	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The season's most ferocious
hurricane plowed into Puerto Rico, killing three people in a
landslide after raking other parts of the Caribbean and forcing
tens of thousands of people into shelters.
	   Packing winds up to 130 mph (208 kph) and churning up 20-foot
(six-meter) waves, Hurricane Georges toppled power lines, smashed
hotel windows, mangled trees and blew away roofs as families
huddled in shelters in the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Kitts, Antigua
and other islands earlier Monday.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico a disaster area,
authorizing release of federal recovery aid.
	   The hurricane appeared headed for the island of Hispaniola,
which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Many of that
island's 15 million people live in substandard housing that could
leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast a landfall
in the Dominican Republic as early as 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT)
Tuesday.
	   The storm caused power and water outages affecting more than
700,000 people in Puerto Rico, shattered hotel windows and spawned
tornados in central Barranquitas and the island of Vieques.
	   ``Our people have very difficult days to come,'' Puerto Rico
Gov. Pedro Rossello warned earlier.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Monday (0300 GMT Tuesday), Georges' center was 65
miles (104 kilometers) west-southwest of San Juan after passing St.
Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where all power was knocked
out.
	   Radar images showed the enormous storm hovering directly over
Puerto Rico late Monday night, its center close to the southern
coast.
	   Georges was upgraded to a category 3 hurricane Monday afternoon,
when the storm's maximum sustained winds reached 115 mph (184 kph),
with gusts up to 130 mph (208 kph), the Hurricane Center said.
	   Moving west at 15 mph (24 kph), the storm packed hurricane-force
winds up to 85 miles (135 kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the
northeast.
	   The Hurricane Center warned the storm winds _ while diminished
from a monstrous 150 mph (240 kph) recorded Sunday _ remained
``extremely dangerous,'' and director Jerry Jarrell said there were
indications Georges was intensifying.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico. President Clinton declared states of emergency in
both territories.
	   The hurricane destroyed at least 60 homes on Vieques and the
island of Culebra, said Mari Tere Pacheco, a spokeswoman for the
civil defense authority.
	   A few hours later, three people were killed in the San Juan
area, where almost half of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents
live. They died in a landslide, although more details weren't
immediately available, civil defense officials said. They had said
earlier the three were killed when a roof collapsed.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered more than 330 shelters
opened. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled flights to and
from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service was suspended. People
were ordered off the beaches.
	   More than 20,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities.
	   With up to 15 inches (38 cms) of rain expected in Puerto Rico's
mountains, the threat of mudslides drove many mountain residents to
shelters in San Juan.
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to one-third of their
height, shook parked cars and destroyed part of the boardwalk. In
St. Thomas, also part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, winds were at
about 75 mph (120 kph) and increasing.
	   A hurricane warning went into effect in the Dominican Republic
and Haiti and hurricane watches were announced for the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands. There was concern as far
away as Florida, where workers put shutters over the windows at Key
West's City Hall.
	   In Cuba, the Interior Ministry issued a hurricane warning to
residents of the island's easternmost provinces. The area has been
hit hard by a drought in recent months.
	   Some cruise ships headed south to get out of Georges' way, and
others changed their schedules to make Caribbean stops before
heading to storm-free Mexico.
	   Georges first hit land Sunday night, downing trees and utility
lines, ripping wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelting
sheets of rain into residences on the northern Leeward islands.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden and ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses.
	   Antiguan shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop
flooding. Civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   All of the island's television and radio stations were off the
air, and rain washed out the road near Urlins, on the southern
coast, stranding a bus. It was pulled from the water by backhoe,
and no injuries were reported.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, swirling winds knocked out
power in several towns. One man was shot and killed by guards while
trying to escape from jail.
	   Key West, the southernmost city in the continental United
States, ordered hard hats, chainsaws, pry bars and other gear that
might be needed if the hurricane strikes. Drivers with city
vehicles were told to fill their gasoline tanks.
	   ``Everybody's in anticipation. This is pins and needles,'' said
Dolores Ruvo, dockmaster at Whale Harbor Marina, home to 20 fishing
and drift boats in the Florida Keys.

three games remaining.
	   Charles Nagy (15-10) allowed five hits in eight innings, and

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Not content with air bags and seat
belts, Australian researchers are encouraging automobile drivers to
don safety helmets to help cut down on head injuries.
	   A report by the Federal Office of Road Safety says that
bicycle-style helmets would be as effective as air bags and better
than seat belts, reducing the severity of auto accident injuries by
50 percent and saving one in five head-injury victims.
	   It presents findings from a two-year study on head and brain
injuries conducted jointly by the University of Adelaide and Monash
University in Melbourne, which said head injuries cost Australia
more than 1.5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs about 1
billion) a year.
	   A spokesman for the Office of Road Safety said the idea was
being promoted as a voluntary measure, and there was no plan to
make it mandatory.
	   Professor Jack McLean of the University of Adelaide said a
specially designed headband could offer most of the protection that
a helmet could, and would be cooler, lighter and less bulky.

Japan's land prices fall for seventh straight year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's average land prices fell for the seventh
consecutive year as the country's economy remains mired in a
stubborn recession, the government said in a report released
Tuesday.
	   The National Land Agency said commercial land prices across the
nation dropped by an average 5.2 percent over the twelve months
through July 1, following a 5.1 percent fall the previous year.
	   In Tokyo, commercial land prices fell by 8.4 percent after
falling 10.6 percent a year earlier, the agency said. Commercial
land prices in Tokyo have now fallen to levels seen 15 years ago.
	   The continued decline was precipitated by the collapse in the
early 1990s of Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy, in which
easy credit caused real estate and stock prices to skyrocket.
	   The average residential land price across the country fell by
1.4 percent in the period, compared with a 0.7 percent fall a year
before.
	   Japan's most expensive commercial land was valued at 12.90
million yen (dlrs 96,200) for one square meter (10.76 square feet)
in Otemachi, Tokyo's main financial district.
	   The highest residential land price in Japan was 2.27 million yen
(dlrs 16,900) per square meter in Tokyo's Gobancho area, down 3.4
percent from the previous year, the agency said.
	   Agency officials said both commercial and residential land
prices in Japan will either weaken further or level off in the near
future.
	   The agency's report was based on a survey of land prices
conducted July 1 at 30,000 locations throughout the nation.

AIDS, venereal diseases spreading quickly in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese health authorities have noted an alarming
rise in the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases,
the official newspaper Guangming Daily reported Tuesday.
	   Citing figures reported at a research conference on AIDS,
Chinese officials said the number of cases of venereal disease had
risen 40.53 percent in the first half of 1998 compared with the
same period a year earlier.
	   In all of 1997, 461,510 cases of sexually transmitted diseases,
including the HIV virus that causes AIDS, were reported in China, a
15.81 percent increase over the previous year, the report said. It
did not provide more detailed statistics.
	   Rapid growth of China's sex industry since the 1970s has
contributed to the swift spread of sexually transmitted diseases,
the report said.
	   But it noted that illegal drug use was a more important cause
for the increase in the number of HIV carriers, which rose to
10,676 nationwide by the end of June, a 22 percent increase from
October 1997.
	   Of that number, 301 people had developed AIDS, the report said.
	   Two-thirds of the Chinese infected with HIV were thought to have
acquired the virus through drug use, the report said. Many of the
cases were concentrated in southwestern Yunnan, which borders major
drug producing areas, and in northwestern Xinjiang and central
Henan province.
	   The government has stepped up efforts to prevent the further
spread of AIDS, hoping to limit the number of people found to be
HIV positive to less than 1.5 million by 2010, the newspaper said.
	   In addition to increasing AIDS awareness through education,
China has enacted legislation banning the sale of blood to donation
centers, effective Oct. 1.
	   About 40 percent of the blood collected in China for
transfusions and other medical needs is purchased, often from
people at the margins of society most at risk for AIDS, hepatitis
and other diseases, the newspaper China Daily reported Thursday.
	   It said the quality of blood sold was often below standard.
	   Ahead of the implementation of the new blood law on Oct. 1, the
government plans a national campaign to encourage more Chinese to
give blood. At present, only 20 percent of the blood needed in
China is provided through voluntary donations, with another 40
percent coming from compulsory donations, the report said without
providing further details.

Australia pressures Malaysia to restore communication links
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Censorship

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia on Tuesday put diplomatic
pressure on Malaysia to restore satellite links to foreign TV
stations that complain authorities are trying to stop them
reporting on civil unrest.
	   Australian, British and New Zealand television stations on
Monday said their television broadcasts of unrest in the capital
Kuala Lumpur were being jammed.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday it was
unfortunate a satellite link shared between several television
stations appeared to have been cut by authorities.
	   He said he had called on Malaysia to restore communications.
	   ``This morning I spoke to the Malaysian High Commissioner about
the decision by Malaysia to cut off communications from Australian
television stations back to Australia,' Downer said.
	   ``I said to the High Commissioner I would like that satellite
feed resumed, it's important for Malaysia's international standing
that there is a continuation of free-flow of information in and out
of Malaysia,'' he said.
	   ABC television reported its satellite feed from Kuala Lumpur had
been interrupted and said other Australian commercial stations had
also been affected.
	   On Monday, the BBC said its pictures of riot police cracking
down on protesters awaiting the arrival of ousted deputy premier
Anwar Ibrahim at a courthouse had been interfered with, while
footage of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II had passed without
difficulty.
	   New Zealand's TVNZ said it would demand answers from Malaysian
authorities after its television pictures of Kuala Lumpur riots
were blocked.
	   TVNZ said it believed the pictures, filmed by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., were being jammed at the main Malaysian
satellite transmission station.
	   Managing editor Paul Cutler said TVNZ would seek an explanation
from the Malaysian information ministry and the High Commission in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Downer said a consular warning had been issued for Australians
in Malaysia to take care during the political unrest in the
country.

Australia: world wheat prices ``set to fall''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ World wheat prices will fall over the
coming year, Australia's Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics said Tuesday.
	   The bureau, commonly known as ABARE, predicted that the world
indicator wheat price, that of US hard red winter wheat, will fall
by more than 15 percent in the 12 months to June next year.
	   It is forecasting a price of U.S. dlrs 120 a metric ton by that
time.
	   ABARE slays this reflects sluggish demand, relatively high world
stocks and another large crop.
	   However the bureau says there are still uncertainties about the
extent of crop and stock damage in China, which has been ravaged by
flood in recent weeks.
	   ``An improvement in domestic crop production in North Africa, a
record wheat crop in Pakistan, continuing economic problems in East
Asia and a recovery in world rice production_particularly in India,
Thailand and Indonesia_are expected to lead to lower wheat imports
in 1998-99,'' ABARE said.

Fan in McGwire controversy fighting back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The 31-year-old high school cross country coach
and gym teacher who was at the center of Mark McGwire's disputed
double has hired a lawyer and will fight his dlrs 518 trespassing
fine.
	   Michael Chapes, of Waterford, Wisconsin, went through the
videotape of the controversial call frame-by-frame Monday to prove
he did nothing wrong, said his attorney, Tom Boyd.
	   Chapes also is sure the ball should have been ruled a home run
in St. Louis' 11-6 victory over Milwaukee on Sunday, Boyd said.
	   The National League on Monday turned down the Cardinals' request
to reverse an umpire's ruling on the play.
	   ``It's clear it was home run No. 66,'' Boyd said.
	   ``Michael just happened to be lucky enough to be in the exact
right position. The ball was hit to him. He did not reach out and
take it while the ball was in play. And it would be a shame for him
to be painted as the bad guy because subsequently that ball was
taken from him,'' Boyd said.
	   NL president Len Coleman telephoned Cardinals general manager
Walt Jocketty and told him umpire Bob Davidson's call Sunday would
not be reviewed.
	   McGwire extended his home run record by hitting his 65th home
run Sunday in the first inning at Milwaukee. In the fifth, he hit a
line drive to left-center field that wound up in the seats, but
Davidson ruled that a fan reached over the wall to pull it in.
	   Davidson, the second-base umpire, stopped McGwire at second base
with a double.
	   The controversy arose as a crowd of spectators pushed and shoved
their way toward the fence as McGwire's line drive headed toward
the left-center field bleachers.
	   Chapes and Allan Riesbeck of Dubuque, Iowa, lunged for the ball.
Riesbeck, who is disabled, tried to catch it with his gray T-shirt.
The ball landed in Chapes' glove, but Riesbeck's T-shirt was in
Chapes' mitt, too.
	   A split second later, the ball was snatched away.
	   Davidson thought the fans had reached over the yellow rail and
into the field of play for fan interference.
	   Chapes said Sunday night that the ball cleared the yellow line
before the crush of fans pushed him and Riesbeck forward. They
doubled over a chain-link fence about 18 inches behind the yellow
railing and into a pit, , where Johnny Luna, 18, of New York came
up with the ball.
	   After the game, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said that
because McGwire wound up scoring, changing the ruling would not
affect the outcome.
	   ``You're not considering giving Mark something he didn't earn,''
La Russa contended.
	   Chapes said he was sickened at becoming a footnote to the
``Great Home Run Chase of 1998'' and worried about the disputed hit
being a factor in whether McGwire or Sammy Sosa ends up the leader.
	   The citation is a Milwaukee County ordinance violation, so a
court date must be set for Chapes to fight the matter, Boyd said.
	   ``I'm a teacher, I don't make that kind of money,'' said Chapes,
who teaches and coaches at Whitnall High School.
	   But Chapes said he was more upset about McGwire losing his home
run.

Investigators meet Suharto over corruption claims: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single names for Suharto, Hartarto are correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators have met ex-President
Suharto over allegations that he amassed a fortune for himself
through corruption, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper Kompas said Attorney General Andi Muhamad Ghalib
and senior Cabinet minister Hartarto talked to the former leader at
his family home in central Jakarta on Monday night.
	   ``The meeting was good. (Suharto's) response was good too,'' it
quoted Ghalib as saying. ``He was so open and he gave a good
response.''
	   Ghalib said he would disclose more details about the meeting
later Tuesday.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests,
ending 32 years in power.
	   He is accused of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts while his family built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   An estimate by Forbes magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   However, in a television appearance this month he flatly denied
any wrongdoing and said he did not have ``a cent'' stashed away
overseas.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who is also a longtime
friend and former subordinate of Suharto, last week bowed to
mounting pressure from protesters and others and ordered that the
former leader be questioned.
	   Kompas reported that on Saturday Habibie sent Suharto a letter,
in which he asked for an explanation over the alleged misuse of
money channeled into several Suharto-controlled charities.
	   Habibie also asked for clarification over Suharto's remarks made
on television.
	   Thirdly, he asked Suharto to sign a document permitting foreign
banks to open up their records to investigators so they could
ascertain whether the old autocrat had placed money abroad.
	   On Monday Ghalib said his office had yet to find any hard
evidence that Suharto had deposited money overseas.

His streak over, Ripken is back to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ It was a short furlough for Cal Ripken.
	   A day after ending his astonishing streak of 2,632 consecutive
games, Ripken was back in the starting lineup for Baltimore on
Monday against Toronto, the same team he faced when the streak
started on May 30, 1982.
	   The SkyDome crowd rose to its feet when Ripken trotted to third
base in the bottom of the first inning, and he responded to the
ovation with a wave of his cap.
	   Then in his first at-bat, he singled off Roger Clemens in the
second inning. It was Ripken's 2,874th hit, moving him ahead of
Babe Ruth into sole possession of 34th spot on the career list.
	   ``I felt much better being inside the game than outside,''
Ripken said after going 2-for-4 in the Orioles' 3-1 loss to the
Blue Jays.
	   With time to contemplate his decision, Ripken was sure he made
the right move in ending the streak Sunday night.
	   ``No regrets, no second thoughts,'' he said. ``I felt great
about how it went. It was a great celebration instead of a sad
event.''
	   He admitted feeling strange about watching a game from the
dugout, and sounded relieved to be returning to the field.
	   ``I still consider myself an everyday player,'' he said. ``I
have a lot of baseball left in me.''
	   He demonstrated that against the Blue Jays, getting a single and
double and striking out only once against Clemens, who fanned 15.
	   ``I knew he'd have a great day,'' Orioloes manager Ray Miller
said of Ripken. ``He swung the bat real well _ he was all over
everything.''
	   Ripken closed out his streak by removing himself from the
starting lineup in the Orioles' final home game of the season
against the New York Yankees.
	   The move came more than three years after he broke 2,130-game
streak of Yankees iron man Lou Gehrig _ a record that had stood for
56 years.
	   Miller said he and Ripken had spoken a couple of times over the
past month about the idea of taking days off.
	   ``I told him this a couple weeks ago ... that 10 or 12 games
off, or maybe 15 games, you would be 10 percent better,'' Miller
recounted Monday. ``I just think that common sense tells me you
would be fresher.''
	   But Miller said he planned to start Ripken for the rest of this
season, and he marveled at what his third baseman had accomplished.
	   ``The streak is mind-boggling,'' Miller said. ``He's 501 games
past an insurmountable number. No one will ever make 2,131.''
	   Ripken isn't so sure.
	   ``If I did it someone else can do it. I don't see myself as
superhuman,'' he said in Baltimore after watching a whole Orioles'
game from the dugout for the first time since May 29, 1982.
	   There's no telling how long Ripken could have gone. Gehrig's
streak ended when he could no longer cope with a rare muscular
disorder that later became known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   Ripken, 38, was completely healthy. He just got tired of the
controversy surrounding the streak _ more than one columnist called
him selfish _ and decided that spring training in 1999 might be
more fun if he didn't have to talk about playing another full
season.
	   So, without tipping any of his teammates except Brady Anderson,
his best friend on the Orioles, Ripken walked into Miller's office
a half-hour before Sunday's game and asked to have his name removed
from the starting lineup.
	   For Ripken, sitting out that one game proved to be the most
difficult thing he had done since breaking into the league in 1981.
For one thing, he had no idea what to do to keep himself occupied.
	   Ripken fidgeted on the bench before getting a call from reliever
Alan Mills.
	   ``He goes, `What are you doing?' And I said, `I'm going to sit
here and watch a ballgame,''' Ripken said. ``I said, `You want me
to come out there and visit with you?'''
	   Ripken did just that. He talked with the fans and posed for
pictures between innings, but afterward he made it clear that most
of his days next season will be spent playing third base _ from the
first inning through the ninth.
	   ``I still think I have the greatest job, doing what I want to
do,'' Ripken said Monday. ``I have a great passion and a great
energy and a great enthusiasm to play the game.''

Seoul proposes joint probe of dead cattle in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea proposed on Tuesday a
joint probe of a North Korean claim that Seoul orchestrated a
``vicious plot'' to kill 500 gift cattle.
	   The cattle were donated to the communist nation by Chung
Ju-yung, founder of Seoul's Hyundai conglomerate, when he visited
his native North Korea in June.
	   On Monday, North Korea accused the South Korean government of
plotting to kill the cattle by feeding them indigestible material
before shipping them to the North.
	   It said 15 cattle already have died and eight more are near
death, adding that ``we cannot guess how many (cattle) may fall to
the vicious plot.''
	   North Korea said autopsies found vinyl strips and lumps of hemp
rope in the stomachs of the dead animals, ``items which cannot be
seen in North Korea.''
	   It said the scheme was cooked up by South Korea's Unification
Ministry and the government's intelligence arm, the Agency for
National Security Planning.
	   South Korea rejected the North Korean accusations as
``nonsense.''
	   ``We suggest that veterinarians and officials of North and South
Korea jointly investigate (the deaths) to verify the North's
claim,'' the Unification Ministry said in a statement.
	   ``We cannot help expressing our deep regret that North Korea is
groundlessly slandering the South over the cattle that have been
donated out of pure compatriotism and humanitarianism,'' it said.
	   Hyundai officials earlier denied the North Korean charges,
saying that they were solely responsible for the shipment of the
cattle and no outsiders were involved.
	   The Koreas were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early
1950s. Animosity and distrust run deep between the two sides.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Not content with air bags and seat
belts, Australian researchers are encouraging automobile drivers to
wear safety helmets to help cut down on head injuries.
	   A report by the Federal Office of Road Safety says that
bicycle-style helmets would be as effective as air bags and better
than seat belts, reducing the severity of auto accident injuries by
50 percent and saving one in five head-injury victims.
	   It presents findings from a two-year study on head and brain
injuries conducted jointly by the University of Adelaide and Monash
University in Melbourne, which said head injuries cost Australia
more than 1.5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs about 1
billion) a year.
	   A spokesman for the Office of Road Safety said the idea was
being promoted as a voluntary measure, and there was no plan to
make it mandatory.
	   Professor Jack McLean of the University of Adelaide said a
specially designed headband could offer most of the protection that
a helmet could, and would be cooler, lighter and less bulky.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges, one of the most
powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years, killed three people
in a Puerto Rico landslide Monday as it swept across the island
packing howling winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph).
	   Georges also killed a resident of St. Kitts, which suffered
extensive damage along with the nearby islands of Antigua and St.
Croix. It toppled power lines, mangled trees, smashed hotel windows
and ripped roofs off homes.
	   President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas, authorizing release of federal recovery
aid.
	   The hurricane appeared headed directly for the island of
Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast a landfall in
the Dominican Republic as early as 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT), Georges' center was about 65 miles
west-southwest of San Juan at latitude 18.1 north and longitude
66.9 west, moving west at 15 mph (26 kph). Georges packed
hurricane-force winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph) extending up to 85
miles (140 kilometers) from the eye.
	   The storm caused power and water outages affecting more than
700,000 customers in Puerto Rico, shattered hotel windows and
spawned tornadoes in central Barranquitas and the island of
Vieques.
	   ``Our people have very difficult days to come,'' said Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello. ``We are maximally prepared.''
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico _ and both territories declared states of emergency
and activated National Guard troops to help evacuations.
	   The hurricane hit Puerto Rico Monday afternoon, destroying at
least 60 homes on the small islands of Vieques and Culebra which
are part of the U.S. territory, said Mari Tere Pacheco, a
spokeswoman for the civil defense authority.
	   ``It's been a disaster here,'' said Amalio Loiz, head of civil
defense in the town of Umacao near where the hurricane first struck
the island.
	   Three people were killed in the San Juan area, where almost half
the island's 3.8 million residents live. They died in a landslide,
although more details weren't immediately available, civil defense
officials said.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open more
than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service to nearby
islands was suspended.
	   More than 20,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities. Some were residents of
the central mountains who feared mudslides and flash floods
resulting from expected rainfall of up to 15 inches (38
centimeters).
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero,
66, as he waited out the storm in a San Juan shelter.
	   A hurricane warning went into effect in the Dominican Republic
and Haiti, and hurricane watches were posted for eastern Cuba, the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands. Concern was
growing even in Florida, where workers put shutters over the
windows at Key West City Hall.
	   Georges first hit the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night,
downing trees and utility lines, ripping wooden and galvanized
roofs from homes and pelting sheets of rain into residences.
	   In St. Kitts, government spokesman Erasmus Williams said one
woman was killed. He gave no details.

Fact-finding team confirms rapes during Indonesian riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators have confirmed
allegations that rapes were committed during riots last May in
which 1,200 people died ahead of the resignation of longtime
President Suharto, a news report said Tuesday.
	   ``We confirmed to the government that sexual assaults including
rapes occurred during the May riots,'' the Jakarta Post quoted
Marzuki Darusman, chairman of a state-sponsored independent
fact-finding team, as saying.
	   Earlier some police and military officers as well as several
government officials poured scorn on allegations by human rights
activists and women's groups that at least 168 women were raped.
	   The groups said that about 20 victims were killed in the attacks
or had died later, some by suicide.
	   They said many were members of the ethnic Chinese minority,
targeted by mobs who resent their comparative wealth and success in
business amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The rape allegations galvanized outrage among Chinese
communities around the world and resulted in calls for tough action
by the governments of China and Taiwan.
	   Last month President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto,
condemned the rapes as barbaric.
	   The team is investigating the cause and circumstances
surrounding May's violence.
	   On Monday it handed an interim report to the government and the
military. A final report is to be submitted in October.
	   Marzuki did not say how many women had been raped.
	   ``The important thing is we want to assure that these things
have happened and this is accepted by the government,'' Marzuki
said.
	   However, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto said the military
would not comment until the investigation was concluded.
	   ``Just wait for another month as the investigation is still
being conducted,'' the Jakarta Post quoted Wiranto as saying.

Political activists in China detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities have detained two dissidents who
earlier this month reported receiving vaguely encouraging signals
from the government about starting an opposition party, an exile
group said Tuesday.
	   Authorities in Shandong province in eastern China detained Xie
Wanjun on Monday, and Liu Lianjun, who earlier had been detained
and released, was missing and feared to have been detained again,
the U.S.-based Chinese Democratic Justice Party said in a
statement.
	   In recent days, authorities also have detained other activists
trying to establish the China Democracy Party. Among them was Tang
Yuanjuan, who had traveled to several cities trying to help
organize the party. Authorities have accused Tang of having
contacts with an illegal organization.
	   Xie and Liu had said they felt encouraged when they tried to
register the party with the Shandong provincial office of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs on Sept. 10. Officials did not
immediately reject their application but rather explained
requirements for setting up a legal organization, according to
accounts by human rights groups.
	   Dissidents have been trying to register the China Democracy
Party with the government since U.S. President Bill Clinton visited
China in June. Police in eastern Zhejiang province rounded up 12
democracy campaigners connected to the group in July and later
released them.
	   Chinese law requires all organizations must be approved by the
government.
	   The ruling Communist Party has never allowed an opposition party
to form. A small number of minor parties established before the
Communists took power in 1949 have been allowed to continue, but
they have no power and play a minor supportive role.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A powerful typhoon hit southwestern Japan Tuesday
afternoon, just one day after another storm swept through the
country damaging buildings and affecting transport.
	   Typhoon Vicki, packing winds of 144 kilometers (89 miles) per
hour, came ashore near Gobo, about 438 kilometers (299 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, just after 1:00 p.m. (0400 GMT), the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The storm was progressing north-northeast at a speed of about 50
kilometers per hour (31 miles per hour), the agency said.
	   A total of 59 domestic flights had been canceled as of 12:00
noon (0300 GMT) Tuesday, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Some train services and passenger ship operations in central and
western Japan were also canceled or delayed, Kyodo said.
	   Dozens of homes were flooded because of heavy rains in Aichi
Prefecture (state), central Japan, the report said.
	   On Monday, a less powerful storm hit western Japan smashing
windows and blowing away roof tiles as it crossed over wide swaths
of the country before dissipating in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first time in 10 years that two typhoons have hit
Japan on successive days.

Tarasco pinch-hit grand slam lifts Reds over Phillies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Tony Tarasco's pinch-hit grand slam in the
seventh inning rallied the Cincinnati Reds to an 8-5 victory over
the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday night.
	   The start of the game was delayed by rain for 2 hours, 23
minutes. Once it began, Scott Rolen hit two home runs and a double
as the Phillies took a 5-4 lead.
	   Tarasco hit his first slam in the majors, and the first
pinch-hit slam for the Reds since Lenny Harris did it on Aug. 31,
1996, against the Florida Marlins.
	   Scott Sullivan (5-5) got the win in relief and Danny Graves got
his seventh save.
	   Mark Leiter (7-5) blew a save chance for the 12th time. He
loaded the bases on a hit batsman, a walk and a fielder's choice
before Tarasco homered over the right-field wall.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Anibal Perez stared
jealously at his shopping cart piled high with meat, chickens,
rice, bread and powdered milk as he waited in a half-hour checkout
line.
	   Perez, 48, works as a motorcycle messenger for a powerful police
colonel, and his boss had sent him to buy supplies to get his
family through Hurricane Georges, which appeared to be heading
straight this way after pounding Puerto Rico Monday.
	   Perez's family would have to make do on its own.
	   ``If I had any money, I'd stock up too,'' he said. ``But here
poor people aren't worth anything.''
	   Perez makes 1,500 pesos (dlrs 100) a month _ little even by the
standards of this poor Caribbean nation that shares an island with
even poorer Haiti.
	   Like many Dominicans, Perez' home is anything but
hurricane-proof. It is made of wood and sits by the side of a
river, and he worried for his wife and four children.
	   ``I don't want this to be happening,'' he said. ``I'm going to
pray to the Virgin so that it doesn't.''
	   Across the Dominican Republic, a nation of 8 million people,
residents were preparing for devastation on Monday. Hurricane
Georges, which hit the eastern Caribbean Sunday night and then cut
across Puerto Rico to the east, was likely to hit on Tuesday.
	   The government canceled classes in schools and universities, and
stores of all kinds were packed. At the Nacional supermarket in
downtown Santo Domingo, stocker Manuel Urena was leaving open
crates on the floor.
	   ``I don't have time to put things on the shelves,'' he said.
``They're finishing off everything. We're out of crackers, beans,
water _ everything.''
	   Pickup trucks shuttled around town with stacks of plywood
boards, and workers nailed them over windows.
	   ``I've been working since 5 a.m.,'' Ramon Osiris said Monday
evening as he boarded windows at the Napolitano Hotel. ``And when I
finish, I'll go home and do the same there.''
	   Traffic jams formed wherever a gas station was located as people
filled their tanks in expectation of power cuts.
	   ``The unleaded and the diesel is already gone,'' said Rafael
Rosario, a pump attendant at a Texaco station. ``We asked for a
truck, but they say it's the same everywhere.''
	   Resort hotels along the Dominican Republic's northeastern coast
evacuated hundreds of tourists in preparation for the arrival of
Georges.
	   ``The hurricane is coming this way. As a security measure we're
moving them (the guests) to the capital,'' said Manuel Munoz,
operations manager for Infratours, which took 230 Italian tourists
on a five-hour bus ride from Punta Cana to Santo Domingo.
	   ``I'm very afraid because of the hurricane,'' said Ambra
Violini, a 24-year-old from Terano, Italy, upon arriving at a
luxury hotel in Santo Domingo. ``I feel safer here.''

 &UR; EDS: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT Sanders' total yardage to 226. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Thanks to Deion Sanders, the
NFC East is back the way the Dallas Cowboys think it should be _
with them on top.
	   Sanders broke a scoreless tie with a 59-yard punt return, caught
a 55-yard pass that set up another score and returned an
interception 71 yards for a TD as the Cowboys beat the New York
Giants 31-7 Monday night.
	   Jason Garrett, making only his third career start for the
injured Troy Aikman, connected with Billy Davis on an 80-yard TD
pass and Sherman Williams ran 18 yards for a score after Sanders'
long reception as Dallas (2-1) became the only team in the division
with a winning record.
	   The Cowboys, who fell to 6-10 and fourth place last season after
five straight division titles, won despite being without Aikman,
who broke his collarbone last week, and Emmitt Smith, who left in
the second quarter with a pulled groin muscle and did not return.
	   Even Sanders, who added a 39-yard punt return in the third
quarter and accounted for 226 total yards, sat out most of the
second quarter because of dehydration. The Giants' only score came
after a holding call against his replacement at cornerback, Kevin
Mathis.
	   For the Giants (1-2), the loss broke a nine-game streak without
a loss in the division they won last season with a 10-5-1 record.
	   They had 11 penalties for 92 yards after getting 15 for 90 yards
in a loss at Oakland last week and had no sacks after entering the
game tied for the NFL lead with 13.
	   At one point, the Giants had two straight illegal procedure
calls against them and had five overall, three by left tackle Roman
Oben. That's not supposed to happen at home before a record crowd
of 78,039.
	   Neither team crossed midfield in the first quarter.
	   But after the Giants first series of the second quarter, Sanders
struck. He took Brad Maynard's low punt, zigged left, then zigged
right and zagged back into the middle of the field for the 15th
return touchdown of his career, the fourth on a punt. That gave the
Cowboys a 7-0 lead.
	   The Giants crossed midfield for the first time with 6:02 left in
the half on a 10-yard pass from Danny Kanell to Ike Hilliard. After
a holding penalty on Mathis, Kanell found Amani Toomer behind Kevin
Smith for a 36-yard TD that tied it 7-7.
	   But on the next series, Garrett found Davis over the middle as
Giants safeties Tito Wooten and Percy Ellsworth collided at the 40
and Davis took it the rest of the 60 yards to the end zone.
	   Then, after Mathis intercepted a pass by Kanell, a pass
interference penalty on Phillippi Sparks set up Richie Cunningham's
40-yard field goal that made it 17-7 at halftime.
	   Garrett, who finished 12-of-28 for 222 yards, connected with
Sanders on a third-and-8 from their 20 on their second offensive
series in the second half that carried the ball to the New York 25.
That set up Williams' touchdown dash up the middle.
	   Sanders' 71-yard interception return came with 2:25 left in the
game. Hilliard slipped, Sanders grabbed the ball and ran untouched
to the end zone, dancing over the last 10 yards.

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The remains of the Argentine guerrilla
Laura Gutierrez Bauer who fought alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara,
were identified Monday by Cuban forensic experts.
	   Gutierrez, who was known as Tania and was the only female
combatant during Guevara's ill-fated 1967 guerrilla campaign, were
found last week in the Andean town of Vallegrande, located 870
kilometers from La Paz. The remains of Guevara and other guerrilla
fighters were found earlier this year on the Vallegrande airstrip.
	   Family members have asked that her remains be taken to Cuba and
to be buried in tomb where 17 other guerrillas lie.
	   Tania was part of the Cuban guerrilla unit known as Joaquin and
died in combat with Bolivian Army forces. She was placed in a
coffin and buried by Bolivian army soldiers in the city of
Vallegrande.
	   Before joining the guerrilla army, Tania worked as a German
teacher in La Paz while providing Guevara and his army logistical
support.

Government to ban tobacco sponsorships by 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ All tobacco sponsorship for
international sporting events held in Australia will be phased out
by 2006, federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge announced
Tuesday.
	   Tobacco advertising and sponsorship have been banned for
domestic sporting competitions since 1992, but the Tobacco
Advertising Prohibition Act permitted the minister for health to
grant exemptions if an event would be otherwise lost to Australia.
	   Only a handful of events qualify, including the Australian
Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne, the Australian Motorcycle
Grand Prix at Phillip Island, the Australian Indy Car Championship
on the Gold Coast and the Australian Ladies Masters golf
tournament.
	   Wooldridge said he was confident Australia would keep those
events as organizers had enough warning to secure alternative
sponsorship, just as cricket and rugby league successfully managed
the transition.
	   ``Australians are great fans of motor sports and women's golf
and we'll enjoy these major international events more once they are
free of tobacco sponsorship,'' Wooldridge said.
	   ``While I have been able to toughen the restrictions in recent
years on signage and other promotional activities and reduce the
number of events given exemption, I am uncomfortable with the very
concept of exemption in the first place.''
	   Wooldridge said he had productive discussions and negotiations
with Formula One and motorcycle grand prix chiefs Bernie Ecclestone
and Max Mosley and they had assured him that automotive events
would not be jeopardized by the phasing out of tobacco sponsorship.

	   Hundreds of protesters have been camped out on the grounds of
the royal palace of this impoverished country of 2 million people.
Gunfire also was heard in the capital's main military barracks.
	   Lesotho asked for the intervention under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' the statement said.
	   South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
speaking in Pretoria, South Africa, on Monday had paved the way,
saying such an intervention could not be ruled out if the Lesotho
government was threatened.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili acknowledged on
Monday that the government was not in control of the army and said
intervention by foreign troops could be a ``very last resort.''
	   Government offices and Parliament have been paralyzed by weeks
of demonstrations and strikes.
	   A SABC radio reporter said Monday senior government officials
had gone into hiding, including Foreign Minister Tom Thabane.
Opposition militants hauled teachers and children out of schools,
the reporter said.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.
	   Mufamadi abruptly cancelled another shuttle mission on Monday.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting, but did not suggest the election be invalidated.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police are investigating the wife
of Malaysia's sacked deputy prime minister for comments she made
suggesting her husband had been injected with the HIV virus while
in police detention.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, arrested under the country's Internal Security
Act, has not been seen since police dragged him and his wife,
Azizah Ismail, from their home Sunday night.
	   Anwar had said his wife would take over his political reform
movement in the event of his arrest. Any move to arrest her would
be seen as another step by the government to crush the growing
movement calling for an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year leadership.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir Sept. 2 as his deputy and finance
minister on charges of sexual misconduct.
	   The sacked deputy has vehemently denied the charges and says
they are part of a government conspiracy to thwart Anwar's growing
challenge to Mahathir.
	   Azizah Ismail reportedly told CNBC news Monday that her
husband's life had been threatened by police.
	   A statement issued by police headquarters Monday said a police
report had been lodged against Azizah.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Mohd. Amin said Azizah told CNBC: ``We
have news to say that maybe Anwar's life is in danger because he
may be given some injection of the HIV virus to prove whatever
allegations ... in the long run to cost his life. This is why I am
afraid for my husband's life.''
	   Ghazali said Azizah's statement could incite hostility against
the criminal justice system.
	   The district police chief went to Anwar's house Tuesday morning
and spoke to Azizah for 20 minutes.
	   Anwar supporters at the home Tuesday were much more subdued,
toning down their usual chants of ``Reform,'' and whispering about
those detained under the ISA.
	   On Monday, thousands of Anwar supporters flooded to the criminal
courthouse, where they had expected Anwar to be arraigned on a
criminal charge of sodomy.
	   They were dispersed by an army reserve unit and riot police,
beating batons on their shields, firing tear gas and jets of water
spiced with stinging chemicals.
	   Newspapers Tuesday reported 11 of Anwar's closest supporters had
been picked up Monday under the ISA, which allows suspects deemed a
threat to national security to be held for up to 60 days without
trial or legal council.
	   The top four leaders of the fundamentalist Islamic Youth
Movement were arrested at the group's headquarters. The head of the
youth wing in Mahathir's own party, who had appeared by Anwar's
side after his dismissal from the government, was also detained.

Man charged in murder of tourists in Bahamas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A Bahamian man has been formally charged
with murdering two tourists on Paradise Island, one of the Bahamas'
most popular resort areas.
	   Terrell Anton MacIntosh, 18, was charged Monday with killing
British tourist Joanne Clark, 24, and American Lori Fogleman, 32,
then leaving their bodies barely 100 yards from each other near a
jogging path on Paradise island.
	   Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.
	   MacIntosh was also charged with raping Clarke and stealing her
camera and dlrs 450 in travelers' checks; and with stealing two
handbags and dlrs 310 in cash from Fogleman.
	   Clarke, of Oxfordshire, England, disappeared from a secluded
area of Cabbage Beach on Aug. 21. Fogleman, of Richmond, Virginia,
was last seen on Paradise Island July 20.
	   The two bodies were found Aug. 22 in an area of bushes between
Cabbage Beach and Paradise Island's golf course. Fogleman's purse
was found in late July about one mile (1.5 kilometers) from the
site.
	   MacIntosh was arrested Aug. 22 but released because of a lack of
evidence against him. Prosecutors said forensic tests led to the
new charges.
	   MacIntosh's trial in Fogleman's case was tentatively set for
Nov. 23, and the Clarke murder trial was set for Dec. 8.
Prosecutors said they had more than 20 witnesses ready to testify
in both cases.
	   MacIntosh's mother fainted on her way out of the courtroom, and
paramedics were called to revive her.
	   MacIntosh is being held at Fox Hill Prison in Nassau.

Flooding leaves 25 dead in northern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Storms that battered the main
Philippine island of Luzon over the past week left at least 25
people dead and destroyed crops and livestock worth 34.2 million
pesos (dlrs 780,000), officials said Tuesday.
	   The deaths did not include at least 40 people who drowned after
an inter-island ferry with 454 people aboard sank Friday night
south of Manila after being pounded by large waves whipped by the
storms.
	   The National Disaster Coordinating Center said Pangasinan
province bore the brunt of tropical storm Vicki and another storm
that followed, with 19 deaths and over 22,000 residents forced to
flee from their homes. Three other people were missing in the
province after being swept away by floodwaters, relief officials
said.
	   In metropolitan Manila, the storms killed six people and injured
two others. Nearly 11,000 residents were forced to stay temporarily
in schoolhouses to escape the floods. Most have now returned to
their homes.
	   The storms also pounded six other northern provinces, causing
widespread flooding but no deaths or injuries. About 15,500 persons
fled their homes in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan,
Tarlac, Zambales and Nueva Ecija, officials said.
	   President Joseph Estrada declared a state of calamity in
Pangasinan and Pampanga provinces, allowing the release of
government disaster funds.
	   The Department of Agriculture reported that the storms destroyed
crops and livestock worth 34.3 million pesos (dlrs 780,000).

South African, Botswanan troops enter Lesotho

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African and Botswanan troops
crossing into this tiny mountain kingdom Tuesday stormed the royal
palace, where opposition protesters had been camped for weeks, news
reports said.
	   The troops, backed by at least six helicopters, battled Lesotho
army soldiers siding with the opposition, South African
Broadcasting Corp. radio said. Heavy gunfire also was heard at the
main army barracks in the capital.
	   At least one member of the intervention force was wounded, as
well as an SABC cameraman, the radio said.
	   Four Lesotho soldiers were seen being led away as prisoners,
SABC radio said.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators, which has paralyzed the government of this tiny
mountain kingdom of 2 million people surrounded by South Africa.
The opposition charges May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   A distraught opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned
the intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   A faction of the Lesotho army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the
military leadership -- apparently loyal to the government -- and
the new commanders had refrained from restoring order in the
streets.
	   Hundreds of protesters have been camped out on the grounds of
the palace of King Leksie III, a figurehead monarch.
	   Some 600 troops crossed the border at 5 a.m., the South African
Press Association said, quoting a government statement.
	   Lesotho asked for the intervention under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community, it said.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' the statement said.
	   South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
speaking in Pretoria, South Africa, on Monday had paved the way,
saying such an intervention could not be ruled out if the Lesotho
government was threatened.
	   On Tuesday, however, he said he had received word from both
parties on the eve of the intervention that they were ready to
talk.
	   The decision to send troops ``is related probably to the
security situation that existed in Lesotho at the time the decision
was taken,'' he told SABC.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili acknowledged on
Monday that the government was not in control of the army and said
intervention by foreign troops could be a ``very last resort.''
	   Government offices and Parliament have been paralyzed by weeks

	   Clemens (20-6), who tied Atlanta's Tom Glavine for the major

his major league, single-season record of 40 successful save
conversions.
	   The Red Sox, 7-14 in September, are 3 1/2 games ahead of
Toronto. They held the same lead over Texas and Anaheim, which

	   The Indians, who beat New York in the first round of the
playoffs last year, are 4-4 this year against the Yankees with
three games remaining.
	   Charles Nagy (15-10) allowed five hits in eight innings, and
Paul Shuey got three outs for his second save. New York's Andy

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Army trucks filled with field
troops carrying assault rifles surrounded the home of ousted deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday.

17-year leadership.
	   The police intimidation appeared to be working.
	   Azizah told reporters Tuesday that she would no longer hold
nightly reform rallies at their house. She called on Anwar's
supporters to remain peaceful, saying the police would use their
disorder as an excuse to arrest them.
	   ``I want things to be stable,'' she said. ``They'll use that
excuse to kill us all.''
	   Azizah said the police had visited her three times since Anwar's
arrest. She said they had asked her to pacify the crowds that
gather at her home nightly, shouting anti-government slogans and
demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   ``I'm not a traffic warden and the crowds will keep on coming,''
she said.
	   One of the organizers of the Anwar rallies, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the public gatherings would continue
in many states in the next few days.
	   ``Although lots of the original leaders are under great danger,
there are still many more leaders who are being mobilized,'' he
said.
	   The organizer said that close Anwar aides who had not been
arrested were now in hiding and that police were now targeting
Anwar's financial backers.
	   ``The net has been cast very wide,'' he said.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir Sept. 2 as his deputy and finance
minister on charges of sexual misconduct.
	   The sacked deputy has vehemently denied the charges and says
they are part of a government conspiracy to thwart Anwar's growing
challenge to Mahathir.
	   Azizah Ismail reportedly told CNBC news Monday that her
husband's life had been threatened by police.
	   A statement issued by police headquarters Monday said a police
report had been lodged against Azizah.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Mohd. Amin said Azizah told CNBC: ``We
have news to say that maybe Anwar's life is in danger because he
may be given some injection of the HIV virus to prove whatever
allegations ... in the long run to cost his life. This is why I am
afraid for my husband's life.''
	   Ghazali said Azizah's statement could incite hostility against
the criminal justice system.
	   The district police chief went to Anwar's house Tuesday morning
and spoke to Azizah for 20 minutes.
	   Anwar supporters at the home Tuesday were much more subdued,
toning down their usual chants of ``Reform,'' and whispering about
those detained under the ISA.
	   On Monday, thousands of Anwar supporters gathered at the
criminal courthouse, where they had expected Anwar to be arraigned
on a criminal charge of sodomy.
	   They were dispersed by an army reserve unit and riot police,
beating batons on their shields, firing tear gas and jets of water
spiced with stinging chemicals.
	   Newspapers Tuesday reported 11 of Anwar's closest supporters had
been picked up Monday under the ISA, which allows suspects deemed a
threat to national security to be held for up to 60 days without
trial or legal council.

Asian stocks rebound on Wall Street rise, calm in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets rebounded early
Tuesday from heavy losses after an overnight rise on Wall Street
and reduced political turmoil in Malaysia.
	   Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index, which had fallen 3.7 percent
Monday, rebounded 3.3 percent by midday. Singapore's Straits Times
Index also rose 1.1 percent, rebounding from Monday's 3.3 percent
fall.
	   In Malaysia, the key Composite Index climbed 2 percent as
protests against the arrest of sacked deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim died down.
	   Riot police had fired tear gas and turned water cannon on
Anwar's supporters after his arrest Sunday, which had unsettled
investors. Malaysia's benchmark index lost 4 percent while and 3.3
percent off neighboring Singapore's skidded 3.3 percent Monday.
	   Other Asian bourses also plunged Monday plunged as investors
feared the release of U.S. President Bill Clinton's videotaped
grand jury testimony would further damage sentiment for U.S.
stocks.
	   But trader relief there were no new damaging revelations in the
tapes helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.48 percent
higher to a close of 7,933.25 points.
	   ``The market reacted positively to the Clinton videotape. I
think the market expected much worse things coming out,'' said
George Chan, research manager at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings
Ltd, in Hong Kong.
	   Of major Asian markets Tuesday only Japan bucked the trend,
falling slightly on persistent worries over the country's ailing
banking system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 31.92 points,
or 0.23 percent, to 13,565.38 at the end of morning trading. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82 points, or 2.76 percent, to
13,597.30, a 12-year low.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 134.35 yen at
midday, up 1.35 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but lower than its
late New York level of 134.49 yen overnight.
	   The Nikkei managed to open higher, but fell back at midday on
persistent worries over the future of key legislation aimed at
stabilizing Japan's troubled banking system.
	   The country's ruling and major opposition parties announced late
Friday a ``basic agreement'' on banking bills aimed at resolving
bad-debt problems in the country's banks.
	   But pessimism set in Monday when it emerged that the parties
remain far apart on key issues _ especially on how to deal with
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   In the Philippines, the key PSE index moved lower, closing down
3.5 percent as the scheduled closure Wednesday of chief national
air carrier Philippine Airlines dampened market sentiment.

Government forecaster: commodity export earnings to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian producers should prepare
themselves for lower export earnings, with worse to come if China's
currency is devalued, the government's chief commodity forecaster
warned Tuesday.
	   Total export receipts were expected to reach 66.5 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 39.9 billion) in 1998-99 _ more than
0.8 percent down on the previous year's tally, the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, or ABARE, said in
its latest snapshot of the nation's commodity outlook.
	   The report reveals a mixed bag in which some commodities are
faring better than others amidst the worsening world economy and
warns the Asian crisis could still deepen.
	   The mineral resources sector, where export earnings are tipped
to rise 1.5 percent to 41.9 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
25.1 billion), remains a strong performer.
	   ``Although world prices of most minerals are forecast to be flat
or down, an assumed 15 percent fall in the Australian dollar means
that prices received by local exporters will be higher,'' ABARE
executive director Brian Fisher said.
	   Dairy exports are expected to surge past 2 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion), thanks to a lower Australian
dollar, expected to average U.S. 58 cents in 1998-99. The outlook
for cotton and beef is also brighter.
	   But the farm sector overall is only expected to contribute about
22 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 13.2 billion) to total
export revenue, down 4 percent on the previous year.
	   Fisher said the world economic outlook had deteriorated markedly
over the past few months due to continued economic weakness in
Asia, financial instability in Latin America and Russia's economic
downturn.
	   Although economic activity in some Asian countries should
stabilize next year, the situation remained volatile and there was
a significant probability conditions could worsen, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police arrested a man who robbed a

shop last Sunday in Siam Square, one of Bangkok's busiest shopping
areas. He was a former employee of the store.

doesn't show her enough love and affection.
	   Police said all four have confessed to their crime.

Slovak opposition claims ruling party planning to steal election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Dire warnings of coup plots and
accusations that the ruling party plans to steal or cancel
elections fill the air ahead of Slovakia's parliamentary balloting
this week.
	   Both sides are slinging claims and counter-claims in the final
days before the Friday-Saturday voting, reflecting the perceived
vulnerability of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his government.
	   Meciar, a hardliner who has ruled Slovakia for virtually its
entire six years of independence, and his ruling Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are favored to outpoll all other
parties.
	   But analysts and foreign diplomats predict they will win far
less than their predicted 40 percent of the 150 seats in
Parliament, leaving them in jeopardy of not being able to put
together a majority coalition.
	   Most other parties are opposed to the authoritarian premier. A
diverse group of five parties, ranging from Christian conservatives
to Greens, comprise the recently formed Slovak Democratic Coalition
that is running a strong second to the HZDS in polls, with other
opposition parties behind them.
	   ``If elections were held normally _ free and fair _ the
opposition would win and would even reach a constitutional
majority,'' says Martin Butora, president of the Institute for
Public Affairs, an independent think tank funded by financier
George Soros' Open Society Institute.
	   But authorities' consistent efforts to limit their opponents'
chances, via a series of rulings on election law and media
controls, have put the opposition and international officials on
alert to the potential of election fraud.
	   The opposition daily Sme claimed Monday that ruling party
officials are pondering how to get around what their own polls show
to be a certain defeat.
	   ``It is this forecast, which is far from optimistic, that caused
a struggle inside the HZDS in the past few days over whether to
proceed with regular elections, or foil the polls under a
fabricated excuse,'' the newspaper wrote.
	   Opposition leaders contend that authorities may launch a phony
coup attempt _ or even an assassination attempt against Meciar _
and blame it on them in order to justify calling off elections.
	   Officials of the populist-nationalist HZDS dismiss those claims
as nonsense. Meciar said this week he will quit politics if he
loses.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci says the government has adopted
measures to prevent provocations, including beefing up police
patrols with soldiers.
	   ``I don't rule out that provocative actions could be launched by
the opposition during the elections, either at polling stations or
in a different way,'' he told the Czech news agency CTK on Monday.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's three top political
leaders began on Tuesday talks chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk
meant to end the nation's post-election turmoil and pave the way
for the formation of a new government.
	   During the summit meeting, party leaders will try to ease
tensions that erupted into violence when police suppressed protests
against Hun Sen's victory in July parliamentary elections. The
opposition claims the ruling party used fraud and intimidation to
win the polls.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, called on Co-Premier Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian
People's Party to be flexible so the country could achieve ``real
national reconciliation.''
	   ``The CPP, like FUNCINPEC, has to positively respond to the will
of the people of Cambodia in moving forward,'' he told journalists
at the airport in this northwestern town. Ranariddh, arriving from
Bangkok, Thailand, was 30 minutes late for the meeting.
	   Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy, whose parties together
won 58 of the 122 seats in the National Assembly, organized
spirited street rallies in the capital of Phnom Penh and threatened
to boycott parliament's opening unless their allegations of fraud
were investigated.
	   Since Hun Sen fell short of attaining the two-thirds majority
needed to form a government on his own, he needs the opposition's
cooperation.
	   After violent clashes between police and the demonstrators in
the capital threatened to get out of control, the opposition
leaders last week agreed to attend the opening session of the
assembly this Thursday.
	   Ranariddh said Tuesday that the opposition will push Hun Sen
during the talks to remove threats of arrest against demonstration
organizers, free those under detention and investigate the killings
of more than a dozen people whose bodies _ many bearing signs of
torture _ have been found dumped around the capital since the
crackdown.
	   The prince also called for lifting a ban on foreign travel that
Hun Sen imposed on opposition members of parliament after a grenade
attack on his home earlier this month.
	   No one was hurt in the incident, which the opposition charged
was staged as a pretext for cracking down on dissent.
	   The ban was lifted for Ranariddh last week after he agreed to
the tripartite talks, but has remained in place for the rest of the
opposition.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters his agreement to attend the summit
meeting and bring his party to parliament was made under duress.
	   Hun Sen had called specifically for Sam Rainsy's arrest after
the grenade incident, and the outspoken politician took refuge for
more than a week in the office of the main United Nations
representative in Cambodia.
	   ``I am under threat. This is coercion, so whatever I decide, by
legal standards, is not valid. Anything obtained, extorted under
duress is not valid,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Ranariddh said he expected Tuesday's talks to address procedural
matters for convening parliament _ including the selection of its
president, two vice presidents and the composition of parliamentary
commissions _ but not the makeup of a new government.
	   ``As far as the formation of the government is concerned, we
still have a long way to go,'' he said.
	   The prince, who was ousted from power by Hun Sen in a coup
d'etat last year, said he had no desire to be an official in the
next CPP-led government.
	   ``I want to be very clear, I don't have any designs to be in the
next government nor the next speaker of the National Assembly,'' he
said at the airport.
	   A small number of Buddhist monks in Phnom Penh attempted to
organize a peace march Tuesday morning as the talks were set to get
underway, but police quickly dispersed them and kept a watchful eye
at major intersections.

Rebels capture town in eastern Congo near strategic air base

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila have captured the eastern town of Kamituga in South
Kivu region, rebel officials said Monday.
	   Rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said his forces faced heavy
fighting when they captured the town, which is about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of the Lake Kivu town of Bukavu on the way to
Kindu, a strategic air base, on Friday.
	   He said that during the battles, forces captured 10 Sudanese
soldiers who were fighting on the side of Kabila.
	   Speaking in the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma, Ondekane said
rebel soldiers also captured the northeastern town of Isiro, 380
kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kisangani, Congo's third
largest city, which has been in rebel hands for several weeks.
	   Isiro, which sits on the northeastern crossroads of the route
west across northern Congo, was captured Thursday and the rebels
are now continuing north to the Sudanese border, he said.
	   The rebel commander said his forces were going to clean out
government troops from the Garamba National Park on the border.
	   Rebel officials said that on Thursday their troops also captured
Matila, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Shabunda also en route to
Kindu.
	   The government said its forces and allies on Monday attacked an
airport north of Bukavu, a border town on the southern end of Lake
Kivu. Congolese TV said a large rebel aircraft, which was about to
take off, was shot on the runway by the Congolese Armed Forces.
	   It was not possible to confirm the claims independently.
	   Ondekane said while rebels are headed to Kindu and the
southeastern town of Lubumbashi in the mineral-rich Katanga region,
the real objective was still the western capital Kinshasa.
	   He noted that the rebels were advancing by foot and the war
would therefore take more time.
	   ``The real enemy of the army is the distance. Our country is
huge,'' Ondekane said. ``We don't go by plane or by car. It takes
time because it's a tactical progression.''
	   The rebellion, led by disgruntled soldiers and Kabila's
political opponents, broke out Aug. 2. The rebels made rapid
advances from their eastern base and even managed to capture
several key bases in the far west of the country.
	   But they were driven back when Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
provided men and equipment to save Kinshasa from rebel capture.
	   Kabila claims Uganda and Rwanda are the driving forces behind
the rebellion. Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo to
defend its security interests, and Rwanda has reserved the right to
intervene to protect itself from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Both countries, which were instrumental in putting Kabila in
power 16 months ago, now say he has failed to get rid of Ugandan
and Rwandan rebels who are using eastern Congo as a base from which
to attack Uganda and Rwanda.

Opposition leader killed in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A leader of Tajikistan's mainly
Muslim opposition was shot dead on Tuesday by unidentified gunmen
in the capital of the former Soviet republic, officials said.
	   Otakhon Latifi, 62 was killed with two gunshot wounds to the
chest and one to the head as he left his apartment in downtown
Dushanbe, the Interior Ministry said. No one claimed responsibility
for the killing.
	   In the past few months, Latifi, a former journalist, was twice
attacked and beaten on the street by unknown assailants.
	   Latifi returned to Tajikistan in the fall of 1997 following a
peace accord the previous June that ended five years of civil war
between Tajikistan's hard-line government and the opposition.
	   Since then, he had chaired a panel for legal issues under the
National Reconciliation Commission, which worked to stabilize the
Central Asian republic.
	   As part of the peace plan, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
appointed several opposition leaders to key cabinet posts and the
opposition has been incorporated into the Tajik armed forces.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan has remained restive. There
have been frequent clashes between the government and the
opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace deal and
wage turf battles with one another.

Tokyo stocks, dollar higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded Tuesday afternoon ahead
of a meeting later in the day between Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The U.S. dollar was higher
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 192.51 points,
or 1.42 percent, to 13,789.81 after losing nearly 32 points in the
morning. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82 points, or 2.76
percent, to 13,597.30, its lowest level in 12 years.
	   The dollar bought 134.76 yen, up 1.76 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 134.49 yen
overnight.
	   While stock investors doubted any new concrete actions would be
produced in the meeting, some said there was a possibility that
Obuchi would pledge more aggressive measures to stimulate the
economy.
	   But others said they see the gains as a technical rebound and
doubted that they signaled the start of a rally.
	   Earlier in the day, prices were pulled down by a steep decline
in blue chips and lingering concerns about the future of key
legislation aimed at stabilizing Japan's financial system.
	   Wednesday is a market holiday.
	   Japan's ruling and major opposition parties announced late
Friday a ``basic agreement'' on a series of bills aimed at
resolving bad-debt problems at the country's banks.
	   But it later emerged that the parties remain far apart on key
issues, especially on how to deal with troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   LTCB shares ended the day at 21 yen (16 U.S. cents) a share,
unchanged from Monday's finish, after slipping to 20 yen (15 cents)
earlier in the day. On Friday, shares dipped to an all-time low of
18 yen (14 cents).
	   Speaking at a regular news conference, chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said the government will the agreement will
allow the government to provide ``public support'' to LTCB.
	   But opposition leaders said they thought the agreement precluded
a public bailout.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
exchange's first section was up 2.38 points, or 0.23 percent, to
1,050.17. The TOPIX closed down 25.43 points, or 2.37 percent, the
day before.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar maintained its
overnight strength in New York on continued worries about the
banking plan.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
stood at 0.900 percent, up from Monday's finish of 0.890 percent,
driving its price down to 108.17 yen from 108.28 yen.

South African, Botswanan troops enter Lesotho
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more details on fighting, SAfrican
military statement, first post-apartheid intervention; CORRECTS in
typo in name of King Letsie III; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African and Botswanan troops
crossed into this tiny mountain kingdom Tuesday to quell weeks of
anarchy. Heavy fighting was reported at military bases and the
royal palace, and some government buildings were seen burning.
	   The action -- post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention -- follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations
over allegations of election rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   The troops, backed by at least six helicopters, battled Lesotho
army soldiers siding with the opposition at the royal palace, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio said. Heavy gunfire also was heard
at the main army barracks and the high court building and other
structures were firebombed by demonstrators, SABC said.
	   At least one member of the intervention force was wounded, as
well as an SABC cameraman, the radio said. Four Lesotho soldiers
were seen being led away as prisoners, SABC radio said.
	   The task force secured two Lesotho military bases near the
capital and a dam project, the South African military said.
	   Flights to Maseru airport were halted.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished mountainous kingdom of 2 million
people, is entirely surrounded by South Africa and dependent on its
huge neighbor's economy.
	   The military said the besieged Lesotho government had called for
intervention by the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' the South African military said.
	   The troops crossed the border at 5 a.m. (0300 gmt), the military
said. South African Press Association said they numbered 600.
	   The force was targeting the state radio building, police,
government buildings, utility stations, military bases, embassies
and airports, the military said.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers freely sent troops across
its borders to take part in wars -- namely in Angola and Namibia.
But since all-race elections in 1994, South Africa had hewn to a
policy of peaceful mediation in African conflicts.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators, which has paralyzed the government here. The
opposition charges May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged, though the extent of popular support for the
three opposition parties is unclear.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting, but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   A distraught opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned
the intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   A faction of the Lesotho army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the
military leadership -- apparently loyal to the government -- and
the new commanders had refrained from restoring order in the
streets.
	   Hundreds of protesters have been camped out on the grounds of
the palace of King Letsie III, a figurehead monarch.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.
	   On Tuesday, South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi said he had received word from both parties on the eve of
the intervention that they were ready to talk.
	   The decision to send troops ``is related probably to the
security situation that existed in Lesotho at the time the decision
was taken,'' he told SABC.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili acknowledged on
Monday that the government was not in control of the army and said
intervention by foreign troops could be a ``very last resort.''

Grand jury indicts bin Laden secretary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS total number killed in embassy bombings to 259, sted
258, to reflect death of one more person in Nairobi.
 &UR; By TOM HAYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A federal grand jury indicted the former
personal secretary of Muslim extremist Osama bin Laden on charges
he lied about his ties to bin Laden's terrorist organization.
	   Wadih El Hage, of Arlington, Texas, is charged with eight counts
of perjury and three counts of making false statements.
	   The grand jury also has been investigating whether his
``international travels concerned efforts to procure chemical
weapons'' for bin Laden, according to the indictment handed down
Monday.
	   FBI agents arrested El Hage, 38, last week while investigating
bin Laden, the Saudi exile wanted by U.S. authorities for allegedly
coordinating attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Aug. 7 blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.
	   The federal indictment says El Hage perjured himself during
testimony in 1997 and again last week before a grand jury
investigating bin Laden and his organization, al Qaeda. El Hage was
first subpoenaed last year after FBI agents identified him as a bin
Laden cohort, the indictment says.
	   El Hage, an American citizen who has admitted working as bin
Laden's personal secretary in the Sudan in 1994, allegedly lied
when he told the grand jurors that he never heard his boss threaten
the United States, the indictment says. Questioned last week by the
FBI, he also denied knowing bombing suspect Mohamed Sadeek Odeh _
despite evidence the two men were associates, the court papers add.
	   Although the papers do not directly link El Hage to any
terrorist attacks, they say that investigators found his code name,
Norman, on al Qaeda documents seized in Kenya following the
bombing. El Hage testified last week that he had never been called
Norman, resulting in one of the perjury counts.

Two Israeli soldiers killed in southern Lebanon accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli tank overturned in southern
Lebanon on Tuesday, killing two Israeli soldiers and injuring three
others, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The tank rolled over on a hill near the village of Kantara in
the eastern sector of an enclave occupied by Israel, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   One of the soldiers was in serious condition, the officials
added. The three injured were evacuated to an Israeli hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear whether guerrillas fighting Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon had a role in the accident.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group said its fighters
detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling
in the area, causing ``definite casualties.''
	   Security officials could not confirm the Hezbollah claim. There
was no immediate comment from Israel on the predawn accident.
	   Israeli artillery fired on areas north of the occupied enclave a
few hours after the accident, but no casualties were reported.
	   Israeli helicopters also strafed mountain areas near the village
of Maidoun in eastern Lebanon believed to be used by Hezbollah
guerrillas to infiltrate the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 Lebanese allied militiamen from the enclave
Israel set up in 1985 as a buffer zone to protect its northern
towns from guerrilla attack.

Indonesia lifts export ban on most commodities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has lifted an export ban on
several major commodities except processed rice, Trade and Industry
Minister Rahardi Ramelan said Tuesday.
	   Rahardi, who is also chairman of national logistics agency,
Bulog, said the ban was lifted as the commodities were no longer
subsidized by the government
	   The government imposed the ban on July 28 to prevent
profiteering through the re-export of subsidized imports.
	   The government had been subsidizing commodities since the
collapse of Indonesia's economy earlier this year to help millions
of poor people avoid shortages of food and essential items.
	   The ban covered fish meal, unprocessed rice, wheat, wheat flour,
black wheat flour, rice flour, soybean, broken soybean, yellow soy
beans, sugar, sugar bits, flavored or colored sugar and kerosene.
	   Rahardi told a news conference that trade in the commodities is
now open to market forces.
	   A ban on the export of processed rice remains in force as the
government imports foreign supplies to control the price, which has
tripled in the past few months.
	   Indonesia faces its worst economic crisis in 30 years.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The season's most ferocious
hurricane plowed into Puerto Rico on Monday after raking other
parts of the Caribbean and forcing tens of thousands of people into
shelters. At least five people died on the island and one woman was
killed on St. Kitts.
	   Packing winds up to 130 mph (209 kph) and churning up 20-foot
(6-meter) waves, Hurricane Georges toppled power lines, smashed
hotel windows, mangled trees and blew away roofs as families
huddled in shelters in the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Kitts, Antigua
and other islands earlier Monday.
	   President Clinton declared Puerto Rico a disaster area,
authorizing release of federal recovery aid.
	   The hurricane appeared headed for the island of Hispaniola,
which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Many of that
island's 15 million people live in substandard housing that could
leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   The storm caused power and water outages affecting more than
700,000 people in Puerto Rico, shattered hotel windows and spawned
tornados in central Barranquitas and the island of Vieques.
	   ``Our people have very difficult days to come,'' Gov. Pedro
Rossello warned earlier.
	   At 0700 GMT Tuesday, Georges' center was off Puerto Rico's
western shore, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west-southwest of the
west coast city of Mayaguez and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Radar images showed the enormous storm hovering directly over
Puerto Rico late Monday night, its center close to the southern
coast.
	   Georges was upgraded to a category 3 hurricane Monday afternoon,
when the storm's maximum sustained winds reached 115 mph (185 kph),
with gusts up to 130 mph (209 kph) mph, according to the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Moving west at 15 mph (24 kph), the storm packed hurricane-force
winds up to 85 miles (136 kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the
northeast.
	   The Hurricane Center warned the storm winds _ while diminished
from a monstrous 150 mph (241 kph) recorded Sunday _ remained
``extremely dangerous,'' and director Jerry Jarrell said there were
indications Georges was intensifying.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico. President Clinton declared states of emergency in
both territories.
	   The hurricane destroyed at least 60 homes on Vieques and the
island of Culebra, said Mari Tere Pacheco, a spokeswoman for the
civil defense authority.
	   A few hours later, three people were killed in Toa Alta, outside
of San Juan, where almost half of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million
residents live. They died in a landslide, although more details
weren't immediately available, civil defense officials said. They
had said earlier the three were killed when a roof collapsed.
	   Another two people died of heart attacks in shelters during the
storm, and one person was reported missing in a separate landslide
in Trujillo Alto, a southern suburb of San Juan.
	   ``It's been a disaster here,'' said Amalio Loiz, head of civil
defense in the town of Umacao near where the hurricane first struck
the island.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered more than 330 shelters
opened. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled flights to and
from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service was suspended. People
were ordered off the beaches.
	   More than 20,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities.
	   With up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain expected in Puerto
Rico's mountains, the threat of mudslides drove many mountain
residents to shelters in San Juan.
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero.
	   In St. Kitts, government spokesman Erasmus Williams said one
woman was killed. He gave no details.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to one-third of their
height, shook parked cars and destroyed part of the boardwalk. In
St. Thomas, also part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, winds were at
about 75 mph (120 kph) and increasing.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands. A
hurricane watch was posted for eastern Cuba. Concern was growing
even in Florida, where workers put shutters over the windows at Key
West's City Hall.
	   In Cuba, the Interior Ministry issued a hurricane warning to
residents of the island's easternmost provinces. The area has been
hit hard by a drought in recent months.
	   Some cruise ships headed south to get out of Georges' way, and
others changed their schedules to make Caribbean stops before
heading to storm-free Mexico.
	   Georges first hit land Sunday night, downing trees and utility
lines, ripping wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelting
sheets of rain into residences on the northern Leeward islands.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden and ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses.
	   Antiguan shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop
flooding. Civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   All of the island's television and radio stations were off the
air, and rain washed out the road near Urlins, on the southern
coast, stranding a bus. It was pulled from the water by backhoe,
and no injuries were reported.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, swirling winds knocked out
power in several towns. One man was shot and killed by guards while
trying to escape from jail.
	   Key West, the southernmost city in the continental United
States, ordered hard hats, chainsaws, pry bars and other gear that
might be needed if the hurricane strikes. Drivers with city
vehicles were told to fill their gasoline tanks.
	   ``Everybody's in anticipation. This is pins and needles,'' said
Dolores Ruvo, dockmaster at Whale Harbor Marina, home to 20 fishing
and drift boats in the Florida Keys.

Italy to request extradition of kidnapper arrested in Sydney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy plans to ask Australia for the extradition of
the alleged leader of a gang which kept an Italian industrialist
hostage for seven months and killed a policeman attempting to
rescue him, Italian news reports said Tuesday.
	   Giovanni Farina is being held by Australia's Federal Police
since Aug. 15 when he was stopped at the Sydney airport for
possessing a false passport and failing to declare he was carrying
more than the consented cash limit.
	   Italian authorities were unaware Farina was in Australia until
late Monday when a set of fingerprints sent by Australian
authorities were discovered to match those of the Sardinian
criminal.
	   Investigators suspect Farina was the mind behind the kidnapping
of Giuseppe Soffiantini, who was freed in February after his family
paid some dlrs 3 million in ransom. Farina has also been linked to
the kidnapping of Milan businesswoman Alessandra Sgarella, who was
freed in September.
	   While Soffiantini was being held captive, a policeman posing as
a go-between with the ransom payment was shot to death when the
abductors realized they had been fooled.
	   Investigators are still searching for other members of Farina's
gang.

Slovak opposition claims ruling party planning to steal election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to ADD opposition leader's prediction of victory &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Dire warnings of coup plots and
accusations that the ruling party plans to steal or cancel
elections fill the air ahead of Slovakia's parliamentary balloting
this week.
	   Both sides are slinging claims and counter-claims in the final
days before the Friday-Saturday voting, reflecting the perceived
vulnerability of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his government.
	   Meciar, a hardliner who has ruled Slovakia for virtually its
entire six years of independence, and his ruling Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are favored to outpoll all other
parties.
	   But analysts and foreign diplomats predict they will win far
less than their predicted 40 percent of the 150 seats in
Parliament, leaving them in jeopardy of not being able to put
together a majority coalition.
	   Most other parties are opposed to the authoritarian premier. A
diverse group of five parties, ranging from Christian conservatives
to Greens, comprise the recently formed Slovak Democratic Coalition
that is running a strong second to the HZDS in polls, with other
opposition parties behind them.
	   ``We will win the elections and bring a change,'' Mikulas
Dzurida, the coalition's leader, said this week. ``We will form a
government of a wide opposition coalition. Meciar will rule no
more.''
	   But the situation may not be clear for weeks. If Meciar's party
gets the most votes, it has 30 days to try to form a new
government.

Russian sailor kills his commanding officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian sailor shot dead his officer and wounded
another serviceman in the second fatal shooting in the military
this week, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The sailor, who serves in a Caspian Sea unit, was on guard duty
when he turned gun on his comrades, shooting his officer dead and
wounding another navy man, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
quoting local police.
	   The attacker was drunk when the shooting took place, said the
report, which did not identify the sailor.
	   The Russian Navy command in Moscow gave a different version,
saying the shooting was an accident caused by ``careless handling
of a weapon.''
	   In a brief statement, the sailor was identified only as V.
Martyanov. He accidentally shot Maj. M. Yazynin who came to inspect
the guards, the statement added.
	   The statement made no mention of a second sailor being wounded,
and did not provide any additional details.
	   Meanwhile, another Russian servicemen remained on the loose on
Tuesday after shooting dead two comrades and wounding a third in
the Ural Mountains, officials said. The Sunday shooting occurred in
Ozyorsk in the Chelyabinsk region, home to Russia's main nuclear
weapons arsenal.
	   The soldier fled his unit with his assault rifle and ammunition
and the authorities have failed to apprehend him despite a massive
manhunt.
	   Poor living conditions, ritual hazings and weak morale have
contributed to a steady string of shootings in the military. About
50 soldiers were killed by their fellow servicemen last year, and
about 500 committed suicide, according to the military.

Tokyo stocks, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late-afternoon dollar, bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded Tuesday on hopes that
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi might pledge more aggressive measures
to stimulate the Japanese economy in talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton. The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 192.51 points,
or 1.42 percent, to 13,789.81 after losing nearly 32 points in the
morning. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82 points, or 2.76
percent, to 13,597.30, its lowest level in 12 years.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar maintained its
overnight strength in New York on continued worries about the
banking plan.
	   The dollar bought 135.14 yen, up 2.14 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 134.49 yen
overnight. The currency ranged from 134.10 to 135.27 yen.
	   Analysts said there was a possibility that Obuchi would pledge
more aggressive measures to kick start the economy or rescue ailing
banks during a summit with Clinton later Tuesday.
	   ``Obuchi might say to Clinton that Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan will not be allowed to go bankrupt,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   Other traders said they see Tuesday's gains as a technical
rebound before a national holiday Wednesday and doubted that they
signaled the start of a rally.
	   Earlier Tuesday, prices were pulled down by a steep decline in
blue chips and lingering concerns about the future of key
legislation aimed at stabilizing Japan's financial system.
	   Japan's ruling and major opposition parties announced late
Friday a ``basic agreement'' on a series of bills aimed at
resolving bad-debt problems at the country's banks.
	   But it later emerged that the parties remain far apart on key

Thai police seize marijuana, chemicals for refining heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In separate raids, Thai police seized
large quantities of marijuana and chemicals used to refine heroin,
local papers reported Tuesday.
	   Police confiscated more than 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of
marijuana during a raid Monday on a house Samut Prakan, a suburb of
Bangkok that borders the coast line and has a reputation as a
smuggling center, The Nation newspaper reported.
	   Three men were arrested in the raid.
	   Meanwhile, police in the northern city of Chiang Mai seized more
than 1,400 liters (364 gallons) of ether, which they said could be
used to produce more than a ton of heroin.
	   Police believe the chemicals were being shipped to neighboring
Myanmar, also known as Burma, according to The Nation. Myanmar is
the world's second largest producer of opium, the raw material for
heroin.

Farmers group will protest unless police drop corruption probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's largest farmers organization
has threatened to stage a mass protest in Bangkok unless a top
police general drops a corruption investigation against five of its
leaders.
	   The police general has no intention, however, of backing down,
one of his aides told The Associated Press on Monday.
	   ``The Ministry of Interior has already issued warrants for their
arrest. The legal motion is already in place and there is nothing
anybody can do to stop it,'' said the aide, speaking only on
condition of anonymity.
	   The corruption case is pitting Gen. Seri Temeyaves, the police
department's deputy chief who has a reputation for tackling
corruption cases, against the Forum of the Poor, a conglomerate of
farmers associations that has massed more than 20,000 protesters to
Bangkok for past demonstrations.
	   Five leaders of the Forum have been accused of pocketing money
the government agreed to pay as compensation to poor farmers who
lost their land because of dam construction.
	   Forum leaders helped negotiate the compensation payment of 363
million baht (dlrs 8.8 million).
	   In a press release on Sunday, the Forum accused Seri of trying
to make political gain and accused him of ``being unjust to the
country's people.''
	   Also targeted in the case is an elected lawmaker from former
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration Party.
	   Deputy Science Minister Pornthep Tejapaibul said he has obtained
more evidence of embezzlement against the lawmaker and the five
Forum leaders, according to Tuesday's The Nation newspaper.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops crossed into this
tiny mountain kingdom today to quell weeks of anarchy. They secured
two army bases and the royal palace after heavy fighting, the South
African military said.
	   Protesters firebombed government buildings, looters were
rampaging through downtown and cars with South African license
plates were being stoned, reports said.
	   The action, post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention, follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom of 2 million people, is
entirely surrounded by South Africa and dependent on its neighbor's
economy.
	   The troops, backed by eight helicopters, battled Lesotho army
soldiers siding with the opposition at the royal palace, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio said. There also was heavy gunfire
at the main army barracks and the high court building, and other
structures were firebombed by demonstrators, SABC said.
	   At least one member of the intervention force and an SABC
cameraman were among 10 people injured, the radio reported. Four
Lesotho soldiers were led away as prisoners, SABC radio said.
	   A military spokeswoman in Pretoria said she had no immediate
word on casualties.
	   The intervention force secured two Lesotho military bases near
the capital, as well as a dam project, the South African military
said. Flights to Maseru airport were halted. The palace gates were
reopened, but there was no word on the whereabouts of King Letsie
III, mainly a figurehead, the spokeswoman, air force Lt. Col.
Laverne Machine said by telephone.
	   She said that contrary to earlier reports, 200 troops from
Botswana had not yet arrived but were expected later in the day.
Six-hundred South African troops, armored personnel carriers,
attack helicopters and mortar units were involved so far, she said.
	   The military said the besieged Lesotho government had called for
intervention by the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' it said.
	   The troops crossed the border at 5 a.m. and were targeting the
state radio building, police, government buildings, utility
stations, military bases, embassies and airports.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers sent troops across its
borders to countries that included Angola and Namibia to take part
in wars. But since all-race elections in 1994, South Africa had
stuck to a policy of peaceful mediation in African conflicts.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   A distraught opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned
the intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   A faction of the Lesotho army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the
military leadership. The new commanders had refrained from
restoring order in the streets.
	   Hundreds of protesters have been camped out on the palace
grounds.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.

Opposition leader killed in Tajikistan

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A leader of Tajikistan's opposition
was shot dead on Tuesday by unidentified gunmen in the capital of
the Central Asian nation, officials said.
	   Otakhon Latifi, 62, was killed with two gunshot wounds to the
chest and one to the head as he left his apartment in downtown
Dushanbe, the Interior Ministry said. No one claimed responsibility
for the killing.
	   In the past few months, Latifi, a former journalist, was twice
attacked and beaten on the street by unknown assailants.
	   Latifi returned to Tajikistan a year ago following peace accords
that ended five years of civil war between Tajikistan's hard-line
government and the opposition.
	   Since then, he had chaired a panel for legal issues under the
National Reconciliation Commission, which worked to stabilize the
former Soviet republic.
	   As part of the peace plan, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
appointed several opposition leaders to key cabinet posts and the
opposition has been incorporated into the Tajik armed forces.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan has remained restive. There
have been frequent clashes between the government and the
opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace deal and
wage turf battles with one another.
	   The opposition blamed the killing on an unspecified ``third
force,'' trying to undermine the peace deal.
	   ``This heinous murder is a blow to ... the peace process in
Tajikistan, dealt by those who want to destabilize the situation,''
opposition leader Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Government officials said the killing was intended to tarnish
the image of Tajikistan while the Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the
world's Ismaili Muslim community, was visiting.

Man falls to death from Lenin statue in botched suicide attempt

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man who was preparing to hang himself from a
statue of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin fell to his death before he
could do so, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The unidentified man in the Siberian town of Gorno-Altaisk was
trying to lasso Lenin's outstretched right hand when he fell from
the 4-meter (13 feet) high pedestal that supported the statue, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing police chief Sergei
Kurnosov.
	   Gorno Altaisk, capital of Russia's Altai republic, is about
3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of Moscow.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Army trucks filled with troops
carrying assault rifles surrounded the home of Malaysia's ousted
deputy prime minister Tuesday. Another 30 riot police with tear gas
canisters lurked outside the house as supporters gathered inside.
	   The police have threatened to arrest the wife of the former
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for suggesting her husband had
been injected with the HIV virus while in police detention.
	   Anwar, arrested under the country's Internal Security Act, has
not been seen since police dragged him and his wife, Azizah Ismail,
from their home Sunday night.
	   Eleven of Anwar's closest supporters also were arrested Monday
under the ISA, which allows suspects deemed a threat to national
security to be held for up to 60 days without trial or legal
council.
	   Amnesty International called for Anwar and his supporters to be
charged promptly or released.
	   Anwar had said his wife would take over his political reform
movement in the event of his arrest. Any move to arrest her would
be seen as another step by the government to crush the growing
movement calling for an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year leadership.
	   Azizah told reporters today that she would no longer hold
nightly reform rallies at her house. She called on Anwar's
supporters to remain peaceful, saying the police would use their
disorder as an excuse to arrest them.
	   ``I want things to be stable,'' she said. ``They'll use that
excuse to kill us all.''
	   Anwar supporters Tuesday at the home were much more subdued,
toning down their usual chants for reform and whispering about
those detained under the ISA. The rest of the capital was calm
following violent clashes between police and Anwar supporters
Monday.
	   Azizah said the police had visited her three times since Anwar's
arrest. She said they had asked her to pacify the crowds that
gather at her home nightly, shouting anti-government slogans and
demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   ``I'm not a traffic warden, and the crowds will keep on
coming,'' she said.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2 as his deputy and finance minister
on charges of sexual misconduct. Anwar denied the charges, saying
they were part of a government conspiracy to thwart his growing
challenge to Mahathir.
	   Azizah Ismail reportedly told CNBC news Monday that her
husband's life had been threatened by police.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Mohd. Amin said Azizah told CNBC: ``We
have news to say that maybe Anwar's life is in danger because he
may be given some injection of the HIV virus to prove whatever
allegations ... in the long run to cost his life. This is why I am
afraid for my husband's life.''
	   Ghazali said Azizah's statement could incite hostility against
the criminal justice system.

Record high air pollution descends on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ As if record lows in the stock market and an
all-time high unemployment rate weren't enough to worry about, now
air pollution levels in the territory are also setting new marks.
	   The roadside air pollution index, which tracks nitrogen dioxide
levels, registered 167 on Tuesday, its highest since the index was
started three months ago. A reading 201 or above is considered
severe.
	   Pollution has gotten so bad that Hong Kong's environmental
department on Tuesday advised those with heart or respiratory
illnesses to avoid heavy traffic areas and reduce physical
exertion.
	   Officials also warned that the smog enveloping urban areas will
remain for at least the next few days if current weak winds and
warm weather persist.
	   Nitric oxide emissions from cars running on diesel are a main
cause for the increase in nitrogen dioxide in the air, said David
Chan, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department.
	   The situation is exacerbated by skyscrapers and hills that
surround urban areas, trapping in emissions, he said.
	   Winds blowing across from China carry additional pollutants, he
said.
	   As southern China becomes more industrialized, Hong Kong's
environment will only worsen, the department's assistant director,
Tse Chin-wan, was quoted as saying in the South China Morning Post.
	   Pedestrians crossing busy intersections covered their noses and
mouths, attempting to inhale fewer toxins. In the bustling shopping
district Causeway Bay, where the index is recorded, emissions are
visible on the narrow sidewalks lined with stores on one side and
moving cars, buses and trucks on the other.
	   Hong Kong is trying to reduce diesel emissions by replacing the
fuel with liquefied petroleum gas in taxis, but the scheme is still
in the trial stage. The higher cost of the cleaner fuel is
deterring its use, especially during the current economic slump.
	   L. K. Cheng, campaign officer at the environmental lobby group
Friends of the Earth, told official Radio Hong Kong that the
government should do more to mitigate the impact of pollution on
the public.
	   Despite heavy taxes on cars and fuel, Hong Kong has not been
able to effectively deter people from owning and driving their own
cars.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker
who suffered a heart attack last week, has been moved out of an
intensive care unit but remains hospitalized, a news report said
Tuesday.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, began suffering chest pains during a television
talk show last Friday. He continued to participate until the show
ended 20 minutes later, his office said.
	   He was immediately taken to Moscow Hospital No. 23 and has
remained there, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Doctors said he was feeling better and had been transferred to
the cardiology department. The doctors declined to say when
Yavlinsky might be released.
	   Yavlinsky finished fourth in the 1996 presidential elections and
said he would run again in 2000. He currently heads the liberal
Yabloko faction in the Russian parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.

Government holds worker referendum to save Philippine Airlines

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a last-ditch effort to keep
Philippine Airlines from closing, government labor officials went
directly to its workers Tuesday to ask if they will support a
rescue plan proposed by the company's management.
	   Union leaders have rejected the plan, which PAL says is needed
for its survival after a series of crippling strikes.
	   Government officials hope that support among workers for the
plan would convince the airline to reverse its decision to shut
down at midnight Wednesday.
	   With results of the referendum still to be counted, workers in
the central city of Iloilo said an informal poll showed about 90
percent of local PAL workers back the plan.
	   ``We have no other choice,'' said Fernando Bermejo, a PAL clerk.
``We have to earn a living, we don't want to lose our jobs.''
	   In the rescue plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan has offered workers
20 percent of the airline's stock and three seats on its board in
exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent.
	   In a meeting Monday night aimed at avoiding PAL's closure,
President Joseph Estrada also offered workers one of the
government's four board seats, but union leaders continued to
reject the plan.
	   Union leaders say a suspension of the collective bargaining
agreement would be a surrender of their labor rights and expose
them to management abuses.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been operating for 57 years. Its
closure would leave many areas of the sprawling archipelago of
7,000 islands without air service.
	   The airline currently has a 50 percent share of domestic
passenger traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in
June.
	   In many cases, the only alternative for travel among the
country's islands is slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries.
Forty-three people are known to have died after a ferry sank south
of Manila during a storm Friday.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said union leaders have
pledged to abide by the outcome of the referendum, to be known
later Tuesday. Tan visited Estrada's house late Tuesday afternoon,
apparently to discuss PAL's status.
	   PAL also has been hurt by Asia's currency crisis, which hit just
as the airline was launching an ambitious dlrs 4 billion plan to
expand and update its fleet.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said creditors, to
whom PAL owes about dlrs 2.1 billion, are insisting on guarantees
of labor harmony before they approve a restructuring plan.
	   Even if workers approve the rescue plan in the referendum, PAL
will have to temporarily close for up to a month to make
adjustments, Zapanta told The Associated Press.
	   ``We've canceled tickets and flights and given away our
passengers,'' he said. ``It'll take time for people to ponder
whether we're really serious in opening again. We might have truly
damaged our image.''
	   When the company announced the closure to employees, many broke
into tears. Some workers are holding daily prayer vigils in hopes
the airline will not shut down.
	   PAL currently is operating about 30 domestic and 14
international flights a day with 20 aircraft, down from its
pre-strike 54 planes. Its last flight is scheduled to leave from
Manila for San Francisco and Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
	   ``This last one is painful,'' Zapanta said.

Four women theology graduates banned from teaching religion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The influential Romanian Orthodox
Church has banned four theology graduates from teaching religion in
two theological seminaries because they are women, a priest said
Tuesday.
	   ``The Orthodox religion does not allow such things and our rules
are sacred for us,'' Visarion Isinareanul, a vicar from the
bishop's office in the central city of Sibiu, said by telephone.
	   But the women protested. ``We have a good, proper education and
we have never thought we would see such reactions,'' one of them,
Iuliana Tatulea, said.
	   The Orthodox faith, to which almost 90 percent of Romanians
adhere, does not allow women to be priests or enter the altar.
There is no movement within the church lobbying for change.
	   The bishop's office in Sibiu, 225 kilometers (141 miles)
northwest of Bucharest, defended its decision, saying women could
not teach future priests about the holy secrets of the altar
because the women are not allowed to enter that place.
	   Altars in Orthodox churches are sealed from view by screens.
	   This summer, the women who are all in their 20s, won a contest
organized by education authorities because of their high grades,
which entitled them to get jobs at theological seminaries in the
cities of Brasov and Fagaras.
	   But the Orthodox church officials said that educational
authorities did not consult them before the contest and said they
disagreed with the decision.
	   Along with the Orthodox church's top officials in Bucharest,
male students attending the courses of the seminar also protested
against having female teachers.
	   Education inspector, Radu Chivarean said by telephone the
Ministry would not start a dispute with the church. He said the
best solution is for the women to find employment elsewhere.

Australia fourth or fifth in world swimming, says Perkins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Australia was still only fourth of fifth
in world swimming despite the 23 gold medals it collected at the
Commonwealth Games, double Olympic champion Kieren Perkins said
Tuesday.
	   Perkins, who finished third in the 1,500 meters behind teenage
star Grant Hackett of Australia and South Africa's Ryk Neethling,
said the ``status quo'' of the team's performance at the Atlanta
Olympics had been maintained.
	   ``The Americans are a lot better than us,'' he said at Perth
Airport on arrival for the Australian short-course championships
starting Thursday.
	   ``The Russians, while their teams are obviously not as strong
since the break up of the U.S.S.R., they still overall have an
incredible talent base of athletes.
	   ``I think after Atlanta we were somewhere around fourth or fifth
in the world. We may have improved a little bit on that, but I
would think that it's pretty well much status quo at this stage.''
	   Perkins, who says he is confident that he can bridge the gap
between himself and Hackett in the leadup to the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, said the biggest positive out of the Commonwealth Games
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was the depth of the Australian team.
	   ``We got a lot of silver, a lot of bronze, our relays were
fantastic,'' said Perkins. ``When you've got that sort of depth
within your events it creates a lot more competitiveness within the
country itself and when we do race against the rest of the world
we'll be more than prepared.'' (djp)

Spokesman: Sudanese army clashes with Ugandan forces in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese soldiers clashed with Ugandan
forces supporting rebels in southern Sudan and destroyed several
tanks and vehicles, the Sudanese army spokesman said.
	   The clashes erupted in Eastern Equatoria province, where fierce
battles have taken place since last week, said the spokesman, Gen.
Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim. Sudanese forces destroyed 11 tanks,
three armored vehicles and several armored personnel carriers, he
said.
	   He did not provide casualty figures or the date of the clash.
	   ``These attacks are essentially carried out by Ugandan troops
using their arms, equipment and recognizable military fatigues,''
Sirul-Khatim told a news conference here late Monday.
	   There was no immediate comment from Ugandan officials.
	   Word of the clash follows claims Thursday by the Sudan People's
Liberation Army that it had captured the garrison town of Liria,
near the southern provincial capital of Juba. The rebels said the
town's fall isolated the army camp at Torit, southeast of Juba, and
that the rebels had begun a campaign to take it.
	   The Sudanese government said it had repulsed the attack on
Liria. It claimed that Ugandan troops took part.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to try to win autonomy for
the south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the
Muslim, Arabized north. More than 1.5 million people have died in
the fighting and in famines caused by it.
	   Sirul-Khatim said that government forces were encircling ``the
aggressors with view of destroying them.''
	   He said that ``mercenaries'' from Uganda, Eritrea and Rwanda
were involved in the attacks.
	   Uganda severed relations with Khartoum in 1995 after accusing
Sudan of harboring Ugandan rebels seeking to overthrow the
government. In turn, Sudan has accused Uganda _ along with Eritrea
and Ethiopia _ of aiding the Sudanese rebels.

``Defense minister'' of exile Kosovo government slain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The ``defense minister'' of the Kosovo
government-in-exile was shot dead in the Albanian capital,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Ahmed Krasniqi, 50, was found dead late Monday on a narrow
residential street in the Albanian capital with three empty
cartridges nearby, according to Interior Minister spokesman Artan
Bizhga.
	   No arrests have been made and the motive was unclear, he said.
	   But Albanian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Krasniqi was the defense minister of the exiled government, formed
in the early 1990s by Ibrahim Rugova, who is trying to negotiate
self-rule for the rebellious Serbian province.
	   The identity of the ``defense minister'' had been kept secret
for security reasons. The exiled government is headed by a
self-styled premier, Bujar Bukoshi, and operates in Switzerland and
other Western European countries.
	   As defense minister, Krasniqi was responsible for organizing
paramilitary forces which would parallel the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part
of Yugoslavia.
	   In Kosovo, political analysts, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Krasniqi's death could be part of a power struggle
within Kosovo Albanian rebel ranks.

Vajpayee recommends dismissal of a state government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Tuesday recommended firing a socialist government in an eastern
state considered India's most lawless.
	   The move comes a day after Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi won a
confidence vote in the state legislature. Federal officials say
that while Devi has the votes in the legislature, she has lost
control of law and order in Bihar.
	   Vajpayee and two of his Cabinet ministers met with President
K.R. Narayanan and said the federal government wanted early
elections in Bihar state. Voting would not normally be held before
2000 for the Bihar state assembly.
	   A final decision rests with the president, who has in the past
turned down a similar request against another state government.
	   Vajpayee's action could still spark violent protests by the
supporters of the governing party, headed by powerful regional
leader Laloo Prasad Yadav, Devi's husband. As soon as news of the
recommendation reached the state capital Patna, governing party
lawmakers began planning a protest march and sit-in demonstration
outside the governor's residence there. Patna remained calm.
	   In New Delhi, Vajpayee's Cabinet met for more than two hours and
endorsed the Bihar governor's report recommending the dismissal of
the state government on grounds of ``constitutional breakdown,
financial mismanagement and failure of law and order.''
	   The state governor, Sunder Singh Bhandari, is a senior leader of
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, but he is expected to act
impartially.
	   ``It was not just law and order situation. The state seems to
have withered away in Bihar,'' said Lal Krishna Advani, India's
interior minister.
	   Tension began building last week following the state
government's rejection of the Vajpayee government's decision to
carve out a separate state for tribespeople out of Bihar to ensure
speedy development. Bihar is India's second most populous state.
	   Most of the lawmakers in the Bihar legislature have criminal
records and are frequently accused of switching political loyalty
in return for hefty bribes.
	   Yadav, a colorful politician resigned as chief minister last
year after a court charged him with siphoning off millions of
dollars in government funds. Yadav immediately appointed his wife
chief minister but he continues to wield enormous power even as his
trial continues.

Dutch stocks recover after Monday slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange rose in early trade Tuesday as the market clawed back
losses made during Monday's strong sell-off.
	   The recovery was spurred by overnight gains in New York and Asia
as well as the better-than-expected performance of U.S. president
Bill Clinton in his testimony to the Grand Jury, video tapes of
which were televised yesterday.
	   At 9.50 a.m. (0750 GMT), 20 minutes after the start of trade,
the 27-share AEX Index was at 936.13 points, up 33.51 points or 3.7
percent.
	   Electronics giant Philips was one of the biggest winners early
Tuesday after seeing its stock plunge 17 percent Monday following a
profit warning for 1998. In early trading, Philips' shares rose
more than nine percent after dropping to a 12-month low Monday.
	   Analysts said Monday's reaction was overblown as investors in
Amsterdam panicked in midsession trade.
	   Philips warned Monday that income from ordinary operations in
1998 will remain at ``about the same level as in 1997.'' It had
forecast 10 percent profit growth.

British doctors expect high Viagra demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British physicians said they expect a high demand
for Viagra, with some expecting as many as 15 patients a week
asking for the new anti-impotence drug, according to a survey.
	   Three-quarters of the family doctors surveyed also said Viagra
should be available through the National Health Service, Britain's
universal medical care program. The drug was licensed by the
European Union last week, but Health Secretary Frank Dobson has
decided the drug will not be available through Britain's health
service.
	   The survey by the British Broadcasting Corp. asked 100 doctors
what level of demand they expected, based on their knowledge of
their local population and previous inquiries from patients about
the drug, which has just become available in Britain.
	   Many doctors expected between one and five patients to ask them
for Viagra over the next few weeks, the survey found. About one in
three thought between five and 15 patients a week would ask for
Viagra, while 11 surveyed expected more than 15 patients seeking
the drug.
	   The survey showed that doctors did not believe the pill should
be prescribed for recreational uses, and there was also clearly a
desire for some prioritization and rationing of the drug, the BBC
said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thirty-five French cities blocked off areas from
traffic to force commuters out of their cars and into public
transit Tuesday, in an operation planned by the Greens Party
environment minister.
	   The ``Day Without Cars'' initially appeared to have little
effect on traffic, French media reported, and the National Center
for Road Information reported normal traffic nationwide.
	   But the environment minister, Dominique Voynet, insisted the day
was ``a starting point to reconquer our cities,'' many of which
choke from air pollution on windless days.
	   Public transit and the national railroad offered reduced prices.
	   The operation followed last year's pilot project in the Atlantic
town of La Rochelle, where locals left their cars at home and took
public transportation in droves.
	   But on Tuesday, only 57 kms (30 miles) of the 1,600 (960 miles)
of streets in Paris were blocked to regular traffic, after a battle
between Voynet and conservative Mayor Jean Tiberi.
	   Non-participating cities included France's second-largest city,
Lyon, Nice, Lille and Rennes. Some cities like Toulouse held their
car-less day last Sunday.
	   According to a government study released Tuesday, only 27
percent of adults said they were ready to give up their cars.

Cabinet ministers in northern India numerous, idle

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ India's most populous state has so many
Cabinet ministers they don't know what to do.
	   `As many as 23 of us, including myself, have little or no work
to do,'' said program implementation minister Raghuraj Pratap
Singh, one of 93 Uttar Pradesh Cabinet members. Speaking Tuesday,
the first anniversary of his government, Singh said he had not
signed off on a single project during his tenure.
	   ``We are ministers in name only,'' added dairy development
minister Sunder Singh Baghel.'
	   Politics are so fractious in Uttar Pradesh that the state's top
politician, Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, had to offer Cabinet posts
_ which come fat with perks _ to secure the loyalty of allies in
his 11-member governing coalition. The 93 ministers in the largest
Cabinet ever in Uttar Pradesh, are nearly half the 222 legislators
who supported his government in a recent confidence vote.
	   ``Some ministers may be sitting idle. But I'll look into it and
streamline work distribution soon,'' Kalyan Singh said Tuesday.
``For a large state like Uttar Pradesh, a 93-member council of
ministers is justified.''
	   Uttar Pradesh has 150 million people, more than any other state
in this country of nearly 1 billion.
	   Several Uttar Pradesh ministers admitted to idleness Tuesday,
but none said they were considering leaving the Cabinet. Officials
estimate that salaries, allowances and privileges such as homes,
cars and special bodyguards for Cabinet members cost the state just
over 1 billion rupees (about dlrs 24 million) for the year.
	   ``We who have no work spend most of our time in our own
constituencies,'' said Satish Sharma, junior minister for science
and technology. ``We get official cars, bungalows and other perks.
So what if there is no work now?''
	   Others have begged for duties to no avail. Junior tourism
minister Lalu Singh Chauhan says his senior minister keeps all the
work for himself ``despite my repeated requests. I even sought the
chief minister's intervention.''

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival parties who attended a
royal-sponsored summit meeting Tuesday to try to ease the country's
post-election political tensions disagreed on how much it had
accomplished.
	   ``The exchange of views was straightforward and produced
positive results,'' said Sok An, a senior official of strongman Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party who attended the meeting hosted by
King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Opposition parties, however, said the talks at Sihanouk's royal
residence had failed to address many issues behind the political
deadlock that has threatened to block the formation of a new
government.
	   ``How can we reach an agreement in two and a half hours of
talks?'' Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition
FUNCINPEC party, said afterwards. ``It's positive already that all
the parties meet together to try to solve these problems.''
	   The meeting of party leaders was held to ease tensions that
erupted into violence when police suppressed protests against Hun
Sen's victory in July parliamentary elections. The opposition
claims the ruling party used fraud and intimidation to win the
polls.
	   Ranariddh and his opposition ally Sam Rainsy organized spirited
street rallies in the capital of Phnom Penh and threatened to
boycott parliament's opening unless their allegations of fraud were
investigated.
	   Since Hun Sen fell short of attaining the two-thirds majority
needed to form a government on his own, he needs the opposition's
cooperation.
	   After violent clashes between police and the demonstrators in
the capital threatened to get out of control, the opposition
leaders last week tentatively agreed to attend the opening session
of the parliament this Thursday.
	   Sok An said meeting participants Tuesday agreed on four points:
to attend the convening of parliament, to allow parliament to
function normally after that, to have parliament discuss unresolved
issues and to begin discussions on the formation of a new
government.
	   He said the king and all three parties agreed that in case Hun
Sen cannot muster a two-thirds majority to approve a new
government, his existing one can continue.
	   Ranariddh said before the meeting Tuesday that the opposition
would push Hun Sen to remove threats of arrest against
demonstration organizers, free those under detention and
investigate the killings of more than a dozen people whose bodies _
many bearing signs of torture _ have been found dumped around the
capital since the crackdown.
	   The prince also called for lifting a ban on foreign travel that
Hun Sen imposed on opposition members of parliament after a grenade
attack on his home earlier this month.
	   Sok An told reporters that the ban was not up to the government
to lift, but rather the courts and police. He suggested however _
in a tacit admission of the government's power _ that if political
events continued to move ``in an orderly and positive direction,''
the government could use its influence to ease the restrictions.
	   No one was hurt in the grenade incident, which the opposition
charged was staged as a pretext for cracking down on dissent.
	   The ban was lifted for Ranariddh last week after he agreed to
the tripartite talks but has remained in place for the rest of the
opposition.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters before the summit meeting that his
agreement to attend it and bring his party to parliament was made
under duress.
	   Hun Sen had called specifically for Sam Rainsy's arrest after
the grenade incident, and the outspoken politician took refuge for
more than a week in the office of the main United Nations
representative in Cambodia.
	   ``I am under threat. This is coercion, so whatever I decide, by
legal standards, is not valid. Anything obtained, extorted under
duress is not valid,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   The prince, who was ousted from power by Hun Sen in a coup
d'etat last year, made known he had no desire to be an official in
the next CPP-led government, Sok An said.

Italian actress dies at 83
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Clara Calamai, an actress who rose to stardom in the
early 40s after she bared her breasts in a movie -- a first on the
Italian screen -- has died in Rimini. She was 83.
	   The cause of her death, which occurred Monday, was not released,
news reports said.
	   Calamai appeared in Alessandro Blasetti's ``La Cena delle
Beffe,'' (``The Dinner of Surprises'') in 1941. A few seconds of
her topless performance prompted a scandal in Italy -- and made the
movie a hit.
	   Her most acclaimed performance came two years later, when she
played a dark lady who had her husband killed in Luchino Visconti's
``Ossessione,'' (``Obsession''), a movie credited with starting
Italian neorealism.
	   She worked again with Visconti in ``Le Notti Bianche'' (``White
Nights'') in 1957.
	   A funeral will be held in Rimini Wednesday.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As diplomats at the United
Nations ponder what to do about Kosovo, Serb forces launched a
strong attack Tuesday, pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic
Albanian resistance with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where the government
launched its crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists six months
ago.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flash of muzzle fire from tanks and artillery, which pounded at
least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Mitrovica
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a last-ditch effort to keep ailing
Philippine Airlines from closing, government labor officials went
directly to the workers Tuesday to ask if they support a
management-proposed rescue plan.
	   Union leaders have rejected the plan, which PAL says is needed
for its survival after a series of crippling strikes.
	   Government officials hope that strong support among workers for
the plan would convince the airline to reverse its decision to shut
down at midnight Wednesday.
	   With official results of the government's referendum still to be
counted, PAL workers in the central city of Iloilo said an informal
poll showed about 90 percent of local staffers support the plan.
	   ``We have no other choice,'' said Fernando Bermejo, a PAL clerk.
``We have to earn a living, we don't want to lose our jobs.''
	   In the rescue plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan has offered workers
20 percent of the flag carrier's stock and three seats on its board
in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent.
	   In a meeting Monday night aimed at avoiding PAL's closure,
President Joseph Estrada also offered workers one of the
government's four board seats, but union leaders continued to
reject the plan.
	   Union leaders say a suspension of the collective bargaining
agreement would be a surrender of their labor rights and expose
them to management abuses.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _The International Development
Association (IDA) will provide dlrs 32.12 million credit to
Bangladesh to combat the presence of harmful Arsenic in water, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Finance Minister Shah Mohammad Kibria and Pierre Landell Mills,
country director of the World Bank, signed an agreement in the
Bangladesh capital on Monday for the arsenic mitigation water
supply project.
	   Nearly 80 percent of the country's 120 million people depend on
well water contaminated by Arsenic.
	   Mills said the fund would provide much needed help to those
fighting the silent killer.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. Food and Agriculture organization (FAO)
announced that it would provide 25 tons of vegetable seeds to small
farmers who have been badly hit by the worst flood in decades.
	   Hiroyuki Konuma, FAO Representative in Bangladesh, told
reporters that the seeds will be procured from local market and

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian producers should prepare

warned Tuesday.

Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 39.9 billion) in 1998/99 -- more than
0.8 percent) down on the previous year's tally, the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said in its
latest snapshot of the nation's commodity outlook.
	   The report reveals a mixed bag in which some commodities are
faring better than others amidst the worsening world economy and
warns the Asian crisis could still deepen.
	   The mineral resources sector, where export earnings are tipped
to rise 1.5 percent to 41.9 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
25.1 billion), remains a strong performer.
	   ``Although world prices of most minerals are forecast to be flat
or down, an assumed 15 percent fall in the Australian dollar means
that prices received by local exporters will be higher,'' ABARE
executive director Brian Fisher said.
	   Dairy exports are expected to surge past 2 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion), thanks to a lower dollar expected
to average U.S. 58 cents over 1998/99, and the outlook for cotton
and beef is also brighter.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's average land prices fell for the seventh
consecutive year as the country's economy remains mired in a
stubborn recession, the government said in a report released
Tuesday.
	   The National Land Agency said commercial land prices across the
nation dropped by an average 5.2 percent over the twelve months
through July 1, following a 5.1 percent fall the previous year.
	   In Tokyo, commercial land prices fell by 8.4 percent after
falling 10.6 percent a year earlier, the agency said. Commercial
land prices in Tokyo have now fallen to levels seen 15 years ago.
	   The continued decline was precipitated by the collapse in the
early 1990s of Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy, in which
easy credit caused real estate and stock prices to skyrocket.
	   The average residential land price across the country fell by
1.4 percent in the period, compared with a 0.7 percent fall a year
before.
	   Japan's most expensive commercial land was valued at 12.90
million yen (dlrs 96,200) for one square meter (10.76 square feet)
in Otemachi, Tokyo's main financial district.
	   The highest residential land price in Japan was 2.27 million yen
(dlrs 16,900) per square meter in Tokyo's Gobancho area, down 3.4
percent from the previous year, the agency said.
	   Agency officials said both commercial and residential land
prices in Japan will either weaken further or level off in the near
future.
	   The agency's report was based on a survey of land prices
conducted July 1 at 30,000 locations throughout the nation.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ World wheat prices will fall over the
coming year, the Australia's Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics said Tuesday.
	   The bureau, commonly known as ABARE, predicted that the world
indicator wheat price, that of US hard red winter wheat, will fall
by more than 15 percent in the 12 months to June next year.
	   It is forecasting a price of U.S. dlrs 120 a metric ton by that
time.
	   ABARE slays this reflects sluggish demand, relatively high world
stocks and another large crop.
	   However the bureau says there are still uncertainties about the
extent of crop and stock damage in China, which has been ravaged by
flood in recent weeks.
	   ``An improvement in domestic crop production in North Africa, a
record wheat crop in Pakistan, continuing economic problems in East
Asia and a recovery in world rice production_particularly in India,
Thailand and Indonesia_are expected to lead to lower wheat imports
in 1998-99,'' ABARE said.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As diplomats at the United
Nations ponder what to do about Kosovo, Serb forces launched a
strong attack Tuesday, pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic
Albanian resistance with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel

ago.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see

least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Mitrovica
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages.

Five people die of poisonous mushrooms in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Five Ukrainians died and at least 20 were
hospitalized in critical condition after eating poisonous mushrooms
over the weekend, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The latest cases of mushroom poisoning, registered in five
central and northern regions, have brought to about 100 the number
of people who have died from eating poisonous mushrooms so far this
year, the daily Fakty said.
	   At least 900 other poisoning cases have been registered in the
former Soviet republic since the beginning of 1998, Fakty said.
	   Mushroom hunting is extremely popular during the summer and
autumn months in the former Soviet Union _ and poisoning cases are
quite common.
	   Ukrainian doctors have warned against picking mushrooms. Some
poisoning cases have involved poisonous mushrooms mistaken for
edible ones and some of the victims gathered edible mushrooms, but
in badly polluted areas.
	   Health authorities have also urged people to avoid buying
mushrooms at outdoors markets, saying that some of them were
gathered in areas affected by radioactive fallout from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Vajpayee recommends dismissal of a state government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Tuesday recommended firing a socialist government in an eastern
state considered India's most lawless.
	   The move comes a day after Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi won a
confidence vote in the state legislature. Federal officials say
that while Devi has the votes in the legislature, she has lost
control of law and order in Bihar.
	   Vajpayee and two of his Cabinet ministers met with President
K.R. Narayanan and said the federal government wanted early
elections in Bihar state. Voting would not normally be held before
2000 for the Bihar state assembly.
	   A final decision rests with the president, who has in the past
turned down a similar request against another state government.
	   Vajpayee's action could still spark violent protests by the
supporters of the governing party, headed by powerful regional
leader Laloo Prasad Yadav, Devi's husband. As soon as news of the
recommendation reached the state capital Patna, governing party
lawmakers began planning a protest march and sit-in demonstration
outside the governor's residence there. Patna remained calm.
	   In New Delhi, Vajpayee's Cabinet met for more than two hours and
endorsed the Bihar governor's report recommending the dismissal of
the state government on grounds of ``constitutional breakdown,
financial mismanagement and failure of law and order.''
	   The state governor, Sunder Singh Bhandari, is a senior leader of
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, but he is expected to act
impartially. State governors are appointed by the federal
government to oversee local administrations, while chief ministers
who are members of state assemblies are the top local politicians.
	   ``It was not just law and order situation. The state seems to
have withered away in Bihar,'' said Lal Krishna Advani, India's
interior minister.
	   Tension began building last week following the state
government's rejection of the Vajpayee government's decision to
carve out a separate state for tribespeople out of Bihar to ensure
speedy development. Bihar is India's second most populous state.
	   Most of the lawmakers in the Bihar legislature have criminal
records and are frequently accused of switching political loyalty
in return for hefty bribes.
	   Yadav, a colorful politician resigned as chief minister last
year after a court charged him with siphoning off millions of
dollars in government funds. Yadav immediately appointed his wife
chief minister but he continues to wield enormous power even as his
trial continues.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks rebounded Tuesday after three
days of sharp declines in line with overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 203.28 points, or 2.8
percent, to close at 7,373.51. On Monday, the index had slumped
275.73 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
474 million), up slightly from Monday's 3.21 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 411 million).
	   Brokers said stocks opened higher in reaction to gains on Wall
Street following the release of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony.
	   ``The market reacted positively to the Clinton videotape. I
think the market expected much worse things coming out,'' said
George Chan, research manager at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings
Ltd, in Hong Kong.
	   The sharp rebound in the Japanese stock market also helped boost
sentiment in the local market, brokers said.
	   Josephine Hui, director of Celestial Asia Securites Ltd., said
shares rose on bargain-hunting after three days of losses in the
market.
	   Among properties, Sung Hung Kai Properties rose 95 Hong Kong
cents to 23.85, and Cheung Kong rose 80 cents to 31.90.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 3.50 dollars to
135.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 70 cents to 44.60.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.10 dollars to 36.40, and
Hong Kong Telecom rose 50 cents to 14.80.

Sympathy for Clinton after release of grand jury deposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with reaction from Vienna, Paris, South Africa, Iran,
Ireland and Singapore, removes outdated material
 &UR; With BC-US-Clinton-Lewinsky
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was aired
around the world, many people expressed sympathy for the president
and revulsion at the spectacle of America dragging its leader
through a ritual of humiliation.
	   From Europe to Asia and the Middle East, people decried what
they saw as an erosion of standards protecting privacy and keeping
explicit sexuality out of the mainstream media.
	   ``They didn't have to do this,'' Kensuke Sunato, a 27-year-old
company worker, said in Tokyo. ``I can't help but feel, so what?''
	   In Vienna, papers said the airing of Clinton' testimony hurt
America as much as its president.
	   ``A President Before the Sex Police,'' read the headline of a
commentary in Vienna daily Der Standard.
	   ``With the broadcast of the Lewinsky Affair video, the smutty
drama of sexual indiscretions of the U.S. president has reached its
highpoint,'' the paper said. ``Not only was Clinton damaged but
also the democratic institutions.''
	   Many people simply felt sorry for a man forced to publicly
discuss his sex life.
	   ``I wish they would just leave him alone,'' said Julie Robinson,
37, a sales executive for an air freight company. She said her
whole office stopped work to watch the testimony on television.
	   The Swiss press, too, was overwhelmingly behind Clinton and
criticized the airing of the video.
	   ``Where is America finally going to stop?'' questioned Le Matin
of Lausanne.
	   The Irish Times, published in Dublin, offered its readers a
brief play-by-play and analysis of the testimony.
	   ``The prosecutor's team landed some glancing blows on Mr.
Clinton but there was no knockout punch,'' the paper said.
``Despite the intensely personal nature of the cross-examination
this was, for the most part, a controlled, calm performance by the
president under the most trying circumstances.''
	   In Canada, one person reserved the harshest criticism for the
media, accusing it of broadcasting Clinton's deposition to boost
ratings.
	   ``No matter what they say, it's about sex; it's about ratings
and there's no denying that,'' said Gail MacLennan, a freelance
consultant and writer. ``This has just upped the ante in terms of
what is acceptable to expose.''
	   That sentiment was shared by papers in Iran.
	   ``Whether one is for or against President Bill Clinton, the U.S.
media has demonstrated its lack of taste and discretion,'' the Iran
News said.
	   In Paris, editorial writers just seemed tired of the scandal.
	   ``Ad nauseum'' headlined the leftist daily Liberation on
Tuesday. Broadcasting the Clinton testimony ``revealed nothing ...
if not the tenacity of the Republicans to make him fall.''
	   Japanese newspapers gave prominent coverage to Clinton's
deposition, carrying front-page photographs of the videotaped
testimony that showed the president lost in thought or displaying
irritation.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers focused on
how damaging the release of the tape would be to Clinton
politically.
	   ``How will the people judge (Clinton's) real face and natural
voice?'' read a headline in the Yomiuri.
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched Clinton on a television
screen at a shopping mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most
people would lie to keep such an affair secret.''
	   And in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald led with this
headline: ``Humiliation of a president ... in your living room.''
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said: ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the Democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops crossed into this
tiny mountain kingdom at dawn Tuesday to quell weeks of anarchy.
They secured two army bases and the royal palace after heavy
fighting, the South African military said.
	   Protesters firebombed government buildings, looters were
rampaging through downtown and cars with South African license
plates were being stoned, reports said.
	   At least 11 soldiers were wounded, none seriously, a military
spokesman, Maj. Louis Kirstein, said in Pretoria.
	   The action, post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention, follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom of 2 million people, is
entirely surrounded by South Africa and dependent on its neighbor's
economy.
	   The troops, backed by eight helicopters, battled Lesotho army
soldiers siding with the opposition at the royal palace, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio said. There also was heavy gunfire
at the main army barracks and the high court building, and other
structures were firebombed by demonstrators, SABC said.
	   An SABC cameraman also was injured, and four Lesotho soldiers
were led away as prisoners, SABC radio said.
	   American citizens -- who number about 60 or 70 in Maseru out of
300 in the country -- were told to stay indoors, said Ambassador
Katherine Peterson.
	   ``There are roving bands of protesters who are out and about who
are targeting South Africans,'' she said, a worry for Americans
because most have South African license plates.
	   The intervention force secured two Lesotho military bases near
the capital, as well as a dam project, the South African military
said. Flights to Maseru airport were halted. The palace gates were
reopened, but there was no word on the whereabouts of King Letsie
III, mainly a figurehead, the spokeswoman, air force Lt. Col.
Laverne Machine said by telephone.
	   She said that contrary to earlier reports, 200 troops from
Botswana had not yet arrived but were expected later in the day.
Six-hundred South African troops, armored personnel carriers,
attack helicopters and mortar units were involved so far, she said.
	   The military said the besieged Lesotho government had called for
intervention by the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' it said.
	   The troops crossed the border at 5 a.m. and were targeting the
state radio building, police, government buildings, utility
stations, military bases, embassies and airports.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers sent troops across its
borders to countries that included Angola and Namibia to take part
in wars. But since all-race elections in 1994, South Africa had
stuck to a policy of peaceful mediation in African conflicts.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   The Congress party won 79 of 80 seats but scored only 61 percent
of the vote because of voting rules, to which the opposition
parties had agreed. The discrepancy is part of the source of
opposition dissatisfaction, Peterson said.
	   A distraught opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned
the intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   A faction of the Lesotho army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the
military leadership. The new commanders had refrained from
restoring order in the streets.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.

Slovak opposition claims ruling party planning to steal election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Warnings of coup plots and
accusations that the ruling party plans to steal or cancel
elections are increasing nervousness ahead of Slovakia's
parliamentary balloting this week.
	   Both sides are slinging claims and counter-claims in the final
days before the Friday-Saturday voting, reflecting the perceived
vulnerability of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his government.
	   Meciar, a hardliner who has ruled Slovakia for virtually its
entire six years of independence, and his ruling Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are favored to outpoll all other
parties.
	   But analysts and foreign diplomats predict they will win far
less than their predicted 40 percent of the 150 seats in
Parliament, leaving them in jeopardy of not being able to put
together a majority coalition.
	   Most other parties are opposed to the authoritarian premier. A
diverse group of five parties, ranging from Christian conservatives
to Greens, comprise the recently formed Slovak Democratic Coalition
that is running a strong second to the HZDS in polls, with other
opposition parties behind them.
	   ``We will win the elections and bring a change,'' Mikulas
Dzurida, the coalition's leader, said this week. ``We will form a
government of a wide opposition coalition. Meciar will rule no
more.''
	   But the situation may not be clear for weeks. If Meciar's party
gets the most votes, it has 30 days to try to form a new
government.
	   ``If elections were held normally _ free and fair _ the
opposition would win and would even reach a constitutional
majority,'' says Martin Butora, president of the Institute for
Public Affairs, an independent think tank funded by financier
George Soros' Open Society Institute.
	   But authorities' consistent efforts to limit their opponents'
chances, via a series of rulings on election law and media
controls, have put the opposition and international officials on
alert to the potential of election fraud.
	   The opposition daily Sme claimed Monday that ruling party
officials are pondering how to get around what their own polls show
to be a certain defeat.
	   ``It is this forecast, which is far from optimistic, that caused
a struggle inside the HZDS in the past few days over whether to
proceed with regular elections, or foil the polls under a
fabricated excuse,'' the newspaper wrote.
	   Opposition leaders contend that authorities may launch a phony
coup attempt _ or even an assassination attempt against Meciar _
and blame it on them in order to justify calling off elections.
	   Officials of the populist-nationalist HZDS dismiss those claims
as nonsense. Meciar said this week he will quit politics if he
loses.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci says the government has adopted
measures to prevent provocations, including beefing up police
patrols with soldiers.
	   ``I don't rule out that provocative actions could be launched by
the opposition during the elections, either at polling stations or
in a different way,'' he told the Czech news agency CTK on Monday.

Teachers in central Russia to get paid in vodka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers in central Russia will be receiving their
monthly salaries in vodka because the government's coffers are
empty, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The 8,000 educators in the Altai republic will get 15 bottles of
vodka each while local leaders pressure the federal government to
pay its debts, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Officials in Altai, about 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of
Moscow, had previously tried to pay part of the teachers' six-month
wage arrears with toilet paper and funeral accessories. The
payments were refused, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The federal government had promised to pay 40 million rubles
(dlrs 2.5 million) to the teachers in August, but the money has not
appeared, ITAR-Tass said.
	   About 75 percent of Altai's budget comes from the federal
treasury, which is months behind in paying workers and pensioners
nationwide. The government's current wage and pension debts amounts
to some 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.2 billion). Many private
companies are also late in paying wages.

Debts to Thai banks will increase by dlrs 4 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Tuesday
that the nation's 15 domestic commercial banks are expected to
increase lending by 168 billion baht (dlrs 4 billion) in the second
half of the year.
	   Deputy Governor Kitti Patpong-pibul told a press conference that
according to credit extension plans submitted by the banks,
outstanding loans will rise to 4.64 trillion baht (dlrs 113
billion) from 4.47 trillion (dlrs 109 billion) at the end of June.
	   Thai banks have been hard hit by the country's economic crisis,
which erupted in July 1997. Many are reeling under a mountain of
bad debt as many of their customers have gone bankrupt or are in
financial difficulty.
	   The government has taken over six banks and shut down 56 of the
country's 93 finance companies.
	   Banks are now reluctant to lend even to customers with track
records of timely repayments.
	   Domestic branches of foreign banks, and banks operating under
Bangkok International Banking Facilities licenses, are expected to
increase loans by 50 billion baht (dlrs 1.2 billion) in the second
half. BIBF branches are authorized to extend foreign currency loans
within the country.
	   Outstanding BIBF and foreign branch loans should rise to 1.05
trillion baht (dlrs 25 billion) 995 billion baht (dlrs 24.2
billion) at the end of June.

Flooding leaves 52 dead in northern Philippines

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with storm death toll reaching 52

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Storms that battered the main
Philippine island of Luzon over the past week left at least 52
people dead and destroyed crops and livestock worth 34.2 million
pesos (dlrs 780,000), officials said Tuesday.
	   The deaths did not include at least 43 people who drowned after
an inter-island ferry with 454 people aboard sank Friday night
south of Manila after being pounded by large waves whipped by the
storms.
	   The National Disaster Coordinating Center said Pangasinan
province bore the brunt of tropical storm Vicki and another storm
that followed, with 37 deaths and more than 22,000 residents forced
to flee their homes. Most of the victims died either by drowning or
from electrocution.
	   Three other people were missing in the province after being
swept away by floodwaters, relief officials said.
	   Five people were reported killed in nearby La Union province.
The provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Tarlac and Zambales reported a
death each.
	   In metropolitan Manila, the storms killed six people and injured
two others. Nearly 11,000 residents were forced to stay temporarily
in schoolhouses to escape the floods. Most have now returned to
their homes.
	   Further south, one person drowned in the port city of Batangas.
	   The storms also pounded six other northern provinces, causing
widespread flooding but no deaths or injuries. About 15,500 people
fled their homes in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan,
Tarlac, Zambales and Nueva Ecija, officials said.
	   President Joseph Estrada declared a state of calamity in
Pangasinan and Pampanga provinces, allowing the release of
government disaster funds for those provinces.
	   The Department of Agriculture reported that the storms destroyed
crops and livestock worth 34.3 million pesos (dlrs 780,000).

Akenobo suffers third defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and
Wakanohana remained tied for the lead at 9-1, while Hawaii-born
yokozuna Akebono suffered his third upset Tuesday, the 10th day of
the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Trailing the leaders were five wrestlers at 7-3 _ Akebono, ozeki
(champion) Musashimaru, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai, No.
15 maegashira (senior wrestler) Toki and No. 16 maegashira Terao.
	   Wrestling at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in downtown Tokyo,
Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory following a triumph
in the last tournament, threw down No. 4 maegashira Wakanosato,
leaving Wakanosato at 5-5.
	   Wakanohana slapped down No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa. Kyokushuzan is 4-6.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, charged No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga with
fierce hand thrusts and tried to drive him out, but Tamakasuga held
off the charge and twisted Akebono down at the ring's edge for the
upset victory. The win was Tamakasuga's fourth victory against six
defeats.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, grabbed ozeki
Takanonami's belt tightly and forced him out, leaving Takanonami at
6-4.
	   In other major bouts, Chiyotaikai threw down No. 2 maegashira
Kotonowaka and Terao threw down No. 10 maegashira Higonoumi. Both
Kotonowaka and Higonoumi are 5-5.
	   Toki thrust out No. 12 maegashira Hamanoshima (4-6).
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, pulled down No. 6-ranked Oohinode (5-5) for his seventh
victory against three defeats.
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
sent out by No. 12-ranked Kitazakura (7-3) for his sixth defeat
against four victories.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma
(3-2), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, crushed down No. 24-ranked
Aminishiki.
	   No. 49-ranked Yamato (3-2), or American George Kalima, was
downed by No. 53-ranked Chiyonosho.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan (3-2), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was toppled by
No. 10-ranked Isshin.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

China detains two dissidents, watches a third in police sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another dissident detained, one under
surveillance, letter from 179 dissidents to leaders.
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have detained two dissidents
and placed a third under surveillance in a widening police sweep
against members of a would-be opposition party, rights groups
reported Tuesday.
	   Authorities in eastern Shandong province detained Xie Wanjun on
Monday, the U.S.-based Chinese Democratic Justice Party said in a
statement.
	   Liu Lianjun, who was detained briefly Saturday, now has five
police officers watching his home in the Shandong city of Weifang,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement said in a separate report.
	   Xie and Liu reported two weeks ago receiving vaguely encouraging
signals from the government about setting up the China Democracy
Party. But last week police began detaining and interrogating
people connected to the party.
	   The Hong Kong-based human rights group also reported that police
in Bengbu, an industrial city in Anhui province southwest of
Shandong, took Wang Hongxue from his home Monday night and on
Tuesday morning told his family to send him clothes.
	   Police in the northeastern city of Changchun have indicated the
China Democracy Party has been ruled illegal.
	   Authorities there accused a democracy campaigner arrested
Friday, Tang Yuanjuan, of having contacts with an illegal
organization. He had traveled to several cities on behalf of the
party.
	   Xie and Liu had said they felt encouraged when they tried to
register the party with the Shandong provincial office of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs. Officials did not immediately reject
their application but rather explained requirements for setting up
a legal organization, according to accounts by human rights groups.
	   Dissidents have been trying to register the China Democracy
Party with the government since U.S. President Bill Clinton visited
China in June. Police in eastern Zhejiang province rounded up 12
democracy campaigners connected to the group in July but later
released them.
	   Chinese law requires all organizations must be approved by the
government.
	   The ruling Communist Party has never allowed an opposition party
to form. A small number of minor parties established before the
Communists took power in 1949 have been allowed to continue, but
they have no power and play a minor supportive role.
	   Also Tuesday, 179 dissidents from around the country sent an
open letter to President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji to protest the charge against Tang that calls
China Democracy Party an illegal group.
	   The activists also called for the release of Tang and two
others: Fang Jue, a Beijing businessman and political reform
activist, and Shi Binhai, a newspaper editor who also edited a book
of essays about political reform.

Report: Soviet warning system's failure nearly sparked 1983 nuke
</HEADLINE>
war &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Soviet Union's nuclear warning system issued a
false alert in 1983 that said the United States had launched
missile attack, a mistake that could have prompted a nuclear
exchange, a Russian magazine said Tuesday.
	   An Oko (Eye) satellite, part of the Soviet early warning system,
wrongly signaled the launch of a U.S. Minuteman intercontinental
ballistic missile during the early hours of Sept. 26, 1983, said
the weekly Vlast (Power) magazine.
	   The Soviet satellite then reported several successive U.S.
launches. Under these circumstances, the Russian military believed
it had about 20 minutes to decide if the report was accurate and
whether it should fire missiles in retaliation.
	   Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, the duty officer in charge of the
warning system at the time, had less than 10 minutes to analyze the
information and make a decision before reporting to the Soviet
leadership.
	   Under his own authority, Petrov decided the alarm was false
because ground warning systems had failed to confirm the signal
sent by the satellite, the magazine said.
	   Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were
running high at the time of the incident.
	   Less than a month earlier, on Sept. 1, 1983, the Soviet military
shot down a civilian Korean Air Lines plane that strayed over
Soviet air space. All 269 people on board were killed, including an
American congressman.
	   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov, who received Petrov's
report, chose not to inform the ruling Politburo, but set up a
panel to investigate.
	   The panel found that the Oko satellites had virtually no
protection from the Earth's radiation, and this sharply distorted
its data.
	   ``The commission was horrified when it learned the real level of
the Oko satellites' reliability,'' the magazine said.
	   Petrov suffered severe stress after the incident and spent
several months in hospitals before being discharged from the
military, the magazine added.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ At the base of Malaysia's tallest
skyscrapers, Queen Elizabeth II walked into a British shopper's
paradise Tuesday.
	   Chatting with vendors displaying crystal wine glasses at a
Waterford boutique and asking about the packaged tea biscuits at
Marks and Spencer, the queen appeared right at home. It was her
first day of sightseeing since arriving Sunday in the former
British colony.
	   ``We want to show her there's still a bit of London in
Malaysia,'' said David Maniam, surrounded by lavender-scented soaps
in his Yardley London stall.
	   Maniam was taking part in an exhibition of British retailers in
the huge shopping mall beneath the 88-story Petronas twin
skyscrapers.
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, rode the elevator to
the 86th floor of one tower and peered out over the modern
Southeast Asian cityscape that has changed considerably since their
last visit in 1989.
	   The city was quiet on Tuesday, in contrast to the day before,
when a crowd of demonstrators against Malaysia's government briefly
chased after her motorcade.
	   Her four-day state visit comes during some of the biggest
political trouble in the Asian nation's history.
	   Queen Elizabeth and her husband landed the same day that fired
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed after addressing
35,000 rowdy demonstrators in the city streets. Police shot tear
gas at angry crowds outside the prime minister's home.
	   Still, the queen hasn't once lost her composure in public during
the Kuala Lumpur visit.
	   At The Body Shop on Tuesday, one salesman pointed out a
hand-mitt loofah, telling her it was one of their best-selling
items.
	   ``I should think so, it saves time in the bath,'' the queen
replied knowingly.
	   Prince Philip, though, was puzzled. He wondered aloud why a blue
shower gel was called ``White Musk.''
	   ``But it's blue,'' he said, eying the plastic container closely,
his hands crossed behind his back. ``You're a little bit off
there.''
	   Vendors said they were nervous about meeting the queen, not so
much because of her stature but out of fear of flubbing protocol.
The British High Commission, in advance of the visit, had
distributed a detailed list of dos and don'ts for greeting the
royals.
	   Inside another store, the queen paused at a display of black
faux snakeskin handbags and pumps.
	   ``Oh, it's a matching set. That's very important,'' said the
queen, dressed in a beige-and-white polka dot dress, gloves, a
wide-brimmed hat and her customary handbag and heels ensemble.
	   Hundreds of people gathered behind behind red-velvet ropes and
leaned over mezzanine balconies as the queen window-shopped below.
	   The queen was scheduled to visit an orphanage and attend a state
banquet hosted by Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar later Tuesday.

Four U.N. observers attacked in breakaway Georgian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on four United
Nations workers in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, seriously
wounding one, the press secretary to Abkhazia's leader said
Tuesday.
	   The U.N. military observers were attacked Monday night in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, said Astamur Taniya, press secretary
to Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba.
	   One worker was seriously wounded, and was taken to Turkey for
surgery, Taniya said. No other details were available, and the four
observers were not identified.
	   The United Nations keeps a group of military observers in
Georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and
separatists in Abkhazia.
	   A U.N. worker from Poland, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, was shot
and killed in July outside her apartment in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia became an independent state in the wake of
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 war,
driving out Georgian soldiers and ethnic Georgians. Violence has
broken out periodically since then despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the region.

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders ponder Kosovo at
the United Nations, Serb forces launched a strong attack Tuesday,
pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance
with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian extremists six months ago.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flash of muzzle fire from tanks and artillery, which pounded at
least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages. The attack appeared aimed at the Cicevica mountains on
the edge of the Drenica region, a known KLA stronghold.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Thousands of refugees are believed to be hiding in the mountain
forests.
	   The attack began as diplomats and world leaders were gathered in
New York for the annual debate of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   In his speech Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged
strong action to stop the bloodshed. He said Britain and France are
drafting a resolution that would demand an immediate cease-fire and
``an urgent end to the trampling on the rights of the inhabitants
of Kosovo.''
	   The major powers have been struggling since March to find a
peaceful solution to the crisis in Kosovo, where Albanians comprise
90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   But Russia and China _ both permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ have refused to sanction NATO military
intervention, despite fears that winter could bring death to tens
of thousands of Kosovo refugees.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, Milosevic insisted Monday that
the refugees are receiving care and shelter and that international
concerns about their fate are misplaced.
	   ``The term 'humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the past weeks is not based on reality,'' said a statement
issued by Milosevic's office following a meeting with special U.S.
envoy, Christopher Hill.
	   Milosevic also met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky, and afterward the government declared that Kosovo
Albanian ``terrorists'' have been defeated.
	   ``Yugoslavia has been faced with unprecedented threats only
because it defends its sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   In New York, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged his
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, to support a U.N. Security
Council resolution authorizing NATO intervention Kosovo.
	   As a permanent council member, China could veto such a
resolution. China considers the crisis in Kosovo an internal matter
in which the council should not become involved. It was unclear
whether Kinkel was able to soften Chinese objections.
	   In Lisbon, a spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said
on condition of anonymity that Kosovo would be at the ``top of the
agenda'' during the informal meeting of NATO defense ministers in
southern Portugal on Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The feeling is that (Tuesday's) intensified Serb attack is
directly linked to the meeting'' where possible NATO intervention
in Kosovo would be discussed, according to the spokesman, who is
involved in preparing the agenda.
	   Despite international pressure, government forces have all but
routed the KLA, driving many of them across the border into
Albania. In the Albanian capital Tirana, officials said Ahmed
Krasniqi, a member of the Kosovo Albanian government-in-exile, was
slain Monday night.
	   The motive was unclear. But Krasniqi was responsible for
organizing military forces for the exile government, and some
Kosovo analysts believed his death could have resulted from a power
struggle within rebel ranks.

Three held for questioning bombing to be released on police bond
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Three men held for questioning in
the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy will be released on police
bond but will remain under investigation, a senior police official
said Tuesday.
	   ``There is not enough evidence to bring formal charges against
them, but investigations into their possible role are continuing,''
Adadi Rajabu, director of criminal investigations, told reporters.
	   ``The three may later assist police as witnesses for the
prosecution, or they may face prosecution,'' he said, adding that
the release would take place some time Tuesday.
	   He said the three had provided valuable information to
investigators.
	   One of those detained, Thomas Lyimo, is the owner of a metal
workshop where some reports indicate the bomb that killed 11 people
could have been mounted on a vehicle.
	   Rajabu refused to identify the other two men, other than confirm
that one was a Tanzanian and the other an Algerian.
	   ``Investigators expect to get important findings this week or
next week from the ongoing analysis of materials collected from the
bomb site,'' Rajabu said.
	   Among possible information, he said, could be the fate of the
driver's assistant or ``turnboy,'' who normally rode in the tanker
truck that periodically delivered water to the embassy located in a
residential neighborhood.
	   He said investigators were conducting DNA analysis of fragments
of human remains found at the bomb site and comparing results with
items provided by the man's relatives to determine whether he was
killed in the explosion. The man disappeared from his home before
the bombing and has not been seen since.
	   The cab of the tanker truck, that appeared to have been outside
the embassy gates at the time of the blast, was badly damaged, but
the tank itself was only slightly damaged.
	   Rajabu did not identify the turnboy and acknowledged that the
mystery behind his fate was bogging the investigation down.
	   Rajabu said police were still looking for several fugitives
wanted for questioning on their ``direct involvement'' in the
bombing, but he declined to give names, numbers or nationalities.
	   On Monday, a magistrate's court in Dar es Salaam filed formal
charges on 11 counts of murder each against Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, who also uses the
names Saleh Aben Alahales and Said Ahmed.
	   The next court hearing was scheduled for Oct. 5, when a trial
date could be set.
	   Rajabu said both men would be tried in Tanzania ``because the
crime was committed in the country, and all the victims were
Tanzanian.''
	   Actually, one of the victims was a Somali married to an American
woman.
	   A nearly simultaneous blast destroyed the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kenya, killing 248 people, 12 of them Americans.
	   Two suspects were flown from Kenya to the United States where
formal complaints have been filed against them for the murders of
the 12 Americans in U.S. federal court in Manhattan.
	   On Tuesday, the Daily Nation newspaper in Nairobi said it had
reported Aug. 18, 10 days after the bombing, that Mustafa Mahmoud
Said Ahmed had given information last November to Kenyan security
officials about bombings planned in the region and that the
information had been given to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the report.

China worries US, Japan agreement might spark arms race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Tuesday that a U.S.-Japan
agreement to research an anti-missile defense system could set off
an arms race in Northeast Asia.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao did not directly
criticize the agreement reached at a meeting of U.S. and Japanese
foreign and defense ministers Sunday. But in response to a
reporter's question about it, Zhu warned of the fragile peace
surrounding the Korean peninsula.
	   ``All parties concerned should exercise restraint and refrain
from doing anything that may cause tensions in the region and spark
a new arms race,'' Zhu said at a routine media briefing.
	   He added that China opposed any side trying to ``seek military
superiority and undermine regional security.''
	   Conflict between North Korea and South Korea is seen as the
region's most likely flash point. In the background is rivalry
between Northeast Asia's big powers _ China, Japan, the United
States and to a lesser extent Russia _ who all have influence and
interests in the Korean peninsula.
	   U.S. and Japanese officials described their decision to study a
theater missile defense system as a necessary step after North
Korea launched a two-stage rocket over Japan on Aug. 31.
	   China has grown increasingly wary of U.S.-Japanese defense
cooperation, fearing a plot to contain its rise as a regional
power. Beijing has vigorously protested a defense agreement reached
last year, despite U.S. and Japanese assurances that it did not
target China.
	   A Japanese official suggested that the pact would require Japan
to support U.S. military action if China attacked Taiwan, which
Beijing claims as a rebel province.
	   Northeast Asia's complex rivalry is also being marked by
intensified diplomacy. Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who held a
successful summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton this summer, was
to have traveled to Japan and Russia this month but canceled the
trip after disastrous flooding struck central and northeastern
China.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said timing for
rescheduled visits was still being worked out.
	   Following up on their June summit in Beijing, Jiang recently
sent a letter to Clinton assuring him their agreements would be
implemented, Zhu said. He added that would bring both countries
closer to their goal of building a strategic partnership.
	   At the summit, both countries agreed not to target the other
with nuclear missiles and to improve exchanges between their
militaries. Gen. Zhang Wannian, China's most politically powerful
general, traveled to Washington last week to work out details on
military exchanges.

Vajpayee recommends dismissal of a state government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Yadav comment in new grafs 6 and 9. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Tuesday recommended firing a socialist government in an eastern
state considered India's most lawless.
	   The move comes a day after Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi won a
confidence vote in the state legislature. Federal officials say
that while Devi has the votes in the legislature, she has lost
control of law and order in Bihar.
	   Vajpayee and two of his Cabinet ministers met with President
K.R. Narayanan and said the federal government wanted early
elections in Bihar. Voting would not normally be held before 2000
for the Bihar state assembly.
	   A final decision rests with the president, who has in the past
turned down a similar request against another state government.
	   Vajpayee's action could still spark violent protests by the
supporters of the governing party, headed by powerful regional
leader Laloo Prasad Yadav, Devi's husband. As soon as news of the
recommendation reached the state capital Patna, governing party
lawmakers began planning a protest march and sit-in demonstration
outside the governor's residence there. Patna remained calm.
	   In New Delhi, Yadav termed Vajpaee's decision ``highly
undemocratic and dictatorial.'' He said he would meet the president
on Wednesday and try to persuade him to reject the prime minister's
recommendation.
	   Vajpayee's Cabinet met for more than two hours and endorsed the
Bihar governor's report recommending the dismissal of the state
government on grounds of ``constitutional breakdown, financial
mismanagement and failure of law and order.''
	   The state governor, Sunder Singh Bhandari, is a senior leader of
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, but he is expected to act
impartially. State governors are appointed by the federal
government to oversee local administrations, while chief ministers
who are members of state assemblies are the top local politicians.
	   Yadav called for Bhandari's dismissal.
	   ``It was not just law and order situation. The state seems to
have withered away in Bihar,'' said Lal Krishna Advani, India's
interior minister.
	   Tension began building last week following the state
government's rejection of the Vajpayee government's decision to
carve out a separate state for tribespeople out of Bihar to ensure
speedy development. Bihar is India's second most populous state.
	   Most of the lawmakers in the Bihar legislature have criminal
records and are frequently accused of switching political loyalty
in return for hefty bribes.
	   Yadav, a colorful politician resigned as chief minister last
year after a court charged him with siphoning off millions of
dollars in government funds. Yadav immediately appointed his wife
chief minister but he continues to wield enormous power even as his
trial continues.

Three bombings, clashes leave 10 dead; army rings militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Three bombings and clashes between the
army and Muslim militants across Algeria have left 10 people dead
and 16 injured, officials said Tuesday.
	   The resurgence of violence this month came as troops carried out
new sweeps against the militants, reportedly encircling hundreds of
fighters belonging to the Armed Islamic Group.
	   On Monday, a bomb exploded near a passing military truck in
Saida, 400 kms (240 miles) southwest of Algiers, killing two
soldiers and injuring four pedestrians, hospital officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The bombing came during a military sweep in the region since
Thursday, in which troops have encircled 350 members of the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), local authorities said, also on anonymity.
	   There was no official confirmation of the operation, though the
eventual capture of the fighters would mark a heavy blow to the
GIA, the most violent group of a 6 1/2-year-old insurgency.
	   In other violence, Muslim militants on Tuesday bombed and
ambushed another truck carrying police near the southern outskirts
of Tizi-Ouzou, capital of the northeastern Berber region, killing
one person and injuring 10 others, hospital officials said.
	   The truck was escorting another truck carrying prisoners, though
the attackers were unable to open the doors and free the inmates
before fleeing.
	   Another bombing on Monday injured six people on a highway near
Sidi Akacha, 200 kms (120 miles) west of Algiers. The bomb was
planted near a fruit and vegetable market, and a second bomb found
nearby was dismantled.
	   Soldiers at a base in Tafsour, 440 kms (260 miles) west of
Algiers, shot and killed three members of the Armed Islamic Group
who were believed on a reconnaissance mission. Two other GIA
members were killed near Mascara, 400 kms (240 miles) west of
Algiers.
	   Security forces also killed four suspected GIA members in Ain
Oussera, 150 kms (80 miles) south of Algiers, as the group tried to
plant a bomb in a market.
	   The insurgency in this petroleum-rich North African nation began
after the military-backed government canceled second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win. More than 75,000 people have been
killed.
	   President Liamine Zeroual last week announced he would call an
early presidential election by February and would not run for
re-election.

Asian stocks rebound on Wall Street rise, calm in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday
on the back of overnight gains on Wall Streets following the
release of U.S. President Bill Clinton's videotaped grand jury
testimony.
	   Hong Kong stocks rebounded after three days of sharp declines in
line with overnight gains on Wall Street. The blue-chip Hang Seng
Index rose 203.28 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 7,373.51. On
Monday, the index had slumped 275.73 points.
	   ``The market reacted positively to the Clinton videotape. I
think the market expected much worse things coming out,'' said
George Chan, research manager at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings
Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   In Tokyo, shares rose on hopes that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
might pledge more aggressive measures to stimulate the Japanese
economy during a summit with Clinton later Tuesday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 192.51 points,
or 1.42 percent, to 13,789.81 after losing nearly 32 points in the
morning. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82 points, or 2.76
percent, to 13,597.30, its lowest level in 12 years.
	   Earlier Tuesday, prices were pulled down by a steep decline in
blue chips and lingering concerns about the future of key
legislation aimed at stabilizing Japan's financial system.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was trading at 135.14 yen, up 2.14
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 134.49 yen overnight.
	   Bucking the trend was the Philippine Stock Exchange, where the
key index fell 3.5 percent as the scheduled closure on Wednesday of
Philippine Airlines continued to cast a long shadow on the market.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 40.96 points
to 1,123.30.
	   Malaysian stocks rebounded from Monday's sharp falls as
bargain-hunters stepped into the market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 7.13
points, or 1.9 percent, to 385.45. On Monday, the index fell nearly
4 percent in the wake of the arrest of former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim and several party officials considered to be his
supporters.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher as fears over the
U.S. presidency subsided, dealers said. The Straits Times Index
closed up 13.73 points, or 1.6 percent, to 896.32.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on bargain-hunting. The
Composite Index rose 4.042 points, or 1.6 percent, to 260.876 after
it touched a seven-year low Monday.
	   TAIPEI: The key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 4.59 points, or
0.06 percent, to 7,033.99.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower for the third
consecutive session. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.80 points, or
0.5 percent, to 1,710.39.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher in reaction to the
rises on both the Japanese and Hong Kong stock exchanges. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 12.5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,534.4.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 4.84 points, or 1.6 percent, to 292.61.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index rose 1.26 points, or 0.6 percent, to 223.14.

MASERU: neighbor's economy.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The troops, backed by eight helicopters, battled Lesotho army
soldiers siding with the opposition at the royal palace, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio said. There also was heavy gunfire
at the main army barracks and the high court building, and other
structures were firebombed by demonstrators, SABC said.
	   An SABC cameraman also was injured, and four Lesotho soldiers
were led away as prisoners, SABC radio said.
	   American citizens -- who number about 60 or 70 in Maseru out of
300 in the country -- were told to stay indoors, said Ambassador
Katherine Peterson.
	   ``There are roving bands of protesters who are out and about who
are targeting South Africans,'' she said, a worry for Americans
because most have South African license plates.
	   Flights to Maseru airport were halted.
	   The palace gates were reopened, but there was no word on the
whereabouts of King Letsie III, figurehead monarch, said a South
African military spokeswoman, air force Lt. Col. Laverne Machine.
	   She said that contrary to earlier reports, 200 troops from
Botswana had not yet arrived but were expected later in the day.
Six-hundred South African troops, armored personnel carriers,
attack helicopters and mortar units were involved so far, she said.
	   The military said the besieged Lesotho government had called for
intervention by the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as quickly
as possible and to withdraw from the kingdom of Lesotho as soon as
this has been achieved,'' it said.
	   The troops crossed the border at 5 a.m. and were targeting the
state radio building, police, government buildings, utility
stations, military bases, embassies and airports.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers sent troops across its
borders to countries that included Angola and Namibia to take part
in wars. But since all-race elections in 1994, South Africa had
stuck to a policy of peaceful mediation in African conflicts.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   The Congress party won 79 of 80 seats but scored only 61 percent
of the vote because of voting rules, to which the opposition
parties had agreed. The discrepancy is part of the source of
opposition dissatisfaction, Peterson said.
	   A distraught opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned
the intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   A faction of the Lesotho army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the
military leadership. The new commanders had refrained from
restoring order in the streets.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.

Hungary to investigate life loss in 1968 invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary will investigate reports of
Hungarian soldiers killed in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia,
the defense minister said Tuesday.
	   The topic was taboo under the communists, when the government
claimed there were no casualties when Hungary participated in the
Moscow-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.
	   Minister of Defense Janos Szabo said that a full-scale
investigation will be launched.
	   The announcement came in response to a question by Zsolt Lanyi,
the chairman of the House Defense Committee and a member of the
Smallholders Party, which is part of the governing coalition.
	   Lanyi told state radio that he has heard from mothers whose sons
never returned from Czechoslovakia. The mothers were never told why
their sons died and never received their bodies.
	   Lanyi said he suspects the Hungarian soldiers may have been
buried in a common grave in the Ukraine, then part of the Soviet
Union.
	   About eight to 10 Hungarian soldiers were killed in the
Czechoslovak invasion, according to Gen. Aleksandr Mayorov, who
commanded the Warsaw Pact troops participating in the operation to
crush a reformist Communist government in Prague.
	   Mayorov made the comment in an interview with Hungarian
historian Miklos Kun, whose book on the invasion was published last
week.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders ponder Kosovo at
the United Nations, Serb forces launched a strong attack Tuesday,
pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance
with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian extremists six months ago.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flashes from tanks and artillery, which pounded at least five
villages on the main road between Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages. The attack appeared aimed at the Cicevica mountains on
the edge of the Drenica region, a known KLA stronghold.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Thousands of refugees are believed to be hiding in the mountain
forests.
	   The attack began as diplomats and world leaders gathered in New
York for the annual debate of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   In his speech Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged
strong action to stop the bloodshed. He said Britain and France are
drafting a resolution that would demand a cease-fire and ``an
urgent end to the trampling on the rights of the inhabitants of
Kosovo.''
	   The major powers have been struggling since March to solve the
crisis in Kosovo, where Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants.
	   But Russia and China _ both permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ have refused to sanction NATO military
intervention, despite fears that winter cold could kill tens of
thousands of Kosovo refugees.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, Milosevic insisted Monday that
the refugees are receiving care and shelter and that international
concerns about their fate are misplaced.
	   ``The term 'humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the past weeks is not based on reality,'' said a statement
issued by Milosevic's office following a meeting with special U.S.
envoy, Christopher Hill.
	   Milosevic also met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky, and afterward the government declared that Kosovo
Albanian ``terrorists'' have been defeated.
	   ``Yugoslavia has been faced with unprecedented threats only
because it defends its sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   In New York, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged his
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, to support a U.N. Security
Council resolution authorizing NATO intervention in Kosovo.
	   As a permanent council member, China could veto such a
resolution. China considers the crisis in Kosovo an internal matter
in which the council should not become involved. It was unclear
whether Kinkel was able to soften Chinese objections.
	   In Lisbon, a spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said
on condition of anonymity that Kosovo would be at the ``top of the
agenda'' during the informal meeting of NATO defense ministers in
southern Portugal on Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The feeling is that (Tuesday's) intensified Serb attack is
directly linked to the meeting'' where possible NATO intervention
in Kosovo would be discussed, according to the spokesman, who is
involved in preparing the agenda.
	   Despite international pressure, government forces have all but
routed the KLA, driving many of them across the border into
Albania. In the Albanian capital Tirana, officials said Ahmed
Krasniqi, a member of the Kosovo Albanian government-in-exile, was
slain Monday night.
	   The motive was unclear. But Krasniqi was responsible for
organizing military forces for the exile government, and some
Kosovo analysts believed his death could have resulted from a power
struggle within rebel ranks.

Four more rescued in Philippine ferry accident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Four more people, including a
Christian minister, were rescued by fishermen from a small island
Tuesday, four days after the ferry they were riding sank in a storm
outside Manila Bay.
	   The coast guard said 48 people remained missing and 43 were
confirmed dead in the accident late Friday. The Princess of the
Orient was carrying 454 people when it began listing and quickly
sank in rough waters.
	   Ernesto Casane, a pastor with a local born-again group, said
several dead bodies remained on the island, about 60 kilometers (35
miles) southwest of Manila.
	   A recovery team led by Ramon Revilla Jr., governor of Cavite
province, headed for the island to retrieve the bodies.
	   Casane said he and several other passengers on the top deck
jumped into the ocean when the ship capsized.
	   By dawn Saturday, they saw an island and swam for it but were
swept in a different direction by powerful waves toward another
island surrounded by sharp rocks.
	   The group could not immediately reach the island for fear of
being battered on the rocks. One man was killed trying to get to
the shore, Casane said in a telephone interview from the hospital
where he is being treated.
	   ``I prayed hard,'' he said. ``Suddenly, a wave tossed me right
inside a cave. If I had crashed on the rocks instead, I would have
been killed.''
	   He and the others sought shelter in the cave and drank rain
water seeping from the rocks, he said.
	   One man, out of desperation, drank sea water stained with oil
and later died, Casane said.
	   When the waters finally calmed early Tuesday, Casane ventured
out of the cave and saw two fishermen on a boat, who rescued them.
	   The group was shivering, their eyes were bloodshot and their
bruised bodies were covered with oil and grease when they arrived
in the hospital, a staff member said.
	   Accident investigators say the ship, owned by Sulpicio Lines,
was carrying a heavy cargo which may have been improperly secured
and shifted in the heavy waves, causing the ship to tilt.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.

Long-delayed German airlift starts in famine-struck Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A German military transport plane delivered
humanitarian aid to southern Sudan early Tuesday after shipments in
the famine-struck north African nation were delayed by last month's
U.S. military strike.
	   The relief flight, which took off from the Sudanese capital
Khartoum at 6:13 a.m. (0413 GMT), was headed for Wau, in southern
Sudan, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people face famine in the south, where
rebels and government forces have been at war for 15 years.
	   Sudan's government declared a unilateral cease-fire in the area
Aug. 3 to promote the flow of aid. Defense officials say the
airlift is supposed to run for at least two months with as many as
four flights daily from Khartoum, where Germany has stationed two
planes and 50 soldiers.
	   The airlift under the United Nations flag had been set to start
Aug. 21, but Germany postponed it after the U.S. attack on a
Khartoum chemical factory a day earlier. The attack was in
retaliation against those suspected of carrying out U.S. Embassy
bombings in east Africa.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army is fighting for greater
autonomy in southern Sudan from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north. About 1.5 million people have died in
fighting and famines since 1983.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Questioned for the first time over
allegations of massive corruption, Indonesia's ex-President Suharto
has again denied stashing money overseas during 32 years in power,
investigators said Tuesday.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhamad Ghalib and senior Cabinet minister
Hartarto Sastrosoenarto talked with the former leader at his family
home in central Jakarta on Monday night.
	   It was the first occasion that Suharto has been directly quizzed
about the extent of his wealth.
	   They described Suharto as ``cooperative and helpful.''
	   A spokesman for Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie,
said the current leader was ``very satisfied'' with Suharto's
response to the investigation.
	   The government, which is laced with former Suharto supporters
including Habibie, has promised a full and thorough inquiry.
	   However, critics say the investigation isn't likely to amount to
much as the government has neither the will or expertise to search
for any ill-gotten wealth.
	   Even one of Habibie's own Cabinet members, Food Minister A.M.
Saefuddin, has called on the investigators to quit if they haven't
got ``the guts'' to stage a proper inquiry, the newspaper Merdeka
reported Tuesday.
	   At a news conference, Ghalib and Hartarto said Suharto had
stressed that he ``has no deposits, shares or promissory notes
abroad'' and that ``has never been a client of any foreign bank.''
	   Suharto also offered to supply a full list of his assets and to
sign a letter authorizing foreign banks to open up their records to
investigators, allowing them to seize any money found.
	   Hartarto said the aging leader threatened to sue anyone who had
set up foreign bank accounts under his name without his knowledge.
Legal action would also be taken against those who make false
allegations against him.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests
against his autocratic rule.
	   He is accused of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade in power and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign
bank accounts while his family built huge business empires under
his patronage.
	   An estimate by Forbes magazine put his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   However, in a recent and rare television appearance he flatly
denied any wrongdoing and said he did not have ``a cent'' stashed
away overseas.
	   That denial was greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians
struggling to make ends meet during the worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Habibie, who is a longtime friend and former subordinate of
Suharto, last week bowed to mounting pressure from protesters and
others and ordered that the former leader be questioned.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Habibie felt that Suharto had
been ``very cooperative.''
	   Akbar said the inquiry would continue and asked that people with
information about corruption to come forward.
	   Ghalib, who earlier said he believed Suharto's original
television denial, promised that his investigation would be
``pro-active.''
	   ``I will obviously try to collect data and information about his
wealth,'' he said.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Army trucks filled with troops
carrying assault rifles surrounded the home of Malaysia's ousted
deputy prime minister Tuesday. Another 30 riot police with tear gas
canisters lurked outside the house as supporters gathered inside.
The police have threatened to arrest the wife of the former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for suggesting her husband had been
injected with the HIV virus while in police detention. Anwar,
arrested under the country's Internal Security Act, has not been
seen since police dragged him and his wife, Azizah Ismail, from
their home Sunday night. Eleven of Anwar's closest supporters also
were arrested Monday under the ISA, which allows suspects deemed a
threat to national security to be held for up to 60 days without
trial or legal council. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The season's most ferocious
hurricane plowed into Puerto Rico on Monday after raking other
parts of the Caribbean and forcing tens of thousands of people into
shelters. At least five people died on the island and one woman was
killed on St. Kitts. Packing winds up to 130 mph (209 kph) and
churning up 20-foot (6-meter) waves, Hurricane Georges toppled
power lines, smashed hotel windows, mangled trees and blew away
roofs as families huddled in shelters in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
St. Kitts, Antigua and other islands earlier Monday. The hurricane
appeared headed for the island of Hispaniola, which is shared by
the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Many of that island's 15 million
people live in substandard housing that could leave them exposed to
Georges' fury. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Lawmakers see impeachment proceedings against
President Bill Clinton as likely but are willing to hear a direct
appeal to Congress by the president, an option the White House is
actively considering. Struggling to digest a historic but wrenching
avalanche of testimony, the people who now hold Clinton's future in
their hands say the president may have gained some sympathy with
the airing of his grand jury testimony Monday in the Monica
Lewinsky affair. But while no one says the nationally televised
spectacle severely damaged Clinton, neither do lawmakers suggest
the president's troubles will go away. One Democratic senator says
he is absorbing details under the assumption he will sit as a juror
in an impeachment trial. ``As a member of the U.S. Senate, I'm a
potential juror in this case,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey, for years one of Clinton's staunchest defenders on Capitol
Hill. ``Whatever affections I've held for Bill Clinton are entirely
eclipsed by my sense of responsibility.'' (US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops crossed into Lesotho
at dawn Tuesday to quell weeks of anarchy. They secured two army
bases and the royal palace after heavy fighting in which three
soldiers died, the South African military said. Protesters
firebombed government buildings, looters were rampaging through
downtown and cars with South African license plates were being
stoned, reports said. Three South African soldiers were killed and
at least 11 wounded, none seriously, a military spokesman, Maj.
Louis Kirstein, said in Pretoria. The action, post-apartheid South
Africa's first major military intervention, follows weeks of
opposition party demonstrations over allegations of
election-rigging and an army rebellion that had effectively
paralyzed the government in this tiny mountain country. Lesotho, a
poor kingdom of 2 million people, is entirely surrounded by South
Africa and dependent on its neighbor's economy. (LESOTHO)
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As diplomats at the United
Nations ponder what to do about Kosovo, Serb forces launched a
strong attack Tuesday, pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic
Albanian resistance with heavy artillery and tank fire. A police
commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it would take
his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel Kosovo

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday
on the back of overnight gains on Wall Streets following the
release of U.S. President Bill Clinton's videotaped grand jury
testimony. Hong Kong stocks rebounded after three days of sharp
declines in line with overnight gains on Wall Street. The blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rose 203.28 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at
7,373.51. On Monday, the index had slumped 275.73 points. ``The
market reacted positively to the Clinton videotape. I think the
market expected much worse things coming out,'' said George Chan,
research manager at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings Ltd. in Hong
Kong. In Tokyo, shares rose on hopes that Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi might pledge more aggressive measures to stimulate the
Japanese economy during a summit with Clinton later Tuesday. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Japan pledged to bail out its South Asian
neighbors, but said its own economic recovery would be the best
medicine to heal the Asian financial crisis _ the top issue of the
day at the opening of the General Assembly's annual speech fest.
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told world leaders gathered for the
53rd annual general debate that Japan hoped to regain its role as a
financial leader in the region by channeling about dlrs 43 billion
in loans and grants to help out its neighbors' shaky economies.
``Japan is making every effort possible, through such measures as
stabilizing our financial system, to put our own economy on a
recovery track within the next year or two,'' Obuchi said. ``We
believe that early recovery of our own economy is the best
contribution we can make to the economies of Asia and the world.''
Obuchi was expected to continue discussions about the bailout in
meetings Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the New York
City suburb of Tarrytown. (UN-GENERAL ASSEMBLY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's average land prices fell for the seventh
consecutive year as the country's economy remains mired in a
stubborn recession, the government said in a report released
Tuesday. The National Land Agency said commercial land prices
across the nation dropped by an average 5.2 percent over the twelve
months through July 1, following a 5.1 percent fall the previous
year. In Tokyo, commercial land prices fell by 8.4 percent after
falling 10.6 percent a year earlier, the agency said. Commercial
land prices in Tokyo have now fallen to levels seen 15 years ago.
The continued decline was precipitated by the collapse in the early
1990s of Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy, in which easy
credit caused real estate and stock prices to skyrocket. The
average residential land price across the country fell by 1.4
percent in the period, compared with a 0.7 percent fall a year
before. (JAPAN-LAND PRICES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has lifted an export ban on
several major commodities except processed rice, Trade and Industry
Minister Rahardi Ramelan said Tuesday. Rahardi, who is also
chairman of national logistics agency, Bulog, said the ban was
lifted as the commodities were no longer subsidized by the
government. The government imposed the ban on July 28 to prevent
profiteering through the re-export of subsidized imports. The
government had been subsidizing commodities since the collapse of
Indonesia's economy earlier this year to help millions of poor
people avoid shortages of food and essential items. The ban covered
fish meal, unprocessed rice, wheat, wheat flour, black wheat flour,
rice flour, soybean, broken soybean, yellow soy beans, sugar, sugar
bits, flavored or colored sugar and kerosene. (INDONESIA-BAN

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a last-ditch effort to keep
Philippine Airlines from closing, government labor officials went
directly to its workers Tuesday to ask if they will support a
rescue plan proposed by the company's management. Union leaders
have rejected the plan, which PAL says is needed for its survival
after a series of crippling strikes. Government officials hope that
support among workers for the plan would convince the airline to
reverse its decision to shut down at midnight Wednesday. With
results of the referendum still to be counted, workers in the
central city of Iloilo said an informal poll showed about 90
percent of local PAL workers back the plan. ``We have no other
choice,'' said Fernando Bermejo, a PAL clerk. ``We have to earn a
living, we don't want to lose our jobs.'' (PHILIPPINE AIRLINES)

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Two gunmen wearing ski masks killed the
acting ``defense minister'' of the Kosovo government-in-exile as he
walked along a narrow, darkened street in the Albanian capital, the
exiles' office here announced Tuesday.
	   A statement by the self-styled consulate of the exile government
said Ahmet Krasniqi, 50, whom it described as the acting ``defense
minister'' and chief of staff, was killed about 11:25 p.m. (2125
GMT) Monday.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga confirmed the killing
and said the gunmen escaped. The motive for the killing was
unclear, he said.
	   Krasniqi, a native of Kosovo, was part of a government-in-exile
formed in the early 1990s by Ibrahim Rugova, who is trying to
negotiate self-rule for the rebellious Serbian province.
	   The Kosovo statement was the first time Krasniqi had been
publicly identified as the ``defense minister'' because of security
concerns. The exiled government is headed by a self-styled premier,
Bujar Bukoshi, and operates in Switzerland and other Western
European countries.
	   As defense minister, Krasniqi was responsible for organizing
paramilitary forces which would parallel the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part
of Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo statement described Krasniqi as ``one of the
best-trained and educated'' officers of the ethnic Albanian
resistance who had ``worked with devotion for the unity of
political sectors and military ones.''
	   In Kosovo, political analysts, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Krasniqi's death could be part of a power struggle
within Kosovo Albanian rebel ranks.
	   The KLA accused the ``extended hand of the Serbian regime'' for
the killing.

Government pledges reforms _ under more state controls

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top economic policymaker said Tuesday that
Russia's market reforms would continue, but stressed that the state
would have to play a larger role to bring the country out of its
current crisis.
	   ``We should advance toward the free market, but do it very
cautiously,'' said Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister
who is in charge of economic policy.
	   President Boris Yeltsin fired the previous government a month
ago, and new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been in office for
11 days. But Russia still does not have a full cabinet in place and
has not announced a comprehensive plan to deal with the worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The new government contains politicians from across the
political spectrum, including Maslyukov, a Communist. It's not yet
clear how the government will incorporate all the various
viewpoints into a coherent economic policy.
	   ``The movement toward a free market is inevitable,'' Maslyukov
told reporters while on a trip to St. Petersburg region on Tuesday,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   But, he added, ``our speed and expectations have surpassed our
real opportunities, and instead of a free market we have got crisis
and collapse of our financial system.''
	   ``The role of the state must, of course, be increased,''
Maslyukov said.
	   Yeltsin signed an order Tuesday approving the structure of the
new Cabinet. In the process, he restored some ministries that had
been abolished in an earlier effort to streamline the government.
	   Several key government posts, including the job of finance
minister and the head of the state tax service, have not yet been
filled.
	   So far, Primakov has only spoken in general terms about the need
to continue reforms while easing the pain on the impoverished
population.
	   The government's top priority has been to stabilize and revive
the country's leading banks, which have been conducting only
limited operations in recent weeks.
	   The Central Bank has helped the commercial banks settle debt
payments in a bid to get cash flowing through the financial system
again. Many firms and individuals have not had full access to their
accounts due to the banking crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the battered Russian ruble was trading at about 16 to
the U.S. dollar in over-the-counter trading on the Moscow currency
exchange. The level has remained roughly the same in recent days,
but the currency is still seen as unstable.

Serbs launch strong attack as world ponders how to deal with Kosovo

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders ponder Kosovo at
the United Nations, Serb forces launched a strong attack Tuesday,
pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance
with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian extremists six months ago.
	   Another Serb police source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said government forces were meeting ``tough'' resistance from the
rebels.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flash of muzzle fire from tanks and artillery, which pounded at
least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages. The attack appeared aimed at the Cicavica mountains on
the edge of the Drenica region, a known KLA stronghold.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed at
least 16 people, including six women and two children under age 5,
had been injured so far in the ``powerful'' Serb attack against 15
villages.
	   There was no casualty report from the Serbs.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Thousands of refugees are believed to be hiding in the mountain
forests.

China insists on political negotiations at start of Taiwan talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Moments before Taiwan's main negotiator with
China began a sensitive mission Tuesday to restart talks, China
insisted the estranged rivals address the prospects for
reunification.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Shi
Hwei-yow to use his Beijing visit to prove Taiwan was committed to
reuniting with the mainland.
	   ``We hope the Taiwan side can present its sincerity, give up the
position of two Chinas and not prolong the negotiations on
procedural matters for political negotiations,'' Zhu said at a news
conference.
	   Zhu's comments _ a recitation of a position that has kept
Beijing and Taipei from talking for several years _ cast into stark
relief the conflicting goals China and Taiwan have for Shi's
mission.
	   Shi is hoping to pave the way for resuming negotiations Beijing
broke off three years ago over Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's
visit to the United States. China saw the trip as evidence Lee was
moving toward formal independence and intermittently fired missiles
and held military exercises over eight months to show its anger.
	   Taiwan wants negotiations to resume where they left off _
dealing with small confidence-building measures and procedural
issues like fishing disputes _ before tackling the more contentious
idea of reunification. But China wants direct negotiations on
political ties to halt the island's drift toward independence.
	   Before leaving Taipei Tuesday, Shi set modest goals for his one
day of talks in Beijing.
	   ``Following all the convolutions between the sides, we ought to
take precious advantage of this opportunity to restart interaction
between the sides,'' said Shi, secretary general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation, the government-backed group that handles
Taipei's relations with the mainland.
	   Shi's eight-member delegation is scheduled to meet Wednesday
with Li Yafei of China's Association for Relations Across the
Straits. The two sides will try to settle details for next month's
visit to Beijing and Shanghai by foundation chairman Koo Chen-fu.
	   China has offered little promise of substantive breakthroughs
for Koo's visit. His schedule, as released by China's state-run
media, focuses on sightseeing. For his most important meeting, with
China's chief negotiator Wang Daohan, the two are to dine and
attend a Beijing opera performance.
	   Shi said Monday his office would like to arrange more formal
discussions between the men. Shi also suggested that Koo might
discuss a summit meeting between Taiwanese President Lee and his
mainland counterpart Jiang Zemin.
	   The idea, first mooted before the break in 1995, has attracted
renewed government attention this week in Taipei.
	   Premier Vincent Siew said in a statement that if the Wang and
Koo talks go well next month and negotiations are restarted then
``this raises the possibility of high-level interaction.''
	   But Siew indicated both sides would have to be treated as
equals, something Beijing refuses to do.
	   Since Mao Tse-tung's communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists from the mainland in 1949, China has viewed the island
as a rebel province. It has suggested that under reunification,
Taiwan would have a status higher than a province, but not equal to
Beijing.

``Defense minister'' of exile Kosovo government slain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to CORRECT attribution in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Two gunmen wearing ski masks killed the
acting ``defense minister'' of the Kosovo government-in-exile as he
walked along a narrow, darkened street in the Albanian capital, the
exiles' office here announced Tuesday.
	   A statement by the self-styled consulate of the exile government
said Ahmet Krasniqi, 50, whom it described as the acting ``defense
minister'' and chief of staff, was killed about 11:25 p.m. (2125
GMT) Monday.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga confirmed the killing
and said the gunmen escaped. The motive for the killing was
unclear, he said.
	   Krasniqi, a native of Kosovo, was part of a government-in-exile
formed in the early 1990s by Ibrahim Rugova, who is trying to
negotiate self-rule for the rebellious Serbian province.
	   The Kosovo statement was the first time Krasniqi had been
publicly identified as the ``defense minister'' because of security
concerns. The exiled government is headed by a self-styled premier,
Bujar Bukoshi, and operates in Switzerland and other Western
European countries.
	   As defense minister, Krasniqi was responsible for organizing
paramilitary forces which would parallel the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part
of Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo statement described Krasniqi as ``one of the
best-trained and educated'' officers of the ethnic Albanian
resistance who had ``worked with devotion for the unity of
political sectors and military ones.''
	   In Kosovo, political analysts, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Krasniqi's death could be part of a power struggle
within Kosovo Albanian rebel ranks.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, accused the
``extended hand of the Serbian regime'' of the killing.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Tuesday his chief political rival won't be locked up
indefinitely without trial, despite the worries of the imprisoned
politician's supporters and family.
	   In his first news conference since the arrest of former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian leader also
acknowledged the turmoil has hurt his country's image.
	   ``I have become a dictator,'' the 72-year-old Mahathir said
sarcastically, but added he was not worried by the negative news
media coverage.
	   Anwar, who was arrested Sunday and taken to a secret detention
center, will be charged soon with a variety of offenses, including
sodomy, Mahathir told reporters.
	   Mahathir, Asia's longest serving leader, defended the action of
his police. ``The climax came on Sunday when he incited followers
to be violent.''
	   Anwar's followers destroyed a museum in the headquarters of the
ruling United Malays National Organization party and some marched
toward the prime minister's house saying they would burn it.
	   ``When you are dealing with an unruly mob, a certain amount of
violence has to be used,'' Mahathir said.
	   Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of
pro-democracy activists who held demonstrations Sunday and Monday.
	   The government also charged Anwar under the Internal Security
Act, a harsh law that provides for indefinite imprisonment without
formal charges or trial. The prime minister said the violence was
the reason for charging 51-year-old Anwar under the security
provisions, but promised a public trial for all alleged offenses.
	   Anwar also faces possible criminal charges for treason, misuse
of power and engaging in homosexual acts.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group
condemned the arrest and demanded that Anwar be tried in an open
court immediately.
	   The group also called on the government to respect the people's
right to peaceful assembly.
	   ``More than 50 demonstrators are reported to have been arrested
in recent days and their whereabouts and welfare remain unclear,''
an Amnesty statement said.
	   Invoking the domestic security law has caused widespread
controversy, since it basically lets Mahathir dispose of his
opponents without giving them a chance to defend themselves.
	   ``The Internal Security Act is entering a new phase as the
convenience tool used by the police to crush dissent,'' said Lim
Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party.
	   During his news conference Tuesday afternoon, Prime Minister
Mahathir firmly hit back at his increasingly vocal international
critics.
	   Mahathir condemned reactions by foreign leaders who have decried
the heavy-handed police action. One early reaction was from
Australian Prime Minister John Howard who said Malaysia was
lurching toward authoritarianism.
	   ``The prime minister is wrong, absolutely,'' Mahathir said.
	   For the first time, Mahathir also admitted that he did face a
leadership challenge from Anwar, but denied that was the reason for
the firing his deputy and ordering his arrest.
	   ``I am going to retire. I have named him successor. What was the
need for him to challenge me,'' Mahathir said.
	   He said it was the charge of sexual misconduct that prompted him
to fire Anwar.
	   ``I cannot accept a man who is a sodomist to become the leader
of this country,'' he said.

Science helps restore lost portion of Leonardo painting
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Two centuries ago, somebody sawed off a third
of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Now, using modern technology,
an expert at the National Gallery of Art has produced an image of
the original work _ it resembles the famed Mona Lisa.
	   David Alan Brown used a computer and a drawing borrowed from
Britain's Windsor Castle to help reconstruct the missing portion of
the only Leonardo painting in America.
	   Brown, the gallery's top man on Leonardo's period, is publishing
a book Tuesday called ``Leonardo da Vinci: Origins of a Genius,''
that tells how the job was done.
	   Brown doesn't know just where, when or by whom the damage was
done, but he said in an interview that the painting was probably
cut down because of fire or water damage. Someone more than 200
years ago trimmed pieces off the side and bottom of the portrait of
the 16-year-old beauty, Ginevra de' Benci.
	   Once apparently 15 inches (38 cms) wide and 22 inches (56 cms)
tall, the remaining part of the original _ on show at the National
Gallery _ measures only 15 inches (38 cms) in height by 14.5 inches
(37 cms) in width.
	   The reconstruction seeks to show how it looked when Leonardo
painted it half a millennium ago.
	   The placement of Ginevra's arms in the remaining portrait
indicates that her folded hands would have been visible so Brown
used the Windsor drawing, a sketch of hands done by Leonardo, to
help reconstruct the missing area.
	   It gives Ginevra gracefully folded arms and a sprig of three
flowers in her right hand.
	   They signify love or chastity, Brown said. Ginevra was about to
be married.
	   ``Beyond its obvious suitability for a betrothal painting,''
Brown wrote, ``holding flowers must have had a personal meaning for
Leonardo, who returned to it again and again in his early works.''
	   The computer work was done on a Macintosh using software that
permitted layering of images, so they could be manipulated by trial
and error. An infrared thermal imaging camera also helped, as did a
live model apparently Ginevra's size.
	   ``We used the computer like a brush,'' said Brown, who is making
a film on the project that should be ready by next year.
	   Brown suggested that many other altered paintings could be
examined by using his new techniques, including at least one other
piece in the gallery's collection.
	   ``There's the 'Feast of the Gods,' by (Giovanni) Bellini and
Titian,'' he said. ``A bit of landscape is left in one corner,
after Titian worked over it. We'd like to see the rest of the
landscape, what the picture looked like originally.''

Ukrainian police detain suspect in killing of American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police have detained a third
suspect in the robbery and killing of an American Peace Corps
volunteer from California, newspapers said Tuesday.
	   Victor Verloo, 64, of Sacramento, was stabbed to death during an
apparent robbery at his home in the northern Ukrainian town of
Chernihiv on Sept. 14.
	   Police quickly arrested two women suspected of being linked to
the crime and arrested their main suspect Sunday in the town of
Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.
	   The suspect was identified only as Volodymyr M., age 33,
according to investigators. He was freed this spring after serving
10 years in prison for robbery, theft and extortion, officials
said, according to the daily Dyen.
	   According to investigators, the three suspects first tried to
rob Verloo and his companion on their way home. When they found
that the American was not carrying any valuables, they demanded a
key to his apartment, the report said.
	   Verloo was stabbed in the chest and the robbers stole a
computer, a telephone and an audio player from the apartment. The
newspaper Segodnya said a neighbor notified police when she saw the
masked attacker running away from the scene.
	   Peace Corps officials said Verloo, a native of Belgium, worked
for the California Department of Transportation before arriving in
the former Soviet republic in February. He was sworn in as a
volunteer in April and worked as a business development adviser in
Chernihiv.

Bombing suspect to be held in Germany until U.S. extradition

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A suspect arrested in Germany in
connection with last month's U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa will
be held in Munich until he can be extradited to the United States,
according to a court warrant issued Tuesday.
	   The United States has 40 days to complete extradition
proceedings for the suspect, whom German officials identified as
Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim. The German Justice Ministry must approve the
extradition.
	   Salim was arrested Wednesday at a car dealership near Munich on
a tip from Interpol in Washington. He arrived in Munich from Sudan,
according to Bavaria state officials.
	   Salim is suspected of being an accomplice to Osama bin Laden,
the millionaire Saudi dissident wanted by the United States for
alleged involvement in the bombings in Nairobi and Tanzania that
killed 259 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured more than
5,000.

Amnesty International condemns Cambodian violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The human rights group Amnesty
International on Tuesday called on countries concerned about
Cambodia's political crisis to pressure its government to end
violence and intimidation directed against the opposition.
	   The London-based organization urged the ``Friends of Cambodia''
_ a grouping of foreign governments formed to help restore
stability after a coup d'etat last year _ to use its influence to
ease repressive measures, including a ban on foreign travel by
opposition members of parliament.
	   Foreign ministers from the group are meeting this week at the
U.N. General Assembly session in New York.
	   The appeal came two weeks after the Cambodian government ordered
police to break up street rallies protesting alleged ballot fraud
by strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party during the
July election.
	   At least four protesters were killed and dozens more injured and
arrested during the crackdown. United Nations human rights
investigators have discovered 21 corpses, many with signs of
torture, in its aftermath, prompting speculation that the death
tally could be higher.
	   Amnesty called on the Cambodian authorities to publicly account
for all opposition activists who have been arrested and to release
anyone who has been detained for participating in ``peaceful
political activities.''
	   ``These latest human rights violations are the consequence of
near-total impunity for authorities who abuse their power,
reinforced by the complicit silence of the international
community,'' Amnesty International said in a statement received by
e-mail.
	   Amnesty also urged the opposition, led by Ranariddh and former
finance minister Sam Rainsy, to refrain from using anti-Vietnamese
rhetoric in speeches. As many as five ethnic Vietnamese were
recently killed in Phnom Penh by angry mobs after a poisoning
scare.
	   ``We regret the inflammatory rhetoric that opposition figures
have used against Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese minority, and
condemn recent racist attacks,'' Amnesty said. ``But these do not
excuse a more generalized crackdown on legitimate and peaceful
protest and expressions of public discontent.''
	   The government responded over the weekend to the U.N.'s
discovery of bodies with a report from its own recently-created
``Cambodian Human Rights Committee'' summarizing its investigations
into six bodies found between Sept. 1 and Sept. 18.
	   Suggesting that at least some of the murders were the result of
common crimes, the government reported that one murder appeared to
be the result of an extramarital affair, another was related to a
theft of bananas and that the other four were still under
investigation.
	   Several of the bodies, the government's report noted, were found
with their hands bound behind their backs or shot at close range,
but no link was made to the crackdown on the street demonstrations.

Fires in Far East kill one, threaten villages and ammunition depot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires have killed at least one person on
Russia's Sakhalin Island in the Far East, and were threatening to
engulf a number of villages as well as an ammunition dump, a news
agency said Tuesday.
	   The remains of a woman were found in the Gorky township, which
burned down Sunday night and left some 700 people homeless, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   There were conflicting reports about two people earlier believed
missing. One Russian media report said the pair had been located
and were not injured, while another said they still hadn't been
found.
	   Meanwhile, fires were threatening an ammunition dump near the
Pobedino settlement on the island, a spokesman at the Sakhalin
firefighting headquarters told ITAR-Tass. Servicemen were removing
the artillery shells, the spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, separate fires were drawing closer to seven villages
on the island. Regional officials have dispatched firefighters to
stop the blaze, but smoke clouds five kilometers (three miles) high
were keeping airplanes from monitoring the fires.
	   Truck convoys with food, tents, field kitchens, and warm
clothing were headed to the region.
	   Regional authorities have asked for 10 million rubles in federal
aid for the firefighters to battle blazes that have now consumed
over 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of forest and 52 kilometers (30
miles) of power cables, ITAR-Tass said.

Hungarians are parasites, nationalists say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Representatives of the Slovak
National Party called the Hungarian minority ``parasites'' and said
Tuesday they will try to prevent them from joining the future
government.
	   Jan Slota, leader of the Slovak National Party, said the largest
opposition group, the Slovak Democratic Coalition, had no objection
to including the Hungarian party in the government if the
opposition manages to oust Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in this
week's elections.
	   Slota, the most nationalistic of the six political parties
expected to gain seats in parliament, said offering Cabinet posts
to the Hungarians would be unthinkable.
	   ``God protect us,'' Slota added.
	   The Party of Hungarian Coalition reacted calmly to Slota's
denunciation. the party leader, Bela Bugar said simply that ``God
will protect us''.
	   Democratic Coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda scoffed that every
country has ``extremists and empty brains.'' He said Slota's party
does not have a ``great influence on Slovak politics.''
	   The Slovak National Party has been part of Meciar's ruling
coalition for the past four years. Slota said he did not agree with
Meciar on all issues but ``someone has to rule in the country.'' He
said his party was willing to join Meciar in another coalition
after the Friday-Saturday balloting.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders ponder Kosovo at
the United Nations, Serb forces launched a strong attack Tuesday,
pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance
with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian extremists six months ago.
	   Another Serb police source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said government forces were meeting ``tough'' resistance from the
rebels.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flash of muzzle fire from tanks and artillery, which pounded at
least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages. The attack appeared aimed at the Cicavica mountains on
the edge of the Drenica region, a known KLA stronghold.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed at
least 16 people, including six women and two children under age 5,
had been injured so far in the ``powerful'' Serb attack against 15
villages.
	   There was no casualty report from the Serbs.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Thousands of refugees are believed to be hiding in the mountain
forests.

Four U.N. observers attacked in breakaway Georgian region

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on four United
Nations workers in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, seriously
wounding one, the press secretary to Abkhazia's leader said
Tuesday.
	   The U.N. military observers were attacked Monday night in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, said Astamur Taniya, press secretary
to Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba.
	   One worker was seriously wounded, and was taken to Turkey for
surgery, Taniya said. No other details were available, and the four
observers were not identified.
	   Russia denounced the attack Tuesday, saying it ``proves a
pressing need for resolute action on the part of the Georgian and
Abkhazian authorities to normalize the situation,'' the Interfax
news agency reported, citing an unnamed source in Russia's Foreign
Ministry.
	   The United Nations keeps a group of military observers in
Georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and
separatists in Abkhazia.
	   A U.N. worker from Poland, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, was shot
and killed in July outside her apartment in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
	   Meanwhile, Georgian and Abkhazian leaders began talks Tuesday in
Tbilisi, but expressly avoided political debate. The two sides
discussed restoring the region's railroads and energy system,
including a natural gas pipeline, said Sergei Bagapsh, who led the
Abkhazian delegation.
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia became an independent state in the wake of
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 war,
driving out Georgian soldiers and ethnic Georgians. Violence has
broken out periodically since then despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the region.

ECB chief rejects coordinated rate cut with US, sees lower European
</HEADLINE>
growth
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg on Tuesday warned that the international financial
turmoil may dampen growth in Europe, but he rejected calls for
globally coordinated interest rate cuts.
	   ``There is no room for, or need for coordinated cuts in interest
rates,'' Duisenberg told the monetary affairs subcommittee of the
European Parliament.
	   He added that interest rates in Europe's core economies such as
France and Germany were already ``significantly'' lower than in the
United States.
	   However, Duisenberg stressed that preparations for the launch of
the European single currency on Jan. 1 meant Spain, Italy, Ireland
and Portugal needed to start lowering rates over the next 100 days
to bring them into line with the other nations that adopt the euro.
	   ``On Jan. 4, the first working day of Euroland, the short-term
interest rates must be equal,'' Duisenberg said. ``A gradual
process will be preferable to a huge fall on one day.''
	   Most of the euro nations have official short-term rates around
3.5 percent, but they are higher in Portugal, Spain, Italy and
Ireland, which has the highest at 6.75 percent. When the euro
becomes reality the ECB will set a common rate for all
participating nations.
	   Duisenberg said economic growth in the European Union next year
would likely be ``some decimal points lower'' than the 3 percent
that had been predicted, but he said the impact of the crises in
Asia and Russia should not be overestimated.
	   ``Don't panic, stay calm,'' he insisted. ``We do not as yet
scale down our growth expectations to a significant extent ...
There will be growth. Europe is strong.''
	   Talk of coordinated global interest rate cuts was generated by a
statement last week by finance ministers and central bankers from
the G-7 group of leading economic powers saying they were in favor
of measures to sustain world growth.
	   But Duisenberg joined other central bankers who have said there
was no need for a coordinated rate cut.
	   ``We do not think that it's pressing to lower interest rates in
a coordinated way with whomever, especially if they have
significantly higher interest rates than we do,'' he said.
	   ``Interest rates cannot solve the whole problem.''
	   Duisenberg was grilled for two hours by members of the EU's
assembly during his first report to them since his appointment in
May as head of the Frankfurt-based bank that will run monetary
policy for the 11 nations that adopt the euro on New Year's Day.

Syria condemn's Turkey's `occupation' of part of Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria strongly criticized the Turkish
presence in northern Iraq on Tuesday, saying it was aimed at
``changing the Arab identity there.''
	   Turkey is believed to maintain several thousand troops in
northern Iraq to prevent insurgents from crossing into its
territory. But it refuses to confirm that the force is permanent,
saying only that troops cross into Iraq whenever necessary.
	   Syria's long-strained relations with Turkey have deteriorated
recently over disagreements in sharing the waters of the Euphrates
River, which passes through both countries, and improving ties
between Turkey and Israel, Syria's biggest foe.
	   Syria's Tishrin newspaper, which speaks for the government,
suggested Iraq's presence in northern Turkey was permanent. Turkey
is fighting an insurgency by Kurds seeking autonomy in southeastern
Turkey, and the rebels have sometimes taken refuge in northern
Iraq.
	   ``Foremost of these ambitions is occupying northern Iraq and
changing the Arab identity there,'' the newspaper said.
	   Most of northern Iraq is under the control of Iraqi Kurdish
groups. The groups received Western protection following their
defeat by the Iraqi government in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.

Philippine stocks fall on weak peso, Philippine Airlines closure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were pushed sharply
lower by concerns over a weak peso and the scheduled closure of the
nation's flag carrier, Philippine Airlines, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 40.96 points,
or 3.5 percent, to 1,123.30, adding to a 10.35-point loss on
Monday.
	   Declines outpaced gaines 67 to 21, while 38 issues were
unchanged.
	   The scheduled closure Wednesday of Philippine Airlines continued
to cast a long shadow on the market.
	   Dealers warned that the airline's shutdown, largely due to its
inability to service dlrs 2.1 billion in debts, would deal a severe
blow to the economy.
	   Philippine Long Distance shares were the most actively traded
Tuesday, accounting for around 69 percent of total volume. They
closed 11 percent lower at 770 pesos (dlrs 17.34).
	   Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said PLDT
shares lost steam on profit-taking following huge gains last week.
	   He said the market now has lost all motivation for a fresh rally
because of the confluence of negative factors.
	   The peso's poor performance against the dollar also contributed
to the market's fall, Kane said.
	   The peso was dragged lower by the weaker Japanese yen and the
economic implications of PAL's closure, dealers said.
	   Currency dealers are concerned that the airline's closure might
trigger a sharp rise in demand for U.S. dollars if the airline
liquidates its assets to pay off its debts.
	   The dollar averaged 44.395 pesos for the day, up from Monday's
44.154 pesos. It was last dealt at 44.375 pesos.
	   The dollar hit an intraday high of 44.60 pesos, but selling
pressure immediately brought it down, dealers said.
	   Some currency dealers said the central bank may have helped ease
the pressure on the peso by selling dollars through some banks.
	   The central bank's overnight interest rates _ its primary weapon
to quell currency speculation _ have remained unchanged despite the
dollar's ascent above the 44-peso level.

	   ROME (AP) _ The World Food Program said Tuesday it will continue
delivering emergency food aid to thousands of people forced to
abandon their homes in Guinea Bissau following an armed rebellion
by a faction of the military.
	   The Rome-based U.N. agency said it planned to distribute some
30,000 tons of food to 350,000 people over the next four months.
Since fighting broke out in June, WFP has already provided the West
African nation with 4,500 tons.
	   ''In the absence of a peace agreement between the warring
parties, the economy is caving in and families are finding it
difficult to survive,'' said Oscar Sarroca, chief of the WFP's
Sahel section.
	   Fighting in the former Portuguese colony erupted June 7 when a
breakaway military faction led by former armed forces chief Brig.
Ansumane Mane seized a Bissau military base and the international
airport.

Telecom withdraws wage cut plan

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Bowing to public pressure, Hongkong
Telecommunications Ltd. agreed Tuesday to withdraw across-the-board
wage cuts that were to have gone into effect in November.
	   Frances Chiu, a company spokeswoman, said Hongkong Telecom
``would still consider staff cuts or pay cuts'' in further
negotiations on cost-cutting measures with union leaders.
	   A company statement said the the decision to lift the Nov. 1
deadline for the pay cuts was ``to demonstrate sincerity.''
	   Terry Ip, chairman of one of the company's staff unions, said
union officials ``cautiously welcomed'' the decision and would hold
talks with the management on Wednesday.
	   Ip said workers would work with the company so it ``could make
more profits, and there won't be any more staff cuts or wage
cuts.''
	   The company, one of Hong Kong's largest private employers with
13,800 workers, announced last Thursday employees must accept a
10-percent pay cut starting Nov. 1 or face dismissal.
	   The decision fueled public outrage. Unions and workers fear
smaller companies would follow Hongkong Telecom's lead to cut wages
at a time when unemployment stands at a 15-year high of 5 percent.
	   Hongkong Telecom's decision was welcomed by unionists and
lawmakers, although some say they worry the company would start
cutting staff.
	   Earlier Tuesday, a group of lawmakers who also are officials of
the Federation of Trade Unions, Hong Kong's largest, met with
company executives and demanded the pay cuts be scrapped.
	   Lawmaker Tam Yiu-chung, also a top adviser to the territory's
chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, said company executives admitted
they had made a mistake, government-owned Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   On Monday, about 1,500 Hongkong Telecom employees staged a
sit-in protest outside the company's headquarters.
	   Hongkong Telecom has laid off 270 managers so far this year, and
the company's chief executive, Linus Cheung, had said he could not
rule out further layoffs unless workers accept the wage cuts.

Vietnam Communist Party publishes its history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Communist Party of Vietnam, whose
inner workings have long been shrouded in secrecy, began publishing
more than 40 volumes of documents Tuesday on its history since
1924.
	   While historians laud the news, some also said they expected
that many major questions about Vietnam's modern history will still
remain a mystery.
	   The documents, which include Communist Party resolutions and
important speeches, will be published in entirety over the next two
years. Much of it has been published before, but some material will
be new.
	   ``Forty volumes means a very substantial declassification,''
said historian Carl Thayer, a professor at Australian National
Defense Academy and expert on Vietnam. ``This will be fantastic
news for the scholarly community.''
	   The first book, which is more than 600 pages, starts with the
address of Nguyen Ai Quoc _ Ho Chi Minh's birth name _ at the 5th
Congress of the Communist International held in Moscow in 1924.
	   Ho Chi Minh, who die din 1969, led the struggle for Vietnamese
independence.
	   Documents on the founding of the party, the beginnings of the
liberation struggle and Vietnam's war with the United States will
be released later.
	   What is likely to remain unanswered are questions about the
personal lives of Communist leaders _ Hanoi still denies that Ho
Chi Minh was married _ China's aid to Vietnam during the war, as
well as details about infighting in the party.
	   Indeed, as an essay in the introduction to the first volume
says, the publication of the documents is intended as propaganda
which will educate party members and younger cadres about the
party's policies and ``refute the distorted and slanderous
documents of the hostile forces and bad elements.''
	   ``The complete set of books with its authentic historical
documents will help to educate and train party members and people
of its tradition,'' said Pham Xuan Sung, deputy director of the
government-owned Truth Publishing House which published the books.
	   The first batch of 8,000 copies will be on sale in the next few
days, Sung said, adding it will also be sold overseas if there is a
demand.
	   The Truth publishing house is subsidizing the books and will
sell them for about dlrs 1.50 per volume.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges' 110 mph (177
kph) winds plowed a destructive path across Puerto Rico and the
northeast Caribbean, spawning tornados, turning trees into missiles
and killing at least four people.
	   Georges' powerful thunderstorms flooded hotels and exploded shop
and car windows Monday, flipped small airplanes, whisked away
satellite dishes and forced many thousands into shelters. Hundreds
of thousands were without water or power.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-struck eastern resort town of Fajardo, where dozens of homes
lost roofs. The storm prevented rescuers from immediately
responding to calls for help, and the upscale Conquistador Resort
which overlooks the sea in Fajardo sustained extensive damage.
	   More than 80 percent of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people lost
electricity and more than 70 percent had no water, the government
said. Countless roads and highways were choked by fallen trees and
poles, dangling power lines, antennas, awnings, tin roofs and other
debris. The storm denuded many lush mountain areas and made others
inaccessible due to flooding.
	   Police took to the streets of San Juan in force to find the
hardest-hit areas and deter looting of damaged stores and
businesses. Gov. Pedro Rossello met with federal officials Tuesday
to plan a disaster response.
	   With island residents facing the sobering task of recovery
Tuesday, President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal
recovery aid.
	   Scores of federal and Red Cross officials mobilized to assess
damage, expected to soar well into the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
	   Georges headed for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where many
of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing that
could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), Georges' center was about 90 miles
(145 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas and
the Turks and Caicos islands and a hurricane watch was in effect in
eastern Cuba. Concern was growing even in Florida, where workers
put shutters over the windows at Key West City Hall.
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   One death was reported in St. Kitts, where 70 percent of homes
were damaged, as were the hospital, airport and police station. A
curfew was in effect there to prevent looting, said government
spokesman Erasmus Williams.
	   ``We would definitely appreciate assistance,'' Williams said.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross planned recovery efforts in the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Both territories activated National
Guard troops to help.
	   More than 20,000 people huddled in shelters in San Juan,
Arecibo, Mayaguez and other Puerto Rican cities, and officials said
the figure could rise to 50,000.
	   Hospitals in several cities reported moderate damage, and three
private planes were damaged at San Juan's international airport.
	   Moving westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges spawned
tornados in the central town of Barranquitas and the eastern island
of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kilometers) were reported
in the interior mountains, where damage reports were sketchy.
	   Georges also caused extensive property damage in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Antigua and other smaller Caribbean islands.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to a third of their
height, shoved a 50-foot (15-meter) sailboat ashore and destroyed
part of the boardwalk.
	   In Antigua, the storm split open government-built homes and
ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and wrapped
them around trees. ``Me house gone. Hurricane mash up my life,''
said Verna McHenry as she surveyed the remains of her home near
Bolans.
	   On the French island of Guadeloupe, a man who tried to take
advantage of the storm to escape from jail was shot and killed by
guards. France sent a team of 170 civil defense workers to help
recovery efforts on the island, where 16,000 people lacked power.
	   Police stations lost communications in southern Puerto Rico,
where Ponce Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago reported heavy damage.
Searchers braved the storm's driving winds and rain to rescue an
unknown number of people from flooded homes, he said.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops rumbled into this
tiny mountain kingdom at dawn Tuesday to quell weeks of anarchy and
the military said they took control of military bases and downtown
and residential areas.
	   At least three South African soldiers were killed and 11
wounded, not seriously, the military said in Pretoria.
	   Protesters firebombed government buildings, looters rampaged
through downtown and cars with South African license plates were
being stoned in the wake of the intervention.
	   Whole shopping centers were gutted by fire, and smoke drifted
from many parts of the capital city just inside the border with
South Africa.
	   The action, post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention, follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom of 2 million people, is
surrounded by South African territory and dependent on its
neighbor's economy.
	   Despite South African government reports that the situation was
stabilizing, a major firefight raged at an army barracks at 1:30
p.m. (1130 gmt). South African and Lesotho troops traded automatic
rifle fire, and mortar explosions were heared. Fifteen armored
vehicles equipped with cannons came to reinforce the South
Africans.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria will ask the European Union to
provide additional funds for humanitarian aid to Kosovo during a
ministerial meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels, the Austria
Press Agency reported Tuesday.
	   APA said Austrian Interior Minister Karl Schloegl would make the
proposal Thursday at a meeting of EU justice and interior ministry
officials.
	   Schloegl will propose that the EU's humanitarian office make
additional funds available for Kosovo Albanian refugees still in
Yugoslavia and consider trying to open an office in the Kosovo
capital Pristina to help coordinate the movement of displaced
people to asylum in Western Europe.

U.S. gives Ethiopia dlrs 10 million for displaced people

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The United States is to give
Ethiopia dlrs 10 million to buy food and blankets for 211,000
people forced to flee their homes by a short border war with
Eritrea, it was reported Tuesday.
	   The agreement for the grant was signed Monday by the U.S.
Ambassador David Shinn and Simon Mechale, head of the state
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, the Ethiopian News
Agency said.
	   According to the agreement, the money will be used to buy 16,000
metric tons of food for six months and 36,000 blankets for the
people in northwestern Ethiopia.
	   The supplies will be distributed by the Relief Society of
Tigray, a private organization in Tigray region, which borders
Eritrea.
	   A border dispute between the two countries erupted into armed
clashes in June. Each side has accused the other of trespassing.
	   Attempts by the U.S. and African leaders to broker peace have
failed, though fighting has subsided with the rainy season.
	   Simon said the United States is the first country to respond to
Ethiopia's June appeal to donors for help.
	   ``The U.S. government which has always stood side by side with
the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission has always
responded quickly for emergency assistance to the Ethiopian
people,'' Simon said.
	   Shinn said Washington hopes the conflict betweem Ethiopia and
Eritrea would be resolved peacefully, the news agency said.
	   A team of U.S. officials led by Anthony Lake, a former national
securiry advisor, is scheduled to visit Ethiopia and Eritrea later
this week to try and resolve the dispute.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa nations had been deteriorating since last year.

Son that parents thought dead, returns home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ His parents thought he'd drowned in
the River Danube. Seven weeks after they identified what they
thought was their 12-year-old son's corpse, he returned home, a
policeman said Tuesday.
	   Valentin Stoian's aunt thought she'd seen a ghost when she
spotted the boy munching grapes in the family's vineyard last week,
daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.
	   Stoian's family were in the middle of an Orthodox feast that
marks a period, in weeks or years, from the day when a relative
dies.
	   Overjoyed, the family informed the police in the village of
Vladuleni in southern Romania that their son was alive, said
warrant officer Liviu Fotescu by telephone.
	   The corpse the family identified at the beginning of August is
believed to belong to an unidentified Bulgarian boy, the paper
said.
	   There were no details available of where Stoian went and what he
did during his one-year absence. One bit of bad news is that he
can't register for school because he's officially dead.

Philippine Airlines
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with PAL chairman crying in farewell meeting with
airline executives in 11th-12th grafs; TRIMS

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a last-ditch attempt to keep
ailing Philippine Airlines from closing, government labor officials
went directly to its workers Tuesday to ask if they will support a
rescue plan proposed by the company's management.
	   Union leaders have rejected the plan, which PAL says is needed
for it to recover from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's
currency crisis.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said union leaders have
pledged to abide by the outcome of the workers' referendum, to be
known later Tuesday.
	   The airline announced last week it will close at midnight
Wednesday because of the plan's rejection by the union leaders.
	   With results of the government-sponsored referendum still to be
counted, PAL workers in the central city of Iloilo said an informal
poll showed about 90 percent of local staffers support the plan.
	   ``We have no other choice,'' said Fernando Bermejo, a PAL clerk.
``We have to earn a living, we don't want to lose our jobs.''
	   In the rescue plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan has offered workers
20 percent of the air carrier's stock and three seats on its board
in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent.
	   In a meeting Monday night aimed at averting PAL's closure,
President Joseph Estrada also offered workers one of the
government's four board seats, but union leaders continued to
reject the plan.
	   Union leaders say a suspension of the collective bargaining
agreement would be a surrender of their labor rights and expose
them to management abuses.
	   PAL officials say Tan has resigned himself to the likelihood of
the airline's closure.
	   In a meeting with PAL senior executives on Monday, he cried as
he bid them goodbye, a participant said.
	   When the company announced the closure to employees, many also
broke into tears. Some workers are holding daily prayer vigils in
hopes the airline will not shut down.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been operating for 57 years. Its
closure would leave many areas of the sprawling archipelago of
7,000 islands without air service.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   In many cases, the only alternative for travel among the
country's islands is slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries.
Forty-three people are known to have died after a ferry sank south
of Manila during a storm Friday.
	   PAL also has been hurt by Asia's currency crisis, which hit just
as the airline was launching an ambitious dlrs 4 billion plan to
expand and update its fleet.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said creditors, to
whom PAL owes about dlrs 2.1 billion, are insisting on guarantees
of labor harmony before they approve a restructuring plan.
	   Even if workers approve the rescue plan in the referendum, PAL
will have to temporarily close for up to a month to make
adjustments, Zapanta told The Associated Press.
	   ``We've canceled tickets and flights and given away our
passengers,'' he said. ``It'll take time for people to ponder
whether we're really serious in opening again. We might have truly
damaged our image.''
	   PAL currently is operating about 30 domestic and 14
international flights a day with 20 aircraft, down from its
pre-strike 54 planes. Its last flight is scheduled to leave from
Manila for San Francisco and Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
	   ``This last one is painful,'' Zapanta said.

Safety concerns hinder U.N. efforts to rescue Angolan peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMRIO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts to halt the collapse of
Angola's four-year-old peace pact are being thwarted by the
government's inability to guarantee the safe movement of
international mediators, the United Nations office here said
Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special envoy Issa Diallo is seeking to meet with Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of the former rebel group UNITA, at the central
highland town where he lives ``in a bid to put the peace process
back on track,'' the U.N. said in a written statement.
	   But Diallo has not been able to move from the capital because
the government says it cannot guarantee his safety, according to
the statement.
	   The announcement came amid unconfirmed reports of fighting
between the government and former rebels in remote areas of the
vast southwest African country _ the latest sign that the
U.N.-mediated 1994 peace pact, which ended a two-decade civil war,
is unraveling.
	   Citing unidentified military sources, Angolan media reported
clashes between the former foes in the Lunda Norte and Malanje
provinces, several hundred kilometers (miles) east of the capital.
No details were given.
	   The government has accused UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of failing to
comply with the peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four central
highland strongholds in contravention of the peace accord, bringing
U.N. sanctions against it.
	   The governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or
MPLA, has expelled UNITA officials from the national unity
government and has said it will no longer negotiate with Savimbi.
	   The MPLA said it would deal only with a group of UNITA
dissidents who have broken with Savimbi and set up a rival
leadership in the capital Luanda. The dissidents accuse Savimbi of
not wanting peace.
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted that Savimbi remains in
the peace process, and Diallo aims to repair the deepening rift
between the rebel chief and his longtime rival President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos.

EU economy slows 0.2 percent in second quarter of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Gross domestic product in the 15-nation
European Union grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
slowing from a first-quarter pace of 0.6 percent, the EU's
statistical office Eurostat announced Tuesday.
	   The GDP in the 11 countries taking part in the launching of the
single currency, the euro on Jan. 1, grew by 0.1 percent over the
same period, according to Eurostat's first estimates.
	   No figures were given for individual EU countries.
	   Compared with the same period last year, GDP in the 15 EU

ECB chief rejects coordinated rate cut with US, sees lower European
</HEADLINE>
growth
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg on Tuesday warned that the international financial
turmoil may dampen growth in Europe, but he rejected calls for
globally coordinated interest rate cuts.
	   ``There is no room for, or need for coordinated cuts in interest
rates,'' Duisenberg told the monetary affairs subcommittee of the
European Parliament.
	   He added that interest rates in Europe's core economies such as
France and Germany were already ``significantly'' lower than in the
United States.
	   However, Duisenberg stressed that preparations for the launch of
the European single currency on Jan. 1 meant Spain, Italy, Ireland
and Portugal needed to start lowering rates over the next 100 days
to bring them into line with the other nations that adopt the euro.
	   ``On Jan. 4, the first working day of Euroland, the short-term
interest rates must be equal,'' Duisenberg said. ``A gradual
process will be preferable to a huge fall on one day.''
	   Most of the euro nations have official short-term rates around
3.5 percent, but they are higher in Portugal, Spain, Italy and
Ireland, which has the highest at 6.75 percent. When the euro
becomes reality the ECB will set a common rate for all
participating nations.
	   Duisenberg said economic growth in the European Union next year
would likely be ``some decimal points lower'' than the 3 percent
that had been predicted, but he said the impact of the crises in
Asia and Russia should not be overestimated.
	   ``Don't panic, stay calm,'' he insisted. ``We do not as yet
scale down our growth expectations to a significant extent ...
There will be growth. Europe is strong.''
	   Talk of coordinated global interest rate cuts was generated by a
statement last week by finance ministers and central bankers from
the G-7 group of leading economic powers saying they were in favor
of measures to sustain world growth.
	   But Duisenberg joined other central bankers who have said there
was no need for a coordinated rate cut.
	   ``We do not think that it's pressing to lower interest rates in
a coordinated way with whomever, especially if they have
significantly higher interest rates than we do,'' he said.
	   ``Interest rates cannot solve the whole problem.''
	   Duisenberg was grilled for two hours by members of the EU's
assembly during his first report to them since his appointment in
May as head of the Frankfurt-based bank that will run monetary
policy for the 11 nations that adopt the euro on New Year's Day.

Russia imports down 19 percent in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia imported 19 percent less in August than it
did during the same month a year ago, a dramatic drop that
reflecting the impact of the country's economic crisis, a news
agency said Tuesday.
	   Russia bought dlrs 3.6 billion in goods from abroad, almost half
of which were machines and equipment, the Interfax news agency
said, citing the press service of the State Customs Committee.
Other major imports included food and chemicals, Interfax said.
	   About 25 percent of the imports came from the former Soviet
republics, the report said.
	   The report did not give a reason for the drop, but according to
port officials in St. Petersburg and elsewhere, Russia has
experienced a sharp decline in imports since financial crisis
struck August 17.
	   With the ruble losing value during the crisis, the price of many
imports has more than doubled.

Chernomyrdin declines to run for parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
on Tuesday reversed an earlier announcement and said he would not
run for parliament. But he still plans to take part in presidential
race in 2000.
	   Chernomyrdin served as prime minister for more than five years
until President Boris Yeltsin abruptly ousted him in March. Yeltsin
reappointed Chernomyrdin last month, but the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, rejected him twice, prompting the president
to drop Chernomyrdin in favor of Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Chernomyrdin said he decided against running for parliament
because he wouldn't be able to work with his foes in parliament's
lower house, the State Duma.
	   ``I don't want to give the opposition a pretext to shake the
boat again,'' he said on Russian television. ``After all that
happened, we would hardly be able to cooperate constructively with
leaders of certain Duma factions.''
	   Chernomyrdin was expected to run for a Duma seat in the Arctic
Yamalo-Nenets region, a stronghold of Russia's natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, which he headed before becoming premier.
	   Earlier this month, Chernomyrdin reasserted his plans to run for
president in the year 2000. Yeltsin said he viewed Chernomyrdin as
his successor in the next election.
	   Most analysts agree, however, that without the prime minister's
clout, Chernomyrdin has little chance of winning the race.
	   Other likely presidential candidates include Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, former security chief turned provincial governor
Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and liberal lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky.

Jordanian prince on horseback meets with visa hurdle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Jordan's Prince Ali has threatened to call
off an expedition on horseback promoting the heritage of the people
of the Caucasus mountains, to protest against Russia's refusal to
grant him a visa, a report said Tuesday.
	   Russia refused the prince entry on grounds that it could not
guarantee his protection if he crosses the volatile Caucasus region
on horseback, the Caucasus Association said in a statement. He
would, however, be allowed to fly to region.
	   ``If Russia does not allow us to continue on horseback, we will
return,'' the association quoted the 23-year old prince as saying.
	   The prince is leading a group of Circassians on horseback
through Syria, Turkey, the Caucasus mountains and Russia to pay
tribute to a minority that has been loyal to Jordan's royal family.
	   Riding a gray horse, he reached Turkey's Black Sea port city of
Samsun Tuesday. He was expected to lead the trek to Trabzon, some
340 kilometers (200 miles) east along the Black Sea coast, where
they planned to take a ferry to the Caucasus region Wednesday.
	   Russian embassy officials were not available for comment.
	   The Circassians lived between the Black Sea, the Kuban River and
the Caucasus in what is now southwestern Russia. They fought the
czar in the 19th century Russo-Turkish war.
	   About 400,000 fled to Turkey and later came to Jordan and Syria
after Russia conquered their homeland. Today, more than 4 million
Circassians live outside the Caucasus, mostly in Turkey.

Dispute over Norwegian aid to Russia settled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A border dispute over humanitarian aid to a
northern Russian region has been settled and food, medicine and
clothing has been delivered, a Russian customs official said
Tuesday.
	   Sergei Oleinik, a spokesman for the State Customs Committee,
told the Interfax news agency that the aid had been held up for
three hours Sunday at Murmansk because Norwegian charity workers
did not inform Russian officials that the aid was on its way.
	   ``The Norwegian side, probably due to haste, forgot to warn the
administration of the town of Olenegorsk about the aid and the
administration did not send its applications to the checkpoint,''
he said.
	   Oleinik said it was not the first time Norwegian charity groups
have ignored customs procedures to the region that has been hard
hit by the country's economic crisis.
	   ``Charity institutions in that Scandinavian country year after
year stubbornly refuse to follow the instructions of Russian
customs,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Norwegian charitable organizations plan to deliver humanitarian
aid worth about dlrs 500,000 in the near future, Interfax said.

Safety concerns hinder U.N. efforts to rescue Angolan peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMRIO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts to halt the collapse of
Angola's four-year-old peace pact are being thwarted by the
government's inability to guarantee the safe movement of
international mediators, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special envoy Issa Diallo is seeking to meet with Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of the former rebel group UNITA, at the central
highland town where he lives ``in a bid to put the peace process
back on track,'' the U.N. said in a written statement.
	   But Diallo has not been able to move from the capital because
the government says it cannot guarantee his safety, according to
the statement.
	   The announcement came amid unconfirmed reports of fighting
between the government and former rebels in remote areas of the
vast southwest African country _ the latest sign that the
U.N.-mediated 1994 peace pact, which ended a two-decade civil war,
is unraveling.
	   Citing unidentified military sources, Angolan media reported
clashes between the former foes in the Lunda Norte and Malanje
provinces, several hundred kilometers (miles) east of the capital.
No details were given.
	   The government has accused UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of failing to
comply with the peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four central
highland strongholds in contravention of the peace accord, bringing
U.N. sanctions against it.
	   The governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or
MPLA, has expelled UNITA officials from the national unity
government and has said it will no longer negotiate with Savimbi.
	   The MPLA said it would deal only with a group of UNITA
dissidents who have broken with Savimbi and set up a rival
leadership in the capital Luanda. The dissidents accuse Savimbi of
not wanting peace.
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted that Savimbi remains in
the peace process, and Diallo aims to repair the deepening rift
between the rebel chief and his longtime rival President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos.

China says President Jiang not snubbing France's Jospin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Turning aside suggestions his country was
delivering a diplomatic slap in the face to the French prime
minister, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that
Paris had agreed to the unusual rural location for an upcoming
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will hold talks with Premier Zhu
Rongji in Beijing on Thursday. But for the usual courtesy call on
the Chinese president, Jospin will travel Friday to Hefei city in
Anhui province, where Jiang will be inspecting rebuilding from
summer flooding.
	   The South China Morning Post, an influential Hong Kong
newspaper, on Monday quoted an unidentified French analyst as
saying Jospin was being made to pay for France's sale of Mirage
fighter jets to rival Taiwan in 1992. Jospin was secretary-general
of the French Socialist Party, which was in power at the time.
	   But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said both
sides had a hand in chosing the location.
	   ``We have exchanged views with the French side on the itinerary
of the prime minister's visit to China. It has been decided by both
sides,'' Zhu said.
	   ``We hope the visit of Prime Minister Jospin to China can
strengthen the consultation and cooperation between the two
countries in various fields and promote the overall development of
bilateral relations,'' he added.
	   Relations between China and France have improved steadily since
the row over Taiwan six years ago, helped along by high-level
exchanges and a willingness to put trade ties ahead of human rights
concerns.
	   The Paris-based press freedom group Reporters without Borders
and New York-based Human Rights Watch urged Jospin Tuesday to try
to persuade Jiang to release jailed journalist Gao Yu.
	   In a letter to Jospin, the groups noted that the 54-year-old Gao
is not receiving adequate medical care despite heart and
circulatory problems and frequent blackouts.
	   ``The Chinese authorities constantly subject her to an abhorrent
form of blackmail: she has to agree to a self-criticism before they
will let her be hospitalized,'' the letter said.
	   A former deputy editor of a now-defunct economics weekly, Gao
was arrested five years ago. She was tried in secret and sentenced
to six years in prison for leaking state secrets, apparently for
writing about Communist Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.

Australia pledges ``continued help'' to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia, (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard pledged
Tuesday that continued help for Indonesia will be ``a priority''
for his conservative government.
	   Howard also urged the world community to support U.S. President
Bill Clinton's plan to deal with the rapidly spreading Asian
economic crisis.
	   ``President Clinton's recent proposals to deal with current
international financial and economic problems deserve full support
from the international community,'' Howard said.
	   ``He proposes measures that promote growth, reinforce financial
support for countries in crisis, accelerate corporate debt
restructuring, strengthen the social safety net for the poor in
affected countries and reform the world's financial institutions.''
	   But Howard, who faces national elections on Oct. 3, also sought
to distinguish the international policies of his government from
those of his Labor predecessor, Paul Keating.
	   ``Our policy is Asia-first or Asia plus,'' Howard said in a
speech to an academic conference in Sydney.
	   Howard accuses Keating of focusing almost exclusively on the
Southeast Asian region.
	   Howard also said Australia has done more than just offer
substantial financial aid to Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea
through the International Monetary Fund.
	   He said his government has also drawn world attention to the
dangers associated with rapidly rising levels of poverty and hunger
in Indonesia.
	   ``Australia, perhaps more than any other country, was conscious
of the stresses that Indonesia would undergo in a period of
leadership transition,'' he said.
	   ``I myself had publicly warned of the issue when in the United
States in June last year,'' he added.
	   Howard said Australia had pressed very hard this year for a more
realistic package of aid to Indonesia than the IMF had originally
proposed.
	   ``This was not popular at the time with some of our friends,''
Howard said.
	   ``Nevertheless our energetic campaign was surely right,'' he
said.
	   ``The IMF program was modified and and better understanding of
Indonesia's circumstances achieved,'' Howard said.
	   He recalled that he had put Indonesia's case personally to
President Clinton and the leaders of Japan, China, Singapore and
Britain.
	   But Howard said Indonesia still faces very serious problems.
	   ``Indonesia has much distance to go to re-establish itself,'' he
said.
	   ``The dramatic increase in poverty, the debt burden on its
businesses, the need for root and branch, but orderly political
reforms are huge tasks to complete,'' he added.

Nearly 1,000 Kosovo Albanians suspected of terrorism

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 Kosovo Albanians have
been suspected of terrorist activities and face trials by Serbian
courts, the justice minister said Tuesday.
	   Dragoljub Jankovic was quoted as saying by the state Tanjug news
agency that out of the 927 investigated ethnic Albanians, 538 have
been arrested and the rest are on the run.
	   He said that additional 300 people may be added to the suspected
list.
	   Kosovo militants are fighting for independence from Serbia for
the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo. Serbian
authorities brand all the the fighters as ``terrorists.''
	   Faced with numerous trials, Serbian courts are short of judges
and prison space.

country of Uzbekistan, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Soldiers from the Central Asian countries of Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan were joined by military units from the
United States, Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The exercise, dubbed Centrazbat-98, involves a total of 1,443
soldiers and officers and will continue through Sept. 28, the
report said.
	   Maj. Gen. Yuri Agzamov told Interfax that most of the dlrs 5
million tab for the exercises will be paid by the United States,
with Turkey picking up the cost of Azerbaijan's contingent.
	   The exercise to provide humanitarian aid is set in a fictional
country, and involves flying Uzbek troops to Kyrgyzstan. ``It will
be the first time that Uzbekistan will transfer troops in such
exercises,'' Agzamov said.

 &UR; Sympathy for Clinton after release of grand jury deposition
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, recasts throughout with fresh reaction
 &UR; With BC-US-Clinton-Lewinsky
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON _ His enemies scoffed. But as Bill Clinton's grand jury
testimony was beamed around the globe many observers _ not all of
them admirers _ expressed dismay that the president of the United
States should have to suffer ritual humiliation on television.
	   From Europe to Asia and the Middle East, people decried what
they saw as an erosion of standards protecting privacy and keeping
explicit sexuality out of the mainstream media.
	   ``The disproportion of this groping investigation into a
pathetic and tacky affair defies belief,'' wrote commentator Polly
Toynbee in London's Guardian newspaper.
	   ``This was slow torture by excruciating embarrassment.''
	   Callers to Bucharest's Pro TV compared Clinton's ordeal to
trials under the former Communist regime, where people were ``put
in corner, judged, and punished, in most cases without being
guilty,'' said Ionela Banarescu, a producer at the station.
	   ``Many Romanians suffered these unjust traumas, and Clinton's
testimony reminded them about those past, painful moments under
Communism.''
	   But Clinton's political opponents exulted.
	   ``Palestinians follow details with a sense of rejoicing'' ran
the headline in the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam. The newspaper
quoted political analyst Ghassan Khatib as saying Palestinians feel
Clinton is too pro-Israel, ``and so that is why they watched to see
his face and body movement that revealed his uncomfortable
situation.''
	   Few felt Clinton had been damaged.
	   ``For those who viewed the tape he was what he has been for them
for six years: a good president but a mediocre man, husband and
father,'' said the Rome-based daily La Repubblica.
	   But some feared his credibility had been eroded.
	   ``Is Clinton in condition to govern the world in this time of
economic uncertainty?'' asked Barcelona's El Periodico newspaper.
``Can he think, advise and decide calmly? The doubt gets bigger.''
	   For Thais, Clinton's ordeal proved ``the strength and resilience
of the American political culture,'' said foreign ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul.
	   ``One cannot imagine the leader of any other country being put
through such an ordeal in a public and transparent manner. Rather
than seeing this as a weakness or losing respect, one can see it as
a demonstration of American inner strength _ that no one is above
the law.''
	   In Canada, one person reserved the harshest criticism for the
media, accusing it of broadcasting Clinton's deposition to boost
ratings.
	   ``No matter what they say, it's about sex; it's about ratings
and there's no denying that,'' said Gail MacLennan, a freelance
consultant and writer. ``This has just upped the ante in terms of
what is acceptable to expose.''
	   That sentiment was shared by papers in Iran.
	   ``Whether one is for or against President Bill Clinton, the U.S.
media has demonstrated its lack of taste and discretion,'' the Iran
News said.
	   In Paris, editorial writers tired of the scandal.
	   ``Ad nauseum'' headlined the leftist daily Liberation on
Tuesday. Broadcasting the Clinton testimony ``revealed nothing ...
if not the tenacity of the Republicans to make him fall.''
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' he said.
	   Will it end here? Not likely, said The Times of London, pointing
out that Congress still must decide whether to censure or impeach
the president, and mid-term elections are approaching. ``This show,
unfortunately, is destined to run and run.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Rwanda,

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Four members of a French parliamentary
panel looking into France's relationship with the former Hutu
government before and during the 1994 genocide were in Rwanda to
meet with legislators and visit a genocide site Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   Dr. Richard Sezibera, a member of parliament for the ruling
Rwandan Patriotic Front, said the four had come to ask questions
about a possible French role in the genocide in which at least
500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered in a
government-orchestrated campaign.
	   France had close relations with the government of Hutu President
Juvenal Habyarimana, and French military advisors are reported to
have aided government troops in repelling attacks by Rwandan Tutsi
exiles that began in October 1990.
	   The mysterious shooting down of Habyarimana's plane April 6,
1994, as it was to land in Kigali sparked the genocide.
	   The French panel is to deliver its conclusions in December.
	   Members of the delegation in Rwanda are deputies Bernard
Cazenave and Pierre Brana as well as administrative staff Didier Le
Bot and Anne Frago.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Military ruler Abdulsalami Abubakar has
withdrawn a special security unit from the oil-rich Ogoni region in
southern Nigeria where it has been stationed since 1994, a daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Residents of the trouble-plagued area woke up one morning last
week to find the paramilitary Internal Security Task Force had
withdrawn in the middle of the night, the respected Lagos Guardian
reported.
	   ``At first, we thought it was a routine change of guard, but two
or three days later we have not seen a single military personnel on
the streets,'' the paper quoted an Ogoni villager as saying.
	   Pro-democracy activists and foreign governments like Britain
have repeatedly called for the removal of the security force, which
has been accused of fueling existing tensions in the region.
	   Rioting, protests and violent clashes have persisted in Ogoni
communities since 1994, when mass rioting led to a government
crackdown on protesters and the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa _ a
leading Ogoni author and environmental activist.
	   Many of the protests _ which have persisted despite the
heightened security presence _ have centered on demands by
communities for compensation by Shell Oil for alleged environmental
pollution by the petroleum giant.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ An outbreak of cholera that began last month
has spread to five regions of Ghana, health authorities said
Monday.
	   ``Pockets of cholera have been reported around the country,
notably in Ashanti, the Upper East region and also the Western,
Eastern and Greater Accra region,'' the Ministry of Health said in
a statement.
	   The Ministry said it had enough health workers and logistics to
control the disease, which is spread through contaminated water or
food and is carried by internal body fluids, including feces and
vomit. Death usually comes from dehydration.
	   ___
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ An acute fuel shortage
has forced about 80 percent of Bangui's gas stations to close,
witnesses said Tuesday.
	   On Monday, the government ordered stations to begin rationing
gasoline sales, after the crisis appeared to reach a head over the
weekend.
	   Lines of cars stretched outside the capital's few serving
stations to buy government-imposed rations of 20 liters (5 gallons)
of gasoline a day. A brisk black market trade has been selling
petrol products at twice the normal rate.
	   The shortage has taken more than half of the country's taxis off
the road. Most of Central African Republic's fuel is imported from
neighboring Congo, which has been embroiled in a rebel uprising
since the beginning of August.
	   A government official told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity that petrol tankers had not been able to reach Congo's
river port of Matadi as a result of the war. The official said a
government delegation had been sent to Cameroon to purchase
emergency supplies to ease the crisis.

Serbs launch strong attack as world ponders how to deal with Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serbs saying they are attacking from all
directions, building bridge, RAISES background. Pick up 10th graf

 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders ponder Kosovo at
the United Nations, Serb forces launched a strong attack Tuesday,
pounding villages in the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance
with heavy artillery and tank fire.
	   A police commander, who refused to give his name, estimated it
would take his troops no more than three days to clear the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army from the Drenica area, where Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian extremists six months ago.
	   Another Serb police source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said government forces were meeting ``tough'' resistance from the
rebels.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Thousands of refugees are believed to be hiding in the mountain
forests.
	   The attack appeared underway in a wide area northwest and
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Reporters could see
the flash of muzzle fire from tanks and artillery, which pounded at
least five villages on the main road between Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the northwest.
	   Numerous columns of smoke could be seen rising from the
villages. The attack appeared aimed at the Cicavica mountains on
the edge of the Drenica region, a known KLA stronghold.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed at
least 16 people, including six women and two children under age 5,
had been injured so far in the ``powerful'' Serb attack against 15
villages.
	   There was no casualty report from the Serbs.
	   But another senior Serb officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said government troops were attacking Drenica from all
four directions and had cut off all guerrilla escape routes.
	   The official also said Yugoslav army engineers built a pontoon
bridge Tuesday to allow tanks and troops to cross a river that runs
the length of Drenica's western border. The river had blocked
armored attacks from the west.

French tourist hit by bullet in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A sniper bullet pierced the eye of a
French tourist strolling in the capital of troubled Kashmir on
Tuesday, police and doctors said.
	   The heavily bleeding tourist, identified only by his first name
Peter, was rushed to hospital from near Srinagar's historic Jama
Masjid mosque after he was hit in his left eye by a bullet fired
apparently from a distance by a sniper.
	   The identity of the attacker or the motive of the attack were
not immediately known, police investigators said.
	   The victim was being treated at Soura Hospital in Srinagar and
was out of danger, but the bullet had not been removed, doctors
said.
	   Kashmir has been gripped by separatist violence since 1989.
Muslim militants in predominantly Hindu India's only
Muslim-majority state want independence to join neighboring
Pakistan, which is officially Islamic.

Report: Sudanese president invites Carter to visit Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president has invited to Khartoum
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who has called for an
investigation into the attack last month on a Sudanese
pharmaceutical plant, a daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said he hoped ``contacts that have
helped us reach an understanding in many regional and international
questions could be boosted,'' the Akhbar Al-Sa'a reported.
	   The newspaper did not say how the invitation was conveyed.
	   Last week, Carter said an investigation should determine whether
the Aug. 20 attack was warranted on El Shifa factory. Washington
said the plant produced precursors for chemical weapons.
	   ``If the evidence shows that the Sudanese are guilty, they
should be condemned for lying and for contributing to terrorist
activities,'' Carter said Thursday. ``Otherwise, we should admit
our error and make amends to those who have suffered loss or
injury.''
	   The U.S. administration has so far turned down Sudanese calls
for a U.N. fact-finding mission at the plant.

Under tough Malaysian law, sacked deputy can stay in jail without
</HEADLINE>
trial
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ When police decided to jail the
sacked deputy prime minister, they used one of their most dreaded
and controversial weapons: the Internal Security Act.
	   Supporters of Malaysia's onetime heir-apparent, Anwar Ibrahim,
on Tuesday railed against the sweeping law, known by its acronym
ISA, which allows imprisonment without trial and was enacted in
1960 to counter militant communists.
	   ``The ISA was introduced to get rid of subversive elements,''
said Mohamed Hisham, a supporter of Anwar. ``But we don't have that
now. All we have are political opinions.''
	   Dozens of police with assault rifles arrested Anwar at his home
Sunday after he staged rallies urging the ouster of his former
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Police have twice broken
up crowds with tear gas and water cannons.
	   Although the former British colony is nominally a democracy,
Mahathir has largely succeeded in keeping a lid on dissent with an
array of stern legal instruments. The ISA is the most notorious.
	   ``We view very seriously the use of ISA to intimidate and
buttress the culture of fear among the people,'' opposition
lawmaker Syed Husin said in a statement.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International said the use of the
act against Anwar indicated the government was pursuing a political
agenda rather than an independent investigation.
	   The government defends the law as a means of keeping order in
normally placid Malaysia and cites the arrest of Anwar as an
example of the fairness of the justice system.
	   ``It goes to show that nobody is above the law, that where the
law applies does not matter, be it a small or a big man,'' Rafidah
Aziz, the trade minister, said recently.
	   Hundreds of people, from mechanics to legislators, have been
jailed over the years on charges of threatening national security,
which enjoys a loose government definition.
	   Boat skippers have been detained under the ISA for smuggling
Indonesian illegal immigrants into Malaysia. So have advocates of
Chinese-language teaching in Malaysia, which has an ethnic Chinese
minority but promotes the dominant Malay culture.
	   Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime but has been
accused of leaking state secrets, sedition, tampering with police
investigations and sexual misconduct.
	   Eleven other people connected with his reform movement are also
being held under the Internal Security Act.
	   Police have not said where they are holding Anwar, who as a
radical student was jailed under the act for 22 months in the
1970s. His misstep then was to lead demonstrations on behalf of
poor farmers.
	   Pending periodic reviews, ISA detainees can be held without
trial indefinitely. Anwar is at the mercy of the man he wants to
quit, Mahathir, who will personally handle the case because he
fills the home affairs portfolio in his own Cabinet.
	   Police can question Anwar for up to 60 days. Mahathir will then
decide whether to sign a detention order, which is renewable, for
up to two years.
	   Lim Kit Siang, an opposition leader who has twice been arrested
under the Internal Security Act, said the first week or two of the
60-day period is the worst as police try to extract a confession.
He said some detainees have been tortured.
	   ``The detained person is completely cut off from the outside
world, with no contact with the family or lawyers,'' he said. ``A
detainee is subject to the greatest pressures to break him down.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Tuesday he personally interviewed people who said they engaged
in illegal sex acts with his ousted deputy because he couldn't
believe the sordid allegations.
	   Mahathir, who sacked Anwar Ibrahim as his deputy and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said the charges against Anwar were so vile he
decided to question people himself.
	   ``I interviewed people he sodomized and the women he had sex
with,'' Mahathir said at a news conference filled with graphic
details about the alleged relationships.
	   ``Their behavior was despicable,'' Mahathir added.
	   Mahathir said that leaders of his United Malays National
Organization were finding it difficult to explain to women and
children the alleged reasons for Anwar's ouster.
	   ``The Malaysian society is conservative,'' he said. ``They don't
even talk about these things.''
	   Sodomy in this predominantly Muslim country is illegal.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges and said they are part
of a government conspiracy to thwart his growing challenge to
Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   With Anwar and 11 of his colleagues detained, police on Tuesday
turned their sights on his wife.
	   They have threatened to arrest Azizah Ismail for comments she
made suggesting her husband had been injected with the HIV virus
while in police detention.
	   Mahathir indicated Azizah would face arrest.
	   ``She has made certain allegations against the police which
amount to incitement,'' he said, adding he felt sorry for the
mother of six who had been ``innocently trapped.''
	   Army trucks filled with troops carrying assault rifles
surrounded Anwar's home Tuesday. Another 30 riot police with tear
gas canisters lurked outside the house as supporters gathered
inside.
	   Though the mood was tense at Anwar's house, the rest of the
capital was calm, following violent clashes between police and
Anwar supporters Monday.
	   The unrest comes during the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II
and her husband, Prince Philip. Demonstrators at the courthouse
where supporters expected Anwar to be charged Monday lunged at the
queen's convoy as it drove by, prompting riot police to move in.
	   Police Tuesday said 132 people, including 17 foreigners, were
detained for involvement in the courthouse rioting.
	   Anwar, arrested under the country's Internal Security Act, has
not been seen since police dragged him, Azizah and two of their six
children from their home Sunday night.
	   Anwar had said his wife would take over his political reform
movement in the event of his detention. But the police intimidation
appeared to be working.
	   Azizah told reporters Tuesday that she would no longer hold
nightly reform rallies at their house. She called on Anwar's
supporters to remain peaceful, saying the police would use their
disorder as an excuse to arrest them.
	   ``I want things to be stable,'' she said. ``They'll use that
excuse to kill us all.''
	   Azizah said the police had visited her three times since Sunday,
threatening to arrest her and telling her to disperse the crowds
around the house.
	   Mohamed Hisham, one of the rally organizers, said the public
gatherings would continue in other states.
	   ``Practically all the leaders have been detained,'' he said.
``But we will regroup by using pamphlets and by word of mouth. The
people will come back.''
	   Police said Azizah told CNBC news Monday that her husband's life
had been threatened by police.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Mohd. Amin said Azizah told CNBC: ``We
have news to say that maybe Anwar's life is in danger because he
may be given some injection of the HIV virus to prove whatever
allegations ... in the long run to cost his life. This is why I am
afraid for my husband's life.''
	   Ghazali said Azizah's statement could incite hostility against
the criminal justice system.
	   Eleven of Anwar's closest supporters were also picked up Monday
under the ISA, which allows suspects deemed a threat to national
security to be held for up to 60 days without trial or legal
council. The detention order can be renewed indefinitely.
	   Yet a private secretary of Anwar, one of five associates who had
been arrested before him, was freed Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A sniper bullet pierced the thigh of a
French tourist strolling with his girlfriend in the capital of
insurgency-hit Kashmir province Tuesday, police and doctors said.
	   The heavily bleeding tourist, identified by police as Peter
Marek Korzec of Paris, was rushed by his friend and their guide to
a hospital from near Srinagar's historic Jama Masjid mosque after
he was hit in his left thigh by a bullet fired apparently from a
distance by a sniper.
	   The identity of the attacker and the motive were not immediately
known, investigators said.
	   The bullet was removed at Srinagar's Soura Hospital and the
victim was out of danger, doctors said.
	   Kashmir has been gripped by separatist violence since 1989.
Muslim militants in predominantly Hindu India's only
Muslim-majority state want independence or to join neighboring
Pakistan, which is officially Islamic.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ German cyclist Jan Ullrich has pulled out of the
Grand-Prix Tell Sept. 23-27 in Switzerland due to problems with his
Achilles' tendon.
	   The team doctor ordered the 1997 Tour de France winner to take
an extended break after an examination showed that a problem with
his Achilles' tendon had grown more serious.
	   Steffen Wesemann, 24, will take Ullrich's place in the race.

Film festival condemns Thai censorship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Organizers of the first international
Bangkok Film Festival blasted Thai authorities on Tuesday for
censoring three of its films, saying the decision damages
Thailand's reputation around the world.
	   The Thai Censorship Board said the films are either pornographic
or offensive in making its ruling.
	   In a statement faxed to news agencies, the organizers said the
festival was granted an exemption from review by the local
censorship board until ``a story based on an anonymous fax''
appeared in The Daily News, a local tabloid, questioning why the
festival was being allowed to screen pornography.
	   The Thai Censorship Board employed a 58-year-old statute and
ruled that a Thai satire ``My Dog Eats Biscuits'' was
``unacceptable on the ground that it insults all religions.''
	   The board, which is under the control of the police department,
also ruled that ``Bugis Street,'' a film from Singapore, be cut in
three separate places or face the same fate.
	   Festival director Brian Bennett ``chose to withdraw the film
rather than cheat audiences or cause permanent damage to the print
by making the cuts,'' the organizers said.
	   However, New Zealand's ``Topless Women Talk About Their Lives''
can screen this week on condition that projectionists put their
hands in front of the camera during controversial scenes.
	   Bennett insisted that none of the films at the festival can be
regarded as pornographic and pointed out that all of them have
passed censorship panels when screen at other festivals in places
such as Singapore, which has stricter censorship laws than
Thailand, and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
	   ``Directors and producers who flew in from around the world to
attend the birth of the Bangkok Film Festival are circulating a
petition to protest the censorship,'' the organizers said.
	   Despite the board's decision that the films were pornographic
and should not be shown, pornographic videos are sold openly by
street vendors on many of the avenues in Bangkok's central business
district.
	   Although their jacket covers with pictures of naked women are
displayed on tables for passersby of any age to see, police have
never raided the stalls.

Ousted lawmaker released from jail pending appeal for forgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An ousted lawmaker was released from prison
Tuesday after posting 40 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.1
million) in bail pending an appeal against a three-year sentence
for forgery in a land deal.
	   Chim Pui-chung, an eight-year veteran of the territory's
legislature, left prison shortly after the High Court granted his
bail application.
	   He was jailed last month on a forgery charge stemming from a 350
million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 44.8 million) land deal in
1992.
	   He was expelled from the legislature earlier this month
following his conviction and sentence.
	   The court is scheduled to hear Chim's appeal against his
conviction in November.

Four U.N. observers attacked in breakaway Georgian region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with 10 workers reportedly
attacked, four wounded, reax from Abkhazian leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on a bus of 10 United
Nations workers in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, wounding
four, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. military observers were attacked Monday night in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Four of the workers _ two from Bangladesh, one Nigerian, and one
Abkhazian _ were wounded in the attack, ITAR-Tass said, citing the
leader of the U.N. mission, Rasheed Al-Haroun.
	   Three of the workers were taken to Turkey for medical treatment,
though the report did not identify them.
	   Earlier, Astamur Taniya, press secretary to Abkhazian leader
Vladislav Ardzinba, had said that only one of the military
observers had been wounded.
	   Ardzinba called the incident an attempt to destabilize the
region, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia denounced the attack, saying it ``proves a pressing need
for resolute action on the part of the Georgian and Abkhazian
authorities to normalize the situation,'' the Interfax news agency
reported, citing an unidentified source in Russia's Foreign
Ministry.
	   An investigation into the incident is under way, Interfax
reported.
	   The United Nations keeps a group of military observers in
Georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and
separatists in Abkhazia.
	   A U.N. worker from Poland, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, was shot
and killed in July outside her apartment in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
	   Meanwhile, Georgian and Abkhazian leaders began talks Tuesday in
Tbilisi, but expressly avoided political debate. The two sides
discussed restoring the region's railroads and energy system,
including a natural gas pipeline, said Sergei Bagapsh, who led the
Abkhazian delegation.
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia became an independent state in the wake of
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 war,
driving out Georgian soldiers and ethnic Georgians. Violence has
broken out periodically since then despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the region.

Tanzania to construct a dlrs 400 million pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.S. company and a local firm
have signed an agreement Saturday to construct a dlrs 400 million
petroleum products pipeline from Dar Es Salaam to a port on Lake
Victoria.
	   El Paso International of Texas and Africomeroe signed the
agreement over the weekend.
	   Africomeroe chairman Elisante Muro said the 1000-kilometer
(600-mile) pipeline will be completed in two years.
	   Muro said the project has the strong support of the governments
of Tanzania and Uganda but added it would face stiff competition
from Kenya's Nairobi to Eldoret pipeline, which is due to be
extended to the Uganda capital, Kampala.
	   The Dar Es Salaam-Mwanza pipeline will provide an alternative
route from the Indian Ocean port for the export of petroleum
products to neighboring Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and eastern parts
of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   ``This project will create ancillary or related development
along the route that it is going to traverse. Commercial and social
facilities will be created and some sort of economic activities
will take place along,'' Minister for Energy and Minerals Abdallah
Kigoda said during the signing ceremony.

British tobacco companies sue over EU ad ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The four top British tobacco companies said
Tuesday they have gone to court to fight European Union decisions
banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
	   The 15-member EU recently approved measures that would outlaw
most tobacco advertising within four years, while banning tobacco
sponsorship of major cultural and sporting events by 2006.
	   The running battle has pitted those who blame cigarettes for
killing hundreds of thousands of EU citizens against those who say
Formula One racing won't survive in Europe without the backing of
tobacco money.
	   ``This is totally unjustified and we will vigorously challenge
the basis on which these restrictions to a legal product are being
introduced,'' said David Swan, chief executive of the Tobacco
Manufacturers' Association, the lobbying group for British tobacco.
	   The companies _ British American Tobacco Investments Ltd.,
Gallaher Ltd., Imperial Ltd. and Rothmans (UK) Ltd. _ say any
legislation about tobacco advertising or sponsorship is a public
health matter that under European law must be decided on a
nation-by-nation basis.
	   EU Health Commissioner Padraig Flynn disagrees.
	   ``We are confident we can defend ourselves against any legal
challenge,'' said Flynn's spokeswoman, Barbara Nolan. ``We're on
solid ground.''
	   The British tobacco companies said that while the EU is going
too far, they are happy to keep negotiating with the British
government over any advertising rules _ an area that has previously
proven embarrassing for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   Blair was reprimanded in the spring for failing to report that
he and his family got a free trip to the 1996 British Grand Prix _
funded by the governing body of Formula One. Tobacco companies are
the sport's biggest sponsor.
	   Late last year, two parliamentary committees criticized Blair
for seeking to exempt Formula One racing from what at the time was
still a proposed ban on tobacco sponsorship.
	   It emerged that Blair's Labor Party had received campaign
donations of 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.7 million) from Formula One
boss Bernie Ecclestone. The party returned the money.
	   Britain finally agreed to a deal that will let Formula One
continue receiving tobacco money through Oct. 1, 2006.
	   The tobacco companies filed their lawsuit Monday in Britain's
High Court, where they hope to persuade judges to transfer the case
to the European Court of Justice.

Strong majority of French in favor of euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After years of mixed feelings, nearly two-thirds of
the French think the euro will be a good thing for the country when
the European single currency takes effect at the end of the year,
according to a poll published Tuesday.
	   Sixty-four percent of the French think the euro will be benefit
France, though only 54 percent said they expect it to improve their
personal lives, according to the survey by CSA for the dailies Le
Parisien and Aujourd'hui.
	   Officials have to do a better job of preparing the public, the
poll indicated, with 44 percent saying they are not adequately
informed about the switch from the franc to the euro.
	   While many financial transactions will occur in euros, and euro
equivalents will have to be included in billings, euro cash is not
to replace the paper and coin currencies in the 11 participating
European Union nations until 2002.
	   Opposition remains strong on the political fringe, with 62
percent of the National Front supporters against the euro.
Forty-nine percent of the Communists are opposed.
	   Among the Socialists, ecologists and conservatives, support runs
at 65 percent. That's a strong shift from 1992, when the Maastricht
Treaty referendum paving the way for the euro squeaked by on a
51-49 percent vote in France.
	   Euro proponents say the currency will stabilize Europe's
financial markets, grease the wheels of intra-EU trade and help
lower interest rates, stimulating growth. Opponents argue countries
will lose fiscal sovereignty to the German-based European Central
Bank in charge of the euro.
	   The poll Sept. 18-19 surveyed a nationally representative
sampling of 1,000 adults. No margin of error was given, but French
polls usually carry an error margin of 2-3 percent.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The oil ministers of Kuwait, Algeria, Oman, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates will meet here Wednesday for another
round of discussions on how to boost world oil prices, Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. officials said Tuesday.
	   Last week, the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Qatar met for
the same purpose with their Kuwaiti counterpart, Sheik Saud
al-Sabah.
	   Sheik Saud said after that meeting that if oil prices don't
reach dlrs 17 a barrel in November, further production cuts should
be considered by all producers. Brent Blend for November currently
is trading at about dlrs 14 a barrel.
	   He said the two months until the November meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were ``crucial'' for
the oil market and that producers needed to formulate a strategy
for improving prices.
	   Kuwait, which depends on oil for most state revenues, has been
hard hit by the falling prices. It estimates a net deficit of 1.92
billion (dlrs 6.27 billion) in fiscal year 1998-99, which started
July 1.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A state-sponsored conference on ways to
fight unemployment ended here Tuesday with calls for creating a
strategy to create jobs for Jordanians and to reduce dependence on
foreign labor.
	   But the three-day conference failed to come up with clear steps
to fight unemployment, estimated at about 14.4 percent of the
950,000-member labor force.
	   A communique signed by more than 300 participants from the
public and private sectors urged the government to limit foreign
labor ``to the minimum.''
	   Bassam Amoush, minister of administrative development, told a
news conference he sought to create a special fund for the jobless
and to introduce a minimum wage system for workers.
	   Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who took office Aug. 20 with a
mandate to fight poverty and unemployment, said he planned to
encourage investments to create jobs.
	   Some 300,000 foreigners work in Jordan, most of them Egyptians.
At least half have no work permits.
	   The government says foreign labor is attractive to Jordanian
employers because it is cheap. They also note that the foreigners
work in construction and agriculture in jobs most Jordanians are
unwilling to do.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's literacy rate reached 90 percent
in 1997 because of high attendance at state-supervised adult
literacy courses, an Education Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Massad, the ministry's director of general education,
said more than 350,000 Jordanians benefited from adult education
since the early 1960s.
	   The literacy rate in Jordan is among the highest in the Arab
world because since 1964, school attendance has been compulsory
until the 10th grade. Jordan has become a major provider of
professionals, such as doctors and engineers, to the Arab Gulf
states.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The government plans to promote
Egyptian-made goods at a week-long trade fair to be held in the
Yemeni capital San'a starting Nov. 3, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The value of Egypt's exports to Yemen increased 29 percent to
dlrs 30 million in 1997, MENA said. About one-third were medical
supplies, it said..
	   In the exhibition, private and state-owned companies will
promote household goods, clothes, cosmetics and electronics. Yemen
exports fish and leather to Egypt.

More soldiers leaving Northern Ireland, police chief says

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ More British soldiers will soon
return home to Britain in response to April's peace agreement, the
Northern Ireland police commander announced Tuesday.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said about 400 soldiers from the
Royal Artillery and Highlander regiments would fly out within days,
reducing troop strength in the British-ruled territory to about
16,000. They can be speedily redeployed to Northern Ireland if
needed.
	   Flanagan also said he and army chiefs were considering how many
of their high-walled barracks should close down in response to the
cease-fires being observed by Northern Ireland's major outlawed
groups: the Irish Republican Army on the anti-British side, and the
Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force on the
pro-British side.
	   The major threat to security-force installations comes from the
IRA, which began bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of
abolishing Northern Ireland. The group has been observing a truce
for 14 months but is refusing to start disarming as envisioned in
April's peace agreement.
	   Also Tuesday, police on both sides of the Irish border confirmed
they were interrogating 12 people on suspicion of involvement in an
Aug. 15 car bomb attack committed by IRA dissidents. The blast _
which killed 29 and wounded more than 330 in the religiously mixed
town of Omagh _ was the deadliest in the history of the Northern
Ireland conflict.
	   Northern Ireland police were questioning six men arrested
Monday, police in the Irish Republic six others. Since the blast
several other suspected IRA dissidents have been arrested, but all
have been released without charge.
	   And 10 more convicts were freed Tuesday from the anti-terrorist
Maze prison southwest of Belfast under terms of the peace accord.
Those walking free after serving about a third of their sentences
were eight IRA members and one each from the UDA and UVF, which
have been observing a joint truce since 1994. So far, 34 of more
than 420 eligible prisoners have been freed.
	   Meanwhile in England, members of the British and Irish
parliaments held their first joint meeting since their governments
and eight Northern Ireland parties struck the peace accord on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   ``Cooperation between the British and Irish governments has been
the engine for all this change. We are working together more
closely now than ever before,'' Britain's governor for Northern
Ireland, Mo Mowlam, told the lawmakers in York in England's
northeast.
	   Mowlam also paid tribute to U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
wife, Hillary, as having proved themselves to be more than
``fair-weather friends'' to those seeking compromise in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``When it got tough, they were there to help. They were prepared
to stay up all night, and talk to people when we needed them. ... I
would like to say thank you to them for that,'' she said, making no
reference to the potential impeachment proceedings facing the
president.

Fiji, Australia win Tuesday matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Australian win &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Jason Little scored a record-equaling
four tries Tuesday to help qualify Australia for next year's Rugby
World Cup with a 74-0 win over Tonga on Tuesday.
	   Winger Little matched Australia's record for tries in a test as
the Wallabies scored 12 touchdowns to run away with the
second-round Pacific qualifying tournament game and better their
66-20 win over Fiji in the opening round in Sydney last week.
	   In the opening match Tuesday at Bruce Stadium, Fiji beat Western
Samoa 26-18.
	   Little equaled the four tries scored by Greg Cornelsen against
New Zealand in 1978 and David Campese against the United States in
1983.
	   While Little goes in the record books, the Australians just
missed their all-time record 76-0 win over England set earlier this
year and fell one try short of their record for a test, scored
against South Korea in the 1987 World Cup.
	   The win virtually guaranteed Australia will finish on top of the
four-nation Pacific tournament and qualify for the World Cup's Pool
E based in Ireland.
	   The only way the Australians won't top the tournament is if
Western Samoa scores more tries on the way to beating them in the
final round in Brisbane on Saturday.
	   The second team in the Pacific tournament will be in Pool C
based in France, the third team is in Pool D in host nation Wales
and the fourth team has a second chance via a repechage tournament.
	   In the opening match, a sideline conversion from Waisale Serevi
three minutes from time saved Fiji's World Cup hopes and leveled
its record at 1-1. A try to winger Fero Lasagavibau with three
minutes to go and a penalty try on the bell gave Fiji its win.
	   Trailing 18-12 and looking at their second loss in the
three-match tournament, the Fijians struck back with a clever try
to Lasagavibau who grounded a grubber kick from halfback Jacob
Raulini.
	   Western Samoa is now 1-1 and Tonga 0-2 in the tournament.
	   Scores:
	   AUSTRALIA 74 (Jason Little 4, Manuel Edmonds 2, Joe Roff, Tim
Horan, Chris Whitaker, Brett Robinson, Owen Finnegan, Jeremy Paul
tries; Edmonds 5 goals, John Eales 2 goals) def. TONGA 0.
	   FIJI 26 (Fero Lasagavibau try, penalty try; Nicky Little 3
penalty goals, Waisale Serevi 2 goals, penalty goal) def. WESTERN
SAMOA 18 (Mike Umaga, Trevor Leota tries; Stephen Bachop 2 penalty
goals, goal). (djp)

Opposition leader killed in Tajikistan

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A leader of Tajikistan's opposition
was shot dead Tuesday by gunmen who ambushed him outside his
apartment in the capital of this Central Asian nation, officials
said.
	   Otakhon Latifi, 62, was killed with two gunshot wounds to the
chest and one to the head, the Interior Ministry said. No one
claimed responsibility for the killing, and the gunmen were not
identified.
	   In the past few months, Latifi, a former journalist, was twice
attacked and beaten on the street by unknown assailants.
	   Latifi returned to Tajikistan a year ago following peace accords
that ended five years of civil war between Tajikistan's hard-line
government and the opposition.
	   Since then, he had chaired a panel for legal issues under the
National Reconciliation Commission, which worked to stabilize the
former Soviet republic.
	   As part of the peace plan, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
appointed several opposition leaders to key cabinet posts and the
opposition has been incorporated into the Tajik armed forces.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistant has remained restive. The
mountainous country just north of Afghanistan is among the world's
poorest, and the constant unrest has kept its economy from
developing.
	   There have been frequent clashes between the government and the
political opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the
peace deal and wage turf battles with one another.
	   The opposition blamed the killing on an unspecified ``third
force,'' trying to undermine the peace deal.
	   ``This heinous murder is a blow to ... the peace process in
Tajikistan, dealt by those who want to destabilize the situation,''
opposition leader Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Government officials said the killing was intended to tarnish
the image of Tajikistan while the Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the
world's Ismaili Muslim community, was visiting.

Philippine Airlines workers reject management plan to save company

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Workers at ailing Philippine Airlines
narrowly voted Tuesday to reject a management-proposed recovery
plan, dashing a last-ditch government effort to avoid the company's
shutdown.
	   Government labor officials had gone directly to PAL's workers to
see if they would support the plan, which union leaders had earlier
rejected.
	   ``The workers have spoken,'' Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma
said. ``I think there is no denying that the situation is
difficult.''
	   PAL says the plan would have been a prerequisite for it to
recover from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's currency
crisis.
	   The airline announced last week that it will close at midnight
Wednesday after the rejection by union leaders.
	   About 56 percent of the workers voted against the plan, the
labor department said.
	   In the plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan offered workers 20 percent
of the flag carrier's stock and three seats on its board in
exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent.
	   In a meeting Monday night aimed at averting PAL's closure,
President Joseph Estrada also offered workers one of the
government's four board seats, but union leaders continued to
reject the plan.
	   Union leaders say a suspension of the collective bargaining
agreement would be a surrender of their labor rights and expose
them to management abuses.
	   ``This was painful. I don't want to lose my job and I also don't
want to lose my rights,'' Alex Barrientos, president of PAL's
largest union, said after the vote.
	   PAL officials say Tan has resigned himself to the likelihood of
the airline's closure.
	   In a meeting with PAL senior executives on Monday, he cried as
he bid them goodbye, a participant said.
	   When the company announced the closure to employees, many also
broke into tears. Some had held daily prayer vigils in hopes the
airline will not shut down.
	   Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the government is now
considering a 1.5 billion peso (dlrs 34 million) loan that would
allow PAL to operate for three more months.
	   ``The domestic lines of PAL are far too important to the economy
to be allowed not to continue,'' he said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been operating for 57 years. Its
closure would leave many areas of the sprawling archipelago of
7,000 islands without air service.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   In many cases, the only alternative for travel among the
country's islands is slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries.
Forty-three people are known to have died after a ferry sank south
of Manila during a storm Friday.
	   PAL also has been hurt by Asia's currency crisis, which hit just
as the airline was launching an ambitious dlrs 4 billion plan to
expand and update its fleet.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said creditors, to
whom PAL owes about dlrs 2.1 billion, are insisting on guarantees
of labor harmony before they approve a restructuring plan.
	   PAL currently is operating about 30 domestic and 14
international flights a day with 20 aircraft, down from its
pre-strike 54 planes. Its last flight is scheduled to leave from
Manila for San Francisco and Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
	   ``There would be no special ritual for this last flight, this
last one is painful,'' Zapanta said.

Granik, Hunter acknowledge talks nearly resumed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern and Billy Hunter agreed almost two
weeks ago that it was time to resume collective bargaining talks
between the U.S. National Basketball Association and its players
union.
	   But when they tried to work out the details, the whole idea
quickly fell apart.
	   Granik, the deputy commissioner of the NBA, and Hunter,
president of the union, both acknowledged Monday that talks aimed
at ending the lockout by the clubs nearly resumed on Sept. 10,
though they differed on why such a meeting never took place.
	   ``We invited players to come back to the table, and they
declined,'' Granik said. ``They said as long as we would be talking
about a hard cap or some system that set a defined percentage of
revenues to go toward player salaries, they didn't see any point of
meeting.''
	   Hunter said he proposed a small meeting, with four
representatives from each side. But when Stern asked that the
meeting be held when the eight members of the owners labor
committee were in town, Hunter declined.
	   ``I just don't think it's progressive or beneficial when there
are 40 people in the room,'' said Hunter, who nonetheless tried to
call Granik on Monday to discuss moving the process forward.
	   Only one formal bargaining session has been held this summer
toward reaching a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) _ the
main deal that establishes work rules like salary caps, minimum
salaries, trading or transfer regulations and roster limits, and
the league is expected to begin canceling pre-season exhibition
games later this week.
	   Training camps are due to open Oct. 6 and the regular season
Nov. 3, but without a new CBA the league will be forced to cancel
games because of a work stoppage for the first time in its history.
	   Both sides are still waiting for a decision from arbitrator John
Feerick, who will rule on the players' grievance contending that
some 220 players with dlrs 800 million worth of guaranteed
contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   The lockout is like a strike by the club owners, who essentially
say without a contract they will not pay the players and will not
let them play until a new deal is in place.
	   Feerick's ruling is not expected until early October.
	   The sides remain far apart on the main economic issue of the
salary cap, with owners saying they need a new system that will not
allow salary growth to continue to outpace revenue growth.
	   Owners had the right to opt out of the old labor agreement if
the percentage of basketball related income devoted to salaries
rose above 51.8 percent, and the league claims that number topped
57 percent last season.
	   The owners haven't made a formal proposal since June, before the
lockout began, and the players' most recent proposal on Aug. 6 was
rejected emphatically as Stern, Granik and six owners walked out of
a bargaining session upon hearing it.
	   Hunter said the league has taken a longer look at that proposal
since then, and claimed Granik told him that the players' newest
ideas had substance.
	   Upon hearing that statement, Hunter said, he asked that the next
negotiating session be kept small so that progress might be made.
	   When Stern came back the next day and asked that owners Gordon
Gund (Cleveland), Jerry Buss (Lakers), Jerry Colangelo (Phoenix),
Les Alexander (Houston), Dave Checketts (New York), Peter Holt (San
Antonio), Abe Pollin (Washington) and Mickey Arison (Miami) be
included, Hunter declined.
	   Still, Hunter agreed Monday that it's time to move forward.
	   ``Once I make contact, I will both suggest and inquire if they
want to meet. We'll see how things evolve,'' he said.
	   Granik said his side remains ready to negotiate.
	   ``We're ready to bargain at any point,'' he said. ``If somehow
the occasion arises that it will be fruitful, we might invite them
back again _ even though they declined the last time we asked
them.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans woke up to scenes of
devastation Tuesday after Hurricane Georges sowed wreckage across
the island and was poised to strike the densely populated and
highly vulnerable Dominican Republic.
	   Packing 110 mph (177 kph) winds, Georges left at least six dead
as it cut through the northeast Caribbean and slowly ripped across
Puerto Rico. Its powerful thunderstorms denuded forests, flooded
hotels and exploded shop and car windows, flipped small airplanes,
whisked away satellite dishes and forced many thousands into
shelters. Hundreds of thousands were without water or power.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-struck eastern resort town of Fajardo, where dozens of homes
lost roofs. Blocked roads prevented rescuers from responding to
calls for help, and the upscale Conquistador Resort which overlooks
the sea in Fajardo sustained extensive damage.
	   More than 80 percent of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people lost
electricity Monday and more than 70 percent had no water, the
government said. Countless roads and highways were choked by fallen
trees and poles, dangling power lines, antennas, awnings, tin roofs
and other debris. Flooding isolated dozens of neighborhoods.
	   ``I don't know where we are going to stay,'' said Andrea Garcia,
33, as she surveyed a fallen mango tree that smashed onto the
dining room table of her tiny, wooden San Juan home. ``I haven't
even had time to think about what we are going to do now.''
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   With island residents facing the sobering task of recovery
Tuesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release
of U.S. recovery aid.
	   Georges headed for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where many
of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing that
could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), Georges' center was about 90 miles
(145 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
	   By daybreak, strong gusts whipped up surf, forcing residents
into shelters and knocked out power across the southeast coast of
the Dominican Republic.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas and
the Turks and Caicos islands and a hurricane watch was in effect in
eastern Cuba. Concern was growing even in Florida, where workers
put shutters over the windows at Key West City Hall.
	   One death was reported in St. Kitts, where 70 percent of homes
were damaged, as were the hospital, airport and police station.
	   More than 20,000 people huddled in shelters in San Juan,
Arecibo, Mayaguez and other Puerto Rican cities, and officials said
the figure could rise to 50,000.
	   Moving westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges spawned
tornados in the central town of Barranquitas and the eastern island
of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kilometers) were reported
in the interior mountains, where damage reports were sketchy.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival parties agreed that a
royal-sponsored summit meeting Tuesday to try to end the country's
post-election political crisis had made progress, even though the
opposition said they had won no concessions from strongman Hun
Sen's side.
	   ``The exchange of views was straightforward and produced
positive results,'' said Sok An, a senior official of Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party, who attended the meeting hosted by King
Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, said that while problems remain to be resolved, the parties
made progress because the opposition decided to attend parliament,
which opens Thursday.
	   The opposition had earlier been threatening to boycott the
convening of parliament.
	   Ranariddh said all parties ``accept that we have to think now
how to set up a government.''
	   ``We have a long way to go,'' he added.
	   The talks marked the first face-to-face meeting between
Ranariddh and Hun Sen since Hun Sen ousted the prince from power in
a coup d'etat last year.
	   Members of the prince's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally,
the Sam Rainsy Party, said Hun Sen's side made no concrete
concessions Tuesday.
	   They said the government proposed dealing with two major
outstanding issues _ opposition protests about fraud in July's
election and a controversial ban on foreign travel by opposition
members of parliament _ after parliament opened.
	   The meeting was held to ease tensions that erupted into violence
earlier this month when police suppressed protests against Hun
Sen's victory in July parliamentary elections.
	   The opposition organized spirited street rallies in the capital
of Phnom Penh and threatened to boycott parliament's opening unless
their allegations of fraud were investigated.
	   Since Hun Sen fell short of attaining the two-thirds majority
needed to form a government on his own, he needs the opposition's
cooperation.
	   Sok An from Hun Sen's side said the king and all three parties
agreed Tuesday that in case Hun Sen cannot muster a two-thirds
majority, his existing government can continue. But opposition
spokesmen did not confirm this.
	   Ranariddh before Tuesday's meeting called for lifting a ban on
foreign travel that Hun Sen imposed on opposition members of
parliament after a grenade attack on his home earlier this month.
No one was hurt in the grenade incident, which the opposition
charged was staged as a pretext for cracking down on dissent.
	   The opposition said afterwards that Hun Sen's delegation
declined to discuss the ban until parliament was convened.
	   Sok An told reporters that the ban was not up to the government
to lift, but rather the courts and police. He suggested however _
in a tacit admission of the government's power _ that if political
events continued to move ``in an orderly and positive direction,''
it could use its influence to ease the restrictions.
	   The ban was lifted for Ranariddh last week after he agreed to
attend the talks but has remained in place for the rest of the
opposition.
	   Ranariddh had also said he would call for Hun Sen to remove
threats of arrest against demonstration organizers, free those
under detention and investigate the killings of more than a dozen
people whose bodies _ many bearing signs of torture _ have been
found dumped around the capital since the crackdown.
	   No agreement was reached on these points, either.
	   Ranariddh repeated after the meeting that he has no plans to
take a post in a government with Hun Sen, whose party has been
pushing for a coalition with the prince's.

Spain's Iberia to buy up to 11 Airbus jets to replace DC-10s
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS list price, background

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Spanish carrier Iberia will buy up to 11 Airbus
A340 long-range aircraft, the European consortium announced
Tuesday, as the Spanish carrier prepared to replace its DC-10s.
	   The agreement, worth up to dlrs 1.39 billion, includes a firm
order for six aircraft and an option on five more, said Airbus, the
main competitor of U.S.-based world leader Boeing.
	   Iberia intends to use the planes primarily on its routes to
Latin America.
	   The A340 Airbus jetliners will replace five DC-10s, as part of a
plan by the state-owned airline to renew its long-haul fleet by
2002 and increase its long-distance traffic by 50 percent next
year, said a person familiar with the deal.
	   The purchase could be seen as a setback for Boeing, which has
acquired McDonnell Douglas, the builders of the DC-10.
	   The A340-300 has a catalog price of up to dlrs 138 million. The
total order, including options, could be worth up to dlrs 1.39
billion.
	   Iberia has been buying Airbus aircraft since 1978 and it is one
of Airbus Industrie's largest customers in Europe.

Philippine kidnappers demand dlrs 1.5 million for freedom of three
</HEADLINE>
Hong Kong men

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers who abducted three Hong
Kong businessmen two weeks ago have demanded dlrs 1.5 million for
their freedom, a television station reported Tuesday.
	   The report on ABC 5 television said the three Hong Kong men _
Law Ching-lau, So Ching-ming and Tong Ket-ming _ were being kept at
an undisclosed location on Tawi-Tawi island, the country's
southernmost province.
	   The three men were kidnapped Sept. 8 while they were fishing in
the town of Sitangkai, also in Tawi-Tawi, about 1,050 kilometers
(650 miles) south of Manila.
	   Police earlier said the kidnappers had demanded 1.5 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 193,500) for the three men.
	   But ABC 5 said the kidnappers' leader, who identified himself
only as ``Global,'' said they were demanding U.S. dlrs 500,000 for
each of the three men.
	   The station said it did not videotape the victims because the
kidnappers asked for a 1 million peso (U.S. dlrs 22,700) fee. The
victims were shown to an ABC 5 reporter for three minutes but were
not allowed to talk with him, it said.
	   The kidnappers claimed they are members of the Abu Sayyaf, an
extremist Muslim group, but a leader of the group denied that.
	   Police said there are indications the victims were involved in
the smuggling of coral from the southern Philippines to Hong Kong
and some European countries.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti, was kidnapped
separately in nearby Zamboanga del Norte province on the same day
the Hong Kong men were abducted. The following day, another group
of kidnappers took three members of a Taiwanese family in Guiwan,
also in Zamboanga del Norte.
	   All the victims remained with their captors.
	   The military has conducted a search for all the victims, and
civilian negotiators have been assigned to talk with the
kidnappers.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers proposal on property disputes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Tuesday proposed setting up a joint commission with Greek Cypriots
to settle property claims by people on both sides of the divided
island.
	   The offer follows a July ruling by the European Court of human
rights ordering Turkey to pay compensation to a Greek Cypriot woman
for depriving her of property in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state. Another 40 similar cases are pending.
	   Fearing a wave of claims, Turkey rejected the court's ruling,
saying it could not legally be held responsible for property in the
Turkish Cypriot state.
	   The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded the northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece. Only Ankara recognizes the
breakaway state.
	   ``The exchange of property is one of the basic points that need
to be settled for a solution to the Cyprus problem,'' Denktash told
reporters after a meeting with Ann Hercus, the new U.N. resident
envoy in Cyprus.
	   Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from their
villages in the wake of the invasion. Their place was taken by
40,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south and settlers from the
Turkish mainland who were given Greek Cypriot property.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Gross domestic product in the 15-nation
European Union grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
slowing from a first-quarter pace of 0.6 percent, the EU's

	   The GDP in the 11 countries taking part in the launching of the
single currency, the euro on Jan. 1, grew by 0.1 percent over the
same period, according to Eurostat's first estimates.
	   No figures were given for individual EU countries.
	   Compared with the same period last year, GDP in the 15 EU
countries was 2 percent higher in the second quarter of 1998,
Eurostat said.
	   For the same period, U.S growth was 3.6 percent.

	   The death of Otakhon Latifi was another blow to peace in
Tajikistan, a poor, mountainous country that has been torn by civil
strife since breaking away from the Soviet Union seven years ago.
	   Latifi, 62, was killed with two gunshot wounds to the chest and
one to the head, the Interior Ministry said. No one claimed
responsibility for the killing, and the gunmen were not identified.
	   In the past few months, Latifi, a former journalist, was twice
attacked and beaten on the street by unknown assailants.
	   Latifi returned to Tajikistan a year ago following peace accords
that ended five years of civil war between Tajikistan's hard-line
government and the opposition.
	   Since then, he had chaired a panel for legal issues under the
National Reconciliation Commission, which worked to stabilize the
former Soviet republic.
	   As part of the peace plan, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
appointed several opposition leaders to key cabinet posts and the
opposition has been incorporated into the Tajik armed forces.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistant has remained restive.
Bordering five countries in the Hindu Kush mountains, including
Afghanistan and China, it is among the world's poorest countries,
and the constant unrest has kept its economy from developing.
	   There have been frequent clashes between the government and the
political opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the
peace deal and wage turf battles with one another.
	   The opposition blamed the killing on an unspecified ``third
force,'' trying to undermine the peace deal.
	   ``This heinous murder is a blow to ... the peace process in
Tajikistan, dealt by those who want to destabilize the situation,''
opposition leader Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Government officials said the killing was intended to tarnish
the image of Tajikistan while the Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the
world's Ismaili Muslim community, was visiting.

British tobacco companies sue over EU ad ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The four top British tobacco companies said
Tuesday they have gone to court to fight European Union decisions
banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship, a major issue for
Formula One racing.
	   The 15-member EU recently approved measures that would outlaw
most tobacco advertising within four years, while banning tobacco
sponsorship of major cultural and sporting events by 2006.
	   The running battle has pitted those who blame cigarettes for
killing hundreds of thousands of EU citizens against those who say
Formula One won't survive in Europe without the backing of tobacco
money.
	   ``This is totally unjustified and we will vigorously challenge
the basis on which these restrictions to a legal product are being
introduced,'' said David Swan, chief executive of the Tobacco
Manufacturers' Association, the lobbying group for British tobacco.
	   The companies _ British American Tobacco Investments Ltd.,
Gallaher Ltd., Imperial Ltd. and Rothmans (UK) Ltd. _ say any
legislation about tobacco advertising or sponsorship is a public
health matter that under European law must be decided on a
nation-by-nation basis.
	   EU Health Commissioner Padraig Flynn disagrees.
	   ``We are confident we can defend ourselves against any legal
challenge,'' said Flynn's spokeswoman, Barbara Nolan. ``We're on
solid ground.''
	   The British tobacco companies said that while the EU is going
too far, they are happy to keep negotiating with the British
government over any advertising rules _ an area that has previously
proven embarrassing for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   Blair was reprimanded in the spring for failing to report that
he and his family got a free trip to the 1996 British Grand Prix _
funded by the governing body of Formula One. Tobacco companies are
the sport's biggest sponsor.
	   Late last year, two parliamentary committees criticized Blair
for seeking to exempt Formula One racing from what at the time was
still a proposed ban on tobacco sponsorship.
	   It emerged that Blair's Labor Party had received campaign
donations of 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.7 million) from Formula One
boss Bernie Ecclestone. The party returned the money.
	   Britain finally agreed to a deal that will let Formula One
continue receiving tobacco money through Oct. 1, 2006.
	   The tobacco companies filed their lawsuit Monday in Britain's
High Court, where they hope to persuade judges to transfer the case
to the European Court of Justice.

Liberian president says there will be no assault on U.S. embassy

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Apparently trying to smooth relations
with the embattled American Embassy, President Charles Taylor vowed
not to attack the diplomatic compound, where a former Liberian
warlord has been hold up since the weekend, media reports said
Tuesday.
	   The embassy has been on alert since Roosevelt Johnson and
several of his followers unexpectedly arrived at the gate Saturday
morning, sparking a Liberian secret police commando unit attack
that killed at least three of his supporters and wounded two
Americans.
	   Reinforcements have since been flown in to help guard the
embassy. Inside, U.S. servicemen patrol the grounds with assault
rifles, while the handful of remaining diplomats move about in
flack jackets and helmets.
	   Despite American fears that there could be more fighting, Taylor
said there would be no attack.
	   ``We will not get engaged in war with the Americans. They are
our allies and are a superpower,'' Taylor was quoted in the
Monrovia-based Inquirer as telling a group of prominent Liberians.
	   Not long after the shooting, Taylor demanded that the Americans
turn Johnson's group over to his government and warned U.S.
authorities not to evacuate his rival from the country.
	   But on Sunday, his tone had become more conciliatory.
	   ``They want democracy. We want them to help us promote it. We
don't have the muscles to fight. What we need is help to ensure
that justice is done in this case,'' said Taylor, a former warlord
himself who has a long-running rivalry with Johnson.
	   Embassy officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday
morning, but Johnson was believed to still be inside the compound.
Diplomats have said there are no plans to hand Johnson over to
Liberian authorities and that American officials in Washington were
talking with Taylor.
	   On Monday, an obviously frightened Johnson huddled on the floor
of an embassy lobby with two of his sons _ one of whom was shaking
from the pain of two bullet wounds _ and two aides.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy to escape arrest after gunbattles
broke out Friday night as government soldiers deployed in a
Monrovia neighborhood he controls.
	   While American officials were trying to get him escorted safely
away from the embassy, government commandos opened fire on
Johnson's retinue. Some witnesses said four of Johnson's men were
killed in the shooting, but newspaper reports Tuesday said only
three of his men died.
	   Johnson, his sons and two aides slipped through the embassy
gates during the melee.
	   At least 47 people were killed in two days of fighting between
government forces and Johnson loyalists. Nearly two dozen people,
including Johnson and many of his aides, have since been charged
with treason for allegedly plotting to subvert Taylor's government.
	   On Tuesday, truckloads of government soldiers and West African
peacekeepers patrolled the streets of Monrovia, but the city
remained calm. Many stores re-opened and people were returning to
work.
	   ``We hope that before the end of the week the situation will
have completely returned to normal,'' said Gen. Timothy Shelpidi,
the commander of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force that patrols
Liberia.
	   Since the Saturday morning shooting, Shelpidi has reinforced
security details near the American embassy and dozens of his
soldiers and armored trucks now keep watch.
	   The weekend shooting was not the first time a move by Taylor to
arrest his longtime foe erupted into violence and embroiled a
reluctant U.S. Embassy.
	   Taylor's attempt to arrest Johnson in 1996 _ when both were
warlords in Liberia's civil war _ triggered wholesale bloodshed in
Monrovia that left thousands dead and the city a burned-out, looted
wreck.
	   Johnson fled to Ghana, after taking shelter in the U.S. Embassy
and then flying out of the country in an American helicopter.
	   Liberia's civil war ended in 1996, after 150,000 people had been
killed. Johnson returned home to become a cabinet minister after
Taylor won last year's presidential elections.
	   But tensions persisted between the men and forces loyal to both
sides have clashed several times in recent months.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops rumbled into this
tiny mountain kingdom at dawn Tuesday to quell weeks of anarchy and
took control of key sites amid heavy fighting, the military command
in Pretoria said.
	   Facing unexpected resistance, the troops battled with rebellious
Lesotho soldiers through the day. At least three South African
soldiers were killed and 11 wounded, not seriously, the military
said.
	   Protesters firebombed government buildings, looters rampaged
through downtown and cars with South African license plates were
being stoned in the wake of the intervention.
	   Whole shopping centers were gutted by fire, and smoke drifted
from many parts of the capital city just inside the border with
South Africa.
	   The action, post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention, follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Believing a coup was imminent, Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili called on regional powers to intervene, South African
officials said.
	   ``The purpose of the intervention is to stabilize the situation
for the purpose of achieving a lasting political solution,'' said
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is acting head of
state while President Nelson Mandela is out of the country.
	   Buthelezi stressed the operation came under the Southern African
Development Community, a regional group chaired by South Africa.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom slightly smaller than Maryland
with a population of 2 million people, is surrounded by South
African territory.
	   A heavy firefight raged mid-day at a military barracks in the
airport area. South African and Lesotho troops traded automatic
rifle fire, and mortar explosions were heared. Fifteen armored
vehicles equipped with cannons came to reinforce the South
Africans.
	   An Associated Press reporter and photographer were pinned down
inside the barracks area during the battle.
	   Officials said the force had secured Lesotho military
headquarters, the main air force base, central business district
and neighborhood were most diplomats and Cabinet members live.
	   South African troops met strong resistance in the morning at the
royal palace, the Katse Dam in the central part of the country and
two military bases, said a South African military spokeswoman, air
force Lt. Col. Laverne Machine.
	   ``Rebel soldiers at the dam put up a strong fight, and the
contact was a severe one,'' she said. ``The rebels also suffered
heavy casualties.''
	   They faced anti-aircraft and small-arms fire at the Ratjemose
and Makonyane military bases, another spokesman, Maj. Ben van Zyl,
said. He said rebel soldiers were arming civilians with assault
rifles.
	   A South African Broadcasting Corp. cameraman also was injured,
and four Lesotho soldiers were led away as prisoners, SABC radio
said.
	   American citizens -- who number about 60 or 70 in Maseru out of
300 in the country -- were told to stay indoors, U.S. Ambassador
Katherine Peterson said.
	   Flights to Maseru airport were halted.
	   King Letsie III was safe and being protected by South African
troops, Machine said.
	   She said 200 troops from Botswana were expected later in the day
to take part. Six-hundred South African troops, armored personnel
carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units were involved so far,
she said.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers sent troops across its
borders to countries that included Angola and Namibia to take part
in wars and to pursue government opponents, particularly in Lesotho
and Botswana. But since all-race elections in 1994, South Africa
had stuck to a policy of peaceful mediation in African conflicts.
	   The apartheid era ruling National Party, now in the opposition,
``strongly condemned'' the intervention, as did other opposition
parties.
	   ``Such intervention cancels (the) government's previous
commitment to peaceful solutions for conflict situations on the
continent,'' the party said.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   The Congress party won 79 of 80 seats but scored only 61 percent
of the vote because of voting rules, to which the opposition
parties had agreed. The discrepancy is part of the source of
opposition dissatisfaction, Peterson said.
	   Echoing widespread anger at the South Africans, a distraught
opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, condemned the
intervention in a radio interview from Maseru.
	   ``President Mandela, the president of South Africa, has sent a
troop of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people) who
are fighting for their democratic rights,'' she said.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.

September inflation in Ukraine to hit 1998 high of 7.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Spurred by the financial crisis in
neighboring Russia, prices in Ukraine in September are expected to
rise by at least 7.5 percent, the highest monthly inflation rate so
far this year, a top government official said Tuesday.
	   The actual inflation figure might be even higher, given
difficulties in forecasting how the situation could develop,
Economy Minister Vasyl Rohovy said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The expected increase in September's inflation was a new
negative sign for Ukraine's shaky financial system, which has
survived mostly on foreign loans in recent years.
	   Following nearly two years of relative price stability, the
former Soviet republic was badly hit by Russia's financial turmoil,
which only aggravated the Ukrainian government's failure to
implement reforms needed to increase budget revenues and boost
economic growth.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency has been sliding steadily in response
to the Russian ruble's fall, causing a massive increase in prices.
	   Inflation in Ukraine has declined steadily since reaching more
than 10,000 percent in 1993, and the annual rate dropped to 10
percent in 1997 and 2.3 percent in the first eight months of 1998.
	   Inflation in August amounted to 0.2 percent.

Strike may lead to cancellation of hundreds of flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Hundreds of flights to and from Greece may
be canceled or postponed starting Thursday because of a planned
four-day strike by civil aviation employees.
	   A union spokesman said Tuesday the strike will affect all
airports in Greece, including those on popular tourist destinations
on Aegean Sea islands.
	   According to spokesman Pantelis Antonopoulos, civil aviation
workers will not service any charter flights to and from Greece and
only 40 percent of the estimated 665 flights scheduled over the
four days by non-charter airlines. The strike will affect both
Greek and foreign carriers.
	   Neither Antonopoulos nor the civil aviation authority could give
an estimate for the number of charter flights to be affected by the
labor action, but the union said such flights usually number in the
hundreds. Most charters fly to Greek islands directly from European
points.
	   A NOTAM, or notice to airmen, issued by the union includes 266
flights its members will service at Greek airports and adds that it
``bears no responsibility for the problems that may occur to
flights other than the above mentioned.''
	   The union, which has 2,700 members, is demanding wage increases
promised by the government.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rob Mattson scattered six hits and Tuffy Rhodes and
Phil Clark each smashed home runs, leading the Kintetsu Buffaloes
to a 7-2 victory over the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters at Tokyo Dome Tuesday.
	   Norihiro Nakamura also hit two home runs, a pair of two-run

	   Mattson, formerly with a Mexican league team, is 9-5.
	   Rhodes has 21 homers, Clark 30 homers and Nakamura 29 homers.
Both Rhodes and Clark formerly played with the Boston Red Sox.
	   The Fighters are still a half game ahead of the second-place
Seibu Lions, whose scheduled game with the Orix BlueWave at Seibu
Dome was rained out.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, the Chiba Lotte Marines scored five runs in the
fourth inning and went on to beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 9-2 at
Fukuoka Dome.
	   Kenji Yoshitsuru hit a three-run home run, his fourth homer of
the season, in the four-run fifth inning for the Marines.
	   In the Central League, Yusaku Iriki hurled a two-hitter and hit
a two-run single against Nathan Minchey in the five-run sixth
inning as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 6-1 at
Hiroshima.
	   Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, took the loss. He is
14-10.
	   Two other scheduled games were rained out.

Teachers' strike leaves 12,000 Ukrainian pupils out of school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - About 12,000 schoolchildren in four regions
of Ukraine have missed more than three weeks of school because
their teachers are striking to demand back wages, an official said
Tuesday.
	   As many as 965 teachers are on strike at 34 schools in the Kiev,
Chernihiv, Kirovohrad and Zakarpattia regions, said Viktor
Ohneviuk, secondary education department chief at Ukraine's
Education Ministry.
	   The school year in Ukraine began on Sept. 1.
	   Ukrainian teachers are currently owed some 410 million hryvna
(dlrs 132.2 million at the present exchange rate) in back wages. In
the Kirovohrad region, their salaries have not been paid for an
average of six months, Ohneviuk said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The former Soviet republic's economic troubles are affecting
many of the country's 500,000 teachers at about 21,260 schools
across Ukraine. Wages are being paid more or less regularly only in
and around Kiev, the capital, and two other regions, Ohneviuk said.

American Norwood beats Japanese challenger Matsumoto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ American Freddy Norwood stopped Japanese challenger
Koji Matsumoto in the 10th round in a scheduled 12-round World
Boxing Association (WBA) featherweight title bout here Tuesday
night.
	   Norwood's victory left the title vacant since he failed to clear
the limit of 57.1 kilograms (126 pounds) for the featherweight
category in the weigh-in and lost his crown Monday. He was 800
grams (28.22 ounces) over the limit.
	   Referee Stanley Christodolou of South Africa stopped the fight
25 seconds into the 10th round as Norwood hammered the helpless
Japanese with a barrage of blows.
	   If Matsumoto, 28, had won, he could have become the new
champion.
	   There were no knockdowns in the fight before 3,500 spectators at
the Yoyogi national gymnasium annex in downtown Tokyo but Norwood,
also 28, staggered Matsumoto, WBA's No. 12 featherweight contender,
in the eighth round when he landed a strong left hook against his
face.
	   Norwood continued to punish Matsumoto with a series of blows in
the ninth.
	   Through nine rounds, Medardo Villalodos of Panama scored it
89-80, Hector Hertnandez of Mexico had it 87-84 and Moohon Moon of
South Korea 88-83, all for Norwood.
	   It was Norwood's 32nd victory, including 20 knockouts, against
one draw.
	   Matsumoto has a record of 26 victories, including 15 knockouts
and six defeats and one draw.
	   Matsumoto weighed 57.9 kilograms (127 3/4 pounds).
	   Norwood won the title from Antonio Cermeno of Venezuela on April
3, 1998, and has defended it twice.

Taiwan's Lee calls adulterer unfit for office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese may be of two minds over the sex
scandal now gripping Washington, but President Lee Teng-hui said in
no uncertain terms Tuesday that adulterers have no place in public
life in Taiwan.
	   Lee was criticizing the expected candidacy for the legislature
of Huang Yih-chiao, a former provincial government spokesman who
resigned in February after admitting to an extra-marital affair.
	   ``Of course, the most important requirement for a candidate is
talent, but moral quality is even more important,'' Lee was quoted
saying by evening newspapers during a campaign stop in central
Taichung county.
	   Huang, who is expected to announce his candidacy as an
independent next month, retorted that the fact he resigned from his
job over the affair proved his values were solid.
	   ``My morals and sense of responsibility are no worse than the
president's,'' Huang told an audience, also in Taichung.
	   The comments from Lee, a devout Presbyterian, may have been
motivated more by politics than morality. His ruling Nationalist
Party faces an uphill battle in opposition-controlled Taichung in
the Dec. 5 contest, and Huang's candidacy could siphon votes away
from its candidate.
	   But they gained special resonance at a time when Taiwan's
newspapers are saturated with reports of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's admission that he had an affair with a White House
intern.
	   Taiwanese have largely mirrored Americans in their attitudes
towards the scandal, mixing disgust at the revelations with
uncertainty about how they should be handled.
	   Even so, public exposure of infidelities among public figures in
Taiwan can be devastating.
	   Plastics tycoon Wang Yung-ching banished his son to the United
States after an affair with a graduate student was revealed. Former
President Chiang Ching-kuo had twins by a mistress, but never
acknowledged the link.
	   Now divorced, Huang was one of the most familiar faces on
television before a well-known radio talk show hostess went public
with the details of their affair.

International space station faces new delay as Russia falls behind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday dealt another blow to the
long-delayed international space station, saying it will fail for a
third time in its commitment to build a key component.
	   The dlrs 21 billion space station, a joint project of Russia,
the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan, has
already been pushed back one year because the cash-strapped Russian
space industry has broken two previous target dates for the
segment's completion.
	   Despite its repeated pledges, the government has failed to
provide money for the construction of the service module that would
serve as living quarters for the crew.
	   It's now certain that it won't be completed in time to meet an
April launch date, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He said the agency now is ``completely in the dark'' about when
the segment could be finished. A tentative date would be in the
third quarter of next year, Koptev said.
	   The delay casts doubt on a plan to launch the station's first
module on Nov. 20. The cargo module, built by the Russian
Khrunichev company under contract with Boeing, has been completed
and already taken to the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet
republic of Kazakstan in preparation for the launch.
	   NASA was expected to follow on Dec. 3 with the second part, a
connecting passageway.
	   These plans may be reviewed because of the latest delay in
construction of the vital third component that would house the
crew, Koptev said. One possible option is to again delay the first
two launches. Another is to start building the station without the
vital service module.
	   ``We must discuss whether it's feasible to launch the first
segments of the station this year and how to revise the schedule of
further construction in orbit,'' he said.
	   Experts from all 16 countries taking part in the project began
considering future action at talks that started in Moscow on
Tuesday.
	   In a last-ditch effort to prevent new costly delays in the
project, NASA intends to ask Congress and the White House for
approval to buy additional goods and services from the Russian
Space Agency worth as much as dlrs 660 million over the next four
years, according to news reports Monday.
	   However, Koptev bristled at the proposed bailout, saying the
U.S. aid would effectively deprive Russia of its current status as
a major stockholder in the project and turn it into a
subcontractor.
	   ``We need to raise domestic resources,'' he said.

Central bank suspends operations at two Ugandan banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Bank of Uganda has suspended
operations at two private banks because of insolvency at one and
problems with the other's parent bank in neighboring Kenya, a bank
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The Bank of Uganda stopped operations at International Credit
Bank last week because it didn't have enough funds to guarantee
deposits.
	   ``Continued operation under the old management board will be
detrimental to the interests of depositors and the entire financial
system,'' said Bank of Uganda spokesman Walugembe Musoke.
	   The bank accepted a request Monday from Trust Bank Uganda, Ltd.
to suspend operations in Uganda following the closure of its parent
office in Kenya.
	   ``They have requested us to close their bank. The problem is
that it is a subsidiary of Trust Bank Kenya, whose operations were
suspended,'' he said. ``It would be wrong to sit here and wait for
catastrophes.''
	   The Central Bank of Kenya has closed three banks in the past two
weeks, and several more are threatened with takeover after a run on
Trust Bank. The main problem is that the small commercial banks are
undercapitalized, have too many outstanding loans and cannot met
depositors withdrawal requests.
	   The Bank of Tanzania also took over Trust Bank operations in
Tanzania last week until further notice, mainly to protect it from
fallout from the closure of its Kenyan parent, a BoT statement
said.
	   Government offices and diplomatic missions in Uganda had been
paying for fuel with credit cards issued by the International
Credit Bank, owned by an Ugandan businessman.
	   ``It was an extreme position, there was extreme illiquidity and
there was nothing else we could do. We had to come in fast to
protect customers' deposits,'' the Bank of Uganda's Musoke said.
	   Officials declined to mention the financial status of the bank,
but according to Ugandan regulations, each operating bank must
maintain a minimum of five hundred million (about dlrs 500,000) on
deposit, which must not be withdrawn.
	   Amounts of money in loans which are in excess of its total
assets make a bank open to intervention by the central bank.
	   Small commercial banks have mushroomed in Uganda and Kenya
following economic liberalization, but many have had serious
problems calling in outstanding loans and maintaining the minimum
deposit.
	   The Ugandan government is steadfastly divesting itself of the
banking business and has sold off its majority stake in the
country's largest bank, Uganda Commercial Bank, to Malaysian
bankers.
	   The Bank of Uganda maintains it role as overseer of banking and
monetary policies.

Strike may lead to cancellation of hundreds of flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of flights to and from Greece may
be canceled or postponed starting Thursday because of a planned
four-day strike by civil aviation employees.
	   A union spokesman said Tuesday the strike will affect all
airports in Greece, including those at popular tourist
destinations.
	   According to spokesman Pantelis Antonopoulos, civil aviation
workers will not service any charter flights to and from Greece and
only 40 percent of the estimated 665 flights scheduled over the
four days by non-charter airlines. The strike will affect both
Greek and foreign carriers.
	   Neither Antonopoulos nor the civil aviation authority could give
an estimate for the number of charter flights to be affected by the
labor action, but the union said such flights usually number in the
hundreds. Most charters fly to Greek islands directly from European
points.
	   A NOTAM, or notice to airmen, issued by the union includes 266
flights its members will service at Greek airports and adds that it
``bears no responsibility for the problems that may occur to
flights other than the above mentioned.''
	   The union, which has 2,700 members, is demanding wage increases
promised by the government.

Union, employers agree to combine wage talks for west and east

workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ For the first time since German unification in
1990, the union representing metal workers in eastern and western
Germany will negotiate a joint agreement for workers nationwide in
1999.
	   Previously, unions negotiated separate agreements for the 3.4
million members in western Germany and 280,000 in eastern states.
	   Eight years after unification, easterners work three hours
longer than their western counterparts for the same pay,
effectively earning just 90 percent pay, said a spokesman for the
powerful IG Metall union Claus Eilrich.
	   IG Metall and the Gesamtmetall employers association separately
reached an agreement on Monday extending the 38-hour work week for
workers in the five eastern states through the end of the year
2000.
	   Both sides have until Oct. 9 to approve the tentative agreement.
	   A Gesamtmetall spokesman, Werner Stumpfe, called the agreement a
``good omen,'' and an important step on the way to more partnership
in negotiating policies for upcoming year-end wage talks.

Fugitive re-arrested on new extradition bid, lawyer asks release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE HUTTEAU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Longtime American fugitive Ira Einhorn
on Tuesday sought his release after French police arrested him
again on another bid by U.S. authorities to have him extradited to
face a new murder trial.
	   Einhorn was arrested again Sunday night, nine months after a
French judge refused to expel him to the United States, where he
has been convicted of murdering former girlfriend Helen Maddux in
1977.
	   Officials in Pennsylvania have requested Einhorn's extradition
again, promising to retry Einhorn as required under French law.
	   Once a long-haired anti-war and New Age vanguard, Einhorn
appeared in court with short, gray hair, sandals and a gray jogging
suit. He remained silent and relaxed while his lawyer argued for
his release.
	   ``This new request shows a certain determination on the part of
prosecutors in Philadelphia,'' said lawyer Dominique Delthil to the
court. ``I truly have the feeling they're making a personal issue
of this, which is against the spirit of French law.''
	   The court is to consider the release request on Tuesday morning,
while the extradition was not expected to be ruled on for several
weeks, to allow Einhorn's lawyers to study the request.
	   Meanwhile, Einhorn was being held in a prison in Gradignan, a
Bordeaux suburb.
	   Einhorn fled the United States in 1981 and lived under an alias
in a southwestern French village before he was captured in July of
last year.
	   Einhorn was well known in Philadelphia in the 1960s as a leader
of the local anti-war movement and once ran for mayor of the city.
	   Although he wore dirty clothes, had a scraggly beard, long hair
and frequently smelled bad, Einhorn became a successful New Age
personality in the 1970s with an international network of
scientists, corporate sponsors and wealthy benefactors.
	   But in 1981 he was arrested on a murder charge after police
found the remains of Helen Maddux, a Bryn Mawr College graduate
from Tyler, Texas, in a trunk in his apartment. The woman, a former
girlfriend of Einhorn's, had disappeared 18 months before her
remains were discovered.
	   Einhorn was released on bail before his trial and fled the
country. He was convicted in absentia in 1993 and sentenced to life
in prison.

Ukrainian president congratulates Jews upon holiday season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - President Leonid Kuchma congratulated
Ukraine's Jews upon their High Holidays season and pledged that his
country would continue to implement its policy of ethnic and
religious tolerance.
	   ``From the very first steps of its independence, Ukraine has
stated the inalienable right of every citizen _ regardless of his
nationality _ for free expression of his ethnic, cultural and
religious originality,'' the president said, according to his press
service.
	   Anti-Semitism runs deep in Ukraine but Ukrainian Jews have
enjoyed ethnic and religious freedom since the 1991 collapse of the
Soviet Union.
	   Ukrainian Jews numbered 1.5 million before World War II and the
Nazi Holocaust. Today, after Soviet-era assimilation and mass
emigration to Israel, there are an estimated half million.
	   The High Holidays began at sundown Sunday, which marked the
start of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. The season ends next
week with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.

Dlrs 100 arrival fee put off until November 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Bowing to pressure from local and
European tour operators, the government has shelved a proposed dlrs
100 arrival fee that would have taken effect in January.
	   Following the visit to the 92-island Indian Ocean archipelago
last week by British tour operators and agents, the Ministry of
Tourism said Monday the new arrival tax announced in July would be
postponed until November 1999.
	   Dubbed the ``gold card,'' the entry fee would allow visitors
access to all nature reserves and parks in the Seychelles.
	   The government of President France-Albert Rene has been making
an effort to link the fee to its environmental conservation
programs.
	   The tourism ministry said Monday it will begin a drive to
promote eco-tourism in the Seychelles, now known primarily as a
beach and scuba diving destination.
	   In 1997, about 100,000 tourists accounted for the bulk of the
hard currency earnings in Seychelles, a nation of 76,000 people
with the highest annual per capita income in Africa.
	   Residents have been required to pay a dlrs 100 departure fee
since August.

Granik, Hunter acknowledge talks nearly resumed

 &UR; EDS: RESTORES Granik's first name in third graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern and Billy Hunter agreed almost two
weeks ago that it was time to resume collective bargaining talks
between the U.S. National Basketball Association and its players
union.
	   But when they tried to work out the details, the whole idea
quickly fell apart.
	   Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner of the NBA, and Hunter,
president of the union, both acknowledged Monday that talks aimed
at ending the lockout by the clubs nearly resumed on Sept. 10,
though they differed on why such a meeting never took place.
	   ``We invited players to come back to the table, and they
declined,'' Granik said. ``They said as long as we would be talking
about a hard cap or some system that set a defined percentage of
revenues to go toward player salaries, they didn't see any point of
meeting.''
	   Hunter said he proposed a small meeting, with four
representatives from each side. But when Stern asked that the
meeting be held when the eight members of the owners labor
committee were in town, Hunter declined.
	   ``I just don't think it's progressive or beneficial when there
are 40 people in the room,'' said Hunter, who nonetheless tried to
call Granik on Monday to discuss moving the process forward.
	   Only one formal bargaining session has been held this summer
toward reaching a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) _ the
main deal that establishes work rules like salary caps, minimum
salaries, trading or transfer regulations and roster limits, and
the league is expected to begin canceling pre-season exhibition
games later this week.
	   Training camps are due to open Oct. 6 and the regular season
Nov. 3, but without a new CBA the league will be forced to cancel
games because of a work stoppage for the first time in its history.
	   Both sides are still waiting for a decision from arbitrator John
Feerick, who will rule on the players' grievance contending that
some 220 players with dlrs 800 million worth of guaranteed
contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   The lockout is like a strike by the club owners, who essentially
say without a contract they will not pay the players and will not
let them play until a new deal is in place.
	   Feerick's ruling is not expected until early October.
	   The sides remain far apart on the main economic issue of the
salary cap, with owners saying they need a new system that will not
allow salary growth to continue to outpace revenue growth.
	   Owners had the right to opt out of the old labor agreement if
the percentage of basketball related income devoted to salaries
rose above 51.8 percent, and the league claims that number topped
57 percent last season.
	   The owners haven't made a formal proposal since June, before the
lockout began, and the players' most recent proposal on Aug. 6 was
rejected emphatically as Stern, Granik and six owners walked out of
a bargaining session upon hearing it.
	   Hunter said the league has taken a longer look at that proposal
since then, and claimed Granik told him that the players' newest
ideas had substance.
	   Upon hearing that statement, Hunter said, he asked that the next
negotiating session be kept small so that progress might be made.
	   When Stern came back the next day and asked that owners Gordon
Gund (Cleveland), Jerry Buss (Lakers), Jerry Colangelo (Phoenix),
Les Alexander (Houston), Dave Checketts (New York), Peter Holt (San
Antonio), Abe Pollin (Washington) and Mickey Arison (Miami) be
included, Hunter declined.
	   Still, Hunter agreed Monday that it's time to move forward.
	   ``Once I make contact, I will both suggest and inquire if they
want to meet. We'll see how things evolve,'' he said.
	   Granik said his side remains ready to negotiate.
	   ``We're ready to bargain at any point,'' he said. ``If somehow
the occasion arises that it will be fruitful, we might invite them
back again _ even though they declined the last time we asked
them.''

British tobacco companies sue over EU ad ban

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The four top British tobacco companies said
Tuesday they have gone to court to fight European Union decisions
banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
	   The 15-member EU recently approved measures that would outlaw
most tobacco advertising within four years, while banning tobacco
sponsorship of major cultural and sporting events by 2006.
	   The running battle has pitted those who blame cigarettes for
killing hundreds of thousands of EU citizens against those who say
Formula One racing won't survive in Europe without the backing of
tobacco money.
	   ``This is totally unjustified and we will vigorously challenge
the basis on which these restrictions to a legal product are being
introduced,'' said David Swan, chief executive of the Tobacco
Manufacturers' Association, the lobbying group for British tobacco.
	   The companies _ British American Tobacco Investments Ltd.,
Gallaher Ltd., Imperial Ltd. and Rothmans (UK) Ltd. _ say any
legislation about tobacco advertising or sponsorship is a public
health matter that under European law must be decided on a
nation-by-nation basis.
	   EU Health Commissioner Padraig Flynn disagrees.
	   ``We are confident we can defend ourselves against any legal
challenge,'' said Flynn's spokeswoman, Barbara Nolan. ``We're on
solid ground.''
	   Anti-smoking activists accused the tobacco companies of
``pointless posturing'' that could delude organizers of
tobacco-sponsored events into thinking the cigarette money will
keep rolling in.
	   ``All the credible evidence shows that tobacco advertising
increases smoking and is used to nurture smoking in teen-agers,''
said Clive Bates, director of Action on Smoking and Health, or ASH.
``People ultimately die as a result of tobacco advertising and the
industry wants to keep it that way.''

Top international official meets Serb politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Trying to keep post-war
democracy-building on track, Bosnia's top international official
told Serb nationalists on Tuesday that only those who respected the
Dayton peace accords would receive foreign aid.
	   Bosnian High Representative Carlos Westendorp was meeting
politicians from rival Bosnian Serb camps for the first time since
the Sept. 12-13 election, and an apparent defeat of the
western-backed candidate for the presidency.
	   Although the final tally of the vote won't be known until later
this week, there are strong indications that a nationalist Nikola
Poplasen defeated Biljana Plavsic, the U.S.-backed incumbent, in
the presidential race.
	   Plavsic conceded defeat Monday even before results were
available but said she would remain on the political scene to fight
for democracy in the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia.
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia; reviving a measure of
coexistence among Serbs, Muslims and Croats after 3{ years of war
that ended in 1995 with a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The message to different party leaders is whatever the result
is going to be, what we expect from them is full cooperation to
implement Dayton,'' he said. ``It is clear that the parties which
do not cooperate ... will act in detriment of the (Bosnian Serb)
population ... because they will not get any support from the
international community.''
	   ``Given that most of the political party leaders have said
openly in the election campaign they will comply with Dayton, there
is hope we can cooperate with all.'' he said.
	   Poplasen is the leader of an extreme nationalist Radical Party
in the Serb-run entity of Bosnia and a supporter of war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   But in an interview with the Associated Press Monday, Poplasen
denied fears that he will not cooperate with the West. He said he
would stick to the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing more
and nothing less.''
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   Plavsic's government has improved ties with the West following
her break with the pro-Karadzic camp last year and a pledge to
implement the Dayton accords. The moderates have received millions
of dollars of international aid which had been denied to the
previous, hardline government.
	   On Tuesday, Plavsic's Serb National Alliance said that the party
would not dispute any results announced by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Longtime American fugitive Ira Einhorn
on Tuesday sought his release after French police arrested him
again on another bid by U.S. authorities to have him extradited to
face a new murder trial.
	   Einhorn was arrested again Sunday night, nine months after a
French judge refused to expel him to the United States, where he
has been convicted of murdering former girlfriend Helen Maddux in
1977.
	   Officials in Pennsylvania have requested Einhorn's extradition
again, promising to retry Einhorn as required under French law.
	   Once a long-haired anti-war and New Age vanguard, Einhorn
appeared in court with short, gray hair, sandals and a gray jogging
suit. He remained silent and relaxed while his lawyer argued for
his release.
	   ``This new request shows a certain determination on the part of
prosecutors in Philadelphia,'' said lawyer Dominique Delthil to the
court. ``I truly have the feeling they're making a personal issue
of this, which is against the spirit of French law.''
	   Einhorn's Swedish companion Anika Flodkin, with whom Einhorn has
lived in a converted mill in the southwestern village of
Champagne-Mouton, also attended the hearing.
	   The court is to consider the release request on Tuesday morning,
while the extradition was not expected to be ruled on for several
weeks, to allow Einhorn's lawyers to study the request.
	   Meanwhile, Einhorn was being held in a prison in Gradignan, a
Bordeaux suburb. He was arrested Sunday when he reported to a local
police station, as he is required to do every week under terms of
his previous release, said a secretary for Delthil.
	   Einhorn fled the United States in 1981 and lived under an alias
in France before he was captured in June of last year.
	   Einhorn was well known in Philadelphia in the 1960s as a leader
of the local anti-war movement and once ran for mayor of the city.
	   Although he wore dirty clothes, had a scraggly beard, long hair
and frequently smelled bad, Einhorn became a successful New Age
personality in the 1970s with an international network of
scientists, corporate sponsors and wealthy benefactors.
	   But in 1981 he was arrested on a murder charge after police
found the remains of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux, a Bryn Mawr College
graduate from Tyler, Texas, in a trunk in his apartment. The woman,
a former girlfriend of Einhorn's, had disappeared 18 months before
her remains were discovered.
	   Einhorn was released on dlrs 40,000 bail before his trial and
fled the country. He was convicted in absentia in 1993 and
sentenced to life in prison.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Three bombings and clashes between the
army and Muslim militants across Algeria have left 12 people dead
and 20 injured, officials said Tuesday.
	   The resurgence of violence this month came as troops carried out
new sweeps against the militants, reportedly encircling hundreds of
fighters belonging to the Armed Islamic Group.
	   On Monday, a bomb exploded near a passing military truck in
Saida, 400 kms (240 miles) southwest of Algiers, killing two
soldiers and injuring four pedestrians, hospital officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The bombing came during a military sweep in the region since
Thursday, in which troops have encircled 350 members of the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), local authorities said, also on anonymity.
	   There was no official confirmation of the operation, though the
eventual capture of the fighters would mark a heavy blow to the
GIA, the most violent group of a 6 1/2-year-old insurgency.
	   In other violence, Muslim militants on Monday bombed and
ambushed another truck carrying police near the southern outskirts
of Tizi-Ouzou, capital of the northeastern Berber region, killing
one person and injuring 10 others, hospital officials said.
	   The truck was escorting another truck carrying prisoners, though
the attackers were unable to open the doors and free the inmates
before fleeing.
	   Another bombing on Monday injured six people on a highway near
Sidi Akacha, 200 kms (120 miles) west of Algiers. The bomb was
planted near a fruit and vegetable market, and a second bomb found
nearby was dismantled.
	   Soldiers at a base in Tafsour, 440 kms (260 miles) west of
Algiers, shot and killed three members of the Armed Islamic Group
who were believed on a reconnaissance mission. Two other GIA
members were killed near Mascara, 400 kms (240 miles) west of
Algiers, officials said Tuesday.
	   Security forces also killed four suspected GIA members in Ain
Oussera, 150 kms (80 miles) south of Algiers, as the group tried to
plant a bomb in a market, officials said Tuesday.
	   The insurgency in this petroleum-rich North African nation began
after the military-backed government canceled second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win. More than 75,000 people have been
killed.
	   President Liamine Zeroual last week announced he would call an
early presidential election by February and would not run for
re-election.

Plan moves traffic from Stonehenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 125 million pound (dlrs 209 million) plan will
move a busy road away Stonehenge, distancing the mysterious
5,000-year-old site from ``its surrounding pollution and clutter,''
the government said Tuesday.
	   The plan will include a 1.25-mile (2 kms) tunnel, bypass and a
visitors center for the famous site in Wiltshire, 90 miles (145
kms) southwest of London.
	   ``We can get rid of the present mess, remove all the unsightly
modern surroundings, remove the traffic noise and intrusion, and
return Stonehenge to its original landscape,'' Culture Secretary
Chris Smith said. ``Visitors will be able once again to wander
freely round and through the stones in open downland. This is a
prize to be fought for.''
	   Farmers affected by the plan will be compensated over the next
20 years.
	   Stonehenge, which had been off limits to visitors since a hippie
riot 10 years ago, reopened this year to the age-old summer
solstice ceremonies of the world's pagans.
	   The English Heritage, the nation's watchdog for historical
monuments, permitted 100 pagan worshippers and members of the
public to watch the June 21 sunrise from inside Stonehenge.
	   The area usually is roped off to visitors, who must view the
ancient ring of rocks from a distance.

Spanish parliament meets to vote on easing abortion law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In what was expected to be a deeply
divisive debate, parliamentary deputies convened Tuesday to discuss
and vote on whether to relax Spain's abortion law.
	   Up for discussion were three proposals aimed at easing the 1985
legislation that decriminalized abortion. The existing law allows
abortion through the first 12 weeks of pregnancies judged to be
dangerous to the mother's life or mental health, as well as in
cases of rape, incest or fetal malformation.
	   The main opposition Socialist party's proposal, the one expected
to get most support, would also allow the termination of any
pregnancy in the first 12 weeks if it created a personal, social or
family conflict for the woman.
	   This proposal has already been blocked twice by conservative
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party since it took
office in 1996 with a simple parliamentary majority.
	   If all Spain's 350 deputies turned up to vote, the Socialist
proposal could be expected to be backed by the party's 141
representatives and rejected by the Popular Party's 156
parliamentary members, leaving its fate in the hands of the
chamber's other 53 members.
	   Two other proposals to decriminalize abortion for up to 14 and
16 weeks after conception, tabled by smaller parties, were also due
to be debated Tuesday.
	   Although yes votes for any of the three projects would be seen
as victories for pro-choice activists, any approved proposal could
still suffer substantial modification before becoming law as it
passed through subsequent parliamentary stages.
	   The debate comes a day after some 3,000 antiabortion activists
protested in Madrid demanding a `No' vote from deputies.
	   Spain's influential Roman Catholic Church has also stepped into
the fray with priests all over the country on Sunday denouncing
those calling for changes in the law.
	   Defending the church's intervention, the spokesman for the
Spanish Episcopal Conference, Juan Jose Asenjo, claimed Tuesday
that ``future generations would probably feel ashamed about
abortion as we do about the Inquisition and Nazi genocide.''

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria strongly criticized the Turkish
presence in northern Iraq on Tuesday, saying it was aimed at
``changing the Arab identity there.''
	   Turkey is believed to maintain several thousand troops in
northern Iraq to prevent insurgents from crossing into its
territory. But it refuses to confirm that the force is permanent,
saying only that troops cross into Iraq whenever necessary.
	   Syria's long-strained relations with Turkey have deteriorated
recently over disagreements in sharing the waters of the Euphrates
River, which passes through both countries, and improving ties
between Turkey and Israel, Syria's biggest foe.
	   Syria's Tishrin newspaper, which speaks for the government,
suggested Turkey's presence in northern Iraq was permanent. Turkey
is fighting an insurgency by Kurds seeking autonomy in southeastern
Turkey, and the rebels have sometimes taken refuge in northern
Iraq.
	   ``Foremost of these ambitions is occupying northern Iraq and
changing the Arab identity there,'' the newspaper said.
	   Most of northern Iraq is under the control of Iraqi Kurdish
groups. The groups received Western protection following their
defeat by the Iraqi government in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Germany threatened Yugoslav President
Slobodon Milosevic with military force Tuesday if he doesn't loosen
his grip on the separatist province of Kosovo, saying NATO was
prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis.
	   In a speech to world leaders gathered for the General Assembly,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned the use of force by
Milosevic's forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence for ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   However, ``Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic,'' Kinkel said in prepared text.
``He must realize that the international community will react with
military force if necessary.''
	   Milosevic also came under heated criticism by Wolfgang Schussel,
the Austrian foreign minister, who demanded he stop the repression
in Kosovo and withdrawn Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   ``Their police and military operations have led to consequences
for the civilian population that are out of any justifiable
proportion,'' Schussel said in prepared text, speaking on behalf of
the European Union.
	   He called for negotiations between the two sides as soon as
possible to ``define a new status for Kosovo.''
	   ``However, without cessation of the ongoing Serb offensive, an
end to further bloodshed, and a significant improvement of the
catastrophic humanitarian situation, a meaningful dialogue cannot
be started,'' he said.
	   Hundreds have been killed and over a quarter-million displaced
since Serb forces in February began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists who are fighting for independence for the province.
Western nations support returning autonomy for Kosovo which
Milosevic withdrew in 1989.
	   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged strong action
by the Security Council to stop the crackdown by Serb forces on
ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Britain and France last week began drafting a resolution that
would demand an immediate cease-fire and ``an urgent end to the
trampling on the rights of the inhabitants of Kosovo,'' Blair said.
	   The two countries were pushing for a council resolution that
would authorize force to make Milosevic comply, council sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia, however, has said it was flatly opposed to any threats
of force.
	   Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov was to speak later Tuesday
morning and was expected to touch on the conflict.
	   On Tuesday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on villages in
the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance in Drenica with heavy
artillery and tank fire.
	   ``The European Union is extremely concerned at the dramatic
escalation of tension in Kosovo,'' Schussel said.
	   Because the primary responsibility rests with Serb and Yugoslav
forces, ``it is up to Slobodon Milosevic, as the president of the
FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) to order a halt to all
repressive actions against the civilian population of Kosovo.

Second typhoon in two days strikes western Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with typhoon dissipating, figures of dead and missing

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A powerful typhoon swept through western Japan on
Tuesday, killing eight, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes
and leaving more than a million dwellings without electricity.
	   A 41-year-old man was killed and two others injured after their
car was buried at the entrance of a highway tunnel that collapsed
in Fukui prefecture (state), 323 kilometers (202 miles) west of
Tokyo, Japan's National Police Agency said.
	   In addition to the eight deaths across six prefectures, one
person was missing and some 154 were injured by the storm, police
said.
	   Kyodo news reported the death toll had risen to nine, but police
were unable to confirm the figure.
	   A man in Shiga prefecture in central Japan died after falling
into a raging river, and two elderly women were killed in separate
locations by flying glass in Nara prefecture.
	   A 78-year-old man in Aichi prefecture died after being pinned
under a greenhouse door. A 55-year-old truck driver in Kyoto was
missing after his truck skidded into a river.
	   Typhoon Vicki packed winds of 144 kilometers (89 miles) per hour
as it came ashore near Gobo, about 438 kilometers (299 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, just after 1:00 p.m. (0400 GMT), the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The storm dissipated as it moved across Japan's main island and
had winds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour as it passed through
Yamagata prefecture, 291 kilometers (182 miles) north of Tokyo, at
10 p.m. (1300 GMT) Tuesday. The storm was moving north-northeast at
a speed of about 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour and was expected
to hit the northern island of Hokkaido on Wednesday, the agency
said.
	   Typhoon Vicki caused the cancellation of 264 flights, affecting
26,000 passengers, and disrupted train service through western and
central Japan.
	   Some 1.25 million homes in 15 western prefectures were left
without power part of Tuesday, news reports said.
	   In the port city of Kobe, 435 kilometers (272 miles) west of
Tokyo, 15,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes as a
major river threatened to burst its banks, the reports said.
	   Dozens of homes were flooded because of heavy rains in Aichi
Prefecture (state), central Japan, the reports said.
	   On Monday, a less powerful storm hit western Japan, smashing
windows and blowing away roof tiles as it crossed the country
before dissipating in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first time in 10 years that two typhoons have hit
Japan on successive days.

Queen's father discharged from hospital after bladder surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Bernhard, the father of
Dutch Queen Beatrix, left hospital Tuesday following succesful
surgery to remove scar tissue from his bladder.
	   The German-born prince left the Academic Hospital in the central
Dutch city of Utrecht and returned to Soesdijk Palace, according to
a Royal House statement.
	   Surgeons on Saturday removed scar tissue resulting from a 1982
operation. The tissue had become painful following surgery in May
this year to treat an enlargement of the prince's prostate.
	   As well as prostate surgery, the 87-year-old prince also
underwent an operation earlier this year to repair a partially
detached retina in his left eye.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Two U.N. warehouses have been looted of
relief supplies worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, a relief
agency official said Tuesday.
	   Jim Worrall, a coordinator for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Tirana, said the warehouses in Tirana and Bajram Curri,
in northern Albania, stored bedding, tents, blankets, soap and
construction materials.
	   Local agencies, including the Albanian Red Cross and the Islamic
Society in Bajram Curri, also have been robbed, he said.
	   ``This is the first bad one,'' in recent months Worrall said,
adding that previous recent thefts mostly have been small-scale
robberies from truck shipments.
	   According to Worrall, last week's rioting in Tirana, the
capital, provided a cover for looting gangs to hit warehouses of
international agencies.
	   On Sept. 14, the second day of the Tirana riots and the
subsequent evening, robbers entered the UNHCR warehouse and took
supplies and equpiment welll worth over dlrs 100,000 Worrall said.
	   Between then and this week, robbers in Bajram Curri struck three
times, Worrall said, hitting warehouses there of the UNHCR, the
Islamic Society and the Albanian Red Cross.

Top international official meets Serb politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
official told Serb nationalists Tuesday that only those who respect
the Dayton peace accords would receive foreign aid.
	   Bosnian High Representative Carlos Westendorp was meeting
politicians from rival Bosnian Serb camps for the first time since
Sept. 12-13 elections.
	   Although the final vote results won't be known until later this
week, there are strong indications that nationalist Nikola Poplasen
defeated Biljana Plavsic, the U.S.-backed incumbent, in the race
for president of the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia.
	   Plavsic conceded defeat Monday even before results were
available but said she would remain on the political scene to fight
for democracy.
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal a blow to a key part of the
West's strategy in Bosnia: reviving a measure of coexistence among
Serbs, Muslims and Croats after 3 1-2 years of war that ended in
1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The message to different party leaders is whatever the result
is going to be, what we expect from them is full cooperation to
implement Dayton,'' Westendorp said.
	   ``The parties which do not cooperate ... will act in detriment
of the (Bosnian Serb) population ... because they will not get any
support from the international community.''
	   ``Given that most of the political party leaders have said
openly in the election campaign they will comply with Dayton, there
is hope we can cooperate with all,'' Westendorp said.
	   The moderates under Plavsic have received millions of dollars of
international aid which had been denied to the previous, hard-line
government.
	   Poplasen is the leader of the extreme nationalist Radical Party
in the Serb-run part of Bosnia and a supporter of war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Poplasen
dismissed fears that he will not cooperate with the West. He said
he would stick to the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing
more and nothing less.''
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   Plavsic's government has improved ties with the West following
her break with the pro-Karadzic camp last year and a pledge to
implement the Dayton accords.

Three held for questioning bombing to be released on police bond

 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with government expells two Sudanese remaining
from group of 16 aliens picked for questioning; minor edits &QL; 
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Three men held for questioning in
the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy will be released on police
bond but will remain under investigation, a senior police official
said Tuesday.
	   ``There is not enough evidence to bring formal charges against
them, but investigations into their possible role are continuing,''
Adadi Rajabu, director of criminal investigations, told reporters.
	   ``The three may later assist police as witnesses for the
prosecution, or they may face prosecution,'' he said.
	   He said the three had provided valuable information to
investigators.
	   The government also said Tuesday it had expelled the last two of
16 foreigners picked up for questioning in connection with the
bombing.
	   Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said two
Sudanese men, one of them an employee at the Sudanese Embassy in
Dar es Salaam, were deported Saturday.
	   Chilambo said El-Sadiq Elyahdi Khogali Ibrahim, who worked at
the embassy, and Rashid Leghman were in the country legally, but
``because they were suspected of involvement in the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy, and there was no evidence to connect them to the
crime, the government said it was undesirable to these people to
continue living in the country.''
	   One of the three to be released on police bond, Thomas Lyimo, is
the owner of a metal workshop where some reports indicate the bomb
that killed 11 people could have been mounted on a vehicle.
	   Rajabu refused to identify the other two men, other than confirm
that one was a Tanzanian and the other an Algerian.
	   ``Investigators expect to get important findings this week or
next week from the ongoing analysis of materials collected from the
bomb site,'' Rajabu said.
	   Among possible information, he said, could be the fate of the
driver's assistant or ``turnboy,'' who normally rode in the tanker
truck that periodically delivered water to the embassy located in a
residential neighborhood.
	   He said investigators were conducting DNA analysis of fragments
of human remains found at the bomb site and comparing results with
items provided by the man's relatives to determine whether he was
killed in the explosion. The man disappeared from his home before
the bombing and has not been seen since.
	   The cab of the tanker truck, that appeared to have been outside
the embassy gates at the time of the blast, was badly damaged, but
the tank itself was only slightly damaged.
	   Rajabu did not identify the turnboy and acknowledged that the
mystery behind his fate was bogging the investigation down.
	   Rajabu said police were still looking for several fugitives
wanted for questioning on their ``direct involvement'' in the
bombing, but he declined to give names, numbers or nationalities.
	   On Monday, a magistrate's court in Dar es Salaam filed formal
charges on 11 counts of murder each against Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, who also uses the
names Saleh Aben Alahales and Said Ahmed.
	   The next court hearing was scheduled for Oct. 5, when a trial
date could be set.
	   Rajabu said both men would be tried in Tanzania ``because the
crime was committed in the country, and all the victims were
Tanzanian.''
	   Actually, one of the victims was a Somali married to an American
woman.
	   A nearly simultaneous blast destroyed the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kenya, killing 248 people, 12 of them Americans.
	   Two suspects were flown from Kenya to the United States where
formal complaints have been filed against them for the murders of
the 12 Americans in U.S. federal court in Manhattan.
	   On Tuesday, the Daily Nation newspaper in Nairobi said it had
reported Aug. 18, 10 days after the bombing, that Mustafa Mahmoud
Said Ahmed had given information last November to Kenyan security
officials about bombings planned in the region and that the
information had been given to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the report.

Prosecutors arrest former Japanese Defense Agency official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors indicted a former senior Japanese
Defense Agency official and three company executives Tuesday in a
corruption scandal over military contracts, a news report said.
	   The men indicted are suspected of allowing a private supply
company to keep profits it made by inflating its bill to the
government in exchange for giving jobs to retiring Defense Agency
employees.
	   One of those indicted was Kenichi Ueno, 59, former deputy head
of the Defense Agency's procurement division, Kyodo News reported.
	   Ueno is suspected of having conspired to reduce the amount of
money Toyo Communication Equipment Co. had to reimburse the
government after overcharging for military supplies.
	   Prosecutors also indicted Toyo Communication president Shinichi
Ito and sales director Yasunori Nagamoto, along with Hideo Arai, a
former defense project promotion chief at NEC Corp. _ the largest
shareholder in Toyo Communications _ and the current head of
another NEC affiliate, according to Kyodo.
	   The four had been arrested Sept. 3 on suspicion of breach of
trust.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.2 million) to the government in 1994 for having sold
overpriced equipment during a five-year period. But it wound up
only having to return 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4 million) to
government coffers.
	   In return for the lower payment, Ueno, who left the agency in
1995, allegedly pressured Toyo Communication to hire several
retired Defense Agency officials.
	   Earlier this year, Tokyo prosecutors arrested officials working
at the Finance Ministry and central bank on influence-peddling
charges.

Zanardi, Ralf Schumacher join Williams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROVE, England (AP) _ Two-time CART series champion Alex Zanardi
of Italy is returning to Formula One next year, joining Ralf
Schumacher at Williams, the team announced Tuesday.
	   The two drivers replace 1997 Formula One champion Jacques
Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen at Williams. Villeneuve is
moving to the new British American racing and Frentzen is going to
Jordan.
	   The 31-year-old Zanardi just wrapped up his second CART series
title in the United States driving for Target/Chip Ganassi Racing.
	   He drove in 25 Formula One races from 1991 through 1994 for
Jordan Ford, Minardi Lamborghini, Lotus Ford and Lotus Mugen Honda.
His best finish was sixth place in the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix
for Lotus Ford.
	   Zanardi has posted 14 victories and 25 podium finishes in 48
races since joining the Target/Ganassi team in 1996.
	   ``Honestly, I had opportunities to leave the team earlier on,
but I never considered them because I felt staying with Chip was
the best opportunity for me at the time,'' he said.
	   ``I feel that I have gotten the most out of my three years and
now it's time to turn a page in my career,'' Zanardi added.
	   Terms were not disclosed, although reports suggested Zanardi
would earn 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.7 million) and Schumacher 2
million (dlrs 3.3 million).
	   The 23-year Schumacher is the younger brother of two-time
Formula One champion Michael Schumacher. He joined Jordan last
season and has yet to win a race.
	   Ralf Schumacher stared slowly this season but has finished
second and third in the last two Grand Prix races.
	   The moves leaves Williams, the top team in Formula One this
decade, with two drivers who have yet to win an F1 race.
	   ``We believe we have a very strong lineup for the 1999 season,''
said Williams owner Frank Williams.
	   ``We are excited at the prospect of welcoming a second
transatlantic champion to the team in Alex,'' he added, referring
to Villeneuve, who joined Williams after winning the Indianapolis
500 and the series championship.
	   ``Ralf is showing great potential. We strongly believe that he
has a remarkable career ahead of him. They are both racers that
should be good competition for each other.''

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Duchess of York and a small
group of fellow mourners held a private burial service Tuesday for
her mother, Susana Barrantes, who died in a weekend car crash.
	   Brief rites were conducted at mid-morning at El Pucara, the
country estate where Mrs. Barrantes was buried alongside her late
husband, not far from the grounds where they once raised polo
ponies.
	   ``There were literally about 20 people there, just family and
very close friends. The service was conducted by the local
priest,'' said the Duchess of York's spokeswoman, Kate Waddington.
	   Police kept journalists back from the gates of the horse and
cattle-farming estate and some mourners left quickly in their cars
after the service, which lasted less than an hour.
	   Speaking from England, Waddington said that a memorial service
would be held for Mrs. Barrantes on Thursday evening or Friday
morning in the capital of Buenos Aires.
	   Police said Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday
night when the Rover she was driving collided with van near her
estate, about 310 miles (510 kilometers) southwest of Buenos Aires.
	   Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by marriage Rafael Barrantes,
25, escaped with minor injuries. The driver of the other car, Jose
Maria Rodriguez, suffered a broken ankle, police said.
	   Rafael Barrantes attended the burial and those sending flowers
included Argentine President Carlos Menem, said the Argentine news
agency Diarios y Noticias.
	   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, arrived a day
earlier after a night flight from Britain and went directly to her
mother's country estate outside Buenos Aires.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia,
also flew in for the funeral.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was the widow of Hector Barrantes, an Argentine
polo player, and ex-wife of the duchess's father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, the queen's former polo manager.
	   Mrs. Barrantes left Ferguson for Barrantes and settled with him
in Argentina in 1975. Hector Barrantes died of cancer in 1990.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ President Charles Taylor vowed not to
attack the U.S. Embassy in Liberia, where a former warlord accused
of treason has been holed up since the weekend, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   The embassy has been on alert since Roosevelt Johnson
unexpectedly arrived at the gate Saturday morning, sparking a
police commando attack that killed at least three of his supporters
and wounded two Americans.
	   A political group believed to be linked to Taylor called for
demonstrations demanding Johnson be turned over to the government.
Such a demonstration would add to an already volatile situation at
the embassy, though organizers insisted it would be peaceful.
	   ``I think the U.S. government respects the relationship with
Liberia and will do nothing to subvert the process'' Citizens
Action Committee chairman Allison Barco said on Taylor's KISS-FM
radio. The Action Committee, which calls itself a pro-democracy
group, is widely believed to be closely tied to Taylor.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Black is beautiful _ especially if you're black
and have some green (dollars).
	   Or if you're Korean, Latino or part of a few other ethnic
groups, you're the target of major brokerages, individual
investment counselors and education programs. They all want to help
start or continue individual wealth-building portfolios among
members of these groups, and fatten their own businesses.
	   ``I definitely see a lot of interest in companies wanting to
know how to reach black investors. They are hiring people to do
ethnic marketing,'' said Carol Davis, president of the Coalition of
Black Investors, known as COBI.
	   ``They realize there are affluent African-Americans, there are
affluent Hispanics, there are affluent Asians, there are affluent
women, a whole market they are not reaching with their broad-based
marketing.''
	   The nonprofit coalition, just a year old, sponsored a financial
services seminar in Washington, D.C., over this past weekend
involving firms as big as American Express, Merrill Lynch and Co.
and Prudential Securities. Twenty-three firms signed on as
exhibitors.
	   The group also sponsored a black investment week this spring
that included education programs at churches and brokerages alike.
	   COBI also asked blacks to pledge to pay themselves _ through
savings accounts or investments _ each week.
	   Davis said the commitments total dlrs 3 million a month. ``We
think it's a great start. And it shows that a lot of people just
need a little nudge.''
	   The interest in ethnic markets, particularly the black segment,
stems from studies of investment and spending practices by the
groups.
	   Black households with annual incomes of dlrs 50,000 invest far
less than their white counterparts, according to a survey by Ariel
Mutual Funds, a black-owned investment firm, and discount brokerage
Charles Schwab and Co. That means much less wealth and retirement
fund flexibility for black households.
	   Other survey show that blacks, Asians and Latinos have a
combined annual spending power of roughly dlrs 1 trillion. Blacks
generate up to dlrs 533 billion of that amount.
	   ``I will enjoy the abundance. I will enjoy the abundance,''
financial advice author and television host Kelvin Boston exhorted
an audience at a New York conference two weeks ago on marketing to
minorities.
	   There's also been public pressure on Wall Street to pay more
attention to minorities.
	   In January, the Rev. Jesse Jackson brought President Clinton,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan to address Wall Streeters about expanding their base.
	   ``Discrimination is patently immoral, but it is now increasingly
being seen as unprofitable,'' Greenspan, to a standing ovation,
told the conference.
	   Since then, some of Wall Street's best-known financial houses
have increased their advertising in Black Enterprise magazine, a
leading proponent of capitalism among black Americans.
	   From the January to October issues, the publication headed by
Earl G. Graves had an additional 22 advertising pages bringing in
dlrs 425,000 above annual advertising revenues that already
exceeded dlrs 2.3 million. Many of the advertisers were new or
returning financial services companies such as Aetna Inc., Charles
Schwab and the Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
	   In addition to the latest conference, which was tied to the
Congressional Black Caucus weekend, COBI also held a one-day
congressional seminar last Thursday.
	   There was a separate two-day multicultural marketing conference
in New York two weeks ago, and a series of separate financial
seminars.
	   ``That's the big thing in 1998, an explosion of interest in
black consumers,'' said Tony Chappelle, publisher of Securities
Pro, a newsletter that tracks the financial activities of blacks on
Wall Street and Main Street.
	   But that comes with the understanding that ``they're not doing
any goodwill stuff. It's about money,'' said Boston.
	   American Express is among the companies that recently focused on
underserved markets.
	   ``It's a huge market,'' said Alfred Osbourne, a senior financial
adviser at American Express who spoke at the marketing conference.
Among other things, American Express is using Black Enterprise's
mailing list to reach black consumers with household incomes of
dlrs 50,000.
	   American Express set up diversity labs 5 1/2 years ago to
explore how best to reach blacks, gays and lesbians, and women,
creating networks of advisers and targeting markets.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Two U.N. warehouses were looted of relief
supplies worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, a relief agency
official said Tuesday.
	   Jim Worrall, a coordinator for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Tirana, said the warehouses in Tirana and Bajram Curri,
in northern Albania, stored bedding, tents, blankets, soap and
construction materials.
	   Local agencies, including the Albanian Red Cross and the Islamic
Society in Bajram Curri, also have been robbed, he said.
	   ``This is the first bad one,'' in recent months Worrall said,
adding that previous thefts mostly have been small-scale robberies
from truck shipments.
	   According to Worrall, last week's rioting in Tirana, the
capital, provided a cover for looting gangs to hit warehouses of
international agencies.
	   On Sept. 14, the second day of the Tirana riots and the
subsequent evening, robbers entered the UNHCR warehouse and took
supplies and equipment well worth over dlrs 100,000 Worrall said.
	   Between then and this week, robbers in Bajram Curri struck three
times, Worrall said, hitting warehouses there of the UNHCR, the
Islamic Society and the Albanian Red Cross.

Hannelore Kohl says world wants her husband's re-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's wife says her
husband has the support of world leaders who want to see him
re-elected _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``They all say, `Helmut, we've got our fingers crossed. You do
it,'' Hannelore Kohl was quoted as saying in the weekly Munich
gossip magazine Bunte. The rare interview _ Mrs. Kohl usually does
not speak to the press _ was published Tuesday.
	   Kohl, the West's longest serving leader, is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term in elections Sunday. His campaign against
rival Gerhard Schroeder has emphasized Kohl's experience with
international diplomacy and clout with world politicians.
	   Mrs. Kohl also put a positive spin on derisive campaign comments
that her portly, 68-year-old husband resembles an elephant. The
elephant is ``an animal of special strength and sensitivity,'' she
said, adding ``A thick skin isn't so bad.''
	   The chancellor can be clever, too, she was quoted as saying. As
evidence, Mrs. Kohl told a story about a trip her husband took as a
young man to France. Spotting a young woman in a cafe, he bet his
friends he could meet her within 20 minutes.
	   ``I was the French girl, naturally,'' Mrs. Kohl told Bunte,
explaining that the two had met before at dance classes back in
Germany. His friends did not know that. And Kohl won the bet.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops rumbled into this
tiny mountain kingdom at dawn Tuesday to quell weeks of anarchy and
took control of key sites amid heavy fighting, the military command
in Pretoria said.
	   Facing unexpected resistance, the troops battled with rebellious
Lesotho soldiers through the day. At least five South African
soldiers were killed and nine wounded, the military said.
	   Protesters firebombed government buildings, looters rampaged
through downtown and cars with South African license plates were
being stoned in the wake of the intervention.
	   Whole shopping centers were gutted by fire, and smoke drifted
from many parts of the capital city just inside the border with
South Africa.
	   The action, post-apartheid South Africa's first major military
intervention, follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging and an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Believing a coup was imminent, Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili called on regional powers to intervene, South African
officials said.
	   ``The purpose of the intervention is to stabilize the situation
for the purpose of achieving a lasting political solution,'' said
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is acting head of
state while President Nelson Mandela is out of the country.
	   Buthelezi stressed the operation came under the Southern African
Development Community, a regional group chaired by South Africa.
	   Two-hundreds troops from Botswana were expected to arrive later
in the day, joining 600 South African troops, the military in
Pretoria said. Armored personnel carriers, attack helicopters and
mortar units also were involved.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom slightly smaller than Maryland
with a population of 2 million people, is surrounded by South
African territory.
	   A heavy firefight raged mid-day at a military barracks in the
airport area. South African and Lesotho troops traded automatic
rifle fire, and mortar explosions were heared. Fifteen armored
vehicles equipped with cannons came to reinforce the South
Africans.
	   An Associated Press reporter and photographer were pinned down
inside the barracks area during the battle.
	   Officials said the force had secured Lesotho military
headquarters, the main air force base, central business district
and neighborhood were most diplomats and Cabinet members live.
	   South African troops met strong resistance in the morning at the
royal palace, the Katse Dam in the central part of the country and
two military bases, said a South African military spokeswoman, air
force Lt. Col. Laverne Machine.
	   ``Rebel soldiers at the dam put up a strong fight, and the
contact was a severe one,'' she said. ``The rebels also suffered
heavy casualties.''
	   They faced anti-aircraft and small-arms fire at the Ratjemose
and Makonyane military bases, another spokesman, Maj. Ben van Zyl,
said. He said rebel soldiers were arming civilians with assault
rifles.
	   A South African Broadcasting Corp. cameraman also was injured,
and four Lesotho soldiers were led away as prisoners, SABC radio
said.
	   American citizens -- who number about 60 or 70 in Maseru out of
300 in the country -- were told to stay indoors, U.S. Ambassador
Katherine Peterson said.
	   Flights to Maseru airport were halted.
	   King Letsie III was safe and being protected by South African
troops, Machine said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Germany threatened Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic with military force Tuesday if he doesn't loosen
his grip on the separatist province of Kosovo, saying NATO was
prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis.
	   In a speech to world leaders gathered for the General Assembly,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned the use of force by
Milosevic's forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence for ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   However, ``Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic,'' Kinkel said in prepared text.
``He must realize that the international community will react with
military force if necessary.''
	   Milosevic also came under heated criticism by Wolfgang Schussel,
the Austrian foreign minister, who demanded he stop the repression
in Kosovo and withdrawn Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   ``Their police and military operations have led to consequences
for the civilian population that are out of any justifiable
proportion,'' Schussel said in prepared text, speaking on behalf of
the European Union.
	   He called for negotiations between the two sides as soon as
possible to ``define a new status for Kosovo.''
	   ``However, without cessation of the ongoing Serb offensive, an
end to further bloodshed, and a significant improvement of the
catastrophic humanitarian situation, a meaningful dialogue cannot
be started,'' he said.
	   Hundreds have been killed and over a quarter-million displaced
since Serb forces in February began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists who are fighting for independence for the province.
Western nations support returning autonomy for Kosovo which
Milosevic withdrew in 1989.
	   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged strong action
by the Security Council to stop the crackdown by Serb forces on
ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Britain and France last week began drafting a resolution that
would demand an immediate cease-fire and ``an urgent end to the
trampling on the rights of the inhabitants of Kosovo,'' Blair said.
	   The two countries were pushing for a council resolution that
would authorize force to make Milosevic comply, council sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia, however, has said it was flatly opposed to any threats
of force.
	   Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov was to speak later Tuesday
morning and was expected to touch on the conflict.
	   On Tuesday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on villages in
the heartland of ethnic Albanian resistance in Drenica with heavy
artillery and tank fire.
	   ``The European Union is extremely concerned at the dramatic
escalation of tension in Kosovo,'' Schussel said.
	   Because the primary responsibility rests with Serb and Yugoslav
forces, ``it is up to Slobodan Milosevic, as the president of the
FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) to order a halt to all
repressive actions against the civilian population of Kosovo.

Schroeder backs economics designate against German unions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor hopeful Gerhard Schroeder
backed his would-be economics minister Tuesday after he angered
labor unions by calling Germany's social security system ``a prison
for normal wage earners.''
	   The remarks by Jost Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur without
party affiliation, underlined a latent rift in the final days of
the opposition's campaign to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
Sunday's election.
	   Schroeder has seen a lead of up to 12 percentage points in the
polls evaporate and is now running virtually even with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who is seeking a fifth term after 16 years in office.
	   ``This man will become economics minister if we get the chance
to fill that job,'' Schroeder said on ZDF public television. ``He
will breathe new life into the economics ministry.''
	   Stollmann torpedoed Social Democratic ideals in a speech in
Hamburg late Monday, saying he would push for employees to
contribute more to their own retirement savings _ a near taboo in
Germany's lavish welfare state.
	   He said the state can no longer guarantee people's future living
standard and called for ``new policies and new concepts'' that
would require a ``profound change of mentality'' in Germany.
	   With the Social Democrats saying they plan to rescind benefit
cuts pushed through by Kohl's government over the past two years,
Stollmann's comments ran counter to the ideas of labor unions and
the party.
	   The deputy head of the Alliance of German Unions, Ursula
Engelen-Kefer, charged Tuesday that Stollmann was pushing
responsibility for change onto the workers.
	   ``The social security system must be reformed, but not
destroyed,'' she said on German radio.
	   Stollmann previously angered labor groups weeks ago with tough,
free-market proposals including cutting subsidies to old industries
such as coal. He also has questioned the usefulness of a
government-sponsored ``alliance for jobs'' with business and labor,
which the Social Democrats have proposed to fight unemployment.
	   Despite criticism by friends and foes of the left-leaning Social
Democrats, Schroeder has stood behind Stollmann, saying Germany
needs independent thinkers.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges' 120 mph (190
kph) winds knocked out power and forced residents into shelters in
the densely populated Dominican Republic Tuesday after devastating
Puerto Rico and leaving at least eight dead in the Caribbean.
	   Georges' powerful thunderstorms left Puerto Rico, an island of 4
million people, completely without electricity and 80 percent of
its people without water. Most highways were impassable, the
government said.
	   It spawned tornadoes, flooded hotels and exploded shop and car
windows as it slowly ripped through Puerto Rico. The storm turned
trees into missiles, flipped small airplanes, whisked away
satellite dishes and forced tens of thousands into shelters.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' a somber Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts. With winds and rains dying
slowly, workers cleared debris from the runways at San Juan's
international airport so emergency aid could be flown in.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-struck eastern Puerto Rican resort of Fajardo, where dozens of
homes lost roofs.
	   ``I don't know where we are going to stay,'' said Andrea Garcia,
33, surveying a mango tree that fell into her tiny wooden San Juan
home.
	   With island residents facing the sobering task of recovery
today, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release
of U.S. recovery aid.
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges headed Tuesday for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where
many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   By 11 a.m. EDT, Georges' winds had risen from 120 mph (190 kph).
The storm was centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers)
east-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of central Cuba and the
central Bahamas. Concern was growing even in Florida, where workers
put shutters over the windows at Key West City Hall.
	   Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   The storm killed two people and injured several others in
Antigua, Prime Minister Lester Bird said. One death was reported in
St. Kitts, where 70 percent of homes were damaged, as were the
hospital, airport and police station. A curfew was in effect there
to prevent looting, said government spokesman Erasmus Williams.
	   As it moved westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges
spawned tornados in the central town of Barranquitas and the
eastern island of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kph) were
reported in the interior mountains, where damage reports were
sketchy.
	   Georges also caused extensive property damage in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Antigua and other smaller Caribbean islands.
	   On the French island of Guadeloupe, France sent a team of 170
civil defense workers to help recovery efforts on the island, where
16,000 people lacked power.

	   Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   The storm killed two people and injured several others in
Antigua, Prime Minister Lester Bird said. One death was reported in
St. Kitts, where 70 percent of homes were damaged, as were the
hospital, airport and police station. A curfew was in effect there
to prevent looting, said government spokesman Erasmus Williams.
	   As it moved westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges
spawned tornados in the central town of Barranquitas and the
eastern island of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kph) were
reported in the interior mountains, where damage reports were
sketchy.
	   Georges also caused extensive property damage in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Antigua and other smaller Caribbean islands.
	   On the French island of Guadeloupe, France sent a team of 170
civil defense workers to help recovery efforts on the island, where
16,000 people lacked power.

False alarm at Bucharest airport

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian national airline's flight
to Rome was delayed more than three hours Tuesday after an
anonymous caller warned a bomb was on the aircraft. The call was a
hoax.
	   The Tarom Boeing 737 was preparing to take off for Rome with 73
passengers, including Transport Minister Traian Basescu, when the
call was received about 10 minutes before the scheduled departure,
officials said.
	   The passengers were evacuated and the plane searched but no bomb
was found. Passengers left on another plane.
	   The private news agency Mediafax quoted state secretary Aleodor
Francu as saying a suspect had been identified but there was no
word on an arrest.

Ukrainian premier locks debtors in government building _ again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko began a new crackdown on debtor companies Tuesday,
locking their top executives in a Cabinet hall and demanding that
they sign debt payment guarantees.
	   The step was unorthodox but not unfamiliar.
	   Last month, the premier started a crackdown on companies and
regional institutions owing large sums to the budget and the
state-run Pension Fund. He kept their chief executives in a Kiev
building for a while, then brought some to a tent camp for
purported civil defense training.
	   As part of his desperate crusade to collect tax payments,
Pustovoitenko also has set up special tax posts at the offices of
debtor companies, seized thousands of cars from them as a method of
pressure and launched dozens of criminal and bankruptcy cases.
	   Ukraine's government is chronically short of cash and faces a
mounting foreign and domestic debt itself. The cash crisis and
failure to collect budget revenues have been aggravated by the
economic turmoil in neighboring Russia, which pushed down the
national currency, the hryvna, and scared investors away.
	   The new measure involved executives from more than 50 companies
that have been slow in returning foreign credits obtained with
government guarantees _ including such large enterprises as the
Makiyivskiy and Kryvorizhstal metal works, the Ukragrotekhservis
supplier of fuel and agricultural machinery and others.
	   Pustovoitenko placed guards at the entrance to the Cabinet's
main meeting hall and the debtors were only allowed to leave after
signing obligations pledging the return of the debts, the Interfax
news service said.
	   Pustovoitenko said Ukrainian companies have received about 2.5
billion dollars in government-backed credits, of which dlrs 886
million were paid back, including dlrs 734 million paid by the
government. Thus, the companies owe the government dlrs 734
million, he said.
	   Pustovoitenko and chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko, who also
addressed the debtors' gathering, threatened to bring top
executives of debtor companies to court and initiate bankruptcy
proceedings.
	   The government-guaranteed foreign credits are only a small part
of the problem.
	   As of August, there were as many as 105,000 debtor companies in
Ukraine, who altogether owed over 8 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.6
billion at the current exchange rate) to the federal and regional
governments. The government also was owed some 3 billion hryvna
(dlrs 1 billion) in payments to the Pension Fund.
	   Pustovoitenko's crackdown has yielded only a small fraction of
these debts so far.

Top Palestinian security officers meet with CIA officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian security officials were meeting
with CIA representatives Tuesday as part of an American effort to
get Yasser Arafat's Authority to spell out specific measures it
will take to combat terror, a Palestinian official said.
	   Israel has said any peace agreement for a next withdrawal of its
forces from West Bank territory was contingent on the Palestinians
laying out a detailed security plan.
	   But the Palestinians have conditions of their own, said Amin al
Hindi, chief of Palestinian intelligence. The Palestinians want the
United States, which is mediating between the sides, to make
similar demands of the Israelis.
	   ``The Americans told us they understood our insistence on
reciprocity,'' Hindi said. He added that Palestinian security
branches were interested in cooperation with Israeli counterparts
and open to new ideas on how to implement security arrangements.
	   Hindi and Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian Preventive
Security in Gaza were participating in the meeting with CIA
officials in Gaza City.
	   With Israeli-Palestinian peace-making at an 18-month standstill,
the CIA has acted as a catalyst for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation
on security issues. The Palestinians want a tri-lateral forum
set-up to discuss several security points.
	   A Palestinian negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Palestinians want Israel to agree to a set of guidelines
on six security-related issues: confiscation of weapons from
militant Palestinian and Jewish groups, outlawing terrorist
organizations on both sides, incitement, weapons registration, a
definition of full security cooperation, and a mechanism for
dealing with suspected in criminal cases.
	   The Palestinians have pledged in past agreements to fight
terrorism but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has charged
that the Palestinians have not been doing enough on security
matters and have a revolving-door policy with regard to militants.
	   Hindi denied the accusation.
	   ``It is Israel who has the revolving door policy,'' Hindi said,
citing an Israeli court decision Friday to release a Jewish
settler, suspected of killing a Palestinian teen-ager, into house
arrest.

Senior Cuban official complains to French about U.S. embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cuba's Vice President complained about U.S.
economic policy toward the Caribbean nation and pleaded for aid
during a meeting Tuesday with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   ``The more we become more flexible in Cuba, the more the
Americans reinforce their embargo,'' Carlos Lage said.
	   During Lage's visit to Paris, France has announced that
development aid will rise from 2 million francs (dlrs 300,000) in
1998 to 15 million francs (dlrs 2.5 million) in 1999.
	   France has long been a critic of U.S. policy toward Cuba,
arguing that the embargo disproportionately hurts poor people
rather than punishing the government.
	   The French government also intends to increase credits awarded
to promote French exports to Cuba.
	   There is a great interest in Cuba and its culture in France and
this year about 100,000 French tourists are expected to visit Cuba.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Tuesday that he himself interviewed people who said
they had engaged in illegal sex acts with his ousted deputy because
he couldn't believe the sordid allegations.
	   Meanwhile, troops carrying assault rifles surrounded the house
of the ex-deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, after his wife
suggested that he was injected with the AIDS virus while in police
custody. She could face arrest.
	   ``I interviewed people he sodomized and the women he had sex
with,'' Mahathir said at a news conference. He went into graphic
detail, saying one man told him that Anwar ``had not only performed
sodomy, but during the process he was masturbating the man.''
	   Mahathir said leaders of his United Malays National Organization
were finding it difficult to explain to women and children the
reasons for Anwar's ouster. Sodomy is illegal in this predominantly
Muslim country.
	   ``The Malaysian society is conservative,'' he said. ``They don't
even talk about these things.''
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges and said they are part
of a government conspiracy to thwart his growing challenge to
Mahathir's 17-year-rule. Mahathir sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister on Sept. 2.
	   With Anwar and 11 prominent sympathizers and opposition party
leaders detained, police turned their sights on his wife Tuesday.
	   They threatened to arrest Azizah Ismail for comments she made
suggesting her husband had been injected with the HIV virus while
in detention.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Amin quoted Azizah as saying in an
interview with CNBC that, ``We have news to say that maybe Anwar's
life is in danger because he may be given some injection of the HIV
virus to prove whatever allegations.''
	   Mahathir indicated that Azizah would face arrest.
	   ``She has made certain allegations against the police which
amount to incitement,'' he said, adding he felt sorry for the
mother of six who had been ``innocently trapped.''
	   Army trucks filled with troops carrying assault rifles
surrounded Anwar's home Tuesday. Another 30 riot police with tear
gas canisters were posted outside the house as about 500 supporters
milled about.
	   Azizah told reporters that police came to her house twice on
Tuesday, ``in circumstances that were intimidating. My lawyer had
to intervene to stop them from harassing me.''
	   Anwar, arrested under the country's Internal Security Act, has
not been seen since police dragged him, Azizah and two of their six
children from their home Sunday night.
	   ``As of now I've yet to see my husband,'' she told reporters
Tuesday night. Anwar is being held under a law that allows people
to isolate him from lawyers and other visitors indefinitely without
trial.
	   She noted that national police chief Abdul Rahim Noor said
Tuesday that police have not yet presented charges to the
attorney-general.
	   The opposition Democratic Action Party issued a call for him to
be charged or released.
	   A protest rally scheduled for a township on the outskirts of the
capital fizzled Tuesday night. About 20 Malaysians and a few
tourists wandered around while policemen and news crews watched.
There were no speeches, posters or pamphlets.
	   ``Practically all the leaders have been detained,'' said Mohamed
Hisham, one of the rally organizers at Anwar's house. ``But we will
regroup by using pamphlets and by word of mouth.''
	   Anwar had said his wife would take over his political reform
movement in the event of his detention. But the police intimidation
appeared to be working. Azizah told reporters Tuesday that she
would no longer hold nightly reform rallies at their house. ``I
want things to be stable,'' she said. ``They'll use that excuse to
kill us all.''
	   The rest of the capital was calm following violent clashes
between police and Anwar supporters Monday.
	   The unrest comes during the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II
and her husband, Prince Philip. Demonstrators at the courthouse
where supporters expected Anwar to be charged Monday lunged at the
queen's convoy as it drove by, prompting riot police to move in.
	   Police Tuesday said 132 people, including 17 foreigners, were
detained for involvement in clashes with police around the
courthouse.

Top international official meets Serb politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by U.S. envoy
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Trying to keep post-war
democracy-building on track, Bosnia's top international official
told Serb nationalists on Tuesday that only those who respected the
Dayton peace accords would receive foreign aid.
	   Bosnian High Representative Carlos Westendorp was meeting
politicians from rival Bosnian Serb camps for the first time since
the Sept. 12-13 election, and an apparent defeat of the
western-backed candidate for the presidency.
	   Although the final tally of the vote won't be known until later
this week, there are strong indications that a nationalist Nikola
Poplasen defeated Biljana Plavsic, the U.S.-backed incumbent, in
the presidential race.
	   Plavsic conceded defeat Monday even before results were
available but said she would remain on the political scene to fight
for democracy in the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia.
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia; reviving a measure of
coexistence among Serbs, Muslims and Croats after 3{ years of war
that ended in 1995 with a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The message to different party leaders is whatever the result
is going to be, what we expect from them is full cooperation to
implement Dayton,'' Westendorp said. ``It is clear that the parties
which do not cooperate ... will act in detriment of the (Bosnian
Serb) population ... because they will not get any support from the
international community.''
	   ``Given that most of the political party leaders have said
openly in the election campaign they will comply with Dayton, there
is hope we can cooperate with all,'' he said.
	   Poplasen is the leader of an extreme nationalist Radical Party
in the Serb-run entity of Bosnia and a supporter of war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   But in an interview with the Associated Press Monday, Poplasen
denied fears that he will not cooperate with the West. He said he
would stick to the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing more
and nothing less.''
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard said Tuesday Poplasen
``will be tested early'' on his commitment to the peace process.
	   A senior U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Poplasen could be removed from office for any serious violation of
the Dayton accords by Westendorp, as part of his wide-ranging
powers to enforce the return to normality in Bosnia.
	   Plavsic's government has improved ties with the West following
her break with the pro-Karadzic camp last year and a pledge to
implement the Dayton accords. The moderates have received millions
of dollars of international aid which had been denied to the
previous, hardline government.
	   On Tuesday, Plavsic's Serb National Alliance said that the party
would not dispute any results announced by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Respiratory congress: human experiment measures harm from diesel
</HEADLINE>
exhaust &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1600gmt. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Researchers said Tuesday that they had been able
to measure for the first time the harm that can be caused by
breathing for just one hour the diesel fumes found in the air on a
city street.
	   ``We have been able to demonstrate that diesel fumes are much
more dangerous than was so far assumed,'' Dr. Anders Blomberg of
the University Hospital of Umea, Sweden, told a conference of 9,000
respiratory specialists from Europe and the United States.
	   Airways in the lungs of human volunteers showed signs of acute
inflammation some six hours after inhaling diesel fumes, with up to
three times as many immune-system cells in the airways than normal,
said the study by the Swedish-British team.
	   ``To our knowledge, this is the first time such effects have
been described in humans exposed to a concentration of diesel
exhaust that may be encountered in the environment,'' said
Blomberg.
	   The presence of the immune-system cells, neutrophiles and
lymphocytes, indicated the stress on the lungs even though
traditional lung tests, such as measuring the exhaled air volume,
showed no abnormal variation.
	   Diesel exhaust contains up to 100 times more soot than ordinary
gasoline exhaust, and the particles are so tiny that they pass
through all natural filters in the human breathing system and reach
deep into the lungs, into the delicate alveoli.
	   The experiment exposed 15 healthy, nonsmoking adults to diesel
exhaust for one hour in a university chamber at Umea.
	   The level of fumes is similar to that found in parking garages,
tunnels or congested city streets, ``unfortunately typical of what
is experienced daily by millions of people in the world,'' said
conference organizers.
	   Professor Philippe Leuenberger of the University Hospital Center
in Lausanne, Switzerland, said repeated exposed to the diesel
exhaust could lead to chronic inflammation, coughing and wheezing.
	   Adding to the problem, the particles can bind with toxic or
cancer-causing compounds, such as benzene derivatives, researchers
said.
	   The congress organizers acknowledged that top-quality diesels
emit far fewer of the offending particles by recirculating exhaust,
but that researchers are now looking into ``ultrafine'' particles
one-tenth the size of those already studied.
	   ``They are afraid that, when the effects can eventually be
measured, other nasty surprises may be in store,'' they said.
	   The five-day congress, which began Saturday, was inconclusive on
whether air pollution causes asthma, the condition of inflamed air
passages in the lungs making it difficult to breathe, but said
nitrogen oxide, particles and ozone can make attacks worse.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Two U.N. warehouses in Albania were
looted of relief supplies worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, a
relief agency official said Tuesday.
	   Jim Worrall, a coordinator for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Tirana, said the warehouses in Tirana and Bajram Curri,
in northern Albania, stored bedding, tents, blankets, soap and
construction materials.
	   Local agencies, including the Albanian Red Cross and the Islamic
Society in Bajram Curri, also have been robbed, he said.
	   ``This is the first bad one'' in recent months, Worrall said,
adding that previous thefts had mostly been small-scale robberies
from truck shipments.

Two countries step up cooperation against underworld, terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and Turkey signed agreements Tuesday to step
up their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, money
laundering and drug trafficking.
	   The accords were signed by the two ministers in charge of
security services in their countries, Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano of Italy and his Turkish counterpart, Kutlu Aktas.
	   Details were not given, but Napolitano said Italy will share its
experiences battling the Sicilian Mafia.
	   The Italian official said he had no information on Turkey's
long-standing bid to extradite Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish
terrorist who wounded Pope John Paul II in 1981, except that it was
``under examination.''
	   Agca is serving a life term in an Italian prison. He was
sentenced to death in Turkey for the 1979 slaying of a newspaper
editor, but he escaped from jail.

Russian Prime Minister to visit Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will visit
Belarus later this month, in what will be his first visit in his
new post to another former Soviet nation, his press service said
Tuesday.
	   Primakov made the decision during a phone call with Belarusian
president Alexander Lukashenko. He will travel to the republic at
the end of September.
	   The pair will discuss Russia's financial crisis, which has
rocked the Belarusian economy. They will also discuss foreign
policy issues and cooperation between the two countries.
	   ``The two countries have established fraternal relations,''
Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most factories and businesses remaining under
state control. It has been harder hit than most by Russia's
economic crisis because the two countries maintain close economic
ties.
	   Lukashenko, an autocratic president who longs for the old days
of the Soviet Union, has actively sought union with Russia and
other former Soviet states.

Kabila flies to mini-summit over Congo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila flew from his
capital on Tuesday to a mini-summit in Gabon with three other
African leaders to discuss the state of Congo's prolonged rebel
war.
	   Kabila was invited to the gathering in Gabon's capital of
Libreville by President Omar Bongo, officials in Kinshasa said.
Central African Republic President Ange-Felix Patasse and
Mozambique's President Joachim Chissano were also expected to
attend.
	   Bongo, a patriarch of Central African politics and Gabon's
leader for more than three decades, has expressed willingness to
mediate between Congo's warring sides.
	   A rebel coalition of Tutsi fighters, former Kabila supporters
and disaffected government soldiers launched the rebellion in early
August, accusing Kabila of corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   The rebels walked out of a round of talks in Zimbabwe earlier
this month after Kabila and other leaders refused to negotiate
directly with them. Kabila has demanded the complete withdrawal of
forces from neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, whom he accuses of
directing the rebellion.
	   Kabila's visit to Gabon came as a delegation of five cabinet
ministers from the neighboring Republic of Congo visited Kinshasa
to deflect tensions between the two Congos.
	   The Republic of Congo's Minister of State for Justice Pierre Nze
told journalists in Kinshasa that his country had not harbored
rebels who launched attacks on Congo's government, contrary to
claims on Kinshasa's state-run radio station.
	   ``If there were troops, we would not be coming to see you as
brothers,'' Nze said.
	   The rebels were driven from western Congo after forces from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia came to Kabila's aid. The insurgents
continue to hold a swath of territory in eastern Congo, bordering
Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Muslim hard-liners staged angry
protests in Bangladesh Tuesday against feminist author Taslima
Nasrin, who whipped up a storm four years ago with her
controversial books and has returned to the country after a
self-imposed exile.
	   Nearly 1,000 Muslim protesters offered prayers at a mosque and
marched through Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, demanding that
Nasrin be given the death sentence for blaspheming Islam.
	   ``Arrest the infidel and hang her,'' shouted the protesters from
Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest conservative Islamic party.
	   After staying in Europe for four years, the 36-year-old novelist
returned home with her mother who underwent treatment in New York
for colon cancer. She immediately went into hiding as her critics
announced a cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who
killed her.
	   She returned home risking her life to stay ``with my mother in
her last days,'' Nasrin told The Associated Press Monday.
	   She fled to Stockholm, Sweden in 1994 to escape arrest ordered
by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government which also filed
a blasphemy case against her. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who
replaced Mrs. Zia in 1996, has not pressed for Nasrin's trial.
	   ``This spoiled woman is an enemy of Islam. We shall not let her
go unpunished,'' Matiur Rahman Nizami, Secretary General of
Jamaat-e-Islami party told the slogan-chanting demonstrators.
Nizami accused the liberal government of supporting Nasrin.
	   Police, equipped with riot gear, watched the demonstrators, many
of them wearing white prayer caps, but there was no confrontation.
	   Jamaat and several other Islamic groups have planned another
protest against her in Dhaka for Friday, the Islamic sabbath.
	   Nasrin angered the zealots after a newspaper quoted her as
saying that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten.
She denied making the comments, but suggested changes in Islamic
laws to give more rights to women in her conservative society.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Soccer star Roberto Baggio escaped unhurt
but his car was slightly damaged in a collision with a truck.
	   The accident occurred Monday afternoon when the star of Inter

Spanish parliament rejects proposals to ease abortion law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rejection of proposals, CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Parliamentary deputies on Tuesday rejected
by just one vote a proposal to relax Spain's abortion law.
	   The main opposition Socialist party's proposal to ease the 1985
legislation that decriminalized abortion for certain cases garnered
172 votes in favor in the nearly full parliamentary chamber, one
less than the number of `No' votes.
	   The existing law allows abortion through the first 12 weeks of
pregnancies judged to be dangerous to the mother's life or mental
health, as well as in cases of rape, incest or fetal malformation.
	   The rejected proposal sought to permit the termination of any
pregnancy in the first 12 weeks if it created a personal, social or
family conflict for the woman.
	   This proposal has already been blocked twice by conservative
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party since it took
office in 1996 with a simple parliamentary majority.
	   Socialist presidential candidate Jose Borrell said his party
would not present it again before the next general elections, the
national news agency EFE reported.
	   Two other proposals to decriminalize abortion for up to 14 and
16 weeks after conception, tabled by smaller parties, were also
debated and rejected by bigger margins Tuesday.
	   The vote came a day after some 3,000 antiabortion activists
protested in Madrid demanding a `No' vote from deputies.
	   Spain's influential Roman Catholic Church had also stepped into
the fray with priests all over the country on Sunday denouncing
those calling for changes in the law.
	   Defending the church's intervention, the spokesman for the
Spanish Episcopal Conference, Juan Jose Asenjo, claimed Tuesday
that ``future generations would probably feel ashamed about
abortion as we do about the Inquisition and Nazi genocide.''

Official: EU should to play a bigger role in ending war in Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The European Union should play a bigger
political role in ending the 15-year civil war in southern Sudan
that has claimed an estimated 1.5 million lives and displaced
millions more, a senior European Union official said Tuesday.
	   ``Europe is paying a lot in this conflict through humanitarian
assistance,'' said Alberto Navarro, director of the Brussels-based
European Commission Humanitarian Office, ECHO.
	   ``My message is that the European Union should play a bigger
political role to end this conflict,'' Navarro told a news
conference.
	   He said the European Commission and the 15 EU member states have
committed dlrs 150 million to assist Sudan this year, most of it
for humanitarian aid in the war-torn south.
	   Several EU member countries have also been underwriting periodic
peace talks between President Hassan el-Bahir's government and the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army led by Col. John Garang.
	   The last round of talks, sponsored by the regional
Intergovernmental Authority on Development in Ethiopia last month,
collapsed. The next round is scheduled for Oct. 5 in Nairobi.
	   Navarro was speaking after a visit to areas controlled by rebels
and the government in southern Sudan and after talks with Sudanese
officials in Khartoum. He plans talks with rebel representatives in
Nairobi.
	   ``How much time has to pass, how many lives have to be lost, how
much more human suffering has to go on on for years until both
sides find a solution to the conflict,'' asked Georg Weiss, a
senior Austrian foreign ministry official who took part in the
Sept. 18-21 mission. Austria holds the current revolving EU
presidency.
	   Navarro described the war in southern Sudan as ``without
parallel in the world'' and the fighters on both sides as ``not
protectors but predators'' on civilians.
	   In addition to those who died in the fighting and accompanying
famines, another 4 million have been forced to flee their homes,
Navarro said.
	   The predominantly African, Christian and animist southerners
took up arms to press for increased autonomy and development in the
south, traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north.
	   Navarro said he had urged the government and the rebels to
extend ``in time and geographically'' a three-month cease-fire that
expires Oct. 15.
	   The cease-fire only covers southwestern Bahr al-Ghazal province,
which has been the worst hit by famine.

American experts start exhumation of Pulaski's great niece

<TEXT>
	   PROMNA, Poland (AP) _ At a quiet village cemetery, U.S. forensic
experts prepared on Tuesday to open the grave of Count Casimir
Pulaski's great niece in hope of finding proof that the
Revolutionary War hero was buried beneath his monument in Georgia.
	   ``It will set many people's minds at rest,'' said James C.
Metts, the coroner of Chatham County, Georgia, who is taking part
in the exhumation of Teresa Witkowska, the great granddaughter of
Pulaski's sister, buried in Promna, some 66 kilometers (41 miles)
south of Warsaw.
	   The six-member team, sponsored by Edward Pinkowski, a U.S.
historian of Polish origin, have already taken down the gray
gravestones with the inscription saying that Witkowska, a protector
of orphans and the poor, died Dec. 23, 1861 at the age of 69.
	   Hoping to find Witkowska's remains intact, forensic expert Karen
Burns of the University of North Carolina, plans to take a bone
sample - most preferably a molar tooth or a two inch piece of the
thigh bone - for DNA tests.
	   The results, expected this year, will be compared with the tests
performed on the bones found in a metal case under the Pulaski
monument in Savannah to determine whether they really are his
remains.
	   The test is supposed to remove doubts about Pulaski's grave _ a
great many people are convinced that Pulaski was buried in
Savannah, ``but a fair number of people are saying that's not true,
that's not true. And that will go on for hundreds of years,'' Metts
said.
	   They chose Witkowska's grave because it seems intact and is
easiest accessible among the graves of his closes relations. The
grave of Pulaski's mother is under the asphalt of a downtown square
in nearby Warka, and that of one of his sisters, in Warsaw, was
plundered during World War II.
	   There was no problem getting permission for the exhumation from
Poland's authorities and from the church, said another team member,
Marek Lazar, chairman of the Pulaski National Monument Committee
that is funding the renovation of the 144-year-old monument.
	   Pulaski, who joined the American Revolution after fleeing Europe
following an insurrection against the Russians, died in 1779 after
being shot by the British during the siege of Savannah. But there
are conflicting theories as to whether he was buried at sea or
whether his remains were placed beneath the monument that was built
in Savannah in 1854.
	   Lazar, of Milwaukee, Wis., believes that a positive
identification may lead to a proper hero's burial.
	   ``I believe that if it turns out it is Pulaski, the Polish and
the U.S. governments will be obliged to pay a proper respect to the
hero who fought on the fronts of both nations,'' said Lazar.

 &UR; Eds: NEW with autopsy done but cause of death not yet clear &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ An autopsy on the body of world-record
holding sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was inconclusive as to
the cause of death, a official said Tuesday.
	   ``It could take a few days or a few weeks,'' said Lt. Hector
Rivera of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. He added that the
38-year-old Griffith Joyner died in her sleep at her Mission Viejo
home in suburban Los Angeles early Monday morning.
	   A family friend attributed the death to a heart-related problem.
	   Rivera said the coroner started the autopsy Monday at 1 p.m.
Among the procedures was a toxicology test, which is done when the
cause of death is unknown.
	   Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple
jump champion, called paramedics after finding her ``unresponsive
and not breathing.''
	   World heptathlon record holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee said Tuesday
morning in a TV interview that her sister-in-law, even when tired,
always found time ``to put a smile on a young person's face.''
	   ``She accomplished amazing things on the track as well as off
the track,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
	   A decade ago this week, ``FloJo'' won the first of her three
gold medals at the Seoul Olympics, where her sister-in-law,
six-time Olympic medalist and world heptathlon record-holder Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, also starred.
	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes.
	   She set the 100 mark of 10.49 seconds in the quarterfinals of
the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and since then no one
has even broken 10.60. At Seoul, she won the gold medal in a
wind-aided 10.54.
	   Griffith Joyner then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic
final, clocking 21.34. American Marion Jones, with a 21.62 at the
World Cup in South Africa earlier this month, is the only other
woman to run the 200 in under 21.70.
	   Griffith Joyner retired from athletics after the Seoul Olympics,
and she served as co-chair of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Amnesty International criticizes British arms trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite its human rights pledges, Britain's Labor
Party government continues selling arms to countries such as
Indonesia and Algeria, and seeks to deter political asylum seekers,
Amnesty International said Tuesday.
	   The London-based organization said, too, that Prime Minister
Tony Blair's government is quick to condemn human rights abuses by
nations with which this country has negligible trade, including
Sudan, Iraq and Myanmar, while reluctant to act against important
political and trading partners.
	   In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia,
Indonesia and the United States _ criticized by Amnesty
International for having the death penalty _ as countries that
Britain treats delicately.
	   ``Commercial and strategic interests often still dominate
foreign policy,'' said Amnesty International.
	   ``This has led to `constructive partnership' with countries
involved in serious human rights abuses such as China and Saudi
Arabia but clear public condemnation of abuses in countries of
limited strategic importance such as Sudan and Myanmar,'' it added.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   However, Amnesty International said the Foreign Office has made
real improvements since Labor defeated the Conservative Party
government in May 1997 national elections. Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook pledged soon afterward to put human rights ``at the heart of
foreign policy.''
	   In an audit of Cook's pledge, Amnesty International praised
Britain for, it said, seeking to set up an International Criminal
Court in Rome, publishing an annual report on human rights, banning
land mines, and taking ``limited measures'' to restrict arms sales
to countries that may use them to commit human rights abuses.
	   However, the organization complained that since Labor took
power, the Trade Department has granted 10 licenses for arms
exports to Algeria, 10 for Colombia, 59 for Saudi Arabia, 64 for
Indonesia and 146 for Turkey.
	   A Trade Department spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said licenses were granted only after consultations with
the Foreign Office and Defense Ministry.
	   A year ago the government blocked two small arms deals to
Indonesia of Land Rovers and sniper rifles worth about 1 million
pounds (dlrs 1.6 million). Britain's total weapons trade with
Indonesia is worth more than 200 million pounds (dlrs 320 million)
a year.
	   On asylum seekers _ whose numbers have soared in recent years,
including many seeking a better way of life, Amnesty International
said genuine cases were regarded with grave skepticism by
government officials.
	   ``The principal message that the government is sending to those
who flee persecution is to keep out of the United Kingdom,'' said
the report.

Volume and value of Kenyan flower exports skyrocket in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ The volume and value of Kenya's cut flower
exports for August skyrocketed compared with the same month a year
ago, the Horticultural Crops Development Authority said Tuesday.
	   In a report, the authority said 1,307,507 kgs of cut flowers
were exported for a value of 292,471,200 shillings (dlrs 4,874,520)
a 529.96 percent increase in value and 643.90 percent increase in
volume from previous year.
	   The report said in August 1997, 175,764 kgs were exported for a
value of 46,427,174 shillings (dlrs 773,786).
	   The authority said the main buyers of Kenyan flowers were
Holland, Germany, United Kingdom, France and Sweden.
	   Carnations and roses account for the bulk of flower exports.

Director, editor of Iran's official news agency detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police detained Tuesday a deputy director
and an editor of Iran's official news agency, the agency reported.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Mohammad Reza Sadeq, its
deputy managing director, and Ali-Reza Khosravi, the social affairs
editor, were detained by court order after a senior cleric filed a
complaint against them.
	   Mohsen Rafiqdoust complained to a Tehran court about an IRNA
report on an attempt on his life on Sept. 13.
	   The nature of the complaint was not immediately known, but on
Sept. 13 the agency initially suggested that Rafiqdoust had been
injured, saying he was ``in satisfactory condition'' and ``received
no serious injuries.
	   Later the agency reported Rafiqdoust had not been hurt in the
attack, which occurred when shots were fired through the window of
his high-rise office in North Tehran from nearby hills.
	   Sadeq and Khosravi were interrogated for five hours before their
detention, IRNA reported Tuesday.
	   Rafiqdoust, a hard-line cleric, is the head of a foundation that
cares for the poor and persons disabled in the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.
	   Last week, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also a
hard-liner, called on the judiciary to deal with what he called
``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   On Sunday, two newspapers were shutdown for publishing stories
critical of hard-line leaders and their polices.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts to halt the collapse of
Angola's four-year-old peace pact are being thwarted because the
government says it cannot guarantee the safe movement of
international mediators, the United Nations office here said
Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special envoy Issa Diallo is seeking to meet with Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of the former rebel group UNITA, at the central
highland town where he lives ``in a bid to put the peace process
back on track,'' the U.N. said in a written statement.
	   But Diallo has not been able to fly out of the capital because
the government says it cannot ensure his safety, according to the
statement.
	   The government earlier this month broke off all contact with
Savimbi and is keen to see him internationally isolated.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last week wrote to the U.N.
Security Council urging it to follow the Angolan government in
dealing only with a group of UNITA dissidents who have broken with
Savimbi.
	   However, the Security Council instead called on the government
to reverse its decision to sever dialogue with the rebel chief,
reportedly angering Dos Santos.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato accused the
government of fabricating reasons to prevent the peace process
advancing.
	   ``The government shouldn't be obstructing efforts towards
dialogue ... towards relaunching the peace process,'' Lukamba Gato
said in a telephone interview.
	   Diallo's flight difficulties came amid unconfirmed reports of
fighting between the UNITA and government forces in remote areas of
the vast southwest African country _ the latest sign that the
U.N.-mediated 1994 peace pact that ended a two-decade civil war is
unraveling.
	   Citing unidentified military sources, Angolan media reported
clashes between the former foes in the Lunda Norte and Malanje
provinces, several hundred kilometers (miles) east of the capital.
No details were given, and officials declined to comment.
	   Continuing hostility between the two sides has long stymied the
peace process that has made no progress since last May.
	   The government has accused UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of failing to
comply with the peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four central
highland strongholds in contravention of the peace accord, bringing
U.N. sanctions against it.
	   The governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or
MPLA, has expelled UNITA officials from the national unity
government.

Top international official meets Serb politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new final grafs adding U.S. comment. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
official told Serb nationalists Tuesday that only those who respect
the Dayton peace accords would receive foreign aid.
	   Bosnian High Representative Carlos Westendorp was meeting
politicians from rival Bosnian Serb camps for the first time since
Sept. 12-13 elections.
	   Although the final vote results won't be known until later this
week, there are strong indications that nationalist Nikola Poplasen
defeated Biljana Plavsic, the U.S.-backed incumbent, in the race
for president of the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia.
	   Plavsic conceded defeat Monday even before results were
available but said she would remain on the political scene to fight
for democracy.
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal a blow to a key part of the
West's strategy in Bosnia: reviving a measure of coexistence among
Serbs, Muslims and Croats after 3 1-2 years of war that ended in
1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The message to different party leaders is whatever the result
is going to be, what we expect from them is full cooperation to
implement Dayton,'' Westendorp said.
	   ``The parties which do not cooperate ... will act in detriment
of the (Bosnian Serb) population ... because they will not get any
support from the international community.''
	   ``Given that most of the political party leaders have said
openly in the election campaign they will comply with Dayton, there
is hope we can cooperate with all,'' Westendorp said.
	   The moderates under Plavsic have received millions of dollars of
international aid which had been denied to the previous, hard-line
government.
	   Poplasen is the leader of the extreme nationalist Radical Party
in the Serb-run part of Bosnia and a supporter of war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Poplasen
dismissed fears that he will not cooperate with the West. He said
he would stick to the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing
more and nothing less.''
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard said Tuesday Poplasen
``will be tested early'' on his commitment to the peace process.
	   A senior U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Poplasen could be removed from office for any serious violation of
the Dayton accords by Westendorp, as part of his wide-ranging
powers to enforce the return to normality in Bosnia.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Capitalizing on a U.N. deadlock
over Kosovo, Yugoslav and Serb forces backed by blistering
artillery strikes launched an offensive on the last remaining
stronghold of secessionist rebels in Kosovo Tuesday.
	   By late Tuesday, the Serb-Yugoslav forces had seized at least
four guerrilla-held villages and killed many rebels, said the Serb
Media Center, which releases official information. Several hundred
more guerrillas withdrew deeper into Drenica.
	   Ethnic Albanian residents from at least 12 additional villages
were forced to flee into nearby forests, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which represents the ethnic Albanian viewpoint.
	   At least 10,000 to 15,000 civilians are believed trapped in the
region. As of a few days ago, many were hiding in hills and forests
of central Drenica, fearing a Serb offensive.
	   Amid the intense fighting, the United Nations pondered ways to
end the killing and avert the threat of mass deaths from cold and
starvation this winter of thousands of unsheltered refugees.
	   At the U.N. General Assembly, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel condemned the use of force by both sides but said most to
blame was Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He must realize that the international community will react
with military force if necessary,'' Kinkel said, alluding to the
threat of NATO involvement.
	   In reality, the issue of a NATO role in ending the Kosovo
fighting is as it has been for months _ unresolved, with some
European nations insisting it can come only if approved by the U.N.
Security Council. That is unlikely, considering strong opposition
by Russia, an ally of Serbia and China, which seeks to avoid
precedents of outside involvement for its dispute in Tibet.
	   In Kosovo, fire flashes issued from muzzles as tanks and
artillery steadily pounded at least five villages on the main road
between Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica, about 25 miles (15
kilometers). Non-stop machine-gun fire and explosions were also
heard about six miles (10 kilometers) west of Pristina.
	   Columns of smoke could be seen rising from villages in the
north, west and south of Drenica.
	   Serb police say they've surrounded Drenica, west of Pristina,
the provincial capital, and are attacking from all sides to crush
the hundreds of rebels trapped there by Serb blockades and patrols.
	   ``According to the resistance they are putting up, they are not
willing to surrender,'' said police Col. Bozidar Filic. He claimed
government forces had routed the rebels from the rest of Kosovo and
many fled to the Drenica region in recent days.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists
six months ago. Since then, government forces have all but routed
the Kosovo Liberation Army, driving many members across the border
into Albania.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the larger of the two republics in
Yugoslavia. Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority support
independence.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed at least 16 people,
including six women and two children under age 5, had been injured
so far in the Serb attack on 15 villages.
	   Major powers have been struggling since March to find a peaceful
solution to the crisis in Kosovo, where Albanians comprise 90
percent of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, Milosevic insisted Monday
that the refugees are receiving care and shelter and that
international concerns about their fate are misplaced.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, officials said Ahmed Krasniqi, a
member of the Kosovo Albanian government-in-exile, was killed
Monday night.
	   The motive was unclear, but Krasniqi was responsible for
organizing military forces for the exile government. Some Kosovo
analysts believed his death could have resulted from a power
struggle within rebel ranks.

US and Russia sign two nuclear agreements

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. and Russian energy officials signed
two agreements Tuesday to help privatize Russia's crumbling nuclear
weapons complex and keep nuclear scientists and plutonium
stockpiles from leaving the country.
	   U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson and Russian Minister of
Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov signed the agreements at the United
Nations office in Vienna, where they are attending the annual
conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency which opened
Monday.
	   ``The United States agreed to help Russia work towards
privatizing its nuclear sector and promote investment in the
Russian nuclear economy,'' said Richardson, following the signing.
	   The accord on uranium was discussed at the summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin earlier
this month in Moscow. The agreement clears the way for each country
to get rid of about 50 metric tons of plutonium by breaking it down
and selling it selling to Western uranium companies so it cannot be
used for military purposes.
	   The second accord focuses on opening up Russia's formerly secret
nuclear cities, where leading nuclear weapons designers have been
growing increasingly unhappy with the government's inability to pay
them.
	   Under the agreement, the United States will invest a total of
dlrs 30 million over the next five years to generate jobs by
bringing private companies and investors to 10 of Russia's leading
nuclear research centers.
	   Management and technological training that focus on the needs of
the individual will be part of the Russian-led initiative.
	   According to Adamov, Russian professionals working in the cities
had enjoyed living standards similar to those during Soviet times,
while the rest of Russia has seen a tremendous rise in crime and
unemployment in the past nine years.
	   But in July, workers at Sarov and Snezhinsk centers went on
strike, demanding five month's worth of unpaid wages. Nuclear
experts in the United States fear researchers will begin searching
for jobs elsewhere, including states which Washington believes are
keen on building nuclear weapons.
	   ``I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to us all that
economic hardship not drive Russian nuclear weapons scientists into
employment in places like Iran and North Korea,'' Richardson told
reports at a news conference.

Swiss back Argentine bid for details of bank accounts in Bussi
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss justice officials have agreed to
back Argentina's request that they provide Swiss bank account
information in the case of provincial Governor Antonio Bussi, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Dominique Reymond, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office, said it decided to enter the case after receiving
additional details from Argentina last July to support two previous
requests for legal assistance filed earlier this year.
	   Bussi's previously secret Swiss holdings, which he failed to
disclose as required by Argentine law, was discovered in February
during investigations surrounding Argentina's 1976-83 military
dictatorship.
	   Argentine reports say the case involves dlrs 100,000-150,000.
	   The former general, who governs the same province he ran during
the military's rule, was accused of misconduct as an elected
official. Suspended for 60 days in April, he denied any wrongdoing,
calling it an ``error of omission.''
	   Human rights groups claim the money was plundered from victims
of the military's ``dirty war'' on leftists and dissidents, which
left 9,000 dead or missing.
	   Bussi, who was charged with taking part in the executions, has
been granted amnesty under Argentina's 1986 and 1987 laws on the
period.

Mexico City mayor calls for files to be opened on 1968 massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Government and military files on the 1968
massacre of student-led protesters should be opened so that
Mexicans will know the answers to lingering questions, such as who
ordered the soldiers to open fire, Mexico City's mayor says.
	   ``It has been unjust that the military carry, until today, the
responsibilities of the massacre,'' Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said
Monday at a university conference on the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre.
	   ``It is not fair that an institution carry the guilt which
belongs to individuals.''
	   Most observers say at least 300 people died after a mix of
uniformed soldiers, police and men in civilian clothing surrounded
and opened fire on a peaceful pro-democracy demonstration in Mexico
City. But officials have claimed only about 30 died in the event,
just weeks before Mexico hosted the Olympics.
	   Official files have never been released.
	   There have been growing calls for the government to release
information as opposition political parties have gained power. Only
in recent years has the Institutional Revolutionary Party begun to
loosen the control it held over all levels of government since its
1929 founding.
	   Cardenas, an opposition leader who in 1997 became the capital
city's first modern elected mayor, said the men who advised
then-President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz should present their version of
the events leading to the massacre.
	   Luis Echeverria, who as interior minister at the time controlled
internal security and police forces, said in a report published
this week that he had nothing to do with sending in the army. He
said Diaz Ordaz, who died in 1979, had excluded him from
decision-making.
	   Cardenas said revealing the truth about the repression would
undoubtedly help eliminate tensions, heal wounds and promote a more
constructive and fruitful community, the government news agency
Notimex reported.

Top Palestinian security officers meet with CIA officials

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ CIA representatives met Palestinian security
officials Tuesday in an effort to get Yasser Arafat's Authority to
spell out steps it will take to combat terrorism, a Palestinian
official said.
	   Israel has said any agreement for the next withdrawal of its
forces from West Bank territory is contingent on the Palestinians
laying out a detailed security plan.
	   But the Palestinians have conditions of their own, said Amin al
Hindi, chief of Palestinian intelligence. The Palestinians want the
United States, which is mediating between the sides, to make
similar demands of the Israelis.
	   ``The Americans told us they understood our insistence on
reciprocity,'' Hindi said. He added that Palestinian security
branches were interested in cooperation with Israeli counterparts.
	   Hindi and Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian Preventive
Security in Gaza, were taking part in the meeting with CIA
officials in Gaza City.
	   With Israeli-Palestinian peace-making at an 18-month standstill,
the CIA has acted as a catalyst for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation
on security issues.
	   A Palestinian negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Palestinians want Israel to agree to guidelines on six
security-related issues: confiscation of weapons from militant
Palestinian and Jewish groups, outlawing terrorist organizations on
both sides, incitement, weapons registration, a definition of full
security cooperation, and a mechanism for dealing with criminal
suspects.
	   The Palestinians have pledged in past agreements to fight
terrorism. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
charged that the Palestinians have not been doing enough on
security matters and have a revolving-door policy with regard to
militants.
	   Hindi denied the accusation.
	   ``It is Israel who has the revolving-door policy,'' Hindi said,
citing an Israeli court decision Friday to release a Jewish
settler, suspected of killing a Palestinian teen-ager, into house
arrest.

No obvious front-runners for the Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NILS MYKLEBOST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Ailing Czech President Vaclav Havel, the
Colombian children's peace movement and players in the Northern
Ireland peace process are seen as among the contenders for this
year's Nobel Peace Prize.
	   That's to the extent that anything at all can be seen about the
secrecy-cloaked prize process.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee reveals next to nothing about the
process, confirming only the number of nominees made by the Feb. 1
deadline _ a record 139 this year. Even that number isn't
definitive, because committee members themselves can make
nominations later.
	   Some nominees become known because whoever nominated them will
announce it; but others remain as close-mouthed as the committee.
	   There are no obvious front-runners for this year's prize, which
is to be announced Oct. 16 and is worth 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 975,000).
	   Havel is a confirmed nominee and may have a strong chance, for
reasons both pleasant and unpleasant.
	   Giving the prize to the noted human rights champion could be a
way for the prize to mark this year's 50th anniversary of the
United Nations Human Rights Charter. Plus, Havel has had serious
health problems recently and the prize is not awarded posthumously.
	   Previous prize-winners are among those who can make nominations
and 1996 laureate Jose Ramos Horta has proposed the approximately 3
million Colombian children in the movement trying to end the
country's three-decade-long civil war.
	   Norway's NTB news agency, an astute observer of the prizes, has
suggested that a top contender may be someone involved in the
Northern Ireland peace process. It is one of the few notable
successes in peace efforts this year.
	   But the committee's problem would be who to give the prize to -
the actors or the mediators.
	   In recent years the tendency has been toward not giving the
prize to mediators, such as in 1994 when the prize went to Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, his foreign minister Shimon Peres and
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat for the Middle East peace accord. The
Norwegian mediators who brokered the agreement were not included.
	   Giving the peace prize to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster
Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume would
certainly not be any less controversial.
	   Another way to honor the Human Rights Charter could be to give
the prize to the International War Crimes tribunals for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda, an award which could be interpreted as a
boost to the work for a permanent international war crimes court.
Last summer it was agreed to establish such a court, but key
countries like the United States and China opposed it.
	   Other candidates who have been among the favorites the last few
years, and are thought to be on the list again, are Kurdish
activist Leyla Zana, who was just given another two years on top of
the 15-year sentence she is serving in a Turkish jail, and Chinese
dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.
	   Organizations that could be honored include the medical charity
Doctors without Borders and The Salvation Army, both of which have
been mentioned among the front-runners for several years.
	   As usual a long list of presidents, religious leaders and
charities are also on the list, such as the presidents of South
Korea, Kim Dae-Jung, and Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui.

Four U.N. observers attacked in breakaway Georgian region

leader. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on a bus of 10 United
Nations workers in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, wounding
four, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. military observers were attacked Monday night in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Four of the workers _ two from Bangladesh, one Nigerian, and one
Abkhazian _ were wounded in the attack, ITAR-Tass said, citing the
leader of the U.N. mission, Rasheed Al-Haroun.
	   Three of the workers were taken to Turkey for medical treatment,
though the report did not identify them.
	   Earlier, Astamur Taniya, press secretary to Abkhazian leader
Vladislav Ardzinba, had said that only one of the military
observers had been wounded.
	   Ardzinba called the incident an attempt to destabilize the
region, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia denounced the attack, saying it ``proves a pressing need
for resolute action on the part of the Georgian and Abkhazian
authorities to normalize the situation,'' the Interfax news agency
reported, citing an unidentified source in Russia's Foreign
Ministry.
	   An investigation into the incident is under way, Interfax
reported.
	   The United Nations keeps a group of military observers in
Georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and
separatists in Abkhazia.
	   A U.N. worker from Poland, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, was shot
and killed in July outside her apartment in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
	   Meanwhile, Georgian and Abkhazian leaders began talks Tuesday in
Tbilisi, but expressly avoided political debate. The two sides
discussed restoring the region's railroads and energy system,
including a natural gas pipeline, said Sergei Bagapsh, who led the
Abkhazian delegation.
	   ``A wide range of questions of economic nature has been
discussed,'' Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said at a news
conference after the meeting. He added that he was ready to fly to
Sukhumi, the Abkhazian capital, to talk with Ardzinba.
	   ``The time has come for our meeting,'' the Georgian president
said. ``I do not think one should be afraid, for those who are
afraid will never succeed.''
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia became an independent state in the wake of
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 war,
driving out Georgian soldiers and ethnic Georgians. Violence has
broken out periodically since then despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the region.

Director, editor of Iran's official news agency detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police detained Tuesday a deputy director
and an editor of Iran's official news agency, the agency reported.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Mohammad Reza Sadeq, its
deputy managing director, and Ali-Reza Khosravi, the social affairs
editor, were detained by court order after a senior cleric filed a
complaint against them.
	   Mohsen Rafiqdoust complained to a Tehran court about an IRNA
report on an attempt on his life on Sept. 13.
	   The nature of the complaint was not immediately known, but on
Sept. 13 the agency initially suggested that Rafiqdoust had been
injured, saying he was ``in satisfactory condition'' and ``received
no serious injuries.''
	   Later the agency reported Rafiqdoust had not been hurt in the
attack, which occurred when shots were fired through the window of
his high-rise office in North Tehran from nearby hills.
	   Sadeq and Khosravi were interrogated for five hours before their
detention, IRNA reported Tuesday.
	   Rafiqdoust, a hard-line cleric, is the head of a foundation that
cares for the poor and persons disabled in the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.
	   Last week, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also a
hard-liner, called on the judiciary to deal with what he called
``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   On Sunday, two newspapers were shutdown for publishing stories
critical of hard-line leaders and their polices.

	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Shrugging off international blame
for the Kosovo bloodshed, Yugoslav and Serb forces backed by
blistering artillery strikes on Tuesday launched an offensive on
the last remaining stronghold of secessionist rebels.
	   By late Tuesday, the Serb-Yugoslav forces had seized at least
four guerrilla-held villages and killed many rebels, said the Serb
Media Center, which releases official information. Several hundred
more guerrillas withdrew deeper into Drenica.
	   Ethnic Albanian residents from at least 12 additional villages
were forced to flee into nearby forests, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which represents the ethnic Albanian viewpoint.
	   At least 10,000 to 15,000 civilians are believed trapped in the
region. As of a few days ago, many were hiding in hills and forests
of central Drenica, fearing a Serb offensive.
	   Amid the intense fighting, the United Nations pondered ways to
end the killing and avert the threat of mass deaths from cold and
starvation this winter of thousands of unsheltered refugees.
	   At the U.N. General Assembly, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel condemned the use of force by both sides but said most to
blame was Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He must realize that the international community will react
with military force if necessary,'' Kinkel said, alluding to the
threat of NATO involvement.
	   The issue of a NATO role in ending the Kosovo fighting has for
months been unresolved, with some European nations insisting it can
come only if approved by the U.N. Security Council. That has been
unlikely, considering strong opposition by Russia, an ally of
Serbia, and China, which fears precedents of outside involvement in
its dispute in Tibet.
	   But Kinkel on Tuesday said he now expects Russia to support a
Security Council resolution seen by Western powers as a
``springboard'' to a resolution sanctioning the use of force.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed''
Kinkel said, calling the change ``a big step forward.''

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon after 2 soldiers killed in accident

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Tuesday hours after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a tank accident.
	   Four Israeli jets fired nine missiles at guerrilla infiltration
trails and hideouts near Litani River, some 25 kilometers (16
miles) southeast of the southern port of Tyre, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6 p.m. (15:00
GMT) air raid, which occurred about four kilometers (2.5 miles)
from a hill where an Israeli tank overturned at dawn Tuesday,
killing two Israeli soldiers and injuring three others.
	   The tank rolled over near the village of Kantara in the eastern
sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, said the
Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately clear whether anti-Israeli guerrillas had
any role in the tank incident.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was passing
in the area, causing ``definite casualties.''
	   Lebanese security officials could not confirm the Hezbollah
claim and there was no immediate comment from Israel.
	   After the accident, Israeli artillery fired shells at suspected
guerrilla positions north of the occupied zone and Israeli
helicopters strafed mountains in southeast Lebanon believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen
from the enclave Israel set up in 1985 as a buffer zone to protect
its northern towns from guerrilla attack.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts to halt the collapse of
Angola's four-year-old peace pact have been thwarted because the
government says it cannot guarantee the safe movement of
international mediators, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special envoy Issa Diallo wants to meet with Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of the former rebel group UNITA, at the central
highland town where he lives ``in a bid to put the peace process
back on track,'' the U.N. said in a written statement.
	   But Diallo has not been able to fly out of the capital because
the government says it cannot ensure his safety, according to the
statement.
	   The government earlier this month broke off all contact with
Savimbi and is keen to see him internationally isolated.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last week wrote to the U.N.
Security Council urging it to follow the Angolan government in
dealing only with a group of UNITA dissidents who have broken with
Savimbi.
	   However, the Security Council instead called on the government
to reverse its decision to sever dialogue with the rebel chief,
reportedly angering Dos Santos.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato accused the
government of fabricating reasons to prevent the peace process
advancing.
	   ``The government shouldn't be obstructing efforts toward
dialogue ... toward relaunching the peace process,'' Lukamba Gato
said in a telephone interview.
	   Diallo's flight difficulties came amid unconfirmed reports of
fighting between the UNITA and government forces in remote areas of
the vast southwest African country _ the latest sign that the
U.N.-mediated 1994 peace pact that ended a two-decade civil war is
unraveling.
	   Citing unidentified military sources, Angolan media reported
clashes between the former foes in the Lunda Norte and Malanje
provinces, several hundred kilometers (miles) east of the capital.
No details were given, and officials declined to comment.
	   Continuing hostility between the two sides has long stymied the
peace process that has made no progress since last May.
	   The government has accused UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of failing to
comply with the peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four central
highland strongholds in contravention of the peace accord, bringing
U.N. sanctions against it.
	   The governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or
MPLA, has expelled UNITA officials from the national unity
government.

Former president warns authorities could be falsely targeted in
</HEADLINE>
probe &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has issued a warning through his lawyer that other top
officials from his administration could be falsely targeted in drug
trafficking probes.
	   The statement, carried Tuesday by Mexican media, followed the
leak of a report by Swiss authorities claiming that his brother
Raul oversaw practically all drug trafficking in Mexico during
Salinas' 1988-94 presidency.
	   ``The attack is so grave ... that neither you, Mr. Attorney
General of the Republic, nor your colleagues, can escape the
charges expressed by these people,'' Salinas said in a statement
made through his lawyer Mariano Albor and released to the Mexican
press.
	   Albor did not immediately respond to a message left at his
office Tuesday morning.
	   Attorney General Jorge Madrazo did not immediately respond
publicly to the former president's warning. He was delivering his
annual report to Congress on Tuesday. Madrazo was president of the
government's National Human Rights Commission under Salinas.
	   The public warning by Salinas, last believed to be living in
Ireland in self-imposed exile, was highly unusual.
	   Meanwhile, the Attorney General's Office said Monday it is
analyzing a ``significant amount'' of evidence regarding possible
drug-related activity by Raul Salinas.
	   Prosecutors in Switzerland, where bank accounts belonging to
Raul Salinas were seized in 1995, have reportedly compiled evidence
that the former president's older brother may have accepted bribes
to allow drugs to be shipped through Mexico.
	   ``The Attorney General's Office is analyzing a significant
amount of documentary evidence which indicate specific lines of
investigation'' into Raul Salinas' alleged drug links, the office
said in a press statement.
	   The office said it would not make that evidence public ``to
avoid interfering with the investigation.''
	   The New York Times reported Saturday that Swiss investigators
say Raul Salinas controlled ``practically all drug shipments
through Mexico,'' and may have received as much as dlrs 500 million
in drug bribes.
	   Raul Salinas has been imprisoned and on trial for more than
three years on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of a
political rival, and for illicit enrichment while he held a
mid-level government post during his brother's administration.
	   No specifically drug-related charges have been brought against
him, but he was charged with money laundering and acquitted on a
technicality.

HIV-infected Ugandans show princess `memory books'

	   MAKINDYE, Uganda (AP) _ A mother dying of AIDS on Tuesday
proudly showed Princess Anne books of memories and photographs she
is making to leave her three children, who already lost their
father to the disease.
	   ``When I am dead no one will be left to tell them about their
parents, or their childhoods,'' said Irene Namagembe, 34.
	   One of the many charities the princess heads, Save the Children,
has helped Namagembe and more than 100 other women make ``memory
books'' for their children.
	   Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter, is on a four-country,
11-day visit to Africa, focusing on her charity work. She also
planned to travel to Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius.
	   In Makindye, 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) on a rutted road east
of Kampala, Anne mingled with the HIV-infected women, admired their
memory books, listened to the problems they've encountered, and
played with their children.
	   At least 10 percent of Uganda's population of nearly 20 million
people is infected with the AIDS virus, according to government
figures. More than 500,000 have died of the immune-stripping
disease.
	   President Yoweri Museveni has led Africa's most aggressive
campaign to control the spread of AIDS, with marked successes. In
some areas, the infection rate is half the level of a decade ago,
according to World Bank figures.
	   Namagembe said she hopes the education program will spare her
three boys _ ages 5, 7 and 12 _ from getting AIDS.
	   She said she is slowly using her memory books, one for each
child, to teach them about the sickness that killed their father
and will kill her, too.
	   ``I've told them that at any time, I can die, but these people
in the book can help you,'' she said.
	   Namagembe also has recorded memories only a mother can share
with her child. With a hearty laugh, she pointed to a photo of her
eldest as a round-faced infant, and said: ``Ezra was a very fat
baby,'' who breast fed greedily until age 3. He loved the zoo and a
dog named Judy, but hated porridge.
	   She encouraged him to pursue his dream of being an artist, and
admired his talent for drawing.
	   On Wednesday, the princess planned to meet with Museveni, and to
open an new British-built AIDS clinic.

Ukraine's chief banker says conversion plan successful
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Most foreign investors have agreed to swap
their Ukrainian domestic treasury bills for longer-term paper under
a government debt restructuring plan, the central bank chief said
Tuesday.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said foreign investors
already have provided the government with notices of agreement to
convert 79 percent of the bonds. Ukraine's currency and financial
system have been badly thrashed by the economic crisis in
neighboring Russia.
	   Budget revenues are insufficient to cover all debt obligations,
and the restructuring plan was meant to postpone some of the debt
payments.
	   Details of the plan were not made public, but Ukrainian bankers
said foreigners were offered to redeem 20 percent of the bonds
immediately and to change the rest into Eurobonds with a 20 percent
annual interest rate.
	   The new bonds are to be redeemed in September and December 2000.
Foreign investors are holding an estimated 1.8 billion hryvna (dlrs
580 million at the current exchange rate) in Ukrainian bonds,
originally slated to mature by August 1999.
	   They have largely dismissed an earlier conversion plan involving
longer-term bonds denominated in hryvnas.
	   The government has extended the expiration date for its new
offer several times, and it is slated to expire on Friday. An
International Monetary Fund mission now on a short-term visit to
Kiev is observing the conversion, Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy
Tyhypko said in comments cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF has made government debt restructuring one of the
conditions for the approval of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine.
	   The first dlrs 257 million tranche was received this month, and
Ukrainian officials said the mission's visit came to assess the
situation following its release.
	   The government also has been negotiating debt conversion terms
with domestic banks. The banks have protested against what they saw
as a forced conversion plan, and the government issued assurances
that all such deals would be voluntary.

Parliament approves opening communist-era files
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated parliament approved
legislation Tuesday to allow individuals to look into their files
set up by the communist secret service.
	   The bill, which still requires the Senate's and president's
approval, is part of Poland's efforts to deal with its communist
past. It is seen as a means of screening secret service
collaborators in order to bar them from top state posts.
	   The legislation calls for setting up in January the Institute of
National Remembrance, to collect communist secret service files
from 1944-89 as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes.
	   The institute will make them available to individual victims of
the totalitarian regimes and reveal the names of agents and
informers.
	   The first files should be available by the end of 1999,
according to Janusz Palubicki, the government minister in charge
the of secret service.
	   He said as many as 4 million people _ one in 10 Poles _ could be
interested in checking their files.
	   ``I'm glad that after all those years we made the first step to
give citizens access to information about themselves,'' Palubicki,
who presented the government-proposed bill to parliament in March,
said after the vote.
	   The bill supported by center and right-wing deputies and opposed
by the ex-communists, was approved by a vote of 237-157, with 10
abstentions.
	   It was not immediately known when the Solidarity-dominated
Senate could move to approve the bill and its supporters hoped that
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, who has
spoken against disclosing the informers' names, will not veto the
law.
	   Since toppling the communist regime in 1989, Poles have been
divided on whether old secret service files should be opened at
all. Some argue the files were falsified by the secret police and a
part of the files were destroyed when the Iron Curtain fell.
	   Others insist those collaborating with the secret police should
be made known to the public and barred from holding public office.
	   Poland's first attempt to open secret files was made in June
1992 by the rightist government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski.
But after his interior minister distributed lists of alleged secret
agents to lawmakers - which were immediately leaked, the government
was toppled on a no-confidence vote.

No obvious front-runners for the Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NILS MYKLEBOST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Ailing Czech President Vaclav Havel, the
Colombian children's peace movement and players in the Northern
Ireland peace process are seen as among the top contenders for this
year's Nobel Peace Prize.
	   That's to the extent that anything at all can be seen about the
secrecy-cloaked prize process.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee reveals next to nothing about the
process, confirming only the number of nominees made by the Feb. 1
deadline _ a record 139 this year. Even that number isn't
definitive, because committee members themselves can make
nominations later.
	   Some nominees become known because whoever nominated them will
announce it; but others remain as close-mouthed as the committee.
	   This year's prize will be announced Oct. 16 and is worth 7.6
million Swedish kronor (dlrs 975,000).
	   Havel is a confirmed nominee and may have a strong chance, for
reasons both pleasant and unpleasant.
	   Giving the prize to the noted human rights champion could be a
way for the prize to mark this year's 50th anniversary of the
United Nations Human Rights Charter. Plus, Havel has had serious
health problems recently and the prize is not awarded posthumously.
	   Previous prize-winners are among those who can make nominations
and 1996 laureate Jose Ramos Horta has proposed the approximately 3
million Colombian children in the movement trying to end the
country's three-decade-long civil war.
	   Norway's NTB news agency, an astute observer of the prizes, has
suggested that a top contender may be someone involved in the
Northern Ireland peace process. It is one of the few notable
successes in peace efforts this year.
	   In recent years the tendency has been toward not giving the
prize to mediators, such as in 1994 when the prize went to Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, his foreign minister Shimon Peres and
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat for the Middle East peace accord. The
Norwegian mediators who brokered the agreement were not included.
	   Giving the peace prize to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster
Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume would
certainly not be any less controversial.
	   Another way to honor the Human Rights Charter could be to give
the prize to the International War Crimes tribunals for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda, an award which could be interpreted as a
boost to the work for a permanent international war crimes court.
Last summer it was agreed to establish such a court, but key
countries like the United States and China opposed it.
	   Other candidates who have been among the favorites the last few
years, and are thought to be on the list again, are Kurdish
activist Leyla Zana, who was just given another two years on top of
the 15-year sentence she is serving in a Turkish jail, and Chinese
dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.
	   Organizations that could be honored include the medical charity
Doctors without Borders and The Salvation Army, both of which have
been mentioned among the front-runners for several years.
	   As usual a long list of presidents, religious leaders and
charities are also on the list, such as the presidents of South
Korea, Kim Dae-Jung, and Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui.

Prosecution team announced for Pan Am bombing trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Scotland's chief prosecutor announced
Tuesday he will lead a six-member team to prosecute two Libyans
suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who were
indicted in the United States and Scotland, are due to be tried by
Scottish judges at a court in The Netherlands. Libya and the
suspects are still arguing over the terms.
	   ``All that remains is for Libya to comply with the United
Nations Security Council resolution and to deliver the accused for
trial in the Netherlands,'' said Lord Hardie, Scotland's chief
prosecutor whose official title is Lord Advocate.
	   The other members of the team are Scottish Solicitor General
Colin Boyd, and lawyers Alastair Campbell, Alan Turnbull and
Jonathan Lake. The sixth member will be identified later.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Germany threatened Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic with military force Tuesday if he doesn't loosen
his grip on the separatist province of Kosovo, saying NATO was
prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis.
	   In a speech to world leaders gathered for the General Assembly,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned the use of force by
Milosevic's forces and by the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is
fighting for the independence of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
make up 90 percent of the population.
	   However, ``Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic,'' Kinkel said in his prepared
text. ``He must realize that the international community will react
with military force if necessary.''
	   Russia, however, has said it is flatly opposed to any threat of
force.
	   The use of force to resolve the Kosovo conflict ``might lead to
a big war with unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and
Europe at large,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the
assembly Tuesday. He called for a solution based on returning
Kosovo's autonomy, which was removed by Milosevic in 1989, while
respecting Yugoslavia's borders.
	   Kinkel told reporters, however, that for the first time he
expected Russia to support a Security Council resolution which a
German official said will describe Milosevic's position as
affecting and endangering regional stability.
	   Endangering regional stability is the only ground that the
council has used in the past for military intervention in an
internal conflict.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed,''
Kinkel said.
	   Kinkel on Monday urged his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, to
support a resolution and said afterwards that Tang told him China
would seriously consider the request.
	   Like Russia, China is a permanent Security Council member and
could veto any such resolution. In the past, China has said it
would consult closely with Russia on any Kosovo resolution.
	   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged strong action
by the Security Council to stop the Serb crackdown.
	   Britain and France last week began drafting a Security Council
resolution that would demand an immediate cease-fire in the
province and authorize force to make Milosevic comply, council
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic also came under heated criticism Tuesday from Wolfgang
Schussel, the Austrian foreign minister, who demanded he stop the
repression in Kosovo and withdraw Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   ``Their police and military operations have led to consequences
for the civilian population that are out of any justifiable
proportion,'' Schussel said in a prepared text, speaking on behalf
of the European Union.
	   Hundreds have been killed and over a quarter-million displaced
since February, when Serb forces began their crackdown on the KLA.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Imports are down and the gross domestic product is
falling. Inflation is climbing and unemployment is on the rise.
With every day, new statistics are showing the depth of Russia's
economic crisis.
	   Russia imported 19 percent less in August than it did during the
same month a year ago, the State Customs Committee said Tuesday,
The dramatic drop is just the latest reflection of the financial
woes facing the country's new government.
	   With the ruble rapidly losing value, the price of many imports
has doubled since the crisis erupted Aug. 17.
	   Also shrinking is the country's industrial output. After showing
signs of modest growth at the end of last year, it was 11.5 percent
lower this August than during the same period last year _ the
sharpest drop since 1994, the State Statistics Committee said on
Friday.
	   The country's gross domestic product was also heading downward,
shrinking 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year, the
committee said. That was before the worst of the crisis hit.
	   While those indicators fell, inflation and unemployment were
going in the other direction.
	   Inflation, less than 1 percent a month before the crisis hit,
soared to 43.3 percent in the first two weeks of September.
	   Meanwhile, joblessness increased last month to reach 8.35
million people, or 11.5 percent of the workforce. The rate is
expected to rise even higher as the crisis worsens.
	   The numbers underscore the seriousness of the problems facing
Yevgeny Primakov, who has been prime minister for just 11 days and
has yet to announce a comprehensive plan to deal with the worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   So far, Primakov has only spoken in general terms about the need
to continue reforms while easing the pain on the impoverished
population.
	   Meanwhile, several key government posts, including the job of
finance minister and the head of the state tax service, have not
yet been filled.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov said formation of the
Cabinet should be completed within the next few days. ``We hope
that all appointments will be made by the end of this week,'' he
said.
	   The new government already contains politicians from across the
political spectrum, and it's not yet clear how the government will
incorporate all the various viewpoints into a coherent economic
policy.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who fired the previous government a
month ago, signed an order Tuesday approving the structure of the
new Cabinet, which will include five new ministries.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister who is in charge
of economic policy, said Tuesday that continued movement toward a
free market was inevitable, but warned against moving too quickly.
	   ``Our speed and expectations have surpassed our real
opportunities, and instead of a free market we have got crisis and
collapse of our financial system,'' he said while on a trip to the
St. Petersburg region, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   But, he added, ``The role of the state must, of course, be
increased.''
	   Mikhail Zadornov, the acting finance minister, met with a senior
official from the International Monetary Fund to discuss the
government's anti-crisis plans.
	   The IMF led an international group which in July pledged dlrs
22.6 billion in credits for Russia by the end of next year. But
Russia's financial crisis and the change of governments have put
the program on hold.
	   Russian stocks rose slightly Tuesday, with the Russian Trading
System Index closing at 49.65 points, up from 47.81 Monday.
	   The battered ruble continued to trade at about 16 to the U.S.
dollar in over-the-counter trading on the Moscow currency exchange.
The level has remained roughly the same in recent days, but the
currency is still seen as unstable.

Senior Palestinian officials asks to be removed from negotiations

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian Cabinet minister who has
led official talks with Israel for the past two years, has asked
Yasser Arafat to remove him from the negotiations, a Palestinian
official said.
	   Saeb Erekat, one of the most well-known figures in the Mideast
peace talks, submitted his request to Arafat Monday, an official
close to Arafat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Erekat is reportedly angry that he has been side-stepped by the
speaker of the Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureai, who is
considered to be more moderate and has been handling a secretive
back-channel with the Israelis, meeting frequently with a confidant
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In a letter to Arafat, Erekat said he preferred to leave the
negotiations and focus on his duties as Minister of Local Affairs.
	   Arafat did not respond to Erekat's request, the Palestinian
official said and his aides were trying to pursued Erekat to change
his mind.
	   Erekat was not immediately available for comment but Arafat's
office said he was expected to meet with the Palestinian leader
late Tuesday in Gaza.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices rallied Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange, recouping some of their recent steep losses despite
continued concerns about world economic troubles.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 113.0
points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 5,103.3. Shares had climbed
slightly higher in the session but slipped off their peak after the

Serbs launch blistering attack as world leaders debate action

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Germany saying Russia has modified
Kosovo position; Serb forces surrounding rebels, adds comments of
police spokesman, Austrian foreign minister, description of
guerrillas in Drenica. No pick up &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Shrugging off international blame
for the Kosovo bloodshed, Yugoslav and Serb forces backed by
blistering artillery strikes on Tuesday launched an offensive on
the last remaining stronghold of secessionist rebels.
	   By late Tuesday, the Serb-Yugoslav forces had seized at least
four guerrilla-held villages and killed many rebels, said the Serb
Media Center, which releases official information. Several hundred
more guerrillas withdrew deeper into Drenica.
	   Ethnic Albanian residents from at least 12 additional villages
were forced to flee into nearby forests, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which represents the ethnic Albanian viewpoint.
	   At least 10,000 to 15,000 civilians are believed trapped in the
region. As of a few days ago, many were hiding in hills and forests
of central Drenica, fearing a Serb offensive.
	   Amid the intense fighting, the United Nations pondered ways to
end the killing and avert the threat of mass deaths from cold and
starvation this winter.
	   At the U.N. General Assembly, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel condemned the use of force by both sides but said most to
blame was Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He must realize that the international community will react
with military force if necessary,'' Kinkel said, alluding to the
threat of NATO involvement.
	   The issue of a NATO role in ending the Kosovo fighting has for
months been unresolved, with some European nations insisting it can
come only if approved by the U.N. Security Council. That has been
unlikely, considering strong opposition by Russia, an ally of
Serbia, and China, which fears precedents of outside involvement.
	   But Kinkel on Tuesday said he now expects Russia to support a
Security Council resolution seen by Western powers as a
``springboard'' to the use of force.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed''
Kinkel said, calling the change ``a big step forward.''
	   In Kosovo, the muzzle flashes from tanks and artillery could be
seen as Serb forces steadily pounded at least five villages on the
main road between Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica. Non-stop
machine-gun fire and explosions were also heard.
	   Columns of smoke could be seen rising from villages in the
north, west and south of Drenica.
	   Serb police say they've surrounded Drenica, west of Pristina,
the provincial capital, and are attacking from all sides to crush
the hundreds of rebels trapped there by Serb blockades and patrols.
	   ``According to the resistance they are putting up, they are not
willing to surrender,'' said police Col. Bozidar Filic. He claimed
government forces had routed the rebels from the rest of Kosovo and
many fled to the Drenica region in recent days.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists
six months ago. Since then, government forces have all but routed
the Kosovo Liberation Army, driving many members across the border
into Albania.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence in Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, the larger of the two republics in Yugoslavia. Most of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority support independence. Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed at least 16 people,
including six women and two children under age 5, had been injured
so far in the Serb attack on 15 villages.

	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ German cyclist Marcel Wust of the Festina
team won the 17th stage of the Tour of Spain in a relatively
relaxed days peddling that ensured Abraham Olano of Banesto stayed
atop the overall standings.
	   Wust sprinted past the finish line at the head of the pack that
had covered the 188.5-kilometer (116.9-mile) run between the
northern cities of Burgos and Leon in 4 hours, 55 minutes and 33
seconds.
	   Olano of Spain and the Banesto team remained in the No. 1 spot,
22 seconds clear of his nearest rival Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of
the ONCE-Deutsche Bank squad.
	   Tuesday's leg included just one breakaway attempt that began
about midway through the stage when Spaniard Marias Cagigas of the
Estepona Brepac set off to open up a lead of well over four minutes
before the pack slowly but surely began to catch up.
	   The pace picked up in the final kilometers (miles) until the
final sprint finish.
	   Wednesday's 18th round from Leon 233 kilometers (144.5 miles)
south to Salamanca is a virtually flat run.
	   With just five more stages to go in the 22-leg cycling marathon,
Jalabert told the news agency Europa Press he still felt he was in
the running.
	   ``If Olano does something wrong I could catch up the 22
seconds,'' Europa quoted him as saying, although he added that the
leader's Banesto team was ``very strong and is controlling the Tour
very well.''

Government claims to have bombed Bukavu prove false
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUKAVU, Congo (AP) _ Thunder rumbled over Bukavu's Kavumbu
airport Tuesday like bombers on an attack run.
	   But there were no signs of damage at the airport 34 kilometers
(21 miles) from the capital of South Kivu region, despite claims
Monday by the government of President Laurent Kabila that his
forces had bombed the airport and destroyed a rebel aircraft about
to take off.
	   ``Why does Kabila lie like that?'' asked rebel official Bizima
Karaha, who defected from his post as Congo's Foreign Minister when
the rebellion began Aug. 2. ``I see he hasn't changed at all.''
	   Kabila and the rebels, who occupy large portions of eastern
Congo, have been fighting a propaganda war since real fighting
broke out early last month, often with no independent confirmation
of claims and counterclaims on either side.
	   But in recent weeks, rebel officials have taken journalists to
places the government claimed to have attacked or captured.
	   There were no damaged aircraft on the runway Tuesday, and dozens
of soldiers armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and heavy
machineguns lolled on the grass along the tarmac.
	   The rebels, a collection of disgruntled soldiers and political
opponents of Kabila, took control of Bukavu in the first days of
the rebellion after the battalion controlling the city at the
southern end of Lake Kivu mutinied and joined rebel forces.
	   They accuse Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal
strife. He levied the same charges against longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko a year and a half ago before he swept to power in May
1997 at the end of an eight-month rebellion that also began in the
eastern towns of Bukavu and Goma.
	   But unlike the previous rebellion that enjoyed overwhelming
popular support, the current uprising has met with skepticism from
a population unsure another war will help their lives.
	   Karaha, a popular figure who grew up in Bukavu, visited the town
Monday and Tuesday to help rally support for his renewed fight
against the political powers in Kinshasa.
	   ``They say they understand why we fought Mobutu and even why we
are fighting Kabila,'' Karaha said. ``But a big problem they have
is why must it start here.''
	   Karaha said people were also concerned about security since some
forces loyal to Kabila have taken refuge among residents
sympathetic to the government in several of the rebel-held towns.
	   He added that the Kivu towns were still threatened by rebels
from Rwanda and Uganda and by local Mai Mai fighters all now allied
with Kabila's forces and based in the dense forests of eastern
Congo.
	   On Sept. 14, a large group of Mai Mai and Rwandan Hutu rebels
attacked the rebel stronghold of Goma at the north end of the lake
and waged a six hour battle with rebel troops before retreating.
	   On Tuesday rebel-controlled Radio Goma announced that the rebel
administration was establishing a court martial in Goma to
prosecute soldiers and civilians supected of involvement in the
attack and of any other military collaboration with government
forces.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to shore up
Kabila's forces after the rebels nearly capture the capital,
Kinshasa, last month.
	   Kabila flew to Gabon Tuesday where he was expected to attend a
mini-summit with leaders of the Central African Republic and
Mozambique, hosted by Gabonese President Omar Bongo.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of Malaysia's jailed
pro-reform leader alleged police harassment after troops surrounded
her house Tuesday, and accused the government of being evasive
about the charges against her husband.
	   Anwar Ibrahim's wife, Azizah Ismail, said that neither she nor
his lawyers had been allowed to meet him since his arrest Sunday.
Police have also threatened her with arrest for suggesting her
husband had been injected with the HIV virus while in police
detention.
	   Police had not responded to repeated requests by lawyers and
Anwar's family for information, Azizah told reporters.
	   She described ``intimidating circumstances'' under which
policemen had interrogated her twice Tuesday and her lawyers had to
intervene to halt harassment.
	   Truckloads of field troops carrying assault rifles surrounded
Anwar's home Tuesday. Another 30 riot police with tear gas
canisters were posted outside the house, while about 500 supporters
milled about.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar denies all the charges. He says trouble started when he
began questioning Mahathir's authority and challenged his
17-year-rule.
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar, arrested
Sunday under a colonial security law that allows imprisonment
without trial, was being held at Kuala Lumpur's police
headquarters.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Anwar would be
brought to court later this week.
	   Police did not take Anwar to court Monday to be arraigned
because of a crowd of supporters outside the courthouse, said d
	   Azizah said policemen who smashed into her house and took away
Anwar had not said he was being arrested under the Internal
Security Act.
	   His lawyers were under the impression that Anwar would be
charged with sodomy, treason and abuse of power, offenses that
police said they were investigating.
	   ``There has been no transparency in the way things have been
done,'' she said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Mahathir said he personally interviewed people
who said they engaged in illegal sex acts with his ousted deputy
because the accusations were so vile he wanted to investigate
himself.
	   Twelve 12 prominent Anwar sympathizers and opposition party
leaders have been arrested since his detention. The latest was of
Zamberi Abdul Kadir, a youth leader in the northern state of Perak.
	   Regarding Azizah's suggestions that Anwar had been injected with
HIV, Mahathir told a news conference Tuesday: ``She has made
certain allegations against the police which amount to
incitement.''
	   The human rights group Amnesty International said the use of the
security act against Anwar indicated the government was pursuing a
political agenda rather than an independent investigation.
	   The government defends the law as a means of keeping order in
normally placid Malaysia.
	   Police Tuesday said 132 people, including 17 foreigners, were
detained for involvement in the protests.
	   About 20 or 30 supporters gathered for a rally in a Kuala Lumpur
suburb late Tuesday, but they were outnumbered by police and there
were no speeches, posters or pamphlets.
	   The unrest comes during the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II
and her husband, Prince Philip. Demonstrators Monday lunged at the
queen's convoy as it drove by, prompting riot police to move in.
	   Malaysia's worst police crackdown in 11 years has severely
handicapped the nascent movement for a more liberal government.
Although Anwar said his wife would continue to lead the campaign,
she has been intimidated by police.
	   ``Practically all the leaders have been detained,'' said Mohamed
Hisham, one of the organizers of Tuesday's rally. ``But we will
regroup by using pamphlets and by word of mouth. The people will
come back.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian Cabinet minister who has
led negotiations with Israel for two years has asked Yasser Arafat
to remove him from the talks, a Palestinian official said.
	   Saeb Erekat, one of the most well-known figures in the Mideast
peace talks, submitted his request to Arafat on Monday, an official
close to Arafat said on condition of anonymity.
	   Erekat is reportedly angry that he has been side-stepped by the
speaker of the Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureai, who is
considered more moderate and has been handling secretive talks with
the Israelis, meeting frequently with a confidante of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In a letter to Arafat, Erekat said he preferred to leave the
negotiations and focus on his duties as Minister of Local Affairs.
	   Arafat did not respond to Erekat's request and his aides were
trying to pursued Erekat to change his mind, the Palestinian
official said.
	   Erekat was not immediately available for comment, but Arafat's
office said he was expected to meet with the Palestinian leader
later Tuesday in Gaza.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers proposal on property disputes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Greek Cypriot reaction grafs 11-13; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Tuesday proposed setting up a joint commission with Greek Cypriots
to settle property claims by people on both sides of the divided
island.
	   The offer follows a July ruling by the European Court of human
rights ordering Turkey to pay compensation to a Greek Cypriot woman
for depriving her of property in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state. Another 40 similar cases are pending.
	   Fearing a wave of claims, Turkey rejected the court's ruling,
saying it could not legally be held responsible for property in the
Turkish Cypriot state.
	   The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded the northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece. Only Ankara recognizes the
breakaway state.
	   ``The exchange of property is one of the basic points that need
to be settled for a solution to the Cyprus problem,'' Denktash told
reporters after a meeting with Ann Hercus, the new U.N. resident
envoy in Cyprus.
	   On the Greek side of Nicosia, no Cypriot government spokesman
could be reached for a reaction Tuesday. But previously the Greek
Cypriots have rejected any exchange of properties and called for
refugees to be allowed to return to their properties.
	   The Cypriot government, which is elected by Greek Cypriots,
insists on the application of U.N. Security Council resolutions
that endorse the right of refugees to return to their homes on
either side of the island.
	   Greek Cypriots view Denktash's demand for property exchanges and
compensation as a means of consolidating the division of the
island.
	   Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from their
villages in the wake of the invasion. Their place was taken by
40,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south and settlers from the
Turkish mainland who were given Greek Cypriot property.

Top international official meets Serb politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Westendorp's office warning
against obstruction of democracy. &QL; 
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Trying to keep post-war
democracy-building on track, Bosnia's top international official
told Serb nationalists on Tuesday that only those who respected the
Dayton peace accords would receive foreign aid.
	   Bosnian High Representative Carlos Westendorp was meeting
politicians from rival Bosnian Serb camps for the first time since
the Sept. 12-13 election, and an apparent defeat of the
western-backed candidate for the presidency.
	   Although the final tally of the vote won't be known until later
this week, there are strong indications that a nationalist Nikola
Poplasen defeated Biljana Plavsic, the U.S.-backed incumbent, in
the presidential race.
	   Plavsic conceded defeat Monday even before results were
available but said she would remain on the political scene to fight
for democracy in the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia.
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia; reviving a measure of
coexistence among Serbs, Muslims and Croats after 3{ years of war
that ended in 1995 with a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``The message to different party leaders is whatever the result
is going to be, what we expect from them is full cooperation to
implement Dayton,'' Westendorp said. ``It is clear that the parties
which do not cooperate ... will act in detriment of the (Bosnian
Serb) population ... because they will not get any support from the
international community.''
	   ``Given that most of the political party leaders have said
openly in the election campaign they will comply with Dayton, there
is hope we can cooperate with all,'' he said.
	   Poplasen is the leader of an extreme nationalist Radical Party
in the Serb-run entity of Bosnia and a supporter of war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   But in an interview with the Associated Press Monday, Poplasen
denied fears that he will not cooperate with the West. He said he
would stick to the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing more
and nothing less.''
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard said Tuesday Poplasen
``will be tested early'' on his commitment to the peace process.
	   A senior U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Poplasen could be removed from office for any serious violation of
the Dayton accords by Westendorp, as part of his wide-ranging
powers to enforce the return to normality in Bosnia.
	   Westendorp's office suggested similar possible action. A
statement said he would not hesitate to take action against those
responsible for a ``deliberate disruption of the democratic
process.''
	   Plavsic's government has improved ties with the West following
her break with the pro-Karadzic camp last year and a pledge to
implement the Dayton accords. The moderates have received millions
of dollars of international aid which had been denied to the
previous, hardline government.
	   On Tuesday, Plavsic's Serb National Alliance said that the party
would not dispute any results announced by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian security officials were meeting
with CIA representatives Tuesday as part of an American effort to
get Yasser Arafat's Authority to spell out specific measures it
will take to combat terror, a Palestinian official said.
	   Israel has said any peace agreement for a next withdrawal of its
forces from West Bank territory was contingent on the Palestinians
laying out a detailed security plan.
	   But the Palestinians have conditions of their own, said Amin al
Hindi, chief of Palestinian intelligence. The Palestinians want the
United States, which is mediating between the sides, to make
similar demands of the Israelis.
	   ``The Americans told us they understood our insistence on
reciprocity,'' Hindi said. He added that Palestinian security
branches were interested in cooperation with Israeli counterparts
and open to new ideas on how to implement security arrangements.
	   Hindi and Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian Preventive
Security in Gaza were participating in the meeting with CIA
officials in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Supporters of Dagestani opposition leader marching to capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 500 supporters of an opposition leader in
the troubled Russian republic of Dagestan have begun a march on the
regional capital of Makhachkala, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The protesters are marching about 100 kilometers from the
Novolaksky district to the capital to demand the release of Magomed
Khachilayev, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Khachilayev was arrested earlier this month on charges of
organizing a May 21 raid on the government building in Makhachkala
with his brother, Nadir Khachilayev.
	   Nadir Khachilayev heads Russia's Muslim Union, a leading
organization of Muslims. Magomed Khachilayev is the leader of the
Laktsi People's Movement, which represents the Lak ethnic group in
Dagestan. Both brothers have been leading opponents of the regional
government.
	   Dagestan, which borders Chechnya in the volatile Caucasus
region, has been roiled by ethnic strife as well as the lawlessness
and violence that have engulfed the entire area.
	   The marchers who are demanding Khachilayev's release are
expected to reach Makhachkala on Thursday, ITAR-Tass said, citing
organizers of the protest.

Kosovo refugees kicked out of Montenegro a new problem

<TEXT>
	   SHKODRA, Albania (AP) _ By any measure, Hysen Gashi and a few
dozen others from Kosovo endured a living hell over the past two
weeks.
	   They fled their homes under assault from Serb forces, walking
for days to the border of Montenegro. They were kicked out of
Montenegro, sent by bus to the Albanian border with few possessions
and little money.
	   It got worse. Gunmen stopped a hired truck transporting them to
the northern Albanian town of Shkodra and took almost all their
meager belongings. Now they are new statistics in the latest wave
of refugees needing help from international aid agencies as the
Balkan winter approaches.
	   More than 4,500 refugees from the Serbian province of Kosovo
have registered in Shkodra in recent weeks and more were expected.
All tell similar stories of hardship. All find themselves with
little money, few clothes and no answers to their single biggest
question: What next?
	   ``I know that Albania is a poor country. I just hope it has the
necessities to help the Kosovar,'' said Sadik Cekaj, who sat in a
Shkodra municipal office registering other refugees from Decan, his
Kosovo hometown. ``We can't leave here. There is no security in
Kosovo.''
	   Or anywhere else, it seems.
	   Albania offers little stability, coming off rioting last week
that threatened to topple the government in a harshly poor country
unable to take care of its own people. In the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, meanwhile, 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian,
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is cracking down
violently on separatists.
	   International agencies, including several U.N. programs, are
scrambling to provide emergency relief such as food, medicine and
bedding. Several warehouses storing relief supplies were looted
last week of goods worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
	   Maki Shinohara, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
spokesperson in Geneva, said various U.N. agencies working in the
region have asked for a total of dlrs 54 million to cover costs
from June 1 to the end of the year.
	   Some refugees want to get away to Italy and then perhaps
Germany, to try to scrape by there. Others insist they'll return to
Kosovo, either if Western powers drive off the Serbs or if they get
some form of security against future Serb attacks.
	   ``Ideally, we hope the situation inside Kosovo will stabilize so
people can go back home,'' Shinohara said.
	   That's the dream of Gashi, 53, whose clear, high-pitched voice
never wavered in telling his tale. It began Sept. 8, when Serb
forces drove him from his home in Peje.
	   ``It was the worst feeling when we left our villages and went up
the mountain and turned to see them burning. I cried,'' he recalled
recently.
	   Serb roadblocks forced him and others from surrounding villages
to head to Montenegro, where 40,000 Kosovo refugees already have
fled. They spent two days there until Montenegro special police
ordered them out, accentuating the directive with arbitrary
beatings, according to several young men listening as Gashi spoke.
	   Montenegro and Serbia are the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   Buses drove Gashi and other refugees to the Albanian border at
Vermosh. Pooling some money, they hired a truck to drive 40 of them
south to Shkodra, where some had relatives and others could catch
boats to Italy.
	   It was cold and raining on a dark mountain road when six men
with automatic rifles stopped the truck two hours later, Gashi
said.
	   ``They made everyone get off. They put them on the ground. They
looted shoes, all the clothes we had from Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Gashi handed over his 800 German marks (dlrs 470) when the
attackers threatened to rape women if no one gave them money.
	   The ordeal lasted about 30 minutes, and no one resisted or got
hurt. Asked if thought the man who rented the truck set them up,
Gashi replied: ``Absolutely.''
	   Once in Shkodra, the group registered as refugees and ended up
at an abandoned fishery along the Buna river, sleeping 10 or more
to a room on mattresses on the floor. The Islamic Society in
Shkodra provided bread and blankets _ most Kosovars are Muslim _
and Xhevet Votaksi, the fishery's owner, also bought food and is
trying to build a kitchen and bathroom.
	   Shinohara of the UNHCR said Albanians have provided
unprecedented help to their ethnic brethren from Kosovo.
	   ``That was really an eye-opener for us,'' she said. ``It still
puts a lot of strain on the local population.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges' 120 mph (190
kph) winds knocked out power and forced residents into shelters in
the densely populated Dominican Republic Tuesday after devastating
Puerto Rico and leaving at least 10 dead in the Caribbean.
	   Georges' powerful thunderstorms left Puerto Rico, an island of 4
million people, completely without electricity and 80 percent of
its people without water. Most highways were impassable, the
government said.
	   It spawned tornadoes, flooded hotels and exploded shop and car
windows as it slowly ripped through Puerto Rico. The storm turned
trees into missiles, flipped small airplanes, whisked away
satellite dishes and forced tens of thousands into shelters.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' a somber Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts.
	   With winds and rains dying slowly, workers cleared debris from
the runways at San Juan's international airport so emergency aid
could be flown in. American Airlines, the island's leading air link
to the U.S. mainland, said it would resume flights at 9 a.m. (1300
GMT) Wednesday.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-struck eastern Puerto Rican resort of Fajardo, where dozens of
homes lost roofs.
	   ``I don't know where we are going to stay,'' said Andrea Garcia,
33, surveying a mango tree that fell into her tiny wooden San Juan
home.
	   With island residents facing the sobering task of recovery
today, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release
of U.S. recovery aid.
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges headed Tuesday for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where
many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   By 11 a.m. EDT, Georges' winds had risen from 120 mph (190 kph).
The storm was centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers)
east-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
	   The storm snapped palm trees in Santo Domingo, forced residents
into shelters and darkened the city.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of central Cuba and the
central Bahamas. Concern was growing even in Florida, where workers
put shutters over the windows at Key West City Hall.
	   Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   The storm killed two people and injured several others in
Antigua, Prime Minister Lester Bird said. Three deaths were
reported in St. Kitts, where 70 percent of homes were damaged, as
were the hospital, airport and police station. A curfew was in
effect there to prevent looting, said government spokesman Erasmus
Williams.

Riot police disperse protesting teachers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Riot police, some on horseback, fired tear
gas Tuesday to disperse thousands of teachers who staged a protest
march headed toward President Frederick Chiluba's official
residence.
	   There were no reports of casualties or arrests.
	   Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe said the teachers ignored
police orders to disperse because they had no permit to hold the
demonstration in the capital of this southern African nation.
	   Scuffles broke out and it took riot police about an hour to
break up the crowd well before it reached Chiluba's State House in
suburban northern Lusaka, Chimfwembe said.
	   Teachers' leaders told reporters they sought Chiluba's
intervention over low pay and delayed salaries _ they said some
teachers received no pay for up to six months. They were also
protesting poor working conditions and poor teachers' accommodation
at schools.
	   The teachers said they were ready to stage a nationwide strike
if their grievances were not resolved.
	   The government has said it lacks the money to raise salaries of
teachers and other government employees despite recommendations
from an independent labor commission to hike their salaries by more
than 30 percent.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African forces faced unexpected
resistance from rebellious Lesotho troops Tuesday in fighting that
left at least 10 people dead.
	   At least five South African soldiers died in sometimes fierce
fighting and sniper fire throughout the capital, which was gripped
by anarchy.
	   Another five Lesotho (leh-SOO-too) citizens arrived dead at
Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Maseru, which also treated 54 people
with bullet injuries. It was not known if they were soldiers or
civilians.
	   The troops entered at dawn Tuesday after the government had
asked South Africa, Botswana and other regional countries to send
military help to deal with a growing state of anarchy. The
intervention was the first by South Africa since the end of
apartheid in 1994.
	   As the troops arrived, angry crowds looted stores, stoned cars
and set government buildings and shopping centers afire. Foreign
Minister Tom Thabane said a bazooka attack destroyed his house.
	   Opposition agitators also targeted cars and businesses owned by
South Africans.
	   Officials said the South African force had secured Lesotho
military headquarters, the main air force base, central business
district and neighborhood where most diplomats and Cabinet members
live, but the situation was not completely stable.
	   The action follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging, as well as an army rebellion that
had effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Believing a coup was imminent, Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili called on regional powers to intervene, South African
officials said.
	   ``The purpose of the intervention is to stabilize the situation
for the purpose of achieving a lasting political solution,'' said
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was acting head of
state while President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki were out of the country.
	   Buthelezi stressed the operation came under the aegis of the
Southern African Development Community, a regional group chaired by
South Africa.
	   Two-hundred troops from Botswana had arrived at the
Lesotho-South African border, witnesses said. They were to join 600
South African troops, the military in Pretoria said. Armored
personnel carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units also were
involved.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom slightly smaller than Belgium
with a population of 2 million people, is surrounded by South
African territory and is largely dependent on South Africa for jobs
and income.
	   Twenty armored vehicles equipped with cannons came to reinforce
South Africans at a barracks near the airport where a day-long
firefight raged. But they withdrew amid furious gunfire and
artillery rounds.
	   An Associated Press reporter and photographer, and a BBC
cameraman, remained pinned down at nightfall inside the barracks.
	   Freelance photographer Greg Marinovich, a photographer who won a
Pulitzer prize while working for The Associated Press, was shot in
the leg by a sniper and was evacuated to South Africa. A South
African Broadcasting Corporation cameraman also was injured.
	   The South African troops have been unable to contain looting and
street violence because they were concentrating on securing the
bases, where they were drawing ``a lot of fire,'' said Lt. Col.
Laverne Machine, a South African Air Force spokesman.
	   ``We'd hoped it would be peaceful,'' she said of the
intervention.
	   South African troops met strong resistance in the morning
securing the royal palace. Prime Minister Mosisili charged that
King Letsie III has harbored opposition activists at the palace.
	   The rebels suffered heavy casualties at a fight at Katse Dam,
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of Maseru in the highlands,
Machine said.
	   Flying in on Oryx helicopter troop transports, South African
troops also faced antiaircraft and small-arms fire at the Ratjemose
and Makonyane military bases, Van Zyl said.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho has drawn criticism
from South African opposition parties, churches and civilian
organizations. The apartheid era ruling National Party, now in the
opposition, ``strongly condemned'' the intervention.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   The Congress party won 79 of 80 seats but scored only 61 percent
of the vote.

Relieve our debt, end sanctions, new Nigerian leader urges
</HEADLINE>
international community &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Promising further reforms before he hands power to
a civilian government in May, Nigeria's military ruler on Tuesday
urged the international community to end sanctions and write off
the debts of his troubled West African nation.
	   ``Our country is at the threshold of history,'' said Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has freed political prisoners and set up
an independent commission to oversee democratic elections since
succeeding the late military dictator Sani Abacha in June.
	   ``We are determined to tell the story hereafter of a people
committed to establishing a credible and durable democracy ... a
strong and reliable economy, a country with value for probity and
accountability in public office,'' Abubakar told journalists after
a 45-minute meeting with Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, his
first with a European head of state.
	   Blair pledged Britain's full support for the drive to restore
civilian rule in Nigeria, the prime minister's spokesman said,
adding Blair was very impressed by Abubakar's approach and his
determination.
	   Blair called for closer bilateral relations between the
countries and said he was confident that all the international
sanctions against Nigeria _ including those imposed by the European
Union _ would be lifted soon except for the arms embargo.
	   Abubakar will repeat his message Wednesday to Chief Emeka
Anyaoku, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Britain and its
former colonies, which in 1995 suspended Nigeria over the execution
of nine human rights activitists. Later in the day, he will fly to
New York, where he will meet United Nations officials.
	   Oil-rich Nigeria became a pariah state under Abacha, who died of
a heart attack in June after five years of oppressive rule.
	   In response to repeated human rights violations, the United
States and European Union imposed limited restrictions on trade and
economic aid to Nigeria and curbed air links to Africa's most
populous nation.
	   Abubakar said his government has an ``irrevocable resolve'' to
restore civilian government ``through free and fair elections''
early next year. It is also committed to restore accountability in
the civil service and judiciary, build a strong economy and improve
human rights, he said.
	   He said the awarding of government contracts has been made
``more open and competitive'' and the hunt has begun for public
funds that were ``not properly applied for the purposes for which
they were withdrawn,'' including money stashed abroad.
	   The government is making headway with its plan to revitalize the
economy, including reorganizing the Ministry of Petroleum Resources
and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, and the appointment
of an independent commission to monitor the petroleum sector.
	   A privatization program ``by which 40 percent of our major
public enterprises will be sold off will soon begin,'' Abubakar
said. State refineries and the national power and
telecommunications companies ``have already been listed for
divestment.''
	   ``In the light of these efforts, we urge our creditors to ...
grant us debt relief,'' he said.
	   And he urged an end to trade and diplomatic sanctions, saying
``events unfolding at home do not warrant'' them.
	   Asked what guarantees he can give that he will deliver civilian
rule, Abubakar pointed out that ``I have not committed a coup.
Destiny brought me here.''
	   ``I believe our actions so far will convince the doubting
Thomases that we are serious.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ CIA representatives met Palestinian security
officials Tuesday in an effort to get Yasser Arafat's Authority to
spell out steps it will take to combat terrorism, a Palestinian
official said.
	   Israel has said any agreement for the next withdrawal of its
forces from West Bank territory is contingent on the Palestinians
laying out a detailed security plan.
	   But the Palestinians have conditions of their own, said Amin al
Hindi, chief of Palestinian intelligence. The Palestinians want the
United States, which is mediating between the sides, to make
similar demands of the Israelis.
	   ``The Americans told us they understood our insistence on
reciprocity,'' Hindi said. He added that Palestinian security
branches were interested in cooperation with Israeli counterparts.
	   Hindi and Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian Preventive
Security in Gaza, were taking part in the meeting with CIA
officials in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Fallen star of Russian politics has new job, no salary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ How the mighty have fallen.
	   Boris Nemtsov, until recently a deputy prime minister and
potential presidential candidate, was given a new job Tuesday:
deputy chairman (without pay) of the Local Self-Government Council.
	   The appointment was announced by President Boris Yeltsin's
office, which added that Yeltsin himself would be chairman of the
council.
	   Nemtsov's duties will involve working with mayors of Russian
cities and towns to help them resolve economic problems, Interfax
reported.
	   Nemtsov was a dynamic young governor in the Nizhny Novgorod
region when he was tapped by Yeltsin to join the federal Cabinet as
a deputy prime minister. At one point last year, he was considered
the rising star of Russian politics and was featured prominently in
every list of future presidential candidates.
	   His power only seemed to increase this year when his longtime
protege, Sergei Kiriyenko, became prime minister. But both men lost
their jobs when Yeltsin fired the government last month, and the
new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has made it clear that
Nemtsov has no place in his cabinet.

Netanyahu heads to New York for meeting with Albright, possible
</HEADLINE>
summit
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was headed
for New York Tuesday where he plans to personally bring up Israel's
position in the stalled Mideast peace process at the United Nations
and in meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide David Bar-Illan said that a summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in New York was a possibility that
would signal significant progress after 18 months of stalemate in
negotiations.
	   Both Netanyahu and Arafat _ who is scheduled to arrive in New
York Saturday _ will be attending the annual opening session of the
United Nations General Assembly.
	   The sides have been haggling over an agreement to move Israeli
troops out of 13 percent of West Bank territory. Israel has said
the Palestinians must spell out a detailed plan to combat terror
before it will withdraw its forces.
	   The Palestinians, who accepted an American initiative aimed at
getting the withdrawal off the ground, blame Israel for failing to
carry out the long overdue troop redeployment it committed to in
January 1997.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu would ``talk about the peace process
and the need for the Palestinians to live up to commitments,''
during his address to the General Assembly.
	   It was not clear whether Netanyahu would address Palestinian
desires for statehood, which his government opposes. Arafat has
said he would declare Palestinian independence in May of 1999 in
the absence of a peace deal with Israel.
	   Netanyahu departs Israel at 10:30pm (20:30gmt) and will meet
with Albright Wednesday in New York to discuss the withdrawal plan
``and perhaps to arrange a summit with Arafat,'' Bar-Illan told The
Associated Press. Albright was scheduled to meet separately with
Arafat as well.
	   The United States has been mediating between the sides in an
effort to end the impasse, but with little success.
	   In recent days, Arafat has expressed his willingness to meet
with Netanyahu if a peace deal is imminent.
	   ``We hope there will be enough movement to make a summit
productive, no one wants a summit that will be disappointing,''
Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu will be in New York until Sunday and then returns to
Israel to meet with his Cabinet before the Jewish holy day of Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement, next Tuesday.

French members of Festina team to miss world championship

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French members of the Festina cycling team will
miss October's world championships, after the French Cycling
Federation (FFC) said Monday it had decided to adjourn disciplinary
action against them.
	   Daniel Baal, the FFC president of the French Cycling Federation,
announced the decision at a press conference Monday. ``They cannot
be selected for the world championships,'' in Holland, he said.
	   Baal said a judicial ruling to not allow the FFC to use the
verbal dispositions of the Festina team members accused of
drug-taking during the recent Tour de France had prompted them to
adjourn proceedings.
	   ``Given the conditions, the FFC believes that its disciplinary
powers have been paralyzed,'' Baal said. ``So we are adjourning the
proceedings.''
	   The Festina members affected are Laurent Brochard, Pascal Herve,
Christophe Moreau, Didier Rous and Richard Virenque.
	   Festina was expelled from the Tour de France after admitting to
using the banned doping substance EPO. Six other teams then
withdrew in protest of police handling of an ensuing investigation
into allegations of widespread drug-taking.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the race, and the pack
was reduced to fewer than 100 riders from the original 189.

Taliban urge UN to condemn rocket attacks on Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In a letter to the United Nations,
Afghanistan's Taliban religious army urged the global body to
condemn devastating rocket assaults on the Afghan capital this week
that killed scores of people.
	   Broadcast Tuesday on the Taliban-run radio Shariat, the letter
attacked the anti-Taliban alliance for carrying out the worst
rocket attack on Kabul in nearly two years.
	   According to the letter written by the ministry of foreign
affairs, more than 100 people were killed in the attacks on Sunday
and Monday. Another 200 people were injured, the letter said.
	   ``The rocket attacks which were launched from north of Kabul
from (Ahmed Shah) Massood areas caused the deaths of more than 100
people . . . including children, women and men,'' the letter said.
``Where is the United nations and Human Rights organizations and
why are they not expressing their condemnation?''
	   The Taliban has been critical of the U.N.'s accusations that
Taliban troops massacred Shiite Muslims last month when it overran
the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan.
	   During the takeover eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalists were killed by Taliban troops causing tensions in the
region to soar.
	   Since then the Iranian military has been put on alert and more
than 200,000 soldiers have been deployed on Iran's border with
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban say it has sent as many as 10,000 fresh troops to
the area.
	   The standoff between Iran and the Taliban army has generated
fears of an all out war.
	   While both Iran and the Taliban army say they want to avert a
confrontation, neither side has been willing to compromise.
	   Iran's leadership has demanded an apology for the death of its
diplomats and is demanding the Taliban hand over their killers.
	   Taliban leaders have refused to apologize and say they will
arrest and try the culprits under the Taliban's tough brand of
Islamic law.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan and its
opponents, which largely comprise the country's minorities
including Shiite Muslims, who adhere to the same sect of Islam as
most Iranians.

Germany joins aid airlift to southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A German military plane flew four tons of
relief aid to a famine-stricken province in southern Sudan on
Tuesday, the German Embassy said here.
	   The German plane flew as part of a United Nations operation to
supply food to Bahr el-Ghazal province, where it has been estimated
that some 700,000 people are facing famine.
	   A German diplomat said the embassy hoped to have a second plane,
now under repair, taking part in the operation within two days.
	   Germany has provided the planes for two months and plans to
operate four flights a day to southern Sudan. The Sudanese
government approved the mission on condition the planes fly under
the U.N. flag.
	   The plane flew from Khartoum to Wau, the capital of Bahr
el-Ghazal.
	   In July, the government and rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army agreed to a three-month cease fire to permit the
delivery of aid to the more than 2 million people threatened by
famine in the south.
	   The rebels, who draw their support from the Christian and
animist southerners, have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy
from the Muslim and Arab north. An estimated 1.5 million people
have died in the fighting and accompanying famines.

Premier celebrates two years in office with preelection speech

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis on Tuesday
celebrated his two years in office with a preelection speech.
	   Aimed at bolstering his governing socialist party's chances in
local government elections on October 11, Simitis spoke before tens
of thousands of supporters at an open air rally in central Athens.
	   His speech came on the second anniversary of a snap election he
called on Sept. 22, 1996, a few months after the death of the
charismatic Andreas Papandreou, founder of the Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, or PASOK, and premier for 13 of the past 17
years.
	   ``In 1996, PASOK asked for the popular mandate based on a
program that had as its cornerstone the full entry of our country
in European Monetary Union,'' Simitis said. ``In 2000, Greece will
achieve this goal.''
	   Simitis has made entry into the Euro zone his government's top
priority and his government has met most of the economic
requirements needed to achieve the goal.
	   But there are fears that his harsh austerity policies may have
eroded support for his party on the eve of elections for the
country's local governors and mayors.
	   ``The goal of EMU is a vital, economic, social and national
goal. We will not retreat,'' Simitis said.
	   Expounding on what the European political left has named the
``third road'' to socialism, Simitis slammed detractors who have
called on his fiscally conservative government to ``allow the
markets to decide.''
	   ``We tell our citizens the exact opposite. We say, let the
societies decide on what life they want and let the markets serve
the societies.''

Minister: Russia will not deviate from path of reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia's new foreign minister pledged
Tuesday that his economically battered country will not deviate
from the path of reforms _ and will score new democratic gains.
	   Russia remains committed to settling international problems by
political negotiations rather than military force and ``to building
a democratic multipolar world,'' Igor Ivanov told the General
Assembly.
	   In his first speech on the international stage since his
appointment less than two weeks ago, Ivanov sought to reassure the
global community that Russia's foreign policy will continue to be
as ``consistent and constructive'' as it was before the recent
political upheaval.
	   Russia's economic crisis, which started last month and has seen
the value of the ruble plummet, led to a government shakeup which
put Ivanov's predecessor, Yevgeny Primakov, into the prime
minister's job.
	   ``Russia will not deviate from the path of reforms and will do
its best to pass with dignity this highly critical test so as not
to preserve the accumulated democratic gains but also to score new
ones,'' Ivanov said.
	   Ivanov did not discuss specific measures to reactivate Russia's
moribund economy but told delegates that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, the new government, and ``the leading political forces are
making vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial
situation.''
	   He made clear that Russia remains opposed to any international
military action that isn't sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council.
Some Western nations have said that council authorization isn't
necessary to authorize military action in Yugoslavia's restive
Kosovo province.
	   Ivanov warned that the use of force in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority is fighting for independence from Serbia, ``might
lead to a big war with unpredictable consequences for the Balkan
region and Europe at large.''
	   Britain and France are currently drafting a U.N. Security
Council resolution authorizing the use of force in Kosovo, but
Ivanov said ``it is our firm belief that a political solution is
the only possible way of settling the problem.''
	   On Iraq, he called for ``concerted action by the world
community'' to get Baghdad to agree to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors. He added that the Security Council must answer
whether Iraq still poses a threat to international security.
	   In the Middle East, he called for collective political efforts
to give a ``second breath'' to the peace process, reiterating
Russia's support for an independent Palestinian state and a
resumption of Israeli talks with Syria and Lebanon.

400 soldiers to leave Northern Ireland as Adams, Trimble meet again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Changes throughout, UPDATES with Trimble-Adams meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two units of British troops
were ordered withdrawn from Northern Ireland Tuesday as the two
politicians central to making the peace agreement work struggled
behind the scenes to overcome key differences.
	   The approximately 400 members of the Highlanders and Royal
Artillery regiments will be flown back to Britain soon, announced
Ronnie Flanagan, police commander for the British-ruled province.
	   The redeployment _ the second withdrawal of soldiers since
April's compromise accord on how Protestants and Catholics should
govern Northern Ireland together _ will reduce troop levels here to
about 16,000. Flanagan said he and army commanders also were
considering closing some of their many fortified barracks in
response to the Irish Republican Army's July 1997 truce.
	   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party said the British moves were
welcome but overdue.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble met on Tuesday to try to resolve a fundamental
disagreement that is preventing the formation of a new multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland.
	   Trimble, chief representative of the province's British
Protestant majority, insists that Protestant politicians will veto
any role for Sinn Fein in the administration if the IRA doesn't
start disarming first.
	   Trimble had long refused to talk directly with Adams, a reputed
former IRA commander, in protest at the IRA's determination to
retain its secret stores of weaponry. Their first face-to-face
meetings two weeks ago received major attention as landmark events
in the peace process.
	   Neither politician advertised Tuesday's meeting in advance, nor
would either discuss in detail whether they had achieved any
progress.
	   April's agreement _ among eight parties and the British and
Irish governments _ specified that the IRA and Northern Ireland's
major pro-British paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, should disarm under
international supervision by mid-2000.
	   But the agreement didn't bluntly link IRA disarmament to Sinn
Fein's eligibility to hold seats in the new administration, which
Trimble has already been elected to lead.
	   The full administration, to be called the Executive, will be
drawn from a 108-seat legislative Assembly elected in June. The
Ulster Unionists are the largest party, with 28 seats, while Sinn
Fein holds 18.
	   Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, said IRA
disarmament was essential to build confidence among Protestants _
but she took Sinn Fein's side in the argument over forming the
administration.
	   Disarmament ``is not a precondition to progress being made on
any other dimension'' of the agreement, Mowlam told a joint
conference of British and Irish lawmakers in York, northeast
England.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

	   MASERU, Lesotho - In their first military operation since
apartheid's end, South African forces on Tuesday faced unexpected
resistance from rebellious Lesotho troops threatening to topple the
beleaguered government of this mountain nation.
	   At least 10 South African soldiers died in a fire fight outside
Makoanyne barracks just northeast of the city, a senior South
African officer told The Associated Press.
	   Military officials in Pretoria reported that five soldiers were
killed in sometimes fierce fighting and sniper fire throughout the
capital, which was gripped by anarchy. Five Lesotho citizens were
also reported killed.
	   It was not immediately clear whether some of those casualties
occurred at the barracks.
	   The senior officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
force lacked enough troops and proper equipment to handle the stiff
resistance.
	   ``We didn't expect them to be so hostile,'' the officer said, as
artillery rounds lit up the night sky.
	   The five Lesotho (leh-SOO-too) citizens arrived dead at Queen
Elizabeth Hospital in Maseru, which also treated 54 people with
bullet injuries. It was not known if they were soldiers or
civilians.

	   The troops entered at dawn Tuesday after the government had
asked South Africa, Botswana and other regional countries to send
military help to deal with a growing state of anarchy.
	   During the intervention, angry crowds looted stores, stoned cars
and set government buildings and shopping centers afire. Foreign
Minister Tom Thabane said a bazooka attack destroyed his house.
	   Opposition agitators also targeted cars and businesses owned by
South Africans.
	   South Africa said a number of key sites are secured, but the
situation was not completely stable.
	   The troops in the reconstituted South African army had never
been in this kind of combat before, said Maj. Ben van Zyl, with the
operational command.
	   The action follows weeks of opposition party demonstrations over
allegations of election-rigging, as well as an army rebellion that
had effectively paralyzed the government.
	   Believing a coup was imminent, Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili called on regional powers to intervene, South African
officials said.
	   ``The purpose of the intervention is to stabilize the situation
for the purpose of achieving a lasting political solution,'' said
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was acting head of
state while President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki were out of the country.
	   Buthelezi stressed the operation came under the aegis of the
Southern African Development Community, a regional group chaired by
South Africa.
	   Two-hundred troops from Botswana had arrived at the
Lesotho-South African border, witnesses said. They were to join 600
South African troops, the military in Pretoria said. Armored
personnel carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units also were
involved.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom slightly smaller than Maryland
with a population of 2 million people, is surrounded by South
African territory and is largely dependent on South Africa for jobs
and income.
	   Twenty armored vehicles equipped with cannons came to reinforce
South Africans at a barracks near the airport where a day-long
firefight raged. But they withdrew amid furious gunfire and
artillery rounds.
	   An Associated Press reporter and photographer, and a BBC
cameraman, remained pinned down at nightfall inside the barracks.
	   Freelance Greg Marinovich, a Pulitzer prize-winning photographer
for The Associated Press, was shot in the leg by a sniper and was
evacuated to South Africa. A South African Broadcasting Corporation
cameraman also was injured.
	   Officials said the South African force had secured Lesotho
military headquarters, the main air force base, central business
district and neighborhood where most diplomats and Cabinet members
live.
	   But they were unable to contain looting and street violence
because they were concentrating on securing the bases, where they
were drawing ``a lot of fire,'' said Lt. Col. Laverne Machine, a
South African Air Force spokesman.
	   ``We'd hoped it would be peaceful,'' she said of the
intervention.
	   South African troops met strong resistance in the morning
securing the royal palace. Prime Minister Mosisili charged that
King Letsie III has harbored opposition activists at the palace.
	   The rebels suffered heavy casualties at a fight at Katse Dam,
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of Maseru in the highlands,
Machine said.
	   Flying in on Oryx helicopter troop transports, South African
troops also faced antiaircraft and small-arms fire at the Ratjemose
and Makonyane military bases, Van Zyl said.
	   American citizens were told to stay indoors and South African
embassy employees were evacuated. Hundreds of foreigners were
fleeing to South Africa, but some were refused admission because
they lacked South African visas.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho has drawn criticism
from South African opposition parties, churches and civilian
organizations.
	   Under apartheid, the nation's rulers sent troops across its
borders to countries that included Angola and Namibia to take part
in wars and to pursue government opponents, particularly in Lesotho
and Botswana.
	   The apartheid era ruling National Party, now in the opposition,
``strongly condemned'' the intervention.
	   The mobilization caps weeks of unrest by opposition
demonstrators who claim May elections swept by the Lesotho Congress
Party were rigged.
	   The Congress party won 79 of 80 seats but scored only 61 percent
of the vote.
	   The intervention follows fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks.

Serbs launch blistering attack as world leaders debate action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European Union naming Kosovo envoy
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Shrugging off international blame
for the Kosovo bloodshed, Yugoslav and Serb forces backed by
blistering artillery strikes on Tuesday launched an offensive on
the last remaining stronghold of secessionist rebels.
	   By late Tuesday, the Serb-Yugoslav forces had seized at least
four guerrilla-held villages and killed many rebels, said the Serb
Media Center, which releases official information. Several hundred
more guerrillas withdrew deeper into Drenica.
	   Ethnic Albanian residents from at least 12 additional villages
were forced to flee into nearby forests, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which represents the ethnic Albanian viewpoint.
	   At least 10,000 to 15,000 civilians are believed trapped in the
region. As of a few days ago, many were hiding in hills and forests
of central Drenica, fearing a Serb offensive.
	   Amid the intense fighting, the United Nations pondered ways to
end the killing and avert the threat of mass deaths from cold and
starvation this winter of thousands of unsheltered refugees.
	   At the U.N. General Assembly, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel condemned the use of force by both sides but said most to
blame was Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He must realize that the international community will react
with military force if necessary,'' Kinkel said, alluding to the
threat of NATO involvement.
	   The issue of a NATO role in ending the Kosovo fighting has for
months been unresolved, with some European nations insisting it can
come only if approved by the U.N. Security Council. That has been
unlikely, considering strong opposition by Russia, an ally of
Serbia, and China, which fears precedents of outside involvement in
its dispute in Tibet.
	   But Kinkel on Tuesday said he now expects Russia to support a
Security Council resolution seen by Western powers as a
``springboard'' to a resolution sanctioning the use of force.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed''
Kinkel said, calling the change ``a big step forward.''
	   The European Union increased its involvement in trying to
mediate the conflict, naming Wolfgang Petrisch, Austria's
ambassador to Yugoslavia, the EU envoy to Kosovo.

Fallen star of Russian politics has new job, no salary

remarks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ How the mighty have fallen.
	   Boris Nemtsov, until recently a deputy prime minister and
potential presidential candidate, was given a new job Tuesday:
deputy chairman (without pay) of the Local Self-Government Council.
	   The appointment was announced by President Boris Yeltsin's
office, which added that Yeltsin himself would be chairman of the
council.
	   Nemtsov's duties will involve working with mayors of Russian
cities and towns to help them resolve economic problems, Interfax
reported.
	   ITAR-Tass quoted Nemtsov as saying that he doesn't want to be a
clerk and ``wants to speak and act as I think best without taking
into account the corporate interests of officials.''
	   He said he wanted to help local authorities tackle unemployment,
improve their tax policy, lure investment and better manage their
budgets.
	   Nemtsov was a dynamic young governor in the Nizhny Novgorod
region when he was tapped by Yeltsin to join the federal Cabinet as
a deputy prime minister. At one point last year, he was considered
the rising star of Russian politics and was featured prominently in
every list of future presidential candidates.
	   His power only seemed to increase this year when his longtime
protege, Sergei Kiriyenko, became prime minister. But both men lost
their jobs when Yeltsin fired the government last month, and the
new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has made it clear that
Nemtsov has no place in his cabinet.

German state governor appeals ruling he can be called Stasi

informer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Brandenburg state Governor Manfred
Stolpe has appealed a high court ruling that allows him to be
called an informer for former East German secret police, his
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Eberhard Thomas confirmed an early release of a report
to appear in Wednesday's Berliner Morgenpost daily, that Stolpe had
filed the appeal with the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, saying
the high court ruling in June violated his personal honor.
	   The popular Stolpe, a member of the leftist Social Democrats,
has never denied that, as a top Lutheran Church advisor in the
former East Germany, he often communicated the Ministry for State
Security, or Stasi, but denies collaborating with them.
	   But, citing freedom of expression rights, the federal high court
in Karlsruhe ruled in June that a politician from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats could call Stolpe a Stasi
informer even though it was not proven.
	   The Constitutional Court must now decide on whether Stolpe's
appeal is covered by Article 2 of the basic law as claimed by the
governor, the Berliner Morgenpost said.

Khatami says Iran will remain cautious about resuming ties with US
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Presenting an image of his country not
seen in the United States in nearly two decades, President Mohammad
Khatami called for U.S. investments in Iran Tuesday and downplayed
the risk of war with neighboring Afghanistan.
	   In a meeting with U.S. news organizations, Khatami said he had
sensed a more positive U.S. tone toward his country, but that was
not enough to establish formal ties.
	   ``Just as we sense a change in tone, we also see the allocation
of funds in the U.S. Congress to hurt Iran,'' said Khatami,
referring to a dlrs 20 million allocation by Congress for covert
operations in Iran.
	   Dressed in the flowing robes and turban of a senior Shiite
cleric, Khatami said that U.S. sanctions that ban investments in
Iran were hurting U.S. companies more than Iran. ``This is a big
world and problems can be solved without the need of the United
States,'' Khatami said.
	   Khatami repeatedly expressed his ``respect for the great
American people.''
	   Khatami, who addressed the United Nations General Assembly
Monday, has adopted a markedly different tone from other Iranian
leaders. The last Iranian president to speak at the General
Assembly was Ali Khamenei, who in his 1986 speech called the United
States ``The Great Satan.''
	   Khatami, asked whether Tehran would lift its death sentence on
author Salman Rushdie, said his government had already pledged not
to enforce the decree.
	   ``Iran has officially declared that in action it has no decision
on this matter,'' Khatami said.
	   In 1989 the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini accused Rushdie of
blasphemy against Islam in his book, ``The Satanic Verses.'' He
issued an Islamic ruling calling for Rushdie's death.
	   In recent years Iranian officials have said that they cannot
lift the execution order, but have pledged not to actively seek
Rushdie's death.
	   Asked about his country's military stand-off with the Taliban
militia that controls nearly all of Afghanistan, Khatami said
Tehran was trying its best avoid a war. Iran has massed 200,000
troops on its border with Afghanistan after Taliban troops killed
nine Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist.
	   The Iranians have been encouraged by a new U.N. initiative,
adopted in a meeting Monday among the United States, Russia, China
and five of Afghanistan's neighbors, to bring peace to Afghanistan
and reduce tensions with Iran.
	   Khatami said that Islam was not compatible with terrorism, and
that being at war with the West was not part of the faith. ``The
Islam that I know says learn from others,'' said Khatami.
	   But he emphasized that Iran differentiated between terrorism and
support for Lebanese and Palestinian groups fighting Israeli
occupation.
	   ``The United States calls terrorism any sympathy with people
whose rights have been trampled and whose lands and homes have been
occupied,'' said Khatami.
	   ``The United States must give up its unilateral support for
Israel and try to protect the rights of Palestinians -- Muslims and
Christians alike,'' said Khatami.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Tuesday hours after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a tank accident, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   Four Israeli jets fired nine missiles at guerrilla infiltration
trails and hideouts near Litani River, some 25 kilometers (16
miles) southeast of the southern port of Tyre, officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6 p.m. (15:00
GMT) air raid, which occurred about four kilometers (2.5 miles)
from a hill where an Israeli tank overturned at dawn Tuesday,
killing two Israeli soldiers and injuring three others.
	   The tank rolled over near the village of Kantara in the eastern
sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, said the
Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement said the tank ``fell
into the Litani river.''
	   After the casualties had been evacuated, ``the vehicle was
destroyed by Israeli helicopters,'' the statement said.
	   An army spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports of an
Israeli jet raid.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its
guerrillas had detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry
unit was passing in the area, causing ``definite casualties.''
	   Lebanese security officials could not confirm the Hezbollah
statement, but they said that Israeli helicopters had strafed
mountains in southeast Lebanon believed to be used by the
guerrillas.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen
from the enclave Israel set up in 1985 as a buffer zone to protect
its northern towns from guerrilla attack.

Four U.N. observers attacked in breakaway Georgian region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with second shooting apparently aimed at
Georgian presidential aide. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on a bus of 10 United
Nations workers in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, wounding
four, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday, a car carrying a Georgian presidential aide came
under fire in Abkhazia, wounding three other people in the car.
	   The U.N. military observers were attacked Monday night in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Four of the workers _ two from Bangladesh, one Nigerian, and one
Abkhazian _ were wounded in the attack, ITAR-Tass said, citing the
leader of the U.N. mission, Rasheed Al-Haroun.
	   Three of the workers were taken to Turkey for medical treatment,
though the report did not identify them.
	   Earlier, Astamur Taniya, press secretary to Abkhazian leader
Vladislav Ardzinba, had said that only one of the military
observers had been wounded.
	   In the second shooting, ITAR-Tass said, unknown gunmen opened
fire on a car carrying Iveri Chelidze, a commissioner under
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze. Although he was apparently
unharmed, three other passengers were wounded, including a
correspondent for Georgian television.
	   The shooting took place near the Gvanda settlement in Abkhazia,
the only place in Abkhazia that remains under the jurisdiction of
Georgian authorities, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Ardzinba called the earlier incident involving the U.N.
observers an attempt to destabilize the region, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia denounced the attack, saying it ``proves a pressing need
for resolute action on the part of the Georgian and Abkhazian
authorities to normalize the situation,'' the Interfax news agency
reported, citing an unidentified source in Russia's Foreign
Ministry.
	   An investigation into the incident is under way, Interfax
reported.
	   The United Nations keeps a group of military observers in
Georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and
separatists in Abkhazia.
	   A U.N. worker from Poland, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, was shot
and killed in July outside her apartment in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
	   Meanwhile, Georgian and Abkhazian leaders began talks Tuesday in
Tbilisi, but expressly avoided political debate. The two sides
discussed restoring the region's railroads and energy system,
including a natural gas pipeline, said Sergei Bagapsh, who led the
Abkhazian delegation.
	   ``A wide range of questions of economic nature has been
discussed,'' Shevardnadze said at a news conference after the
meeting. He added that he was ready to fly to Sukhumi, the
Abkhazian capital, to talk with Ardzinba.
	   ``The time has come for our meeting,'' the Georgian president
said. ``I do not think one should be afraid, for those who are
afraid will never succeed.''
	   Georgia and Abkhazia have been locked in a bitter conflict that
began soon after Georgia became an independent state in the wake of
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 war,
driving out Georgian soldiers and ethnic Georgians. Violence has
broken out periodically since then despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the region.

from looted shops was being swept away and platoons of soldiers
were returning to their barracks. Monrovia, often the frontline in
Liberia's seven-year civil war, has done plenty of such clean-ups _
It knows the drill.
	   Beneath the seeming normalcy, though, some people have a lurking
fear war may again be coming.
	   ``We're praying to God because we don't know what will happen
next,'' said Leon Kweru, standing beside an abandoned building,
just across the street from the embattled U.S. Embassy. ``I'm
really afraid.''
	   Indeed, the flashpoint for a new conflict could be the embassy,
where President Charles Taylor's chief rival, former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson, is holed up to escape arrest on charges of
treason.
	   Taylor promises the embassy won't come under attack, but a
battle raged near its gate just days earlier when Johnson came here
on Saturday to seek refuge. In addition, a demonstration in front
of the embassy is planned for Wednesday to demand Johnson be handed
over, further raising the tension.
	   At the U.S. State Department in Washington, an official said
diplomats were trying to negotiate a solution to the standoff.
	   ``We have received assurances that (the Liberian authorities)
will honor the inviolability of the embassy compound,'' a U.S.
official in Washington said on condition of anonymity.
	   In reality, the chance of another all-out war in Liberia doesn't
appear very great. Still, events of this past weekend make it
obvious that Monrovia may have to endure more battles before there
is true peace.
	   The power balance in Liberia has shifted enormously since its
civil war in 1996. These days Taylor _ who as a warlord fought for
supremacy among rivals _ controls the country's military, its
police, its economy. Johnson, by comparison is but a poor wannabe.
	   Johnson may have occasionally tooled around town in his
sparkling armor-plated Jeep, but he lived in a squalid, three-floor
apartment building crammed with his family and supporters.
	   Few believe he has the money or weapons to wage a war at this
point.
	   ``I don't hope that war will break out again,'' said Gen.
Timothy Shelpidi, the commander of the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force that helped with elections last year and still
works to keep the peace here. ``However, we are always on the
alert.''
	   On Friday night, hundreds of government soldiers advanced
through Johnson's neighborhood, apparently coming to arrest him. A
fierce battle erupted, and bullets, rockets and mortars jolted
parts of Monrovia for two days. At least 47 people were killed.
	   Saturday morning, when Johnson turned up at the U.S. Embassy,
diplomats _ who had no wish to harbor Johnson _ tried to get him
safely away.
	   But Liberian commandos attached to the country's secret police
force opened fire on Johnson and his followers _ at least three of
whom were killed, two more injured. Two Americans were also shot.
	   Fearing another attack, the embassy is prepared for the worst:
staff has been reduced, extra servicemen have been helicoptered in
and most diplomats don't move without a flak jacket and helmet.
American troops in combat gear patrol the grounds.
	   It is unclear what will happen to Johnson, though U.S. officials
have said he will not be handed over the Liberians.
	   Still, it's one more volatile element in a city with more
volatility than it wants.
	   Liberia is, in many ways, a confusing country. It's perhaps the
most easy-going country in Africa, a place where strangers are
warmly welcomed with a friendly ``May I know you?'' It's a country
founded by freed American slaves that often has the feel of the
rural American south.
	   But it's also a country capable of horrendous violence. More
than 150,000 people were killed during a brutal civil war; half the
country's population became refugees.
	   Johnson, for his part, claims that ethnic persecution is at the
base of Liberia's problems. He says that Taylor and his allies are
hunting down members of his Krahn tribe.
	   ``Why does he want to kill all of us,'' Johnson demanded in a
brief interview at the embassy.
	   It's a charge Taylor vehemently denies, and there are, in fact,
a number of Krahns with high positions in his government.
	   Still, Taylor as president has harassed opponents and cracked
down on the media.
	   ``He has to learn to get along better,'' said a Monrovia
resident who would only identify himself as Robert, ``or we won't
have more peace.''

Australia urges ratification of nuclear and other weapons treaties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The world must make sure that recent
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan are only ``temporary
deviations'' from the accepted norms against nuclear
non-proliferation, Australia's U.N. ambassador said Tuesday.
	   Worldwide condemnation of the tests _ and Brazil's recent
ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty _ are
evidence that the international community wants to rid the world of
weapons of mass destruction, Penny Wensley told heads of state
gathered at the General Assembly's 53rd annual debate.
	   ``The new ratifications which the CTBT attracted following the
South Asian nuclear tests were eloquent testimony to the confidence
of the international community in and its commitment to the
no-testing norm,'' she said.
	   India set off underground tests in May and Pakistan followed
suit soon after, raising fears about a nuclear arms race in South
Asia. The tests resulted in economic sanctions being imposed
against both countries.
	   ``In the face of these setbacks, it is vitally important to stay
the course and to ensure that such events amount to no more than
temporary deviations from the near universally accepted norm
against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,'' she
said.
	   Australia has long supported universal adherence to weapons
treaties, signing all 13 multilateral arms control and disarmament
treaties and ratifying but one, she said. Ratification of that one
_ the recent treaty banning anti-personnel land mines is in
progress, she said.

Separatist group threatens new attacks on French island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court freeing jailed editor of separarist
publication &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTIA, Corsica (AP) _ A clandestine nationalist group that
claimed responsibility for assassinating the top French official on
Corsica is threatening new attacks, after the government launched a
new crackdown.
	   The group, which did not identify itself, said it was ``more
determined than ever'' to stage new attacks on the French
Mediterranean island, plagued by a 23-year-old campaign of bombings
and other strikes on government sites.
	   The statement, released Monday night to the news media, called
for a ``patriotic resurgence against the state of colonial law to
build a sovereign, free and democratic Corsica.''
	   The group did not identify itself, but it included in the
message the serial number of a policeman's Beretta firearm that
Corsican militants seized when they raided a police station last
year.
	   It was the same group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 9
assassination of Prefect Claude Erignac, a symbolic attack on the
centralized French government since the office is named by the
president.
	   The killing triggered a government probe on the island, released
this month, which found a ``pre-mafia-like'' system of corruption
driven in part by militant intimidation.
	   ``The state has only been able to react with smokescreens,'' the
group said, noting changes in functionaries on the island and
``massive searches of Corsican patriots and their families.''
	   The crackdown was a ``constant and pathological reaffirmation of
`republican order' by a reinforced military occupation,'' the group
said.
	   At the same time, the group took credit for getting the
government to expose the corruption.
	   ``Today, as predicted, the masks have fallen,'' it said. ``The
corruption of the political class has burs out into broad daylight.
... Without our action, Corsica would not be starting its recovery
and renewal.''
	   Also Thursday, a Paris appeals court freed the editor of a
weekly Corsican separatist publication called ``U Rimbobu,'' that
is under investigation, judicial officials said.
	   Jean-Michel Rossi, a leader of the nationalist group Cuncolta
Naziunalista, had been in prison since October, 1996, on charges of
criminal association with a terrorist organization.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges' 120 mph (190
kph) winds knocked out power Tuesday and forced residents into
shelters in the densely populated Dominican Republic, after plowing
through Puerto Rico and leaving at least 10 dead in the northeast
Caribbean.
	   Georges' powerful thunderstorms Monday left all of Puerto Rico
without electricity and 80 percent of its people without water. The
storm spawned tornadoes as it ripped through the island of 4
million people, turning trees into missiles, flipping small planes,
exploding car windows and forcing tens of thousands into shelters.
	   As the hurricane headed west across the Caribbean, concern was
growing in Florida _ where Georges was expected late Thursday or
early Friday. Workers shuttered the windows at Key West's City
Hall, and officials said they would consider evacuating some
mobile-home parks.
	   Tourists were advised to fly out of the Florida Keys, or to
drive out and avoid congestion later on the Overseas Highway, the
only road linking the 110-mile (180-kilometer) ribbon of islands.
	   David Chorney, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that Georges
would hit Florida.
	   ``It's still about 72 hours out,'' Chorney said. ``It looks like
late Thursday, more like Friday.''
	   In San Juan, the storm blew out windows in hotels and apartments
in the beachfront district and toppled a towering construction
crane into an apartment building. The crane hit one apartment, but
no one was home. Trees were uprooted throughout the city, and
billboards and highway signs were knocked to the ground.
	   With winds and rains dying slowly in Puerto Rico, workers
cleared debris from the runways at San Juan's international airport
so emergency aid could be flow in.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-hit eastern Puerto Rican resort of Fajardo, where dozens of
homes lost roofs. The Conquistador Resort, which overlooks the sea
in Fajardo, sustained extensive damage.
	   Police took to the streets of San Juan in force to find the
hardest-hit areas and deter looting of damaged stores and
businesses.
	   ``I don't know where we are going to stay,'' said Andrea Garcia,
surveying a mango tree that fell onto the dining room table in her
San Juan home.
	   In the north coast town of Arecibo, National Guard troops rushed
to remove residents from alongside the Rio Grande de Arecibo as
mountain runoff overflowed its banks.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal
recovery aid. Scores of federal and Red Cross officials mobilized
to assess damage, expected to soar well into the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges headed Tuesday for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where
many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   By 1800 GMT, Georges' winds had risen to 120 mph (190 kph), and
the storm was just north of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital.
	   The storm snapped palm trees in Santo Domingo, forced residents
into shelters and darkened the city.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.
	   Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   The storm killed two people and injured several others in
Antigua. Three deaths were reported in St. Kitts, where 70 percent
of homes were damaged, as were the hospital, airport and police
station.
	   As it moved westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges
spawned tornadoes in the central town of Barranquitas and the
eastern island of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kph) were
reported in the interior mountains, where damage reports were
sketchy.
	   Georges also caused extensive property damage in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Antigua and other smaller Caribbean islands.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to a third of their
height and destroyed part of the boardwalk.
	   In Antigua, the storm split open government-built homes and
ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and wrapped
them around trees.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers proposal on property disputes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new Greek Cypriot reaction grafs 6-7; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Tuesday proposed setting up a joint commission with Greek Cypriots
to settle property claims by people on both sides of the divided
island.
	   The offer follows a July ruling by the European Court of human
rights ordering Turkey to pay compensation to a Greek Cypriot woman
for depriving her of property in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state. Another 40 similar cases are pending.
	   Fearing a wave of claims, Turkey rejected the court's ruling,
saying it could not legally be held responsible for property in the
Turkish Cypriot state.
	   The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded the northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece. Only Ankara recognizes the
breakaway state.
	   ``The exchange of property is one of the basic points that need
to be settled for a solution to the Cyprus problem,'' Denktash told
reporters after a meeting with Ann Hercus, the new U.N. resident
envoy in Cyprus.
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides rejected the
Denktash proposal, saying that the U.N. Security Council
resolutions on Cyprus call for the return of refugees to their
homes.
	   ``This position was given full legal backing by the decision of
the Human Rights Court of the European Union in the case of Greek
Cypriot Titina Loizidou. Neither the Security Council nor the human
rights court make any reference to an exchange of property as part
of a settlement,'' Stylianides told The Associated Press in a phone
call from New York, where he is attending the U.N. General Assembly
meetings.
	   Greek Cypriots view Denktash's demand for property exchanges and
compensation as a means of consolidating the division of the
island.
	   Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from their
villages in the wake of the invasion. Their place was taken by
40,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south and settlers from the
Turkish mainland who were given Greek Cypriot property.

Nuggets, rebuilding again, name D'Antoni coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON MITCHELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Denver Nuggets, coming off one of the worst
seasons in American National Basketball Association history, hired
Mike D'Antoni as their head coach on Tuesday.
	   D'Antoni, who joined the Nuggets as director of player personnel
last year after coaching in the Italian League for seven seasons,
becomes Denver's seventh coach this decade.
	   He replaces Bill Hanzlik, who was fired after an 11-71 season.
	   D'Antoni, who briefly served as interim general manager last
season, was hired by general manager Dan Issel, who took over the
team in March.
	   ``Mike is a tremendous individual with impressive coaching
acumen,'' Issel said. ``He is an excellent communicator and will be
integral to revitalizing the Nuggets franchise.''
	   Before joining the Nuggets, D'Antoni compiled a 144-68 coaching
record with Benetton and Milan of the Italian League. His teams
made the playoffs each season, and Benetton won the 1997 Italian
League Championship.
	   D'Antoni, 47, also had success as a player, helping Milan to
five league championships, two European Cup titles and two
Intercontinental Cups in 13 seasons. He spent four years in the NBA
and one in the American Basketball Association, a former rival to
the NBA.
	   D'Antoni served as the Nuggets' interim general manager after
Allan Bristow was fired in February. Issel took over the team in
March, and D'Antoni finished the season as an assistant to Hanzlik.
	   As interim general manager, his most notable move was signing
point guard Cory Alexander, who played a pivotal role in helping
the Nuggets avoid the worst record in NBA history.
	   They avoided that dubious distinction by winning six of their
final 19 games to finish two games better than the 9-73 record set
by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers.

Justice minister says Starr representative of ``new McCarthyism''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's justice minister Tuesday issued a
rambling diatribe against Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and
what he called his ``new McCarthyism.''
	   ``Democratic people around the world should rise up so that the
new McCarthysim does not pass,'' Evangelos Yannopoulos said in an
official statement.
	   Likening Starr's inquest to a litany of tragedies perpetrated by
the ``extreme right'' in the United States, Yannopoulos went far
beyond the official government reaction to the airing of President
Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony.
	   Yannopoulos blamed the extreme right in the United States for
the death and persecution of a series of American leaders, from
President John F. Kennedy to black activist Malcom X.
	   By comparison, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said of
Starr that ``I have the opinion that moralists often don't have
feelings, they have no principals and they have no barriers. In the
end, they are unethical.''
	   Yannopoulos also launched a tirade against Starr in an interview
with a private television network, saying the independent counsel
would have been stoned in Greece.
	   The decision to air Clinton's testimony touched a raw nerve in
Greece, which went through a similar period in the late 1980's and
early 1990's.
	   At the time, the late Premier Andreas Papandreou was attacked by
conservative and right wing parties in Greece for his extra-marital
affair with an airline hostess half his age.
	   He eventually married her, but was then prosecuted and tried on
corruption charges by a special court and acquitted in January
1992.
	   The scandals contributed to Papandreou's election defeat in 1989
after eight years in power. He weathered both, was re-elected in
1993, and died in 1996. His socialist party, now led by Premier
Costas Simitis, won snap elections in 1996.
	   Yannopoulos was often criticized for his acid tongue in the
early 1990s, when he spent hours on television lambasting and
hurling epithets at opponents, critics, judges and lawyers in
Papandreou's defense.

As drug campaign succeeds, Peru fights terrorism and nuclear
</HEADLINE>
weapons spread &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As its campaign to eradicate drugs gains
success, Peru is focusing on fighting terrorism and limiting the
spread of nuclear weapons, the Peruvian foreign minister told the
U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.
	   ``In 1990, there were 120,000 hectares of coca; today in a
spectacular decline, this has been reduced by half, and with it,
the number of families linked to the coca economy,'' said Eduardo
Ferrero Costa. ``Through programs of alternative development it is
possible to avoid a resurgence in the supply of coca leaves.''
	   The need to combat terrorism is as important as the fight
against drugs, said Costa, who echoed the sentiments in many
speeches already given before the world body.
	   In December 1996, leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
rebels raided a cocktail party at the Japanese ambassador's mansion
in the Peruvian capital, Lima, and grabbed a star-studded list of
hostages whom they tried to exchange for their imprisoned comrades.
	   The rebels held 72 hostages for 126 days before military
commandos freed them in a bloody rescue raid. All 14 rebels, two
commandos and one hostage died in the raid.
	   ``Peru categorically condemns terrorism in all its forms and
varieties, and urges the international community to fight it,''
Costa said.
	   Part of the campaign against terrorism includes eliminating
weapons, especially, nuclear ones, he said.
	   Costa said Peru was the first Latin American country to ratify
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ``and consequently
rejects any kind of nuclear test anywhere in the world.''

Israeli soldiers were killed in a tank accident, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   Four Israeli jets fired nine missiles at guerrilla infiltration
trails and hideouts near Litani River, some 25 kilometers (15
miles) southeast of the southern port of Tyre, officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the evening air
raid, which occurred about four kilometers (two miles) from a hill
where an Israeli tank overturned at dawn Tuesday, killing two
Israeli soldiers and injuring three others.
	   The tank rolled over near the village of Kantara in the eastern
sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, said the
Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement said the tank ``fell
into the Litani river.''
	   After the casualties had been evacuated, ``the vehicle was
destroyed by Israeli helicopters,'' the statement said.
	   An army spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports of an
Israeli jet raid.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its
guerrillas had detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry
unit was passing in the area, causing ``definite casualties.''
	   Lebanese security officials could not confirm the Hezbollah
statement, but they said that Israeli helicopters had strafed
mountains in southeast Lebanon believed to be used by the
guerrillas.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen
from the enclave Israel set up in 1985 as a buffer zone to protect
its northern towns from guerrilla attack.

Taliban urge UN to condemn rocket attacks on Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Afghan foreign minister accusing Iran of trying
to divide Afghanistan in new grafs 10-11, denying the Taliban
killed the diplomats in new grafs 15-16. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In a letter to the United Nations,
Afghanistan's Taliban religious army urged the global body to
condemn devastating rocket assaults on the Afghan capital this week
that killed scores of people.
	   Broadcast Tuesday on the Taliban-run radio Shariat, the letter
attacked the anti-Taliban alliance for carrying out the worst
rocket attack on Kabul in nearly two years.
	   According to the letter, written by the foreign ministry, more
than 100 people were killed in the attacks on Sunday and Monday.
Another 200 people were injured.
	   ``The rocket attacks which were launched from north of Kabul
from (Ahmed Shah) Massood areas caused the deaths of more than 100
people ... including children, women and men,'' the letter said.
``Where are the United Nations and human rights organizations and
why are they not expressing their condemnation?''
	   The Taliban has been critical of U.N. accusations that Taliban
troops massacred Shiite Muslims last month when the Taliban overran
the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan.
	   During the takeover eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist were killed by Taliban troops.
	   Since then the Iranian military has been put on alert and more
than 200,000 soldiers have been deployed on Iran's border with
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban say they have sent as many as 10,000 fresh troops to
the area.
	   The standoff between Iran and the Taliban army has generated
fears of an all-out war.
	   At a meeting Tuesday of Islamic clerics from across Taliban-held
areas of Afghanistan, Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed
Hassan said Iran ``has been conspiring against our nation.''
	   Accusing Iran of arming and financing Afghanistan's
northern-based opposition, Hassan said, ``If attacked we will not
allow Iran to divide our country.''
	   While both Iran and the Taliban say they want to avert a
confrontation, neither side has been willing to compromise.
	   Iran's leadership has demanded an apology for the death of its
diplomats and is demanding the Taliban hand over their killers.
	   Taliban leaders have refused to apologize and say they will
arrest and try the culprits under their tough brand of Islamic law.
	   ``We did not kill'' the Iranian diplomats, said Hassan. ``They
were killed by angry people who have seen them conspiring against
Afghanistan.''
	   Hassan said the slain Iranians were ``pretending to be
diplomats.''
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan and its
opponents, which largely comprise the country's minorities
including Shiite Muslims, who adhere to the same sect of Islam as
most Iranians.

Bangladesh wants benefits from globalization for poor countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Bangladesh's foreign minister said Tuesday
that poor countries like his could not succumb to the
industrialized world's insistence on market reforms without
assistance.
	   ``The external economic shocks associated with this process are
too powerful for the vulnerable economies to absorb,'' Abdus Samad
Azad said in an address to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``We need to formulate a positive and workable agenda for
ensuring that globalization promotes equity and benefit for all,''
said Azad.
	   He said his country could benefit if countries implement easier
work rules for migrant laborers.
	   Azad noted that development assistance to Bangladesh had
declined by 15 percent from 1992 to 1996 in real terms. ``This
decline must be halted and reversed. For the poorest and more
vulnerable economies, ODA remains indispensable,'' he said.
	   Azad noted that the cost of relief, rehabilitation and
reconstruction from the recent devastating floods in Bangladesh had
been estimated at about dlrs 900 million, and asked the United
Nations and donor countries for their help.
	   The floods, which submerged two-thirds of Bangladesh, caused 550
deaths and disrupted the lives of 20 million people.

Mexican flood victims begin rebuilding villages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) _ Eager to shelter their families, dozens
of Mexicans swung machetes and tore the earth with hoes Tuesday to
clear land for new homes to replace the ones swept away by this
month's flash floods.
	   Fathers and mothers worked to rebuild their villages, Chamisal
and Paraiso, outside the municipal seat of Huixtla, 25 miles (40
kms) northwest of the Guatemala border.
	   Storms devastated southern Chiapas state's coastal region
earlier this month, wiping out roads and bridges, burying towns in
mudslides, and cutting communication links to scores of remote
villages.
	   Chiapas officials have confirmed at least 183 dead. But with
thousands of people still unaccounted for, the death toll is
expected to rise.
	   In the Huixtla area, about 800 families lost everything.
	   Workers will begin building the first 450 homes for the flood
victims in about a week, Huixtla Mayor Jorge Paz Medina said. The
municipality has acquired nearly 15 acres (6 hectares) to relocate
the flood-wrecked villages.
	   The government is donating the lots for the homes, along with
building materials, he said.
	   Similar rebuilding efforts were underway across the affected
region, where more than 23,000 people were living in dozens of
shelters.
	   Victims have complained that aid has not arrived quickly enough:
Some charged that communities supportive of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party were being given priority; the
Mexican Red Cross complained the government was not supplying air
transportation for the aid it had collected.
	   On Tuesday, federal deputies in the lower house of Congress
called for a group of lawmakers to tour the region and investigate
the reports of inadequate aid. The Chamber of Deputies, which is
dominated by opposition parties, said the proposal would be given
urgent attention.

Public support for Clinton unshaken by video release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Note contents in graf 12, bgng: But not... &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Graphic &QL; 
 &UR; By WILL LESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Most Americans oppose President Bill Clinton's
ouster even though they say he was evasive in his videotaped
answers to a grand jury and they don't accept his narrow definition
of sexual relations, polls indicate.
	   Republicans predicted over the weekend the president's standing
with the public would be hurt by the Monday release of his
videotaped testimony. But Clinton shrugged off the potential impact
before the tape was made public, saying: ``It's not of so much
concern to me.''
	   That assessment appears correct _ for now.
	   Clinton's job approval rating ranges from 60 percent to 66
percent, according to surveys taken Monday night by ABC News,
CNN/USA Today/Gallup and NBC News. And about six out of 10 oppose
his resignation or impeachment, said the polls taken hours after
the videotape was shown nationally by several networks.
	   The president's taped testimony didn't live up to predictions
that it would shock viewers, already overwhelmed with information
about the president's relationship with the former White House
intern.
	   While most say Clinton should not be removed from office, 68
percent in the Gallup poll said the Lewinsky matter is causing
significant harm to the country.
	   It's not clear yet who will eventually bear most of the blame.
	   White House aides say privately they are watching the polls to
see what kind of marks the Republicans in Congress are getting for
their conduct of the investigation. At this point, the public
disapproves of their handling of the Lewinsky investigation by 62
percent to 34 percent, according to the ABC poll.
	   Six out of 10 said Congress was wrong to release the videotape
and prosecutors were wrong to ask about such intimate details. And
the president was right not to answer such questions, according to
70 percent of those in the ABC survey.
	   Among those who saw the videotape, more approved of the
president's handling of the testimony than disapproved, 45 percent
to 41 percent in the ABC poll.
	   ``The overnight polling data suggests that the American people
now have a more sympathetic view of the president than they had
before,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
	   But not all of the poll results were good news for Clinton _ 68
percent who saw the videotape described his answers as evasive. And
four out of five disagreed with Clinton's narrow legal definition
of ``sexual relations,'' saying that applies to oral sex as well as
intercourse. Clinton testified his intimate contact with Ms.
Lewinsky did not count as sexual relations.
	   The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 631 adults had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The ABC poll of 523
adults and the NBC poll of 508 adults had margins of error of plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points.

Saudis expel Afghan diplomat, recall their envoy from Kabul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia expelled the Afghan
charge d'affaires Tuesday and recalled its representative from
Kabul, the official news agency reported.
	   The Afghan envoy was ordered to leave ``due to Saudi Arabia's
national interests,'' the Saudi Press Agency said.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of three countries that has recognized the
Taliban militia as the legitimate government in war-wracked
Afghanistan. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   The Taliban were condemned internationally after they admitted
Sept. 10 that their forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and
an Iranian journalist after capturing the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   Since then the Iranian military has been put on alert and more
than 200,000 soldiers have been deployed on Iran's border with
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban say they have sent as many as 10,000 fresh troops to
the border area.
	   Western diplomats in Riyadh say the Saudi chief of intelligence,
Prince Turki al-Faisal, visited Afghanistan last week with the aim
of trying to reduce tension between the Taliban and Iran.
	   Iran is accused of backing the opposition to the Taliban.

O'Meara is 0-2, but Rest of the World prevails against Scandinavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Mark O'Meara lost matches in Sweden and
Norway within 24 hours, but the Rest of the World prevailed by one
point, 4.5-3.5, against Scandinavia in the inaugural SAS
Invitational Tuesday.
	   Brad Faxon edged Per Haugsrud of Norway 2 and 1 in the second of
four matches at Ullna Golf Club to clinch victory for the Rest of
the World team.
	   The American was the only player to win both matches in the
two-day competition in three Scandinavian countries.
	   The Scandinavians trailed 3-1 after Monday's opening matches,
held on courses outside Oslo, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark.
	   They dropped to 3.5-1.5 after Colin Montgomerie halved his match
with Sweden's Joakim Haeggman in Tuesday's opener.
	   Thomas Bjorn, a Dane, rallied to beat David Duval 2 and 1 and
Jesper Parnevik, playing only a few miles away from where he grew
up, edged O'Meara 1 up in the final match of the day.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Imports are down and the gross domestic product is
falling. Inflation is climbing and unemployment is on the rise.
With every day, new statistics are showing the depth of Russia's
economic crisis.
	   Russia imported 19 percent less in August than it did during the
same month a year ago, the State Customs Committee said Tuesday,
The dramatic drop is just the latest reflection of the financial
woes facing the country's new government.
	   With the ruble rapidly losing value, the price of many imports
has doubled since the crisis erupted Aug. 17.
	   Also shrinking is the country's industrial output. After showing
signs of modest growth at the end of last year, it was 11.5 percent
lower this August than during the same period last year _ the
sharpest drop since 1994, the State Statistics Committee said on
Friday.
	   The country's gross domestic product was also heading downward,
shrinking 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year, the
committee said. That was before the worst of the crisis hit.
	   While those indicators fell, inflation and unemployment were
going in the other direction.
	   Inflation, less than 1 percent a month before the crisis hit,
soared to 43.3 percent in the first two weeks of September.
	   Meanwhile, joblessness increased last month to reach 8.35
million people, or 11.5 percent of the workforce. The rate is
expected to rise even higher as the crisis worsens.
	   The numbers underscore the seriousness of the problems facing
Yevgeny Primakov, who has been prime minister for just 11 days and
has yet to announce a comprehensive plan to deal with the worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   So far, Primakov has only spoken in general terms about the need
to continue reforms while easing the pain on the impoverished
population.
	   Meanwhile, several key government posts, including the job of
finance minister and the head of the state tax service, have not
yet been filled.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov said formation of the
Cabinet should be completed within the next few days. ``We hope
that all appointments will be made by the end of this week,'' he
said.
	   ITAR-Tass reported that the Russian ambassador to Greece,
Valentina Matvienko, had accepted the post of deputy prime minister
for social issues.
	   The new government already contains politicians from across the
political spectrum, and it's not yet clear how the government will
incorporate all the various viewpoints into a coherent economic
policy.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who fired the previous government a
month ago, signed an order Tuesday approving the structure of the
new Cabinet, which will include five new ministries.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister who is in charge
of economic policy, said Tuesday that continued movement toward a
free market was inevitable, but warned against moving too quickly.
	   ``Our speed and expectations have surpassed our real
opportunities, and instead of a free market we have got crisis and
collapse of our financial system,'' he said while on a trip to the
St. Petersburg region, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   But, he added, ``The role of the state must, of course, be
increased.''
	   Mikhail Zadornov, the acting finance minister, met with a senior
official from the International Monetary Fund to discuss the
government's anti-crisis plans.
	   The IMF led an international group which in July pledged dlrs
22.6 billion in credits for Russia by the end of next year. But
Russia's financial crisis and the change of governments have put
the program on hold.
	   A top World Bank official said Russia would continue to receive
aid if it remains on the reform path, ITAR-Tass reported. Johannes
Linn, the bank's vice president for Europe and Central Asia, said
the country's situation was difficult but not hopeless.
	   Russian stocks rose slightly Tuesday, with the Russian Trading
System Index closing at 49.65 points, up from 47.81 Monday.
	   The battered ruble continued to trade at about 16 to the U.S.
dollar in over-the-counter trading on the Moscow currency exchange.
The level has remained roughly the same in recent days, but the
currency is still seen as unstable.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges' 120 mph (190
kph) winds knocked out power Tuesday and forced residents into
shelters in the densely populated Dominican Republic, after plowing
through Puerto Rico and leaving at least 10 dead in the northeast
Caribbean.
	   Georges' powerful thunderstorms Monday left all of Puerto Rico
without electricity and 80 percent of its people without water. The
storm spawned tornadoes as it ripped through the island of 4
million people, turning trees into missiles, flipping small planes,
exploding car windows and forcing tens of thousands into shelters.
	   As the hurricane headed west across the Caribbean, concern was
growing in Florida _ where Georges was expected late Thursday or
early Friday. Workers shuttered the windows at Key West's City
Hall, and officials said they would consider evacuating some
mobile-home parks.
	   Tourists were advised to fly out of the Florida Keys, or to
drive out and avoid congestion later on the Overseas Highway, the
only road linking the 110-mile (180-kilometer) ribbon of islands.
	   David Chorney, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that Georges
would hit Florida.
	   ``It's still about 72 hours out,'' Chorney said. ``It looks like
late Thursday, more like Friday.''
	   In San Juan, the storm blew out windows in hotels and apartments
in the beachfront district and toppled a towering construction
crane into an apartment building. The crane hit one apartment, but
no one was home. Trees were uprooted throughout the city, and
billboards and highway signs were knocked to the ground.
	   With winds and rains dying slowly in Puerto Rico, workers
cleared debris from the runways at San Juan's international airport
so emergency aid could be flow in.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Mayor Anibal Melendez of the
hard-hit eastern Puerto Rican resort of Fajardo, where dozens of
homes lost roofs. The Conquistador Resort, which overlooks the sea
in Fajardo, sustained extensive damage.
	   Police took to the streets of San Juan in force to find the
hardest-hit areas and deter looting of damaged stores and
businesses.
	   ``I don't know where we are going to stay,'' said Andrea Garcia,
surveying a mango tree that fell onto the dining room table in her
San Juan home.
	   In the north coast town of Arecibo, National Guard troops rushed
to remove residents from alongside the Rio Grande de Arecibo as
mountain runoff overflowed its banks.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal
recovery aid. Scores of federal and Red Cross officials mobilized
to assess damage, expected to soar well into the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
	   One of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years,
Georges headed Tuesday for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where
many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to the hurricane's fury.
	   By 1800 GMT, Georges' winds had risen to 120 mph (190 kph), and
the storm was just north of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital.
	   The storm snapped palm trees in Santo Domingo, forced residents
into shelters and darkened the city.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.
	   Georges unleashed a landslide near San Juan that killed three
people, civil defense officials said. Two people died of heart
attacks in shelters, and one person was reported missing in another
landslide.
	   The storm killed two people and injured several others in
Antigua. Three deaths were reported in St. Kitts, where 70 percent
of homes were damaged, as were the hospital, airport and police
station.
	   As it moved westward across southern Puerto Rico, Georges
spawned tornadoes in the central town of Barranquitas and the
eastern island of Vieques. Gusts reaching 175 mph (280 kph) were
reported in the interior mountains, where damage reports were
sketchy.
	   Georges also caused extensive property damage in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Antigua and other smaller Caribbean islands.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to a third of their
height and destroyed part of the boardwalk.
	   In Antigua, the storm split open government-built homes and
ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and wrapped
them around trees.

Nigerian woman dies after police try to expel her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A Nigerian woman who sought asylum in
Belgium died in hospital Tuesday after a struggle with police
during a deportation attempt at the airport left her in a coma.
	   Semira Adamu was facing expulsion and was led to an Africa-bound
airplane in Zaventem when she started resisting. Officials said
police pushed a pillow in her face to restrain her. During the
fight, the 20-year-old woman fell unconscious and sank into a coma.
	   She was taken to hospital with brain damage and died late
Tuesday, a hospital official, who demanded not to be named said.
	   Interior Minister Louis Tobback said he regretted the incident.
Judicial police opened an inquiry.
	   Adamu had claimed she would face a forced marriage to a much
older man if she returned to Nigeria.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down were
repatriated last year. Some 300 needed police escorts.

Desmond Tutu, Grandmothers of Argentine `disappeared' thank World
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and the
grandmothers of the Argentine ``disappeared'' paid tribute Tuesday
to the World Council of Churches for supporting their struggles.
	   ``We are free!'' said Tutu in a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of the WCC. ``We have won a spectacular victory over
injustice and oppression and the ghastliness of apartheid,'' thanks
in large measure to international support.
	   The church body played a ``very significant'' role by supporting
the struggle, he said, noting that he himself had served as a
staffer of the WCC in London for three years during the 1970s.
	   Estela de Carlotto, president of the Grandmothers of the Plaza
de Mayo, Argentina, said the WCC was one of the first international
bodies to offer support when she and other Argentine women were
desperate to find their children and grandchildren who disappeared
during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s.
	   ``For more than 20 years there has been a profound friendship
between the WCC and the association,'' she said.
	   ``We were women who did not what to do or where to go because we
did not know where our loved ones had been taken,'' Mrs. de
Carlotto said.
	   Encouraged by a WCC representative in Brazil that ``God will
provide,'' the group sent a delegation to WCC headquarters in
Geneva in 1980 on an initial budget of only dlrs 200. The World
Council provided the support for them to make a crucial initial
tour of 11 European countries to ``tell our story.''
	   Since then, she said, the WCC has been ``our guardian angel.''
	   ``We are eternally grateful to the World Council of Churches for
helping us to find our grandchildren,'' Mrs. de Carlotto said. ``We
have found 59 of them.''
	   The WCC has more than 300 member churches from virtually all
Protestant and Orthodox Christian traditions in more than 100
countries. While the Roman Catholic Church is not a member, it
maintains links with the WCC.

Saudis expel Afghan diplomat, recall their envoy from Kabul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia expelled the Afghan
charge d'affaires Tuesday and recalled its representative from
Kabul, the official news agency reported.
	   The Afghan envoy was ordered to leave ``due to Saudi Arabia's
national interests,'' the Saudi Press Agency said.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of three countries that has recognized the
Taliban militia as the legitimate government in war-wracked
Afghanistan. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   The Taliban were condemned internationally after they admitted
Sept. 10 that their forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and
an Iranian journalist after capturing the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   Since then the Iranian military has been put on alert and more
than 200,000 soldiers have been deployed on Iran's border with
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban say they have sent as many as 10,000 fresh troops to
the border area.
	   Western diplomats in Riyadh say the Saudi chief of intelligence,
Prince Turki al-Faisal, visited Afghanistan last week with the aim
of trying to reduce tension between the Taliban and Iran.
	   Iran is accused of backing the opposition to the Taliban.

Milutinovic is MetroStars coach, but uncertain for how long
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMY WESTFELDT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNION, New Jersey (AP) _ Bora Milutinovic started his job as
coach of the New York-New Jersey Metrostars on Tuesday, but gave no
clue as to how long he'd stay.
	   ``This is a big chance for myself. I like to be in America,''
said the Serbian-born Milutinovic, in between practices for the MLS
team at Kean University. ``Tomorrow is very far away.''
	   Milutinovic, a former United States National Team coach and a
rumored candidate for the job again, has no signed contract with
the team, although he says he is committed to stay through the
playoffs, which start next week.
	   Vice President and General Manager Charlie Stillitano said he
called Milutinovic over the weekend and agreed to a short-term
arrangement ``on a handshake.'' He wouldn't say how much
Milutinovic was being paid.
	   Milutinovic, the MetroStars' fifth coach in less than three
years, and Stillitano will sit down in the next few weeks for
longer-term negotiations, Stillitano said.
	   ``I have a minimum of three games,'' said Milutinovic. The
MetroStars' first playoff series, beginning Sept. 30 against the
Columbus Crew, is a best-of-three series.
	   Milutinovic flew in from Mexico on Monday night, hours after
Stillitano fired coach Alfonso Mondelo. He met with his players on
Tuesday, including four he coached during the 1994 World Cup:
midfielders Tab Ramos and Mike Sorber, goalkeeper Tony Meola and
defender Alexi Lalas.
	   Despite clinching a playoff berth last month, the MetroStars
(14-17) have lost their last six matches with one game remaining,
on Saturday against the New England Revolution.
	   Stillitano said the players had lost their confidence on the
field after getting into the playoffs.
	   And team members had complained that Mondelo had not motivated
or disciplined them. Four or five team meetings didn't help, Sorber
said Tuesday.
	   ``Nobody was on the same page,'' Sorber said. Of Mondelo, he
said, ``I never saw him deal with anything.''
	   Enter Milutinovic, who has a reputation for turning around a
team's fortunes on short notice.He is the only coach in history to
guide four different teams into the second found of the World Cup.
	   He wasn't specific about the style of play he wanted the
MetroStars to use.
	   ``The game is so easy ... but you need to be intelligent,''
Milutinovic said.
	   ``They have experience. We need to play. It's so simple,
really.''
	   Milutinovic last guided Nigeria into the second round of this
summer's World Cup before it was eliminated by Denmark. He also led
Mexico to the second round in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990 and the
United States in 1994.
	   Introduced by then U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg in 1991 as a ``miracle worker,'' he headed the U.S. team
until 1995, when he said he was fired for not taking a larger role
in player development.
	   Milutinovic had been one of four names bandied about to replace
Sampson, along with D.C. United coach Bruce Arena; and two former
MetroStars coaches: Carlos Queiroz, former Portuguese national team
coach; and Brazilian Carlos Alberta Parreira, who left to coach
Saudi Arabia in the 1998 World Cup.

Atletico and Rosario decide berth in finals of Conmebol Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Atletico Mineiro, with practically
a reserve team, faces Rosario Central of Argentina on Wednesday in
a game that sends the winner to the final of the Conmebol Cup.
	   Atletico will be without eight starters against Rosario. The
only members of the ``A'' team are goalie Emerson, defender Vitor
and forward Valdir.
	   Edgar and William were expelled in the first semifinal game in
Argentina, when the teams tied 1-1. Forward Marques is injured, and
five other players were not enrolled in the tournament.
	   Still, Atletico won't be a pushover. After a slow start in the
national championship, the team has played well and is in 11th
place among the 24 first-division clubs.
	   In the Conmebol Cup, Atletico also had a so-so start, squeaking
by Cerro Cora of Paraguay in penalty kicks after a pair of ties.
But then the Brazilians downed Wilsterman of Bolivia twice to
advance to the semifinals.
	   Rosario eliminated Audax of Chile in the first round, then
knocked out Huracan Buceo of Uruguay in the quarterfinals.
	   The game starts at 8:30 p.m. local time (2330 GMT) in Mineirao
stadium.
	   The winner will face the victor of the all-Brazilian matchup
between Santos and Sampaio Correa of Sao Luis. Their semifinal
match was postponed until Thursday to avoid a conflict with the
Brazilian national team, which plays Yugoslavia on Wednesday in Sao
Luis.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Shane Spencer homered twice and the New York
Yankees hit four homers in all to beat the Cleveland Indians 10-4
Tuesday in the first game of a day-night doubleheader.
	   The four homers gave the Yankees 201, the second-most in
franchise history. The 1961 team homered 240 times.
	   The Yankees won their 108th game, the third-most in franchise
history. They are pursuing the American League record of 111 wins
set by the 1954 Cleveland Indians.
	   Spencer, Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius homered in a four-run
second inning. Spencer homered again in the fourth.
	   Ramiro Mendoza (10-2) allowed four runs on seven hits in five
innings and became the sixth Yankees pitcher to win 10 games this
year. The last time the Yankees had six 10-game winners was 1977.
	   The last team to accomplish the feat was the 1987 Toronto Blue
Jays.

Feyenoord edges PSV to stretch lead to four points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals either side of the half gave
Dutch league leader Feyenoord a 2-1 win at arch-rival PSV Eindhoven
Tuesday and its fifth victory from five games.
	   Feyenoord's 15 points put it four clear of Ajax and FC Utrecht
who are tied for second, while PSV languishes in tenth with seven
points.
	   On 13 minutes, Feyenoord's Peter van Vossen gave away a free
kick wide on the right and when Gilles de Bilde crossed, Andre
Ooijer leaped highest in a crowd of players to head home.
	   But Van Vossen's combative attitude paid off just before the
half when his one-two with Jon Dahl Tomasson broke the PSV defense
wide open and he chipped delicately over keeper Ronald Waterreus.
	   And within two minutes of the restart, Brazilian Tininho's
center gave Argentinian Julio Ricardo Cruz a sharp near-post tap-in
to win the game for the Rotterdammers.
	   It was Cruz's first league game back from a suspension earned at
the end of last season.
	   It should have been 3-1 almost immediately but Tomasson blasted
high and wide of an empty goal after Cruz's pace forced an error
from PSV defender Stan Valckx.
	   Then De Bilde was denied an equalizer when he was adjudged to
have fouled Polish keeper Jurek Dudek before knocking the ball in
from a corner.
	   Feyenoord fell back to defending its own penalty area and Dudek
had to make three agile fingertip saves and a brilliant block from
Ruud van Nistelrooy's free kick to keep PSV out.
	   This traditional grudge match between two of the country's top
three teams produced seven yellow cards, five of them for PSV fouls
on Cruz and Van Vossen.

Security Council moves toward resolution on Kosovo, would authorize

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain reported progress Tuesday on a
draft Security Council resolution demanding an end to the violence
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and threatening force if the
Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists continues.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, indicated it would go
along with the resolution.
	   Heading into hastily called Security Council consultations,
British U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock cautioned that the
resolution would not authorize immediate military action.
	   ``That was never anybody's objective,'' Greenstock said. ``The
objective was to recognize the seriousness of the humanitarian
situation, as a consequence of a very bad political situation, and
to pass a Chapter 7 resolution which made Belgrade realize that the
international community was losing its patience.''
	   Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter authorizes force if regional peace
and security is threatened.
	   Russia, which as a permanent council member has the right to
veto resolutions, has said it opposed any threat or use of force.
	   But Russian U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated Moscow could
go along with the resolution because it wouldn't signal any
immediate action.
	   The resolution, Lavrov said, reiterates previous resolutions on
Kosovo that threaten force and ``also clearly says that any new
measures would have to be subject to a decision by the Security
Council.''
	   Greenstock said he hoped the resolution, championed by Britain
and France, would be adopted by the end of the week.
	   Fighting in Kosovo has killed hundreds of people and uprooted
over 250,000 since February, when Serb forces began a crackdown on
the separatist guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.

Iraq uses ancient site to voice modern complaint against U.N.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BABYLON, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president said Tuesday that his
country would ``never, never, never'' resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors unless the Security Council first reviews Iraqi
disarmament activities.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement as he opened a music
festival in Babylon, where traces of President Saddam Hussein now
overshadow those of its great builder in antiquity, the biblical
king Nebuchadnezzar.
	   The ancient setting contrasted with the modern dispute between
Iraq and the United Nations over whether Iraq has fulfilled U.N.
resolutions requiring the country to eliminate its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq last month cut off cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
to dramatize its argument that it has indeed fulfilled that
obligation. The inspectors have insisted Iraq is still hiding
weapons or the systems to produce more lethal arms.
	   ``Never, never, never!'' Ramadan replied when asked by reporters
whether Iraq will rescind its Aug. 5 decision freezing further U.N.
inspections of the country's banned weapons.
	   The Security Council responded by dropping its regular reviews
of U.N. trade sanctions, in effect cutting off any avenue for Iraq
to argue for lifting of the sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
include a ban on Iraq's free export of oil, its most valuable
commodity. The Security Council has offered a full review of Iraq's
progress on eliminating weapons programs, but only after Saddam's
government resumes cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   Iran says the comprehensive review should come first.
	   Ramadan opened a festival that organizers said featured 45
troupes from 32 countries, a sign that Iraq was breaking out of the
isolation of the sanctions.
	   The setting spoke of Iraq's ancient culture when Nebuchadnezzar
ruled Babylon for 40 years in the 6th century B.C.
	   But the Babylon of today _ as rebuilt by Saddam's government _
is quite different. Murals of Saddam accompany pictures of
Nebuchadnezzar, and bricks inscribed with Saddam's name accompany
those from ancient times that show Nebuchadnezzar's name.
	   In his inaugural speech, Ramadan unleashed a vitriolic attack at
the United States, saying ``this country of evil has directed all
its evil potentials against Iraq.''
	   He said Iraq had no more faith in the U.N. Security Council,
which has become ``an assembly for aggression, arrogance and
despotism.''
	   Ramadan and other senior Cabinet members and officials from the
ruling Baath party attended the celebration. They wore olive-drab
uniforms with military berets.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ After plowing through
the northern Caribbean, Hurricane Georges carved into the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday, uprooting trees and churning the sea as
Dominicans and tourists alike fled to shelter.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
Authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, as residents
began boarding up windows in anticipation of Georges' fury.
	   The storm caught the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo almost
entirely unprepared Tuesday. Forecasters had expected it to hit
only the northern coast, but Georges, which killed at least 10
people in its furious march across the Caribbean, changed course
and headed straight for the tropical capital of 3 million people.
	   Even more than in Puerto Rico, where Georges exploded shop and
car windows, flipped small airplanes and whisked away satellite
dishes, the damage was expected to be extensive.
	   In this poor U.S. territory where the minimum wage is about dlrs
140 a month, the wooden houses that line riverbeds and hillsides
would be no match for the storm's 110 mph (175 kph) winds.
	   In neighboring Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola and
is also in the storm's path, people prepared to battle the
hurricane amid even more profound poverty.
	   As the darkness approached, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez
told his countrymen the island's fate was in God's hands.
	   ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise
our prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.
	   Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Dominican Republic to
eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. The U.S. National
Weather Service said a hurricane watch may be needed late Tuesday
or early Wednesday for the northwest Bahamas and South Florida.
	   David Chorney, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that Georges
would hit Florida.
	   ``As far as intensity, it's still too early to tell what it's
going to do,'' he said. After crossing the Caribbean islands and
getting back over water, he said, ``there's a good chance it could
redevelop and strengthen again.''
	   The storm had already caused what is expected to amount to
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in Puerto Rico, where the
entire island lost power and most had their water cut. Five people
were killed on the island and tens of thousands took refuge in
shelters.
	   In the capital of San Juan, where almost half the island's
people live, downed power lines and trees fell onto flooded roads,
making some impassable.
	   On Tuesday, residents began the sobering task of recovery.
	   ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte
Figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes in the musty heat, the
roof of her house ripped off by the winds. ``There's flooding,
there are mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''
	   The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof
off the cab of a water tanker truck passing through Santo Domingo,
flipping it onto the hood of the vehicle. The driver continued on,
hanging out the window to see where he was going.
	   Some people stood in whipping winds Tuesday morning trying to
nail plywood boards over their windows. Many residents simply sat
back and waited.
	   Authorities in Santo Domingo didn't open shelters until Tuesday
morning, hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had
reached the capital. People continued to stream into shelters even
as the full force of Georges hit.
	   Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.
Hotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put them
up in conference rooms or ballrooms.
	   There was no word on casualties in the Dominican Republic. As
Georges moved into the east of Hispaniola, communication was cut
between the capital and the east of the island.
	   Earlier, President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands disaster areas though details of the extent of
damage to the Virgin Islands, a popular tourist retreat, wasn't
known. The storm also caused extensive damage in Antigua and other
smaller Caribbean islands.
	   On the western half of Hispaniola, Haitian authorities warned
that substandard housing and deforested land could put many people
in jeopardy, but they said they hoped the storm would lose strength
over the Dominican Republic.
	   In 1994, mudslides unleashed by tropical storm Gordon killed
several thousand people in Haiti's southern provinces.

Lithuania: Human rights, natural resources should be protected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ All countries should ratify the recent
treaty creating an international war crimes court, which will
prosecute genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes
of aggression, Lithuania's president told the General Assembly on
Tuesday.
	   ``Little facts of modern history remind us that aggression so
often leads to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity,''
said Valdas Adamkus told world leaders.
	   Lithuania was among the countries that participated on a
preparatory committee that led to the treaty.
	   Adamkus was born in Lithuania but fled as a young man during
World War II, when Lithuania was occupied both by the Nazis and the
Soviet Union. He emigrated to the United States, eventually
becoming a top official in the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
	   This was his first trip to the United States since he returned
to Lithuania last year to run for president. He abandoned his U.S.
citizenship in January after winning the election.
	   In his speech, Adamkus also highlighted the importance of
environmental protection, saying the struggle for the world's few
remaining natural resources can easily become the grounds for
conflict.
	   ``The struggle for fresh water, rich soil and natural resources
can turn men against men and nation against nation, and neither
democratic political processes nor economic development will matter
then,'' he said.

Chavez asks for shot at super lightweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez, former world champion in
three divisions, asked the World Boxing Council on Tuesday for a
chance to fight for the super lightweight title.
	   The request follows Chavez's bruised and bloody loss to WBC
welterweight champion Oscar de la Hoya on Saturday.
	   Chavez, 36, told the council he hopes to fight the winner of the
Nov. 28 title match between No. 1 ranked Miguel Angel Gonzalez of
Mexico and No. 2 Konstantin Tzsyu of Russia.
	   WBC President Jose Sulaiman said the council would approve the
weight change and consider his appeal for a title fight at its next
convention Oct. 25 in South Africa.
	   Chavez, who weighed in at 144 1/2 pounds (65 kilograms) for
Saturday's bout, would drop to at least 140 pounds (63 kilograms)
for the super lightweight division.
	   The 36-year-old Chavez has held super featherweight, lightweight
and super lightweight titles while accumulating a 101-3-2 record.
	   The veteran boxer was punished by the 25-year-old De La Hoya,
who opened a deep cut on Chavez's lower lip. After a hard-fought
eighth round, Chavez's cornerman refused to let the fighter come
out for a ninth.
	   De La Hoya improved his record to 29-0 with 24 knockouts.
	   Chavez has suggested he will retire from boxing by the end of
the year, but that he'd like to win another belt to leave the ring
as a champion.

Tyson eyes ranked opponent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson probably will fight a ranked
opponent in his first comeback fight this year if he regains his
boxing license, his adviser said Tuesday.
	   Shelly Finkel said he and Tyson want someone better than Peter
McNeeley, whom Tyson fought _ and knocked out in the first round _
in his first comeback fight when he was released from prison in
1995.
	   ``You want credibility in the person he fights,'' Finkel said.
``We're looking for a rated opponent.''
	   Before Tyson picks an opponent, though, he must pick a team of
doctors to examine him and make sure he is psychologically fit to
return to the ring.
	   Nevada boxing authorities have given Tyson a list of three
facilities to undergo a psychiatric examination, and a deadline of
Monday for his doctors to submit reports on Tyson's mental state.
	   If Tyson is cleared by the doctors, the Nevada Athletic
Commission is expected to give the former heavyweight champion a
new boxing license on Oct. 3.
	   ``No one wants to go see doctors, but he's eager to get his
license back,'' Finkel said.
	   Tyson gets his choice of being examined at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston or C.F.
Menninger Memorial Hospital in Topeka, Kan.
	   Finkel said he was still trying to decide Tuesday where to go.
	   The examination was ordered by the commission following a
six-hour hearing Saturday on Tyson's request for reinstatement. He
has been banned since the commission revoked his license July 9,
1997 for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   A letter sent to Tyson and his advisers Monday from the
commission said the team of doctors evaluating him must include a
psychologist, a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist. The boxer
must be given comprehensive neuropsychological testing as well as
an MRI of the brain and a complete drug screen.
	   In addition, the commission wants the doctors who evaluate Tyson
to look at videotape of his fight against Holyfield as well as from
post-fight interviews and license reinstatement hearings in New
Jersey and Nevada.
	   Finkel said he was trying to find out which of the three
facilities do all the testing required by the commission and
whether he could get three doctors to come to Las Vegas on Oct. 3
to be questioned by the commission.
	   The Mayo Clinic, he said, apparently doesn't do all the testing
requested by the commission.
	   If Tyson is allowed to return to the ring, he is expected to
fight in late November or early December, most likely at the MGM
Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
	   Finkel predicted the fight will be bigger than Tyson's comeback
against McNeeley, in which he got a dlrs 25 million purse. However,
the money was split in half by payments he had to make to promoter
Don King and his co-managers.

International backing needed for Guyana's democracy, president
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wracked by election-related political
violence, Guyana needs international backing for its government if
democracy is to survive, its president said Tuesday.
	   ``We need to go beyond the holding of periodic elections to
ensuring the observance of the rule of law and building the
institutions upon which democracy must rest,'' Janet Jagan told the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   Since elections last December, there have been sporadic
outbreaks of violence in Guyana, a former British colony of 730,000
on the northern coast of South America.
	   The opposition accuses the U.S.-born Jagan of vote rigging,
abusing power and discriminating against blacks and other
minorities. Jagan is white and her party is dominated by Guyanese
of East Indian descent.
	   Jagan succeeded her husband, Cheddi, who died in office more
than a year ago. Cheddi Jagan won Guyana's first democratic
elections in three decades in 1992.
	   Although international observers judged the last elections to be
free and fair, ``the minority opposition refuses to abide by the
results, consequently the will of the electorate has been
questioned,'' she said.
	   ``We firmly believe that it is in the interest of the
international community as a whole to assist in the strengthening
of the democratic system as a bulwark against encroachment by
oppressive regimes,'' she said.
	   Jagan also defended her country against accusations that it is
recklessly logging its tropical forests.
	   ``A land of abundant and pristine forest, Guyana runs no risk of
deforestation,'' said Jagan, adding that her government has in
place ``firm legislative and administrative arrangements to ensure
the conservation of our natural resources.''
	   Guyana's timber industry has been shaken by the economic
collapse in some Asian countries because most of the logging firms
flocking to Guyana during the last five years are from Malaysia,
Korea, China and other Asian countries.
	   Before the Asian economic troubles, timber sales made up 4.6
percent of Guyana's gross domestic product. This year it is likely
to drop to just over 2 percent, the Guyana Forestry Commission
says.

A must read: the book on Muirfield
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The United States had more than just
home turf advantage when it retained the Solheim Cup last week at
Muirfield Village.
	   Captain Judy Rankin asked several PGA Tour players to write down
a few thoughts on how to play Muirfield, a yearly tour stop, and
how to prepare for the event, then assembled them in a booklet for
a ``nice memento.''
	   The cover sheet was from Jack Nicklaus, the course designer. But
that was only the start. Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard and John Cook
each contributed advice in handwritten letters. Curtis Strange
wrote about pride and told them to practice putting all week long.
	   ``A great piece of advice,'' Rankin said.
	   Other notes came from Hale Irwin and Cathy Gerring, who once
lived at Muirfield and played in the 1990 Solheim Cup.
	   ``Each of them, you could tell, took an awful lot of effort and
cared an awful lot about this team to do what they did,'' said
Dottie Pepper, who was unbeaten in last week's competition.
	   Among the contributions:
	   _A hole-by-hole description from Leonard. ``It looked like a
regular college-ruled notebook,'' Pepper said.
	   _Two pages of single-spaced typing from Lehman, describing every
shot in detail (``If you hit it in the back bunker left at 14, it's
X'').
	   _Four handwritten pages from Cook, signed by him and his wife.
	   ``I just had this idea that maybe these fellows, who play here
all the time, could help us a little bit,'' Rankin said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FIRST TEE IN TEXAS: &LR;  Chalk up another first for historic
Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio. The first public golf
course in Texas and the first home of the Texas Open will become
part of The First Tee program on Wednesday.
	   Designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1915, Brackenridge will renovate
its practice facility and clubhouse, and allow tee times and range
use for First Tee, a national program aimed at making golf more
affordable and accessible, especially to kids.
	   Walter Hagen, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead won the Texas Open at
Brackenridge. And in 1955, Mike Souchak set a tour record there for
the lowest 72-hole score _ 257 _ with rounds of 60-69-64-65.
	   ``First Tee participants will not only be taught the virtues and
values of the game, but from Brackenridge, they will learn about
the history and tradition of the game,'' said Reid Meyers, chairman
of the San Antonio First Tee Program.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BERMUDA TRIANGLE: &LR;  Eight players from the PGA Tour, LPGA and
Senior Tour will meet in Bermuda next week for the dlrs 1.8 million
Gillette Tour Challenge Championship.
	   In its second year, the Gillette Challenge is an alternate-shot
format played on the Tuesday before various tournaments throughout
the year. The leading money winners from the challenge reached the
finals Sept. 29 at the Mid Ocean Golf Club. Nick Price, Jim Colbert
and Kelly Robbins will defend their title, while the other seven
teams will be randomly selected.
	   The PGA players are Price, Robert Gamez, Lee Janzen, Billy
Andrade, John Daly, Jim Furyk, Scott Hoch and Payne Stewart. From
the Senior Tour are Colbert, Hale Irwin, Hugh Baiocchi, Jim
Colbert, Hubert Green, Gil Morgan, Walter Morgan, Jay Sigel and Lee
Trevino.
	   The LPGA will send Robbins, Annika Sorenstam, Donna Andrews,
Laura Davies, Chris Johnson, Rosie Jones, Michelle McGann and Se Ri
Pak.
	   Gillette will donate dlrs 1 million to the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation, the official national charity of the LPGA. Also,
five people will take part in a putting contest that ends with a
10-foot putt worth dlrs 2 million. If the putt goes in, the money
is split between the winner and the Komen Foundation.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIGER HIBERNATION: &LR;  If you haven't heard much from Tiger Woods
lately, there's a reason: He's not playing.
	   Woods is in the middle of his longest layoff since he turned pro
at the Greater Milwaukee Open in August 1996. He tied for fifth at
the World Series of Golf on Aug. 30 _ his sixth straight top 10 _
and won't resurface until Oct. 8 for the Alfred Dunhill Cup
matches.
	   Woods took a quick trip to Las Vegas to see coach Butch Harmon
and helped open a nine-hole course during a junior clinic in
Atlanta last week. He'll be in Louisville on Sunday for another
junior clinic, but otherwise has stayed away from golf.
	   ``I've only played nine holes,'' Woods told CBS SportsLine. ``It
definitely feels strange.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Bulldozing across Puerto Rico,
Hurricane Georges served up a powerful reminder of what nature can
do: make rivers overflow, spread trees like matchsticks across
highways, and leave 4 million people without power.
	   With transportation impossible in many areas, officials have yet
to gauge the full extent of one of the most powerful storms to hit
this U.S. territory in decades.
	   At least five Puerto Ricans were killed _ along with at least
six others who died as a result of the storm elsewhere in the
Caribbean _ and authorities here fear the casualty figures will
rise. Damage was expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
	   The storm also lashed the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing extensive
damage to homes and businesses in St. Croix and other neighboring
islands, disrupting phone service in and out of the territory.
Details were sketchy because of the communication problems.
	   Although accustomed to hurricanes every couple of years, Puerto
Ricans were stunned by Georges. Its 110 mph (175 kph) winds spared
not an inch (centimeter) of the U.S. territory as it swept westward
since hitting late Monday.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' said Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas even as Georges was still passing over
Puerto Rico en route to the Dominican Republic, which was hit hard
Tuesday.
	   In the San Juan neighborhood of Santa Teresita, Elodia Kendall
grew edgy when she heard wood snap during the height of the
hurricane. First a tree fell in front of her house, then behind.
Both missed the house by inches (centimeters).
	   ``When the first tree went, we freaked out because it made this
tremendous thundering sound,'' said Kendall. ``We didn't dare go
out. It takes a lot to frighten me because I'm 75 and I've seen
everything, but this did it.''
	   At dawn Tuesday, driving rains kept most people in their homes
or shelters, but by midday more people ventured out to begin
assessing the damage.
	   They found Georges had raked the island, denuding hillsides,
toppling power lines, peeling off roofs, and making highway signs
simply disappear.
	   As the rains receded, rivers swelled, overflowing their banks in
the northern coastal towns of Arecibo and Barceloneta. The
tree-lined streets of Barceloneta were under 4 feet (more than 1
meter) of water, and more than 200 homes lost their roofs, said
Mayor Sol Luis Fontanez Olivo.
	   ``There is no sign of the flood ending,'' the mayor said.
	   In the capital of San Juan, where almost half the island's
people live, the typical site was that of downed trees _ in some
areas most were felled onto roads or broken in half. Some flooded
roads were impossible to traverse.
	   There were also many downed power lines _ blacking out all of
Puerto Rico. The state power company urged retirees to report to
work and asked for help from private contractors. Damage to the
power grid alone was estimated at dlrs 60 million.
	   In all, damage was expected to far exceed that of Hurricane Hugo
in 1989, which crossed only the northeast corner of the island and
paralyzed San Juan for weeks.
	   On Tuesday, residents began cleaning their homes. Neighborhood
work parties sprung up to clear streets of branches and unclog
storm drains.
	   ``This thing was a monster,'' said Pedro Juan Morales, who lost
part of his roof and whose home was flooded. ``Hugo was a little
breeze compared to this.''

Hungarian airliner makes emergency landing in Scotland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRESTWICK, Scotland (AP) _ A Hungarian airliner carrying more
than 200 people from Budapest to Toronto made an emergency landing
in Scotland on Tuesday and was searched by army bomb experts.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   The Malev Hungarian Airlines Boeing 767 landed at Prestwick
airport near the west-central coast of Scotland after what police
described only as ``a threat regarding the safety of the
aircraft.''
	   Full emergency procedures were activated by the airport
authorities following the threat, made at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT)
and police, fire and ambulance crews were at the scene.
	   The plane touched down at around 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).
	   A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said the Malev Hungarian
aircraft landed safely following a threat, and that it was being
searched by officers and the British Army's explosives division.
	   Police refused to comment on whether the threat had been made by
a passenger on the flight or by telephone.
	   All 196 passengers and nine crew members on board flight MAH1010
were reported to be safe, police said.

Grieving Duchess of York leads mourners in burial of her mother

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Duchess of York's mother was
buried Tuesday at her polo ranch on the Argentine pampas, three
days after her death in a weekend car accident.
	   Only 20 mourners, led by the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson,
took part in the simple half-hour ceremony as Susan Barrantes was
laid in a vault beside her husband, Hector, on their estate in El
Pucara, 310 miles (500 kilometers) southwest of Buenos Aires.
	   The funeral service and burial, at a gravesite near the polo
field on the ranch, was private, attended by family and close
friends and conducted by a local priest, the Duchess of York's
spokeswoman, Kate Waddington, said in England.
	   Police guarded the wooden gates to Mrs. Barrantes' windswept
ranch, keeping a large throng of journalists at a distance.
	   The duchess was told about the accident while vacationing in
Italy. She arrived Monday in Argentina, visibly weary and saddened
and without her two children, who remained behind in Britain.
	   Despite the long distance between the two, Mrs. Barrantes had
maintained a close relationship with the duchess, making frequent
trips to Britain.
	   British media reported that the duchess was badly shaken by her
mother's death, which came a little more than a year after the
Paris auto accident that killed Princess Diana, her former
sister-in-law.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' is the former wife of Queen
Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was the widow of Barrantes, an Argentine polo
player, and the former wife of the duchess's father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, the British monarch's former polo manager.
	   Mrs. Barrantes left Ferguson for Barrantes and settled with him
in Argentina in 1975. Barrantes died of cancer in 1990.
	   The duchess said she intends to preserve her mother's final
resting place so her daughters, Beatrice, 10, and Eugenie, 8, will
be able to visit, Press Association reported.
	   ``I want my daughters to stay in touch with this place,'' she
was quoted by the news agency as saying.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Dozens of people whose relatives disappeared
during Peru's civil war placed white flowers in front of Congress
and demanded Tuesday to know the whereabouts of 3,600 people
missing since 1983.
	   Both Peru's armed forces and leftist rebels were accused of
massive human rights abuses during the conflict in which 30,000
have died since 1980. The level of political violence fell in the
early 1990s with the capture of top rebel leaders.
	   ``To have no information on the whereabouts of family members is
permanent torture,'' said Angelica Mendoza, president of the
Association of Families of those who Disappeared in Emergency
Zones.
	   The government declared states of emergency in rebel areas,
suspending civil rights and giving the armed forces sweeping powers
to stamp out rebels of the Shining Path and Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.
	   The Maoist Shining Path in turn executed community leaders and
army collaborators, and carried out a bloody car-bomb campaign.
	   In 1995, President Alberto Fujimori granted a complete amnesty
to members of the military for human rights abuses between 1980 and
1995, freeing the few soldiers prosecuted for the violence.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The remains of an Argentine rebel who
fought alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara were sent Tuesday to Cuba
from the Bolivian town where she was buried after being killed in
an army ambush.
	   Tania was the only female combatant during Guevara's ill-fated
1967 guerrilla campaign in Bolivia. Her remains were found last
week in the Andean town of Vallegrande, 540 miles (870 kilometers)
southeast of La Paz, where the remains of Guevara and other
guerrillas were found this year.
	   Tania, also known as Laura Gutierrez, was shot to death on Aug.
31, 1967 as she crossed a river alongside a Cuban commander. The
fighter, whose real name was Hayde Tamara Bunke Bider, was 29 when
she died.
	   Family members asked that her remains be taken to Cuba and be
buried in a tomb where 17 other rebels lie.
	   Her body was placed in a coffin and buried in the town of
Vallegrande.
	   Bunke Bider was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1937 of
German parents who migrated to escape Nazi persecution. After the
war, her family returned to East Germany and Tania became a member
of the Socialist Party.
	   In 1960 she met Ernesto ``Che''Guevara and moved to Cuba, where
she trained and became a member of the Cuban Communist Party, Tania
moved to Bolivia in 1964 to begin laying the groundwork for the
guerrilla campaign.

Brazilian stocks rise slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stocks crawled back from
three days of consecutive losses, posting minor gains Tuesday as
investors waited to see if the worst of the recent stock market
turbulence had passed.
	   Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange index closed up 109 points to
finish at 6,559, a gain of 1.71 percent.
	   Earlier in the day, the Bovespa rose as much as 4.3 percent
after strong showings in markets abroad. A downturn on the Dow
Jones industrial average wiped out much of those gains.
	   Brazil's stock and currency markets have been battered in recent
weeks by the global financial crisis that has sent investors
fleeing from Asia, Russia and other developing markets.

Mexican stocks, peso close stronger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks closed higher Tuesday, buoyed
by gains registered in Latin American equity markets and lower
local interest rates. The peso closed slightly stronger against the
U.S. dollar.
	   According to preliminary data, the stock market's key IPC index
closed up 82.96 points or 2.4 percent to 3577.36 points. At the end
of 1997, the IPC stood at 5229.35.
	   Volume totaled a robust 1.6 billion pesos (dlrs 157 million) on
134.0 million shares traded, compared to Monday's volume of 80.7
million shares.
	   The gain came despite a loss in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which closed down 0.5 percent to 7897.20 points. Other
markets in the Americas registered bullish sessions. In Buenos
Aires, the Merval index advanced 3.5 percent and Sao Paulo's
Bovespa gained 1.7 percent.
	   The local equity market was also bolstered by expectations of
lower interest rates at the Bank of Mexico's weekly auction of
Treasury Bills, known as Cetes. The rate on Mexico's bellwether
28-day Cetes plunged 10.26 percentage points at weekly auction
Tuesday to 37.60 percent, while the rate on 91-day Cetes fell 7.73
percentage points to 38.67 percent. Auction results are reported
just after the end of trading at 2000 GMT.
	   Meanwhile, the Mexican peso closed marginally stronger Tuesday
in active trading.
	   In Mexico City, banking leader Banamex quoted the peso closing
at 10.1600 per dollar, weaker from its open of 9.9950 but
marginally stronger than Monday's close of 10.1700.
	   Markets received mixed news in the government's preliminary
report on the August trade deficit of dlrs 694 million, which was
lower than the proceeding month but higher than analysts predicted.

Zimbabwe calls for international efforts for peace in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Zimbabwe's foreign minister on Tuesday
defended his country's decision to send troops to Congo, saying
they were sent in to uphold the sprawling nation's territorial
integrity.
	   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Stan Mudenge said his
country was committed to a negotiated settlement in Congo, where
President Laurent Kabila has been trying to suppress an insurgency
Kabila says is aided by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``In August this year, the Democratic Republic of Congo found
itself under siege from rebels supported by foreign troops,'' said
Mudenge.
	   He said that in the search for peace, Zimbabwe had hosted two
summits since the insurgency began in July.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent in troops to aid Kabila.
	   Rwanda and Uganda have denied sponsoring the insurgents,
although Uganda says it has troops in Congo under an earlier border
patrol agreement.
	   Mudenge called on the international community to support peace
initiatives.
	   He also said that many developing countries were going through
tough economic times as they tried to meet the challenges of
globalization and a market economy. He said external debts were
among their biggest problems.
	   ``We believe that new comprehensive and coordinated approaches
to the debt and debt-servicing problem have to be adopted,
including outright forgiveness.
	   ``The critical economic situation in Africa, the least developed
and most marginalized of all regions, has to be addressed, if
global economic growth and interdependence are to have any meaning
at all,'' Mudenge said.

Pepper spices Solheim Cup with plenty of punch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Europe didn't get the outcome it wanted,
but maybe the Solheim Cup did.
	   The European women had pointed to Muirfield Village as the scene
where the men had turned around their Ryder Cup fortunes in 1987 by
beating the United States on its home soil for the first time.
	   Annika Sorenstam, Laura Davies and Co. didn't take possession of
the Solheim Cup, only a punching bag with Dottie Pepper's name on
it. That still may be enough to give the Solheim the boost it
needs.
	   While Pepper pitched a shutout (4-0) in leading the United
States to a 16-12 victory, the Europeans pitched a fit over
Pepper's raise-the-roof cheering they decried as poor
sportsmanship.
	   Pepper described it as patriotism, and the debate over semantics
could go on until the women take off their gloves two years from
now on the other side of the Atlantic.
	   Whatever the case, the stakes have been raised. Interest will be
even higher at Sunningdale Golf Club in Surrey, England. The
English crowd will be just as vocal. The pride will be even
stronger. The pressure will be even greater.
	   ``This has been a great week, apart from the fact that we
lost,'' Davies said. ``That's the only downside, and it's obviously
a big downside.''
	   The Europeans have won only once since the Solheim Cup began in
1990, at Dalmahoy in 1992 with a Sunday singles blitz. They could
have used that at Muirfield, where they had to win nine of 12
matches to reach 14 1/2 points.
	   Europe won the first four matches to throw a scare into U.S.
captain Judy Rankin. The Americans got back on track behind a
fitting source: Pepper.
	   Pepper, who dyed her hair red for the 1994 matches and painted
her toenails blue this time, is to the United States what Seve
Ballesteros is to Europe.
	   The 34-year-old native New Yorker is the most decorated player
in the brief history of the Solheim Cup _ 12-4-1 in five events,
compared with Davies' 12-6-1 record. She will become known more as
a Solheim star than for her 14 victories and one major
championship.
	   And it wasn't just at Muirfield. Four years ago, Davies took
umbrage at Pepper for blurting out a ``Yes!'' after Davies missed a
crucial putt.
	   That was nothing compared to Saturday, when Juli Inkster lagged
a tricky 45-foot (13 1/2-meter) birdie putt within tap-in range on
the 17th hole while leading 1-up. Pepper put a bear hug on Inskter
to start the celebration _ even though Helen Alfredsson and Marie
Laure de Lorenzi were still much alive.
	   ``That's sad,'' Alfredsson said. ``That's junior stuff.''
	   Asked if she crossed the line between gamesmanship and
sportsmanship, Pepper replied, ``Not once.''
	   Maybe not. Still, she could have taken a cue from Corey Pavin in
the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill. With the final match of Saturday
all square on the 18th, Pavin holed a birdie chip from just off the
green and kept his emotions in check until after Nick Faldo missed
a birdie putt to halve the match.
	   Told about European players taking out their frustration on a
bop bag with Pepper's name on it, the feisty American welcomed it.
	   ``I take it as a compliment,'' she said. ``If that's what it
takes, then I'll be glad to be their punching bag.''
	   If that's not enough, Pepper's explanation of U.S. success in
the Solheim Cup only stirred the pot.
	   ``We played better golf, period,'' she said. ``I think from 1 to
12, we're better players. But I also think we dig down pretty deep.
This team had a huge heart and every time it looked like we were
going to be outplayed, they dug deeper.''
	   The U.S. dominance in the Solheim Cup should not suggest a wide
gap in talent. The best women players in the world are from all
over the world, starting in Europe with Sorenstam and Davies and
stretching to Australia (Karrie Webb) and Asia (Se Ri Pak).
	   For one weekend, the United States holed every putt in sight,
just as Europe did in its surprise victory over the Americans in
the Ryder Cup at Valderrama.
	   ``It's just a matter of luck sometimes whether a putt will drop
in or not,'' Sorenstam said.
	   Even more irritating were suggestions to change the Solheim Cup
so players like Pak and Webb could be included. One such format
would pit North America against the rest of world, an idea that cut
Europe's pride.
	   ``I won't play on an international team, ever,'' Davies said.
``It's an insult to every single one of us.''
	   Asked later about Europe's depth, Davies could hardly contain
herself.
	   ``In a few years time, you'll be asking about the Americans. Are
they good enough. Do they need Canada and Japan?'' she said with a
laugh.
	   Probably not. A punching bag with Davies' name on it might be
enough.

	   Specifically, Chinese ambassador told council members in hastily
called consultations Tuesday that Beijing objected to the citation
in the resolution of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which could
allow for the use of force if regional peace and security is
threatened.
	   China traditionally objects to intervention in what it considers
internal matters.
	   The council was expected to adopt the resolution Wednesday
afternoon, council president Hans Dahlgren said.
	   Fighting in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo has killed
hundreds of people and uprooted over 250,000 since Serb forces
began a crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence of
Kosovo; western nations have called on Milosevic to return the
autonomy he stripped from the province in 1989.
	   British ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the goal of the
resolution was to end the fighting and halt a humanitarian
disaster. Immediate military action was not the objective, he said.
	   ``The objective was to recognize the seriousness of the
humanitarian situation, as a consequence of a very bad political
situation, and to pass a Chapter 7 resolution which made Belgrade
realize that the international community was losing its patience.''
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated Moscow could go along
with the resolution because it wouldn't signal any immediate
action.
	   The resolution, he said, reiterates previous resolutions on
Kosovo and ``also clearly says that any new measures would have to
be subject to a decision by the Security Council.''

Ligament injury may stop Larsson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Magnus Larsson, one of Sweden's
potential singles players in this weekend's Davis Cup semifinal
encounter against Spain, may be ruled out because of injury.
	   Larsson, who made it to the quarterfinals in the U.S. Open last
month, was admitted to a local hospital for a hurting wrist earlier
Tuesday, national news agency TT reported.
	   After a training session Larsson had his injury x-rayed but
there were no reports how serious it was.
	   ``I hurt the wrist when we were playing Germany in the Davis Cup
quarter finals earlier this year and since then I have had
problems,'' Larsson said.
	   ``It may be a ligament problem, but I hope I will be fit in time
for the semifinals, '' Larsson added.
	   If Larsson can't play, Sweden's coach Calle Hageskog has two
other players who also made it to the U. S. Open quarterfinals,
Jonas Bjorkman and rookie Thomas Johansson.
	   Johansson beat Moya in their only encounter last summer 6-7,
6-0, 6-1. He has never played Alex Corretja.

Feyenoord edges PSV to stretch lead to four points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals either side of the half gave
Dutch league leader Feyenoord a 2-1 win at arch-rival PSV Eindhoven
Tuesday and its fifth victory from five games.
	   Feyenoord's 15 points put it four clear of Ajax and FC Utrecht
who are tied for second, while PSV languishes in tenth with seven
points.
	   On 13 minutes, Feyenoord's Peter van Vossen gave away a free
kick wide on the right and when Gilles de Bilde crossed, Andre
Ooijer leaped highest in a crowd of players to head home.
	   But Van Vossen's combative attitude paid off just before the
half when his one-two with Jon Dahl Tomasson broke the PSV defense
wide open and he chipped delicately over keeper Ronald Waterreus.
	   And within two minutes of the restart, Brazilian Tininho's
center gave Argentinian Julio Ricardo Cruz a sharp near-post tap-in
to win the game for the Rotterdammers.
	   It was Cruz's first league game back from a suspension earned at
the end of last season.
	   It should have been 3-1 almost immediately but Tomasson blasted
high and wide of an empty goal after Cruz's pace forced an error
from PSV defender Stan Valckx.
	   Then De Bilde was denied an equalizer when he was adjudged to
have fouled Polish keeper Jurek Dudek before knocking the ball in
from a corner.
	   Feyenoord fell back to defending its own penalty area and Dudek
had to make three agile fingertip saves and a brilliant block from
Ruud van Nistelrooy's free kick to keep PSV out.
	   This traditional grudge match between two of the country's top
three teams produced seven yellow cards, five of them for PSV fouls
on Cruz and Van Vossen.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Residents of a town devastated by
Venezuela's cut in oil production protested Tuesday at the
headquarters of the state oil monopoly.
	   The southeastern town of El Tigre has lost 3,000 jobs in recent
months, said Mayor Miguel Arismendi. Its has about 50,000
residents.
	   Officials at Petroleos de Venezuela said 28 of the 51 drilling
rigs that have been shut down in the country are located in the El
Tigre area.
	   ``We've been cheated,'' Arismendi said. ``We've got thousands of
workers on the street and are in the middle of a huge depression.''
	   Venezuela, one of the top foreign suppliers of oil to the United
States, has cut production by 525,000 barrels a day to try to boost
oil prices that hit a 12-year low in June.
	   The South American country expects to take in several billion
dollars less this year in revenue from oil exports than it did in
1997.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiary of German
pharmaceutical giant Schering AG will be fined 200,000 reals (dlrs
170,000) for faulty packaging of its birth control pills, the
health minister said Tuesday.
	   The health minister did not specify the irregularities, but
Schering has been charged over the last week of releasing packages
of contraceptives containing 20 tablets instead of 21.
	   Jose Serra was quoted by the Estado news agency as saying the
fine would be slapped by the state of Sao Paulo's Health
Department, for ``recent irregularities'' in the production of
Schering products. The health department would not confirm the
fine.
	   A spokesman said the company would not comment on the fine until
it has been officially notified.
	   On June 20, the government banned the sale of Microvlar
contraceptives after placebos test-packaged as birth control pills
reached the market, causing about 20 unwanted pregnancies.
	   The placebos were supposed to have been incinerated after the
packaging tests, but were stolen and sold illegally.
	   Sales resumed Aug. 17 after the company changed Microvlar's
packaging and recalled most of its contraceptives from the market.

Brain's use of oxygen points to stroke risk, study finds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Researchers have come up with a way to predict
which people with totally blocked carotid arteries in the neck are
most likely to suffer strokes.
	   The researchers say the discovery could lead to the revival of a
surgical bypass procedure that was abandoned in the 1980s. They say
it could save lives.
	   A blocked carotid artery isn't always dangerous, but an
estimated 50,000 Americans suffer strokes from such blockages each
year. Up to now, doctors have had no reliable way of predicting
which blockages might lead to strokes, said one of the researchers.
	   But now, an existing method of measuring oxygen use by the brain
appears to offer a means of prediction, the researchers reported in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   Of 81 patients who had a totally blocked carotid artery, those
whose brains extracted a lot of oxygen from the blood were found to
be six times more likely to suffer a stroke within two years than
others.
	   Strokes occurred in 12 of 39 patients with high oxygen use by
the brain, compared with only three of the 42 other patients.
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Robert L. Grubb Jr. of Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, recommended more study
of a bypass technique that was discarded in the mid-1980s after it
failed to improve the overall survival rate of patients with
blocked carotid arteries.
	   The bypass involves drilling a hole in the skull, taking a
branch of the carotid artery and repositioning it so that it routes
blood around the blockage. If limited to such high-risk patients,
the operation might have great benefit, the researchers said.
	   The only treatment now is taking blood thinners. Completely
plugged arteries cannot be opened with carotid endarterectomy, the
procedure now used to clear a partially blocked neck vessel, said a
co-author, Dr. William J. Powers, a professor of neurology at
Washington University.
	   ``When it gets completely obstructed, the material in there to
some extent hardens up. If you were to open up that vessel wall,
there's just this plug in there that extends from the neck all the
way up into the head, and you can't get it out,'' he said.
	   Researchers aren't sure know why higher oxygen extraction is
linked to a greater risk of stroke.
	   Dr. Thomas Brott, chairman of the American Heart Association's
stroke council, praised the study but said it will difficult to do
further research because of the rarity of skills and equipment
necessary.
	   The researchers used an imaging test called Positron Emission
Tomography, or PET scan. Only about 30 states have PET scanners,
Brott said. The capacity to make radioactive oxygen that is
necessary for the test is even more uncommon, Powers said.

Iraq uses ancient site to complain against United Nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BABYLON, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president said Tuesday that his
country would ``never, never, never'' resume cooperation with
international weapons inspectors unless the U.N. Security Council
first reviews Iraqi efforts to disarm.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement as he opened a music
festival in Babylon, where murals and constructions of President
Saddam Hussein now overshadow those of its great builder in
antiquity, the biblical king Nebuchadnezzar.
	   The ancient setting was the backdrop for the current dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations over whether Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, a requirement for the
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
	   Iraq last month cut off cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
to dramatize its contention that it has indeed fulfilled that
obligation. The inspectors have insisted Iraq is still hiding
weapons or the systems to produce more lethal arms.
	   ``Never, never, never!'' Ramadan replied when asked by reporters
whether Iraq will rescind its Aug. 5 decision freezing further U.N.
inspections of the suspected weapons sites.
	   The sanctions include a ban on Iraq's free export of oil, its
most valuable commodity. The Security Council has offered to review
Iraq's progress in eliminating weapons programs, but only after
Saddam's government resumes cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   Iran says the comprehensive review should come first.
	   He said Iraq had no more faith in the U.N. Security Council,
which has become ``an assembly for aggression, arrogance and
despotism.''
	   In his speech inaugurating the festival, Ramadan unleashed a
vitriolic attack at the United States, saying ``this country of
evil has directed all its evil potentials against Iraq.''
	   Organizers said the festival featured 45 troupes from 32
countries, a sign that Iraq was breaking out of the isolation of
the sanctions.
	   The setting reflected Iraq's ancient culture when Nebuchadnezzar
ruled Babylon for 40 years in the 6th century B.C.
	   But the Babylon of today _ as rebuilt by Saddam's government _
is quite different. Murals of Saddam accompany pictures of
Nebuchadnezzar, and bricks inscribed with Saddam's name accompany
those from ancient times that show Nebuchadnezzar's name.

Namibian minister blames `blind ambition' for Congo fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Namibia's foreign minister on Tuesday
blamed the conflict in Congo on ``blind ambition,'' and appealed
for African unity.
	   In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Theo-Ben
Gurirab also called for debt write-offs by the industrialized
nations to help developing countries tread the path to
globalization and market reforms.
	   ``Globalization must be our thing collectively as members of the
human family. When one section of the family prospers, the rest
should be allowed to share in that bonanza,'' Gurirab said.
	   He justified Namibia's involvement in the fighting in Congo,
saying his country sent in troops ``for the sole purpose of
preventing the collapse of the state machinery and the violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity'' of a fellow African
country.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have sent in forces to help
President Laurent Kabila quell an insurgency that he says is aided
by Rwanda and Uganda. The uprising began in July.
	   ``Misguided men driven by blind ambition and appetite for
needless confrontation have plunged the Democratic Republic of the
Congo into a destructive war which has resulted in an inter-African
fighting on a battlefield,'' Gurirab said.
	   Rwanda and Uganda have denied sponsoring the insurgents,
although Uganda says it has troops in Congo under an earlier border
patrol agreement.
	   Speaking shortly before Gurirab, Zimbabwe's foreign minister
also defended his country's intervention in Congo on the same
grounds.
	   ``African unity and cooperation must be based on a genuine
spirit of solidarity and sharing and not on subversion and
disunity,'' Gurirab said.
	   He also called for support for his bid for the presidency of the
General Assembly session in 1999.

Finland wants human rights issue at the forefront of world
</HEADLINE>
attention &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Finland wants human rights issues at the
forefront of the world's attention, the foreign minister said
Tuesday in welcoming China's pledge to protect civil and political
rights.
	   Finland plans to raise awareness of human rights this October by
presenting the first comprehensive report on the human rights
policy of Finland, Tarja Halonen told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``We attach particular importance to the human rights of women,
children minorities and indigenous peoples,'' she said. ``We call
for the universal abolition of (the) death penalty as an inhuman
form of punishment.''
	   Halonen said Finland also welcomed an announcement by China to
sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights.
China has long been accused of human rights abuses. It has the
death penalty and often suppresses free speech by arresting and
imprisoning dissidents.
	   ``We realize that China will still have a laborious process
ahead,'' Halonen said. ``This signature constitutes an important
step in making the U.N. covenants truly universal.''
	   Finland also consistently supports establishing a permanent
international criminal court, she said.
	   ``Finland will continue to be actively involved in the work of
the Preparatory Commission so that the actual establishment of the
criminal court can take place in the nearest future,'' she said.
``I appeal to all nations to sign and ratify the ... statute
speedily.''
	   Halonen said it is important that special provision for the
protection of women and children be included in the definition of
war crimes and crimes against humanity being heard by the Yugoslav
and Rwanda war crimes tribunals.
	   ``The criminal court should keep this in mind in its everyday
work,'' Halonen said. ``As the experience of two ad hoc tribunals
shows special expertise is needed for that purpose.''

Mozambique urges rich nations to cancel debts owed by poor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Mozambique's foreign minister urged the
world's rich nations Tuesday to consider canceling debts owed by
his country and other poor nations so they can concentrate on
eradicating poverty.
	   Leonardo Simao told the U.N. General Assembly that a program by
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to provide debt
relief for a number of heavily indebted African nations including
Mozambique was ``a significant step'' _ but is not a solution to
the debt problem.
	   ``We would therefore encourage the creditor and donor
communities to continue to review and consider new relief measures
including the cancellation of official bilateral debt, in order to
ensure that the affected countries can redirect their meager
resources to social programs,'' he said.
	   Mozambique, a former Portugese colony, ended a 16-year civil war
in 1992 and held its first democratic national elections in 1994.
It is one of Africa's poorest countries despite natural gas
reserves, rich mineral deposits and ports that serve landlocked
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Swaziland.
	   Even though Mozambique has strengthened democracy and embarked
on economic reforms that led to a 16 percent economic growth rate
last year, Simao said the country still faces ``acute problems
whose solution is vital if the country is to maintain the needed
stability.''
	   ``The most critical of these, without a doubt, is the debt
burden which continues to be the single most significant impediment
to national development,'' he said.
	   Simao said land mines continue to disrupt the existence of
countries and peoples _ including Mozambicans.
	   This month, the United Nations announced that a treaty aimed at
eliminating anti-personnel landmines will take effect March 1, 1999
following ratification by 40 countries, including Mozambique.
	   Simao told the General Assembly that Mozambique has offered to
host a meeting of signatories to the convention next year in Maputo
focusing on international cooperation and assistance to eliminate
millions of mines around the world.
	   Mozambique is also concerned about regional conflicts in Africa
including in the Congo and Angola, he said.
	   ``Africa and the international community cannot afford to add a
new chapter of conflicts of regional proportions, especially taking
into account that virtually all other long lasting conflicts in
this continent to defy our collective imagination,'' Simao said.

Before Pearl Harbor, Japanese-American leagues thrived

<TEXT>
	   HOOD RIVER, Oregon (AP) _ They took the field with such names as
the Los Angeles Nippons, Seattle Asahis and Portland Mikados.
	   In the 1920s, '30s and early '40s, Japanese-American amateur and
semipro leagues thrived, producing a handful of players who seemed
poised to make it to the top and change the face of American Major
League Baseball.
	   Until the bombing of Pearl Harbor, that is.
	   Almost overnight, these teams vanished as their
Japanese-American players were interned in camps as enemies or
drafted into the Army to prove their patriotism.
	   Now, like stars of the former Negro leagues, Japanese-American
players have only the tattered newspaper clippings and old photos
to remind them of the days when even rural teams could draw 3,000
fans a game.
	   Pulling out a neatly pressed wool jersey embroidered with the
words ``Hood River Nisei,'' 77-year-old Kay Kiyokawa recalled his
first trip to the mound.
	   ``The starter couldn't get the ball over, so they inserted me as
relief and ever since then I was the starting pitcher,'' he said,
proudly raising the uniform with arms that still appeared as strong
as tree trunks.
	   Memories of these teams and their players are being revived in a
traveling exhibit, ``Diamonds in the Rough: Japanese-Americans in
Baseball,'' which made a stop at the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, New York and is currently showing for three months in
Portland.
	   Exhibit organizer Kerry Nakagawa said he came up with the idea
while watching his young son play baseball in Fresno, California.
	   ``I realized the fourth generation had no clue of the pioneering
efforts and sacrifice their grandparents brought to the game. It is
a hidden chapter in American history,'' he said.
	   Early Japanese immigrants were no strangers to baseball. They
brought a love for the game with them from Japan, where American
schoolteacher Horace Wilson introduced the game in 1872.
	   But their sons and daughters, the second generation _ or Nisei _
are the ones who played ball while their parents worked hard to
make ends meet. And in an era when Japanese-Americans were often
treated as second-class citizens, segregated teams were the rule.
	   ``When I would play Caucasian teams, they'd always have remarks
about 'Jap,''' said 79-year-old John Murakami, who played for the
Portland Mikados from 1936 to 1941. ``And I tried to explain that
I'm American, and they'd say, 'Oh no, you're a Jap.'''
	   He said scouts told him: ``'You might as well forget it. Your
people are never going to play professional baseball,''' he said.
``That really took the wind out of my sails.''
	   But baseball was a craze among the Japanese-Americans that was
hard to kill.
	   ``They played baseball not to prove how American they were but
to prove how competitive they were at the game and that they could
compete at the highest level,'' Nakagawa said.
	   And that they did.
	   On a 1927 tour of Japan to play 50 games against Japanese
opponents, a Nisei team from Fresno and the Negro leagues'
powerhouse Philadelphia Royal Giants both went undefeated.
	   But when they met in Tokyo to play each other at the end of the
tour, the Fresno Athletic Club pummeled the Royal Giants 9-2.
	   And six years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in
1947 by being the first black to play in the majors, Henry Honda _
a Nisei from San Jose _ was signed with the Cleveland Indians.
	   He was all set to pitch his first game and go down in history,
when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.
	   ``The war completely made it all come to a screeching halt,''
Nakagawa said.
	   But even in internment camps, baseball played a critical role.
	   Ray Shiiki and his family were rounded up from their Gresham
farm and herded off to the Minidoka camp in the badlands of Idaho.
He credited baseball with helping him survive life behind barbed
wire.
	   Playing infield on the camp team enabled him to stretch his legs
and leave camp to play ball against white teams in the surrounding
area. The 71-year-old Shiiki said it was an invaluable way to boost
morale.
	   Other camps had well-developed leagues. At the Gila River Camp
in Butte, Arizona, 32 teams played year-round. Women tore up
mattress ticking to make uniforms and used flour instead of chalk
to mark the batters' box.
	   After the war, those Japanese-Americans found themselves too
busy rebuilding their lives to play games.
	   ``We left everything on the farm, cars, trucks, the tractor. But
it was all gone when we returned,'' Shiiki said.
	   Nakagawa said a love of baseball is the forgotten legacy of
Japanese-Americans.
	   ``When people think Nisei, they think an earth person, a farmer
or a fisherman,'' he said. ``What I hope is that in the future,
they will also think great baseball player.''

Holyfield admits fathering children out of wedlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ One week after his second wife gave birth to
their first child, Evander Holyfield admitted that he has fathered
two children out of wedlock in the past year.
	   Holyfield, the IBF and WBA heavyweight champion, now has nine
children _ the newborn Elijah Jedidiah to his wife, Janice; three
with his first wife, Paulette, from whom he has been divorced since
1991; and five others born out of wedlock to four women.
	   Holyfield made the admission in an interview published in
Tuesday's editions of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
	   Holyfield, who beat Vaughn Bean in a 12-round decision Saturday
night at the Georgia Dome, described his wife as ``my best
friend,'' but admitted he regretted getting married almost
immediately after they met in October 1996.
	   The couple has been in and out of counseling since then, he
said, but he declined to address the future of his marriage.
	   Two boys, Eleazar and Elijah Elias, were born 11 months and 10
months ago. When the women became pregnant, Holyfield said he was
angry about the state of his marriage and admitted, ``I started
going back to my old habits.''
	   He said he told his wife of his infidelity and the impending
births and suggested they get divorced, but she declined and the
two continued to attend counseling.

Belgian minister says world needs `new moral compass'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Belgium's foreign minister said Tuesday
that countries around the world should adopt a ``new moral
compass'' in which economic and financial forces do not dictate
behavior.
	   Calling for a ban on anti-personnel mines and regulation over
the transfer of small arms, Erik Derycke told the United Nations
General Assembly that arriving at such a world was impossible
without efforts by all countries.
	   ``Even for a good or just cause no government will easily
restrict itself if that government is the only one to pay the price
of its actions,'' he said.
	   ``We need to seek a new moral compass, based on two pillars,
namely international solidarity and social justice.''
	   He warned that globalization threatened to de-humanize the
individual.
	   ``The logic of the market place has grasped man in such a way
that he risks being relegated to a secondary role in the
international system,'' said Derycke.
	   He said Belgium was committed to prohibition on land mines and
control over small arms. He noted that his country was hosting a
conference on small arms next month.
	   He also called for reform at the United Nations, and against the
veto power of Security Council members.
	   ``The right to veto is an exaggerated privilege if and when it
is used against the interests of the larger international
community,'' Derycke said.

Germany threatens force, EU urges Milosevic halt all repression in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council to approve Kosovo resolution Wednesday &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
received a stern warning Tuesday to loosen his grip on the
separatist province of Kosovo or face military action by NATO.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Austrian foreign
minister Wolfgang Schussel _ speaking before the General Assembly's
annual debate _ both condemned the fighting that has killed
hundreds of people and uprooted a quarter of a million ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern province.
	   ``Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with Belgrade,
with President Milosevic,'' Kinkel said. ``He must realize that the
international community will react with military force if
necessary.''
	   The Security Council was expected to adopt a British-and
French-sponsored resolution Wednesday demanding a cease-fire in
Kosovo and threatening further measures if the hostilities don't
stop.
	   A draft of the resolution doesn't directly authorize NATO
intervention, but council members called it a first step towards
further action.
	   Russia, which as a permanent council member has the right to
veto resolutions, has said it opposed any threat or use of force.
	   But Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated Moscow could go
along with the resolution because it would require additional
council approval for military intervention.
	   Permanent council member China opposed the threat of further
action, and a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he anticipated China would abstain from the vote.
	   Schussel demanded Milosevic withdraw Serb and Yugoslav forces
from the province.
	   ``Their police and military operations have led to consequences
for the civilian population that are out of any justifiable
proportion,'' Schussel said, speaking on behalf of the European
Union.
	   He called for negotiations between the two sides as soon as
possible to ``define a new status for Kosovo.''
	   Serb forces in February began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists who are fighting for independence for the province.
Western nations support returning autonomy for Kosovo which
Milosevic withdrew in 1989.
	   Britain and France last week began drafting a resolution that
would threaten Milosevic with force if he doesn't stop the
offensive and the humanitarian catastrophe that is in the making
with winter setting in the hills of Kosovo.
	   Russian foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned in his speech
Tuesday that using force ``might lead to a big war with
unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and Europe at
large.''
	   ``It is our firm belief that a political solution is the only
possible way of settling the problem of Kosovo, with broad autonomy
granted to it and ensuring strict respect for the territorial
integrity of the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia),'' he said.
	   Kinkel told reporters, however, that for the first time he
expected Russia to support a resolution, which a German official
said will describe Milosevic's position as affecting and
endangering regional stability.
	   That language is the only ground that the council has used in
the past for military intervention in an internal conflict.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed,''
Kinkel said, calling the change ``a big step forward.''
	   In Ivanov's speech, his first on the international stage since
being appointed, the Russian foreign minister pledged that his
economically battered country will not deviate from the path of
reforms.
	   Russia's economic crisis, which started last month and has seen
the value of the ruble plummet, led to a government shakeup which
put Ivanov's predecessor, Yevgeny Primakov, into the prime
minister's job.
	   ``Russia will not deviate from the path of reforms and will do
its best to pass with dignity this highly critical test so as not
to preserve the accumulated democratic gains but also to score new
ones,'' Ivanov said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks swung widely and closed lower
Tuesday as anxiety about third-quarter earnings mounted, but
broad-market indexes held their own. The Dow Jones industrial
dropped 36.05 points _ or by 0.4 percent _ at 7,897.20. The
blue-chip index rose 53 points in early trading, retreated to minus
77 points, rallied a second time and then dropped back again.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices rallied Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange, recouping some of their recent steep losses despite
continued concerns about world economic troubles. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 113.0 points, or 2.3
percent, to close at 5,103.3. Shares had climbed slightly higher in
the session but slipped off their peak after the Dow Jones
industrial average moved into negative territory in early New York
dealings. Volume came to 970.6 million shares, compared to 721.3
million in Monday's session. (BRITISH-STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With just a month left to go in fiscal 1998,
the first federal budget surplus in 29 years looks virtually
assured. The Treasury Department reported Tuesday a deficit of dlrs
11.2 billion in August, down 68 percent from a year ago. That put
the surplus for the first 11 months of the budget year at dlrs 31.8
billion. With quarterly tax payments flowing into federal coffers
in September, the surplus for the full year should easily double
that amount and surpass the latest government projections. The
September surplus last year was dlrs 49.9 billion. (US-BUDGET
SURPLUS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg on Tuesday warned that the international financial
turmoil may dampen growth in Europe, but he rejected calls for
globally coordinated interest rate cuts. ``There is no room for, or
need for coordinated cuts in interest rates,'' Duisenberg told the
monetary affairs subcommittee of the European Parliament. He added
that interest rates in Europe's core economies such as France and
Germany were already ``significantly'' lower than in the United
States. However, Duisenberg stressed that preparations for the
launch of the European single currency on Jan. 1 meant Spain,
Italy, Ireland and Portugal needed to start lowering rates over the
next 100 days to bring them into line with the other nations that
adopt the euro. (EUROPEAN-CENTRAL BANK)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Gross domestic product in the 15-nation
European Union grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
slowing from a first-quarter pace of 0.6 percent, the EU's
statistical office Eurostat announced Tuesday. The GDP in the 11
countries taking part in the launching of the single currency, the
euro on Jan. 1, grew by 0.1 percent over the same period, according
to Eurostat's first estimates. No figures were given for individual
EU countries. Compared with the same period last year, GDP in the
15 EU countries was 2 percent higher in the second quarter of 1998,
Eurostat said. For the same period, U.S growth was 3.6 percent.
(EU-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economy is shrinking and imports are
down. Inflation is climbing and so is unemployment. With each day,
new statistics are showing the depth of the country's economic
crisis. The State Customs Committee delivered the latest piece of
bad news Tuesday, reporting that imports plummeted 19 percent in
August compared with a year ago. With the national currency, the
ruble, rapidly losing value, the price of many imports has doubled
since the crisis erupted Aug. 17. A day before, the State
Statistics Committee reported that the country's economy shrank 2.1
percent during the first eight months of the year _ which was
before the worst of the current crisis hit. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Invited in by Lesotho's beleaguered
government, South African forces encountered unexpected resistance
Tuesday from the kingdom's rebellious troops. At least 10 soldiers
and five civilians died in heavy fighting in South Africa's first
military incursion since all-race elections in 1994. Furious
gunfire and artillery rounds forced 20 armored South African
vehicles equipped with cannons to retreat and scuttle an attempt to
reinforce troops at a barracks near the capital's airport, where a
day-long firefight raged. About 600 South African soldiers,
personnel carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units rumbled
across the border at dawn Tuesday after the government had asked
regional countries to send military help. The action follows weeks
of opposition party demonstrations over allegations of
election-rigging in May, as well as an army rebellion that had
effectively paralyzed the government. (LESOTHO)
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ After plowing through
the northern Caribbean, Hurricane Georges carved into the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday, uprooting trees and churning the sea as
Dominicans and tourists alike fled to shelter. The mammoth storm
was on a trajectory that could send it crashing into the Florida
Keys by late Thursday or early Friday. The storm caught the
Dominican capital of Santo Domingo almost entirely unprepared
Tuesday. Forecasters had expected it to hit only the northern
coast, but Georges, which killed at least 10 people in its furious
march across the Caribbean, changed course and headed straight for
the tropical capital of 3 million people. In neighboring Haiti,
which shares the island of Hispaniola, people prepared to battle
the hurricane. Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Dominican
Republic to eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. The U.S.
National Weather Service said a hurricane watch may be needed for
the northwest Bahamas and South Florida. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela vowed
Tuesday to stand by President Bill Clinton in the wake of his
affair with a White House intern. Mandela said no other American
president has identified himself more with the aspirations of
blacks. ``He has my full support in everything that he (does),''
said Mandela at a luncheon at the South African embassy prompting
applause. ``I will support my friends even if they have been
deserted by the entire group.'' Mandela also said it is a ``grave
injustice'' for Western countries to judge South Africa by their
own standards because his people have not had the same
opportunities. ``We have parents who have never seen the inside of
a school, who cannot write their names,'' said Mandela. In his
speech Mandela made no reference to the latest developments in
Lesotho, where South African troops were trying to quell weeks of
anarchy. (US-MANDELA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Germany threatened Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic with military force Tuesday if he doesn't loosen
his grip on the separatist province of Kosovo, saying NATO was
prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis. In a speech to
world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned the use of force by
Milosevic's forces and by the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is
fighting for the independence of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
make up the vast majority of the population. Russia, however, has
opposed threats of force since that ``might lead to a big war with
unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and Europe at
large,'' said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. He called for
returning Kosovo's autonomy, which was removed by Milosevic in
1989, while respecting Yugoslavia's borders. (UN-GENERAL ASSEMBLY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Tuesday he
understood that the government of new Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi can only do what is ``politically possible'' to deal with a
spreading global economic crisis. The two leaders, in New York for
opening sessions of the U.N. General Assembly, candidly reviewed
the current global crisis and Japan's efforts to jump-start its
ailing economy and handle a serious banking crisis. Clinton invited
Obuchi to visit the United States early next year and Obuchi
accepted. In recent weeks, U.S. officials have urged Japan to be
more aggressive in dealing with the worst recession in 50 years to
help lift its troubled Asian neighbors out of their own steep
declines. Obuchi's latest setback is the apparent unraveling of
last week's compromise to deal with billions of dollars in bad bank
debt. Asked about those developments, Obuchi stressed he knew
Japan's handling of its economic problems ``have very large
implications worldwide. ... I am convinced that we will be able to
respond.'' (US-JAPAN)

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Rich, small and smart, Singapore seems an ideal
place for experiments in pioneering technology.
	   But the world's first project to wire an entire nation has
gotten off to a disappointing start. People's cyber needs have
turned out humbler than expected.
	   The government announced plans in 1996 to link every household,
school and office in the city-state to an ultra-fast network
offering information, shopping, entertainment and Internet access.
	   The project received support from some big, high-tech companies,
including investments by Microsoft and Motorola.
	   More than a year into Singapore One _ for ``One Network for
Everyone'' _ the government has spent 150 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 86 million) for the fiber-optic network around the island.
Multinational technology and information companies and local banks
have invested an additional 200 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 114
million).
	   High-speed access to Singapore One is now available to 90
percent of the city's 3.1 million people, either via a special
telephone link or through a line provided by Singapore's cable
television operator.
	   Almost all the services on Singapore One are also available via
regular Internet servers. But the network offers a speedy, reliable
connection and lots of snazzy multimedia that is impossible to
enjoy with a much slower conventional telephone line through a
computer modem.
	   ``The key selling point is the speed and the multimedia
dimension,'' said Tay Lay Kheng of the government-run National
Computer Board. ``Internet is still largely text-based. And on
Singapore One, you can do a virtual walk through the apartment you
want to buy or rent.''
	   A Singapore One user can also call up a ``movie on demand'' from
the network's budding video library and watch it on a personal
computer.
	   The project seemed bound for success in Singapore, where
computer use starts in kindergarten, 41 percent of the people own
PCs and the government encourages the use of information technology
across all segments of society.
	   People already were being urged to use the Internet for
everything from matchmaking and filing lawsuits to ordering taxis
and submitting tax forms. The elderly, blue-collar workers and
others who missed computer courses in their formative years are
visited by a ``cyber bus'' equipped with PCs and instructors.
	   But only 30,000 Singaporeans _ just 1 percent of the population
_ use Singapore One, Tay said. Even fewer actually subscribe to the
service.
	   Singapore One is all wired up, but it has nowhere to go, said
Raymond Chia, a 33-year-old manager.
	   ``You can visit government Web sites and find out what plays in
movie theaters, but otherwise there's not much else to do'' that's
not on the Internet, he said.
	   Most people still mainly use cyber networks to communicate with
each other, Tay said. For that purpose, the regular Internet is
cheaper.
	   There are about 400,000 regular Internet users in Singapore, and
their average monthly bill is about 25 Singapore dollars (dlrs 14),
one-third less than a Singapore One subsidized rate of 35 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 20).
	   As for electronic shopping, a recent survey found that only 6
percent of Internet users in Singapore actually buy something
on-line. Of those who try, some discover unforeseen complications.
	   ``Almost every time I order groceries from Cold Storage
(Singapore's main grocery chain), they call me back and ask if they
can substitute a strawberry yogurt with some other flavor,'' one
woman said. ``It drives me nuts.''
	   Despite Singapore One's low use, the government remains
committed to making the island one of the world's cyber hubs.
	   Its 1997 Information Technology Master Plan called for spending
5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 2.9 billion) over the next 5
years to boost the cyber culture.
	   Perhaps optimistically, the government expects half of all
Singaporeans to be wired into Singapore One by 2001, either through
PCs, public kiosks or special network computers connected to TV
screens.
	   ``Everything that exists in the physical world is being
replicated in some form in cyberspace,'' George Yeo, minister for
information and the arts, recently told Singaporeans.
	   He said the government needed the public's help in turning
Singapore into a cyber haven.
	   ``What we have to build up is a total environment which is
supportive of electronic commerce,'' he said.

Brazil's national team faces Yugoslavia in first game with new
</HEADLINE>
coach

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's national team will meet
Yugoslavia Wednesday in an exhibition match, their first game since
losing the World Cup finals in France.
	   The game, which will be played at the Castelao stadium in Sao
Luis 1,399 miles (2,257 kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro, will be
the first under the command of new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo.
	   For Wednesday's game Cafu, Rivaldo and Denilson will be the only
World Cup veterans, while Vampeta, Felipe and Andre will be playing
for the national team for the first time.
	   The World Cup team captain Dunga is absent and, so far,
Luxemburgo has not named anybody to fill the spot, relying only on
his side-line coaching to drive the team.
	   But Luxemburgo told reporters that his lineup is far from final
and that he plans to experiment with different players to develop a
team that can represent Brazil in the first official games.
	   The Yugoslav team has six players from their World Cup team and
promises to be a formidable opponent for this embryonic Brazilian
team.
	   Probable lineups:
	   Brazil: Andre, Cafu, Antonio Carlos, Kleber, Felipe, Vampeta,
Marcos Assuncao, Marcelinho Carioca and Rivaldo.
	   Yugoslavia: Kralj, Salkic, Djukic, Matjasevic, Nadj, Jokanovic,
Stankovic, Grozdic, Kovacevic, Petkovic and Mijatovic.

Honduran general says some officers oppose pending military
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The head of Honduras' military
forces charged Tuesday that young officers are plotting ways to
resist the government's plans to do away with military autonomy,
which has been in place for 41 years.
	   Under the proposed changes, army officers would lose their
immunity from arrest and would be subject to civilian courts,
rather than the military tribunals which currently try any cases
involving soldiers.
	   ``The military has lost its discipline and hierarchy,'' Gen.
Mario Hung Pacheco said. ``And there is a power struggle ...
(among) officers in which I'm accused of defeatism for not opposing
the changes the government has begun.''
	   The discontent among the officers _ who oppose Hung's leadership
and plans to switch control of the armed forces to a cabinet
position _ has apparently resulted in little but angry talk so far.
	   However, five predecessors of Hung _ Honduras' 12th military
chief since 1962 _ were violently deposed by their own forces.
	   Lawmakers voted Saturday in favor of a bill to abolish the armed
forces' autonomy and constitutional immunity.
	   Hung is to end his three-year term in January, when the military
comes under civilian authority. Some officers, however, wish to
succeed Hung in the post, he said, and oppose ``the modernization
of the armed institution, which is best for our society.''
	   Hung stressed, however, that he remains in control of the naval
and air bases.
	   ``There are no problems in any military unit, whose chiefs obey
my orders. ... And there is tranquility in all of the barracks.''
	   ``I will not give in to the pressures of ambitious officers, who
have organized in cells to achieve their goal ... And if they look
for war, full war they will have,'' he said.
	   Hung identified Col. Efrain Gutierrez Ardon, chief of the Office
of Military Doctrine, as leader of the rebel movement.
	   Gutierrez Ardon, according to the military chief, confronted him
in heated debates during meetings in August and on Sept. 16. The
arguments led Hung to urge President Carlos Flores Facusse last
week to speed the military changes.
	   Hung said he will meet with military leaders Friday to analyze
the problem.
	   The Honduran military was granted autonomy by liberal President
Ramon Villeda Morales in 1957 and six years later toppled him. It
governed the Central American country for nearly two decades until
1981.
	   Hung said the rebel officers have accused him of stealing dlrs
800,000 from military businesses and donating another dlrs 500,000
to the presidential candidate of the opposition National Party,
Nora Gunera, widow of a former armed forces chief, Gen. Juan
Alberto Melgar.
	   Military businesses include radio stations, banks, a cement
factory, insurance companies, funeral homes and rental buildings.

Howard's tax plan in trouble as his own allies begin defecting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
re-election campaign ran into trouble Wednesday as some of his
rural conservative allies said his main proposal -- a 10 percent
goods and services tax -- would be unfair.
	   Some members of the rural National Party, the junior partner in
Howard's conservative governing coalition, said a 10 percent tax on
food would hurt the poor more than the well-off.
	   They also fear the new tax will boost gasoline, diesel fuel and
telephone costs in the rural outback among their constituents.
	   The campaign is down to its final phase in the lead-up to the
Oct. 3 general election.
	   The National Party leader, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer,
maintained his full support Wednesday for the 10 percent tax
package, saying he did not regret that it is proving increasingly
unpopular in opinion polls.
	   A poll last Thursday showed voters are turning against the tax,
with disapproval for tax reform up 10 percent in a week, to 52
percent.
	   ``It is a total package which delivers real gains for country
Australia and exporters. It tilts the unlevel playing field in
favor of our exporters,'' Fischer told Channel Nine TV.
	   But there is a rebellion in the ranks of Queensland National
Party members of Parliament, with Bob Katter calling for food to be
exempt and Paul Marek asking Howard to exclude fresh fruit and
vegetables.
	   Katter has warned that the tax plan could cost the conservatives
the election and renewed his attack on it Wednesday:
	   ``There is no more basic necessity of life than food and that is
where my problem comes from, always in this particular area,''
Katter said.
	   ``I will not resile from the position that I have always taken,
that I have enormous difficulty with taxing food,'' he said.
	   In the 1993 election, the conservatives sought a 15 percent
goods and services tax, but in the last weeks of the campaign began
exempting various items as Labor raised fears that the tax would
boost prices. The conservatives soundly lost what had been billed
as an ``unloseable'' election for them.
	   This time, Kim Beazley's Labor Party needs to win an additional
27 seats to win government, a feat no Australian opposition party
has ever achieved.
	   Most polls have shown Labor just slightly ahead of the
conservatives, not a big enough lead to capture government.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Newspaper: Oil chiefs to meet for world summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heads of some of the world's biggest oil companies
plan to meet in Europe next week to discuss the slump in crude
prices and the growing global economic uncertainty, the Financial
Times reported Wednesday.
	   The summit of about 20 companies is thought to be the first time
in recent years that oil industry chief executives have assembled
informally for talks on the future of the sector, the newspaper
said.
	   The Financial Times report did not specify where in Europe the
talks would be held, but said that, according to an unnamed
organizer of the event, a senior U.S. energy lawyer has been
invited to the summit to head off any suspicion that the oil giants
intend to carve up markets or engage in price-fixing.
	   The high-level talks follow British Petroleum's announcement
last month that it is to take over U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp in a
30.3 billion pound (dlrs 53.9 billion) deal that is the biggest
industrial merger in U.S. history. The proposed marriage is
currently being scrutinized by the U.S. government for its
implications for competition in the marketplace.
	   Companies expected to participate in next week's summit include
some of the biggest publicly quoted western oil groups, including
Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Total and Eni, the
Financial Times said.
	   Several of the largest state oil and gas groups, such as Saudi
Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, and Statoil
of Norway, also plan to take part, along with the chief executives
of several leading independent oil companies, the newspaper added.
	   Russia will be represented by Gazprom, the country's biggest
company and its largest single source of hard currency, the
newspaper said.
	   The Financial Times quoted an unnamed senior European oil
industry executive as predicting that more big deals could result
from the gathering.
	   ``Everybody is on the prowl,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a gloomy assessment
of the oil business last week, predicting depressed oil prices
won't recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the
ripple effects of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Crude oil prices have plunged this year to levels unseen in a
decade.
	   The collapse started in the winter, when OPEC started pumping
more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis began
choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.
	   Besides discussing crude prices and the global economy, the oil
industry chiefs are expected to debate a wide range of other
issues, including growing environmental pressures and the impact of
new technology, such as fuel cells, the Financial Times reported.
	   They will also discuss the risks that companies face as they
invest in areas that could turn into trouble spots, such as the
Middle East and Central Asia, the newspaper added.

Italian fugitive wanted for kidnapping held in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Italian criminal who severed the
ears of a kidnapped businessman to emphasize his ransom demand has
been apprehended in Australia and was due to appear in court
Wednesday.
	   Giovanni Farina was picked up in a random search at Sydney
Airport on Aug. 15. Customs officers opened his carry-on bag and
found 138,000 Australian dollars worth of U.S. and Swiss currency
after he arrive on a flight from Zurich.
	   He was carrying a false passport in the name of Luigi Valiante,
and was only identified by Italian police on Tuesday.
	   He had appeared in court Aug. 25, when his true identity was
still unknown, on a charge of failing to declare his excessive
amount of currency.
	   Farina made a run from the courtroom at the end of the hearing
but ran into a freshly cleaned plate glass door, injuring his nose.
He also was charged with assault for allegedly punching a police
office.
	   Australian Federal Police say he has been charged in Italy with
kidnapping Guiseppe Soffiantini, who was released after eight
months after a multi-million dollar ransom was paid.
	   Soffiantini's ears were severed and sent to a TV station to
emphasize Farina's ruthlessness.

27 seats to win government, a feat no Australian opposition party
has ever achieved.
	   Most polls have shown Labor just slightly ahead of the
conservatives, not a big enough lead to capture government.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Italian fugitive wanted for kidnapping held in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Italian criminal who severed the
ears of a kidnapped businessman to emphasize his ransom demand has
been apprehended in Australia and was due to appear in court
Wednesday.
	   Giovanni Farina was picked up in a random search at Sydney
Airport on Aug. 15. Customs officers opened his carry-on bag and
found 138,000 Australian dollars worth of U.S. and Swiss currency
after he arrive on a flight from Zurich.
	   He was carrying a false passport in the name of Luigi Valiante,
and was only identified by Italian police on Tuesday.
	   He had appeared in court Aug. 25, when his true identity was
still unknown, on a charge of failing to declare his excessive
amount of currency.
	   Farina made a dash from the courtroom at the end of the hearing
but ran into a freshly cleaned plate glass door, injuring his nose.
He also was charged with assault for allegedly punching a police
office.
	   Australian Federal Police say he has been charged in Italy with
kidnapping Guiseppe Soffiantini, who was released after eight
months after a multi-million dollar ransom was paid.
	   Soffiantini's ears were severed and sent to a TV station to
emphasize Farina's ruthlessness.

Newspaper: Oil chiefs to meet for world summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX CODING

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heads of some of the world's biggest oil companies
plan to meet in Europe next week to discuss the slump in crude
prices and the growing global economic uncertainty, the Financial
Times reported Wednesday.
	   The summit of about 20 companies is thought to be the first time
in recent years that oil industry chief executives have assembled
informally for talks on the future of the sector, the newspaper
said.
	   The Financial Times report did not specify where in Europe the
talks would be held, but said that, according to an unnamed
organizer of the event, a senior U.S. energy lawyer has been
invited to the summit to head off any suspicion that the oil giants
intend to carve up markets or engage in price-fixing.
	   The high-level talks follow British Petroleum's announcement
last month that it is to take over U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp in a
30.3 billion pound (dlrs 53.9 billion) deal that is the biggest
industrial merger in U.S. history. The proposed marriage is
currently being scrutinized by the U.S. government for its
implications for competition in the marketplace.
	   Companies expected to participate in next week's summit include
some of the biggest publicly quoted western oil groups, including
Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Total and Eni, the
Financial Times said.
	   Several of the largest state oil and gas groups, such as Saudi
Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, and Statoil
of Norway, also plan to take part, along with the chief executives
of several leading independent oil companies, the newspaper added.
	   Russia will be represented by Gazprom, the country's biggest
company and its largest single source of hard currency, the
newspaper said.
	   The Financial Times quoted an unnamed senior European oil
industry executive as predicting that more big deals could result
from the gathering.
	   ``Everybody is on the prowl,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a gloomy assessment
of the oil business last week, predicting depressed oil prices
won't recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the
ripple effects of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Crude oil prices have plunged this year to levels unseen in a
decade.
	   The collapse started in the winter, when OPEC started pumping
more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis began
choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.
	   Besides discussing crude prices and the global economy, the oil
industry chiefs are expected to debate a wide range of other
issues, including growing environmental pressures and the impact of
new technology, such as fuel cells, the Financial Times reported.
	   They will also discuss the risks that companies face as they
invest in areas that could turn into trouble spots, such as the
Middle East and Central Asia, the newspaper added.

Monrovia bounces back from battles but some fear the worst

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Dozens of people died in a two-day
spasm of gunbattles, a former Liberian warlord took refuge in the
U.S. Embassy, and neighborhoods were rocked by machine-gun and
rocket fire.
	   But just days after the shooting died down, much appeared normal
Tuesday in this disarmingly relaxed seaside town.
	   Stores reopened, people were going back to work. Platoons of
soldiers, who earlier had been patrolling the streets with tanks,
headed to their barracks.
	   Beneath the seeming normalcy, though, some people are nervous,
recalling Liberia's civil war, which ended two years ago after
150,000 were killed and half the country's population became
refugees.
	   ``We're praying to God because we don't know what will happen
next,'' said Leon Kweru, standing beside an abandoned building,
across from the embattled U.S. Embassy. ``I'm really afraid.''
	   The weekend flareup began Friday night, when hundreds of
government soldiers rushed the home of President Charles Taylor's
chief rival, former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, apparently to arrest
him for treason. A fierce battle erupted, and bullets, rockets and
mortars jolted parts of the capital. At least 47 people were
killed.
	   Johnson turned up at the U.S. Embassy on Saturday, and diplomats
_ who had no wish to harbor him _ tried to get the former warlord
safely away. But as Johnson talked to embassy officials outside the
gate, Liberian forces drove up and opened fire.
	   Four of Johnson's men were killed, and two Americans were
wounded in the gunfire. They all rushed into the compound, and have
been there since.
	   It is unclear what will happen to Johnson, though U.S. officials
have said he will not be handed over the government.
	   Taylor has promised that the embassy won't come under attack,
but the sprawling seaside compound is prepared for the worst.
Nonessential staff have been evacuated, extra servicemen have been
flown in by helicopter and most diplomats don't move without a flak
jacket and helmet.
	   A demonstration in front of the embassy is planned for Wednesday
to demand Johnson be handed over, further raising the tensions.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African peacekeepers trying to back
up the beleaguered government of its tiny neighbor Lesotho found
unexpected resistance and lost at least ten soldiers in the
government's first military intervention since the end of
apartheid.
	   A day of combat Tuesday left up to 20 people dead and South
Africa had failed to achieve its objectives for the day, combined
task force spokesman Major Ben van Zyl said.
	   South Africa's SABC television reported late Tuesday that backup
troops were headed to Lesotho from a base in Bloemfontein.
	   Since white rule ended in 1994, the South African military has
merged former apartheid military forces with the armed wing of the
anti-apartheid movement. The new army had never been in this kind
of combat before, Van Zyl said.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom with a population of 2 million
people, is surrounded by South African territory and is largely
dependent on South Africa for jobs and income.
	   After a revolt two weeks ago by junior military officers, some
of the ousted military leaders fled the country. The military
appears to be siding with an opposition movement that claims May
elections swept by the ruling Lesotho Congress Party were rigged.
	   At dawn Tuesday, 600 South African troops, along with armored
personnel carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units rumbled
into Lesotho after the government asked neighbors to help it deal
with a growing state of anarchy.
	   A senior South African officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the force lacked enough troops and proper equipment
to handle the stiff resistance. As artillery rounds lit up the
night sky, the officer told The Associated Press that his
government did not expect Lesotho's rebels to be so hostile.
	   In their first military operation since the end of apartheid in
1994, at least 10 South African soldiers died in a fire fight
outside Makoanyne barracks northeast of the city, the officer said.
	   For the past month, officials from the Southern African
Development Community have been trying to mediate as opposition
strikes paralyzed the capital of Maseru.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili asked for the military help.
Botswana also sent 200 troops late Tuesday.
	   During the intervention, angry crowds stoned cars and set
government buildings and shopping centers afire. Shooting and
looting continued into the night in Maseru, with no soldiers or
police in sight, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Military officials in Pretoria reported that five soldiers were
killed in sometimes fierce fighting and sniper fire throughout the
chaotic capital.
	   It was not immediately clear whether some of those casualties
occurred at the barracks.
	   Five Lesotho citizens were also reported killed, although it was
not clear if they were civilians or members of the rebel military
force.
	   SABC television news reported an unconfirmed death toll of up to
30 people.
	   Under President Nelson Mandela, South Africa has promoted
nonintervention throughout Africa.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho unleashed biting
criticism from South African opposition parties, churches and
civilian groups.
	   But Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was acting
head of state while President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki were out of the country, said the purpose was to
stabilize the situation.
	   Officials said Buthelezi consulted with Mandela on the decision.

Suspected Lebanese terrorist denied refuge, deported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A suspected Lebanese terrorist
has been deported from New Zealand after being denied refugee
status, a newspaper reported.
	   Izat Ibrahim Al-Ayubi, a member of Lebanese political groups
that have been involved in terrorist bombings, shootings and
kidnappings, was flown out to Lebanon last Friday.
	   Deported on the grounds he had committed crimes against
humanity, Al Ayubi had been jailed since his arrival on a false
passport on Aug. 22, the Manukau Daily News reported Tuesday.
	   Al-Ayubi's Auckland lawyer, Colin Amery, believes Al-Ayubi will
be executed or imprisoned on his return.
	   Al-Ayubi, 33, was arrested at Auckland airport as he entered the
country, charged with using a false passport, and held in custody
at Mount Eden prison until he was deported.
	   An Immigration Service report on the case, quoted by the Daily
News, states that Al-Ayubi is wanted by the Lebanese army and by
the Syrian secret police, and that Lebanese parliamentarians want
him ``out of the way.''
	   It said Al-Ayubi joined political parties with terrorist
ideologies from 1984.
	   The report said Al-Ayubi is now a member of the political party
Tripoli Resistance, and the leader of one of its factions.
	   The Syrian secret police want Al-Ayubi for fighting against
Syrian armed forces.
	   The Lebanese army wants him for desertion and stealing a truck
full of weapons. And Lebanese parliamentarians want Al-Ayubi ``out
of the way'' because in 1993 he distributed pamphlets claiming they
accepted bribes.
	   The Immigration Service decision to decline Al-Ayubi's refugee
status application and deport him was based on his involvement in
the Movement of Islamic Union (Harakat al Tawheed Al-Eslamic). The
party followed the ideology of the radical wing of the Muslim
Brotherhood, which is ``internationally recognized as a terrorist
group,'' the report said.
	   Before his deportation, Al-Ayubi was convicted and discharged by
an Otahuhu District Court judge on the false passport charge.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ After plowing through
the northern Caribbean, Hurricane Georges struck the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday, raising the death toll to 20 and flooding the
Western hemisphere's oldest city.
	   The damage here was expected to be considerably worse than in
Puerto Rico, where Georges exploded shop and car windows, flipped
small airplanes and whisked away satellite dishes.
	   Next on Georges' path is impoverished Haiti, which occupies the
western third of the island of Hispaniola. Officials there seemed
unprepared for the impending wrath, which could move on to strike
the U.S. mainland.
	   In the Dominican Republic, where the minimum wage is 2,040 pesos
(dlrs 140) a month, the wooden houses that line riverbeds and
hillsides would be no match for the storm's fistful of 110-mph
(175-kph) winds.
	   Presidential spokesman Adriano Miguel Tejada said 11 people were
confirmed dead, including three in the eastern provinces first hit
by the hurricane and five in Santo Domingo. Since Monday, Georges
has claimed the lives of four people in Puerto Rico, three in St.
Kitts and two in Antigua.
	   The storm caught Santo Domingo, a tropical capital of 3 million
people which was the first city built by colonizers in the New
World, almost entirely unprepared.
	   Forecasters had expected the storm to hit only the northern
coast of the Dominican Republic, but Georges changed course on
Tuesday and headed straight for the capital.
	   ``The damages here are terrible, terrible,'' said Jose Guillermo
Sued, director of the Santo Domingo airport, where the terminal and
several hangars were damaged.
	   At 0000 GMT, the eye of Georges was located over the Dominican
Republic, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east-northeast of
Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.
	   The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof
off the cab of a tanker truck passing through the capital, and
flipped it onto the hood. The driver continued on, hanging out the
window to see where he was going.
	   In addition to the winds, Georges flooded parts of Santo
Domingo, reaching one 22-foot highway overpass. Looters could be
seen carrying television sets and microwave ovens on their heads
through waist-deep water.
	   Police Chief Jose Anibal Sanz said officers fired at several
people who were looting a shopping center.
	   ``Under no circumstances are we going to allow vandals to take
advantage of this misfortune,'' said Sanz.
	   As the storm approached, many sat back and waited.
	   ``I live hanging on to God,'' said tour guide Fausto Lorenzo
Cipion, 38. ``I'm not afraid of this.''
	   President Leonel Fernandez addressed the nation on television
and offered similar advice.
	   ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise
our prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.
	   Authorities in Santo Domingo opened shelters Tuesday morning _
hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had reached the
capital. People continued to stream into shelters even as the full
force of Georges hit.
	   Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.
	   Hotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put
them up in conference or ballrooms.
	   To the west, Haitian authorities warned that substandard housing
and deforested land could put many people in jeopardy, but they
said they hoped the storm would lose strength over the Dominican
Republic. In 1994, mudslides unleashed by tropical storm Gordon
killed several thousand in Haiti's southern provinces.

Mexico asks NAFTA arbitration in dispute over U.S. trucking rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico said Tuesday it will take its demand
that Mexican trucks be allowed into U.S. border states to an
arbitration panel under the terms of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA.
	   U.S. authorities have refused to allow Mexican trucks into
border states, citing safety concerns about the vehicles, which are
often overweight, poorly maintained or under-insured.
	   Mexico's Commerce Ministry said it will ask for the formation of
a NAFTA arbitration panel to resolve the dispute and to analyze the
right of Mexican investors in the United States to offer
international transport services.
	   Such a panel would have the power to propose a binding solution
to the two-year-old dispute.
	   Under the NAFTA accord, which went into effect Jan. 1, 1994,
Mexican trucks were supposed to have been allowed access to U.S.
border states as of Dec. 18, 1995. Mexican investors were supposed
to have access as of Jan. 1, 1997.
	   The U.S. has denied access, arguing that Mexican trucks do not
meet U.S. safety standards.

Eight nations launch U.N. campaign for nuclear weapon-free world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Eight nations pressing for a nuclear weapon-free
world aren't giving up because of recent nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan. They're taking their campaign to the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The eight non-nuclear countries said Tuesday they want eight
nations with nuclear weapons to follow South Africa's example and
dispose of their nuclear arsenals.
	   The five nuclear powers - the United States, Russia, Britain,
France and China - are permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council. India and Pakistan are the newest members of the nuclear
club while Israel has never confirmed Western intelligence reports
that it has produced nuclear weapons.
	   Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said he expects the nuclear
nations to argue against total disarmament - but he's optimistic
that ``in the next number of years'' all 185 U.N. member states
will agree that nuclear weapons should be outlawed.
	   The eight non-nuclear nations - Ireland, Sweden, New Zealand,
South Africa, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico and Slovenia - issued a
declaration in June urging the nuclear states to make a clear
commitment to the speedy, final and total elimination of their
nuclear weapons.
	   But the new arms race in South Asia following nuclear tests in
May by India and then Pakistan took the spotlight off disarmament.
So foreign ministers of the eight nations decided to relaunch their
campaign with a resolution which they plan to submit to the U.N.
General Assembly's disarmament committee.
	   ``Effectively, we're warming up something that's gone cold,''
Andrews said.
	   He told a news conference following a meeting of foreign
ministers of the eight nations that ``the resolution will require a
change in approach by the nuclear-weapon states and therefore not
be immediately attractive to them.''
	   ``They will argue ... that they have recently undertaken
significant steps and that the world is now safer with - as they
would say _ only 10,000 weapons. But wouldn't the world be safer
with no weapons?,'' he asked.
	   The eight nations are seeking wide support for the resolution.
	   ``We would hope that ... the eight would become 80 and that
maybe the 80 in time will become 185,'' Andrews said. ``I would
like to think it will never come to a vote. I think that it will be
accepted by consensus ... We hope to have this matter solved in the
next number of years.''
	   In his speech Monday to the General Assembly, South African
President Nelson Mandela called on all U.N. members to ask
themselves why they need nuclear weapons - and conclude that they
don't and must support the resolution.
	   South Africa developed nuclear weapons during the apartheid era
but disclosed it had gotten rid of them after Mandela came to
power.
	   ``In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to explain in a
satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the consequence of Cold
War inertia and an attachment to the use of the threat of brute
force, to assert the primacy of some states over others,'' Mandela
said.
	   But New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon told the news
conference a lot remains to be done to end the allure of nuclear
weapons.
	   ``I get worried when I see chanting and enthusiastic people on
the streets ... saying: `Isn't it wonderful, we are now a nuclear
country. We are now a country to be taken seriously because we have
detonated a nuclear test,''' he said. ``We have a lot of work to do
in turning that thinking around.''
	   Crowds took to the streets in India and Pakistan
enthusiastically backing their countries' new nuclear status.
	   Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said the Indian and
Pakistani tests had to be viewed as ``a very serious warning'' and
a fresh call ``to revitalize every effort to avoid ... a nuclear
war in the future.''

Yugoslav officials shrug off threats, criticize world leaders

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As world leaders in the United
Nations ponder use of military force to halt Kosovo violence,
Yugoslav officials are shrugging of the threat and accusing the
West of being anti-Serb.
	   The defiant reaction to increasing international pressure to
stop the government crackdown in Kosovo, a Serbian province
populated mostly by ethnic Albanians, is typical of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. For years, Milosevic ignored growing
international condemnation of Serb excesses in Bosnia until NATO
struck at Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, helping end the war
there.
	   While world statesmen criticized Milosevic at the U.N. General
Assembly meeting Tuesday, his powerful security forces launched a
fresh offensive in Kosovo.
	   Backed by blistering artillery strikes, the Serb-Yugoslav forces
were reported to have seized at least four villages by late Tuesday
and killed dozens of ethnic Albanian rebels. The fighting forced
thousands from their homes to nearby forests, increasing fears of
mass deaths this winter from hunger and cold.
	   The seven-month-long government crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists fighting for independence of Kosovo has so far
claimed hundreds of lives and forced upward of 275,000 people from
their homes. Kosovo remains part of Serbia, the dominant republic
in Yugoslavia.
	   At the United Nations, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
blamed Milosevic for the Kosovo bloodshed and said the world would
use force if necessary to halt further violence.
	   The issue of a NATO role in ending the Kosovo fighting has for
months been unresolved, with some European nations insisting it can
come only if approved by the U.N. Security Council. That has been
unlikely, considering strong opposition by Russia, an ally of
Serbia, and China, which fears precedents of outside involvement in
its dispute in Tibet.
	   But Kinkel said Tuesday he now expects Russia to support a
Security Council resolution seen by Western powers as a
``springboard'' to a resolution sanctioning the use of force.
	   ``Milosevic will see that the Russian position has changed''
Kinkel said, calling the movement ``a big step forward.''
	   But Milosevic aide Zoran Lilic said the world should ``leave
Serbia alone to solve its own problems.''
	   Pledging that Kosovo will remain within Serbia's borders, Lilic
threatened pro-independence ethnic Albanians in the province with
expulsion unless they give up their quest and recognize Serbia as
their home.
	   International officials have accused Milosevic's forces of
brutality. They fear a humanitarian disaster as harsh Balkan winter
approaches.
	   In Belgrade, top officials of Milosevic's Socialist Party,
including Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, praised Yugoslav and
Serbian forces for their ``professional and patriotic'' work in
``protecting (Serbia's) territorial integrity and sovereignty.''
	   The party dismissed reports of a looming humanitarian disaster
in Kosovo, saying they presented an ``excuse for continuation of
pressure on our country.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ African leaders defended their decisions
to intervene in the Congo conflict, telling heads of state that the
nation would collapse if rebels ousted President Laurent Kabila.
	   The foreign ministers of Namibia and Zimbabwe, speaking Tuesday
to the General Assembly, urged a negotiated settlement to end the
fighting that began in August with a rebellion in the eastern part
of the country and has spread into a pan-African conflict.
	   Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe was
scheduled to address the assembly on Wednesday, along with minsters
from Tanzania, Niger and France.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have sent in forces to help Kabila
quell the insurgency that he and his supporters say is aided by
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo to defend its
security interests, and Rwanda has reserved the right to intervene
to protect itself from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   ``Misguided men driven by blind ambition and appetite for
needless confrontation have plunged the Democratic Republic of the
Congo into a destructive war,'' Namibian foreign minister Theo-Ben
Gurirab told the assembly.
	   He justified Namibia's backing of Kabila, saying his country
sent in troops ``for the sole purpose of preventing the collapse of
the state machinery and the violation of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity'' of a fellow African country.
	   Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, also defended his
decision to intervene on Kabila's behalf, saying troops were sent
in to uphold the sprawling nation's territorial integrity.
	   The rebels are a coalition of Tutsi fighters, former Kabila
supporters and disaffected government soldiers who accuse Kabila of
corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   Mozambique's foreign minister, Leonardo Santos Simao, urged a
settlement.
	   ``Africa and the international community cannot afford to add a
new chapter of conflicts of regional proprtions, especially taking
into account that virtually all other long-lasting conflicts in
this continent continue to defy our collective imagination,'' he
said.
	   Similar sentiments were expressed by European leaders Tuesday
regarding the conflict in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian separatists
are fighting Serb forces for independence.
	   Austrian foreign minister, Wolfgang Schussel said the abuses
perpetrated on civilians exceeded ``any justifiable proportion.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel went a step further,
threatening military intervention if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic doesn't rein in the Serb troops.

Remains of guerrilla who fought with Che Guevera flown to Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The remains of an Argentine rebel who
fought alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara were sent Tuesday to Cuba
from the Bolivian town where she was buried after being killed in
an army ambush.
	   Tania was the only female combatant during Guevara's ill-fated
1967 guerrilla campaign in Bolivia. Her remains were found last
week in the Andean town of Vallegrande, 540 miles (870 kilometers)
southeast of La Paz, where the remains of Guevara and other
guerrillas were found this year.
	   Tania, also known as Laura Gutierrez, was shot to death on Aug.
31, 1967 as she crossed a river alongside a Cuban commander. The
fighter, whose real name was Hayde Tamara Bunke Bider, was 29 when
she died.
	   Family members asked that her remains be taken to Cuba and be
buried in a tomb where 17 other rebels lie.
	   Bunke Bider was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1937 of
German parents who migrated to escape Nazi persecution. After the
war, her family returned to East Germany and Tania became a member
of the Socialist Party.
	   In 1960 she met Ernesto ``Che''Guevara and moved to Cuba, where
she trained and became a member of the Cuban Communist Party, Tania
moved to Bolivia in 1964 to begin laying the groundwork for the
guerrilla campaign.

Former rebels say Guatemalan peace process stalled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's former rebel group said in a
Tuesday report that the country's peace process ``is virtually
stalled'' because conservative groups are blocking key reforms.
	   Rebels of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, or URNG,
signed peace accords in December 1996 under which the government
agreed to take steps toward increasing economic opportunities and
demilitarizing the country.
	   ``The government has not promoted a progressive tax reform
needed to achieve the economic goals put forth in the (peace)
agreements,'' the URNG said in a press release.
	   ``There has been a lack of progress in demilitarization,'' the
report added.
	   The report released Tuesday, which blamed conservative parties,
former military officers and landowners for blocking the reform
efforts, was the fourth in a series of quarterly analyses of the
peace process by the former rebels.
	   The peace accords formally ended Guatemala's 36-year civil war
that left 200,000 people dead or missing.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Vicki, the third storm to hit Japan in the
past week, killed nine people, injured more than 200 and flooded
thousands of homes, police said Wednesday.
	   Damage was reported in 23 prefectures, or states, with two
people missing and 4,123 homes flooded. Another 56 homes and
buildings were destroyed, the National Police Agency said.
	   Landslides were reported at 160 locations, while river banks
were destroyed at five sites.
	   In addition to the nine deaths in nine prefectures, 258 people
suffered injuries, the agency said.
	   Among the dead was a 41-year-old man killed when his car was
caught in a landslide caused by heavy rains at the entrance of a
highway tunnel in Fukui prefecture, 323 kilometers (202 miles) west
of Tokyo, the agency said.
	   In the ancient capital of Nara, roof sections of a five-story
pagoda believed built in the late 8th century were ripped off by a
cedar tree felled gusty winds.
	   Local officials in Nara, 368 kilometers (234 miles), west of
Tokyo, began checking the extent of the damage to the Muroji temple
pagoda, which stands 16 meters (53 feet) high, media reports said.
	   Vicki, packing winds of 144 kilometers (89 miles) per hour, came
ashore Tuesday afternoon at Gobo city, about 438 kilometers (299
miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The storm tore across the main island of Honshu but began to
lose force as it moved through Yamagata prefecture, 291 kilometers
(182 miles) north of Tokyo. It moved out into the northern Pacific
Ocean early Wednesday, the agency said.
	   On Monday, a less powerful storm hit western Japan, smashing
windows and blowing away roof tiles as it crossed the country
before dissipating in the Sea of Japan.
	   Last Wednesday, Typhoon Stella swept through northern Japan,
killing four people and injuring 25 others.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Bulldozing Puerto Rico, Hurricane
Georges served up a powerful reminder of what nature can do: make
rivers overflow, spread trees like matchsticks across highways, and
leave 4 million people without power.
	   With transportation impossible in many areas, officials have yet
to gauge the full extent of one of the most powerful storms to hit
this U.S. territory in decades.
	   At least four Puerto Ricans were killed _ along with at least 16
others who died as a result of the storm elsewhere in the Caribbean
_ and authorities feared the casualty figures would rise. Officials
originally had said five people were killed in Puerto Rico. Damage
was expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   The storm also lashed the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing extensive
damage to homes and businesses in St. Croix and other neighboring
islands, disrupting phone service in and out of the territory.
Details were sketchy because of the communication problems.
	   Although accustomed to hurricanes every couple of years, Puerto
Ricans were stunned by the widespread impact of Georges. Its
110-mph (175-kph) winds spared not a bit of the U.S. territory as
it swept westward after hitting ground late Monday.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' said Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas even as Georges was still passing over
Puerto Rico en route to the Dominican Republic, where at least 11
people were killed in the storm.
	   In the San Juan neighborhood of Santa Teresita, Elodia Kendall
grew edgy when she heard wood snapping outside her home during the
height of the hurricane. First a tree in front of the house fell,
then one behind. Both missed the house by inches (centimeters).
	   ``When the first tree went, we freaked out because it made this
tremendous thundering sound,'' said Kendall. ``We didn't dare go
out. It takes a lot to frighten me because I'm 75 and I've seen
everything, but this did it.''
	   At dawn Tuesday, driving rains kept most people in their homes
or shelters, but by midday more people ventured out to begin
assessing the damage.
	   They found Georges had raked the island, denuding hillsides,
toppling power lines and billboards.
	   As the rains receded, rivers swelled, overflowing their banks in
the northern coastal towns of Arecibo and Barceloneta. The
tree-lined streets of Barceloneta were under 4 feet (more than 1
meter) of water, and more than 200 homes lost their roofs, said
Mayor Sol Luis Fontanez Olivo.
	   ``There is no sign of the flood ending,'' the mayor said.
	   In the capital of San Juan, where almost half the island's
people live, the typical sight was that of downed trees _ in some
areas most were felled onto roads or broken in half. Some flooded
roads were impossible to traverse.
	   There were also many downed power lines _ so many that all of
Puerto Rico was blacked out. The state power company urged retirees
to report to work and asked for help from private contractors.
Damage to the power grid alone was estimated at dlrs 60 million.
	   In all, damage was expected to far exceed that of Hurricane Hugo
in 1989, which crossed only the northeast corner of the island and
paralyzed San Juan for weeks.
	   Later Tuesday, residents began cleaning up their homes, and
neighborhood work parties sprung up like mushrooms to clear streets
of branches and unclog storm drains.
	   ``This thing was a monster,'' said Pedro Juan Morales, who lost
part of his roof and suffered flood damage. ``Hugo was a little
breeze compared to this.''

Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano releases ash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocatepetl volcano showered suburbs of
neighboring Mexico City with a light dusting of ash Tuesday after
what was described as an ``explosive'' exhalation, Mexico's
National Center for Disaster Prevention reported.
	   The center recorded the exhalation, which sent a plume of ash
and steam 2 1/2 miles (four kilometers) into the air, just after
noon. The center said the volcano's activity was slightly more
intense than in previous days.
	   Light showers of gray, gritty volcanic ash were reported in some
suburbs in the state of Mexico to the east of this capital of 8.5
million. The center said that ``the small amount of ash represents
no risk'' to the population.
	   Volcanic ash can cause eye and respiratory irritations, but
heavy rains Tuesday in Mexico City made it unlikely the ash would
spread.
	   Clouds blocked views of the 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) volcano,
whose name means ``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec Indian language.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution remained in effect and
authorities warned people against venturing within 2 1/2 miles of
the crater.
	   The volcano, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of
downtown Mexico City, has been sputtering intermittently since
1994.

Youth guilty of murdering Japanese tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ A Cairns youth was found guilty
Wednesday of murdering 22-year-old Japanese tourist Michiki Okuyama
last year.
	   The brutal slaying, which happened in September 1997 as
right-wing member of Parliament Pauline Hanson was campaigning
against Asian immigration, made some Asian residents and tourists
fear for their safety in Australia.
	   The 17-year-old man, who cannot be named as he was 16 at the
time of the offense, will be sentenced Nov. 9 after Cairns Supreme
Court judge Stanley Jones considers a pre-sentencing report.
	   Okuyama was beaten to death in a Cairns warehouse in September
1997 and her body later dumped in a swamp. She had arrived in
Australia to take part in a course to upgrade her scuba diving
qualifications.
	   Her parents, Toshie and Hideo Okuyama from Yokohama, watched the
trial and reportedly intend to establish a permanent memorial to
their daughter.
	   Police said Okuyama, from Yokohama, died from facial fractures
and blood inhalation.
	   Her murder sparked a high level of interest in Japan because of
the large number of Japanese visiting northern Queensland and after
her family appealed for help in finding her.
	   Australian Tourism Commission figures show more than 600,000
Japanese tourists visited Australia last year, and 77 percent of
them traveled to Queensland.

Report: Mitsubishi group companies to set up new securities firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Four financial institutions belonging to the
Mitsubishi group will set up a large securities company with
capital worth 200-300 billion yen (dlrs 1.49-2.23 billion) next
year, a major Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The four institutions involved are the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co.
and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., the Yomiuri Shimbun
reported.
	   Officials from the four companies are in the final stages of
coordinating the launch of the new brokerage, scheduled for October
of next year, said the daily, Japan's largest.
	   The move is seen as linked to Japan's ``big bang'' financial
reforms, now under way and to be fully implemented early in the
next century, the report said.
	   Mitsubishi officials were not available to comment on the report
Wednesday due to a national holiday.
	   In July, companies in the Sumitomo group and Daiwa Securities
Co., a major Japanese brokerage, announced a comprehensive
securities business tie-up.

Hungarian airliner grounded in Scotland after bomb scare
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRESTWICK, Scotland (AP) _ A Hungarian airliner carrying more
than 200 people from Budapest to Toronto was grounded overnight in
Scotland after a bomb scare prompted an emergency landing.
	   No injuries were reported and nothing was found on board the
plane.
	   The Malev Hungarian Airlines Boeing 767 landed at Prestwick
airport near the west-central coast of Scotland Tuesday afternoon
after what police described as ``a threat regarding the safety of
the aircraft.''
	   It is thought a bomb threat was made by telephone in Hungary,
prompting air officials to order the jet down. It landed safely at
around 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT) to allow army experts to search the
aircraft.
	   Full emergency procedures were activated by the airport
authorities following the threat, made at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT)
and police, fire and ambulance crews were at the scene.
	   A spokesman for Strathclyde Police, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the Malev Hungarian aircraft landed
safely and that was searched by officers and the British Army's
explosives division.
	   All 196 passengers and nine crew members on board flight MAH1010
were reported to be safe and spent the night in a local hotel,
police said.
	   ``A full and detailed search of the aircraft was made and
nothing was found. The passengers and crew are all safe and well
and will continue their journey later this morning,'' the spokesman
said Wednesday the spokesman.
	   The plane was scheduled to resume its journey to Canada at
around noon Wednesday.

	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ A Cairns youth was found guilty
Wednesday of murdering 22-year-old Japanese tourist Michiko Okuyama
last year.
	   The brutal slaying, which happened in September 1997 as

	   The 17-year-old man, who cannot be named as he was 16 at the

Court judge Stanley Jones considers a pre-sentencing report.
	   Normally the maximum sentence that would be imposed on a minor
for murder is 10 years, but the prosecution indicated it will seek
a life sentence on the basis that it came under the category of a
``heinous crime.''
	   The youth was expected to be transferred to a detention center
in Brisbane to await sentencing.
	   Okuyama was beaten to death in a Cairns warehouse in September
1997 and her body later dumped in a swamp. She had arrived in

Oil spills into Gulf lagoon from Mexican pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Oil from a leaking pipeline spilled into a
lagoon on the Gulf of Mexico, leaving a light sheen of oil a mile
(1.5-kilometers) long on the waters of the Tamiahua Lagoon, the oil
monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos said.
	   The spill occured Monday after heavy rains breached a
containment pool dug to collect oil spilling from the pipeline near
Naranjos, Veracruz, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of the
port of Tampico on the Gulf coast.
	   The state-owned company said Tuesday that work crews had begun
trying to clean up the spill with suction equipment and containment
booms.
	   Television footage showed oil clinging to shrubs and seashores
in the lagoon.

Electronic game or phone jams airliner's autopilot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities are investigating whether
the autopilot on a Qantas flight to London jammed because
passengers used electronic games, computers or mobile phones on
board.
	   The 400 passengers on the Sept. 4 flight thought they were going
to crash as the plane lurched heavily on its side and dropped
sharply through the air.
	   The malfunction is believed to have been caused by passengers
using electronic games, a laptop computer and a personal CD player
during the descent -- despite being told not to.
	   According to an incident report obtained by The Australian
newspaper, intervention by the captain to correct the plane's
altitude was forced by a silent malfunction in the autopilot.
	   The malfunction had pitched the aircraft 700 feet (210 meters)
higher into the sky when it was meant to be in a holding pattern
above London Heathrow airport.
	   Since January 1994, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has
logged about 50 incident reports from airlines in Australia
involving personal electronic devices.
	   A spokesman for the bureau, which is investigating the Heathrow
incident, told the newspaper a conclusive link between the use of
devices which emit electromagnetic energy and the dozens of
reported malfunctions was yet to be made.

Jane's: India, Pakistan can make more nuclear weapons than thought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New information on nuclear reactor performance
indicates that India is now capable of producing 455 atomic bombs
and Pakistan can build 105 nuclear weapons, Jane's Intelligence
Review reported in its October issue.
	   The estimates are higher than the current widely accepted view
that India can now produce a maximum of 65 bombs while Pakistan can
make at most 25 bombs, the respected monthly security magazine
said.
	   Rival nuclear tests in May by the South Asian neighbors, who
have fought three wars in the last 50 years, heightened fears of a
new nuclear arms race that could ultimately spread to other
aspiring nuclear nations.
	   The London-based magazine said new information provided by the
Canadian Nuclear Association on the performance of Canadian nuclear
reactors in India and Pakistan led to the revised projections on
the amount of nuclear material produced in both countries.
	   India has eight Canadian CANDU nuclear power reactors and one
Canadian research reactor while Pakistan's one nuclear power
reactor is a CANDU, it said.
	   Toronto-based author Ian Steer, who specializes in defense and
science issues, said in a telephone interview that the new
estimates raise fears that India could produce at least 800 atomic
bombs over the next 10 years and Pakistan could make more than 200
bombs.
	   As of July 1, India's 10 nuclear power reactors and three of its
six nuclear research reactors have produced 3,299 kilograms (7,258
pounds) of plutonium, the key ingredient of its nuclear weapons,
the Jane's report said.
	   Seventeen percent of this plutonium, or 567 kilograms (1,247
pounds), is weapons-grade and the rest is less efficient
reactor-grade plutonium which can still be used to make nuclear
weapons, it said.
	   The weapons-grade and reactor-grade plutonium can potentially be
used to make 455 atomic bombs, the magazine said.
	   Colin Hunt of the Canadian Nuclear Association was quoted as
saying that ``so far as is known, India's power reactors have not
been used to produce weapons-grade plutonium, and none of the
reactor-grade plutonium they have produced has been diverted for
weapons purposes.''
	   Jane's noted, however, that if India's reactor-grade plutonium,
which is not under international safeguards, is separated from
spent nuclear reactor fuel, ``it can be converted into 243 atomic
bombs very quickly.''
	   In Pakistan, Jane's said, the estimate that the country can
produce a maximum of 25 atomic bombs doesn't take into account
plutonium for at least 38 weapons produced by the country's CANDU
reactor.
	   Pakistan now uses highly enriched uranium in its nuclear weapons
but within a few years a new plutonium production reactor at Khusab
will allow the country to build plutonium-based atom bombs, it
said.
	   In addition, the magazine said, closer analysis of Pakistan's
two uranium enrichment plants indicates their combined production
to date is 2 1/2 times greater than previously believed.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A group of 14 men armed with assault
rifles and pistols ambushed two police patrol cars carrying 20
policemen near this Pacific coast resort, seriously wounding four
officers before fleeing.
	   The attack occured late Tuesday afternoon about five miles
(eight kilometers) west of Acapulco on a highway leading to the
resort of Zihuatenejo, just short of a police roadblock.
	   Police said the attackers wore military-style uniforms, but were
unsure if they belonged to the Popular Revolutionary Army, a
leftist rebel group blamed for past attacks in the area, or a local
gang.
	   ``We are not ruling out the possibility that the attackers
belonged to a band of thieves, or some armed guerrilla group,''
said Elias Oliva Perez, regional supervisor of the Guerrero state
police.
	   The attackers emerged from high grass beside the highway and
fired rifles and pistols, police said. Police and army troops began
a search for the assailants in the area.

Youth guilty of murdering Japanese tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ A Cairns youth was found guilty
Wednesday of murdering 22-year-old Japanese tourist Michiko Okuyama
last year.
	   The brutal slaying, which happened in September 1997 as
right-wing member of Parliament Pauline Hanson was campaigning
against Asian immigration, made some Asian residents and tourists
fear for their safety in Australia.
	   The 17-year-old man, who cannot be named as he was 16 at the
time of the murder, will be sentenced Nov. 9 after Cairns Supreme
Court judge Stanley Jones considers a pre-sentencing report.
	   Normally the maximum sentence that would be imposed on a minor
for murder is 10 years, but the prosecution indicated it will seek
a life sentence on the basis that it falls under the category of a
``heinous crime.''
	   The youth was expected to be transferred to a detention center
in Brisbane to await sentencing.
	   Okuyama was beaten to death in a Cairns warehouse in September
1997 and her body later dumped in a swamp. She had arrived in
Australia to take part in a course to upgrade her scuba diving
qualifications.
	   Her parents, Toshie and Hideo Okuyama from Yokohama, watched the
trial and reportedly intend to establish a permanent memorial to
their daughter.
	   Police said Okuyama, also of Yokohama, died from facial
fractures and blood inhalation.
	   Her murder sparked a high level of interest in Japan because of
the large number of Japanese visiting northern Queensland and after
her family appealed for help in finding her.
	   Australian Tourism Commission figures show that more than
600,000 Japanese tourists visited Australia last year, and 77
percent of them traveled to Queensland.

United Nations moves towards resolution on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Consultations resume at 1500 GMT; council vote
tentatively scheduled for 1930 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that the people of Kosovo are
facing a desperate winter without proper food or shelter, the U.N.
Security Council is demanding a cease-fire in the Yugoslav province
and threatening further action if the violence continues.
	   A draft of a resolution expected to be adopted Wednesday doesn't
specifically authorize NATO force to stop the Serb offensive on
ethnic Albanian separatists. But countries such as the United
States have said such authorization isn't necessary for military
intervention.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.N. resolution doesn't go that far, stating only that ``the
council would consider further action and additional measures to
maintain or restore peace and stability in the region,'' if a
political settlement isn't reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and a quarter million
uprooted since Serb forces began a crackdown in February on ethnic
Albanian separatists, who constitute the vast majority of Kosovo's
population.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence of
Kosovo; western nations have called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   In addition to demanding a cease-fire, the draft resolution
urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating
a solution to the crisis.
	   It demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in Kosovo
and the return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention.
	   China however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said. A U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said China could abstain from the vote.
	   British ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the goal of the
resolution was to end the fighting and halt a humanitarian
disaster. Immediate military action was not the objective, he said.
	   ``The objective was to recognize the seriousness of the
humanitarian situation, as a consequence of a very bad political
situation, and to pass a Chapter 7 resolution which made Belgrade
realize that the international community was losing its patience,''
Greenstock said.
	   Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter allows for the use of force by
member states if regional peace and security is threatened.
	   The next step _ presumably authorizing military intervention _
would have to wait until Milosevic reacts to the resolution, he
said.
	   ``There is no agreement among anybody about next steps,'' he
said. ``We're just concentrating on now.''
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Russia _ which has
cultural and religious ties to the Serbs _ opposed any military
intervention.
	   ``The use of force is the last resort, and it could only be done
on the decision of the Security Council,'' he said.

Electronic game or phone jams airliner's autopilot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts third graf to clarify there is no proof yet that

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities are investigating whether
the autopilot on a Qantas flight to London jammed because
passengers used electronic games, computers or mobile phones on
board.
	   The 400 passengers on the Sept. 4 flight thought they were going
to crash as the plane lurched heavily on its side and dropped
sharply through the air.
	   Airline experts are looking into whether the problem was caused
by passengers using electronic games, a laptop computer and a
personal CD player during the descent -- despite being told not to.
	   According to an incident report obtained by The Australian
newspaper, intervention by the captain to correct the plane's
altitude was forced by a silent malfunction in the autopilot.
	   The malfunction had pitched the aircraft 700 feet (210 meters)
higher into the sky when it was meant to be in a holding pattern
above London Heathrow airport.
	   Since January 1994, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has
logged about 50 incident reports from airlines in Australia
involving personal electronic devices.
	   A spokesman for the bureau, which is investigating the Heathrow
incident, told the newspaper a conclusive link between the use of
devices which emit electromagnetic energy and the dozens of
reported malfunctions was yet to be made.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
unleashed violence in the Dominican Republic as police arrested
hundreds for looting and President Leonel Fernandez ordered an
overnight curfew.
	   The death toll in the Dominican Republic rose to 12 _ and 21
overall _ as the storm continued churning across the island of
Hispaniola and entered the impoverished nation of Haiti, where
damages were expected to be severe due to substandard housing and
minimal preparation for the hurricane.
	   There were concerns the storm might continue as far as Florida.
	   In the Dominican Republic, where the minimum wage is 2,040 pesos
(dlrs 140) a month, looters could be seen carrying television sets
and microwave ovens on their heads through waist-deep water.
	   Police Chief Jose Anibal Sanz said police fired on some people
who were trying to loot a shopping center.
	   Ruben Paulino Alvarez, secretary of the armed forces, said the
death toll had risen to 12. He said a family of four died when a
tree fell on their house in a Santo Domingo suburb; a boy died in
Santo Domingo when a wall fell on him; another person died in Santo
Domingo when a roof fell on them, and four people died in the
eastern city of Higuey _ three when a roof fell on them and one
from a falling tree.
	   He did not give details of the other two deaths, and refused to
answer a reporter who asked about reports that police had shot and
killed two alleged looters.
	   President Fernandez declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Paulino said he expected Fernandez to send the military into the
streets of the capital to maintain order and said looters would be
dealt with sternly.
	   Forecasters had expected the storm to hit only the northern
coast of the Dominican Republic, but Georges changed course Tuesday
and headed straight for the capital before moving into Haiti.
	   ``The damages here are terrible, terrible,'' said Jose Guillermo
Sued, director of the Santo Domingo airport, who said the terminal
and several hangars were damaged.
	   At 0000 GMT, the eye of Georges was located over the Dominican
Republic, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east-northeast of
Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.
	   The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof
off the cab of a tanker truck passing through the capital, and
flipped it onto the hood. In addition to the winds, Georges flooded
parts of Santo Domingo, reaching one 22-foot highway overpass.
	   As the storm approached, many sat back and waited.
	   ``I live hanging on to God,'' said tour guide Fausto Lorenzo
Cipion, 38. ``I'm not afraid of this.''
	   President Fernandez addressed the nation on television and
offered similar advice.
	   ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise
our prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.
	   Authorities in Santo Domingo opened shelters Tuesday morning _
hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had reached the
capital. People continued to stream into shelters even as the full
force of Georges hit.
	   Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.
	   Hotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put
them up in conference or ballrooms.
	   In Haiti, authorities had warned that substandard housing and
deforested land could put many people in jeopardy, but they said
they hoped the storm would lose strength over the Dominican
Republic. In 1994, mudslides unleashed by tropical storm Gordon
killed several thousand in Haiti's southern provinces.
