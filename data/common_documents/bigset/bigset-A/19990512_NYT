U.S., CITING SAFETY, SUSPENDS HUMAN RESEARCH AT DUKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government has suspended all federally financed
medical research on humans at the Duke University Medical Center
after determining that the center could not adequately guarantee
the safety of the subjects, a federal official said on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Gary B. Ellis, heads the Office for Protection
From Research Risks, whose inspectors found on repeated visits to
Duke that there were unacceptable lapses in procedures and
record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said on Tuesday night that he and his agency colleagues
had been surprised at the center's slowness in moving to correct
the problems and that he had sent a letter to the medical center
conveying the agency's decision _ one that could cost the center in
Durham, N.C., some $175 million in federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   No research subjects have been made ill or harmed in any way,
the medical center said on Tuesday, characterizing the deficiencies
as housekeeping problems. Ellis conceded that no one had been
harmed, but he said there was nothing trivial about the problems
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In medicine, all doctors know that if something isn't
documented in the medical records, it wasn't done,'' Ellis said.
``That's a good standard for medical research as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems cited by the agency in its letter include the
failure of a supervisory committee at the medical center to keep
track of human studies after they began _ the only way to make sure
the subjects are not unexpectedly harmed by the research _ and
failure to make sure that protections for children were in force,
as required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's action against the prestigious Duke center, only
the fourth such move by the government in nearly a decade and
apparently the most significant in terms of the money at stake, was
reported in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Ralph Snyderman, Duke's chancellor for
health affairs, as saying, ``We're absolutely going to make certain
that anyone in a research protocol is going to be fully
protected.'' He and other Duke officials said they would do their
utmost to see that the shortcomings detected by the government were
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the experiments run the gamut from the
desperately ill whose sickness does not respond to treatment to the
robustly healthy who take part out of a sense of altruism or
perhaps to aid an ailing relative, Ellis said in an interview on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Protection From Research Risks is part of the
National Institutes of Health, which in turn is part of the
Department of Health and Human Services. The action against Duke
follows a similar one against a Los Angeles veterans' hospital in
March. Ellis said other disciplinary actions had been taken against
a Chicago hospital in 1998 and a Massachusetts eye-and-ear
treatment center in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said his agency's dissatisfaction with the Duke center
began with a random visit in December. Subsequent visits and
several exchanges of letters did not produce the expected
corrections, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected the faults would be swiftly and sufficiently
corrected,'' he said. ``We were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the failings dealt with the center's Institutional
Review Board, which reviews all proposed human research to insure
that it is appropriate, scientifically and ethically, The Post
reported, adding that it was sometimes difficult to tell from
records whether a quorum was present for meetings.

SACRIFICE FLY, BULLPEN SAVE CSUN IN 12
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ With this kind of opportunity, Jason Gorman
wasn't going to wait for another chance. He was going to swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is get the right pitch and execute,''
Gorman said after knocking in the winning run with a 12th-inning
sacrifice fly to give the Cal State Northridge baseball team a 6-5
victory over UC Santa Barbara Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman's high fly ball to right field, which he hit on the first
pitch he got from Gauchos reliever Chris Quiroz, was deep enough to
score Michael Bumstead and give the Matadors (27-28) their second
consecutive extra-inning win at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, a freshman from Palmdale High who started at third base,
was the right Matador to come to the plate in the 12th with the
bases loaded and one out; he had three hits in his first five
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Mike Batesole said Gorman needed to swing at any high
fastball Quiroz offered. Gorman just happened to get it on the
first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is if you get one up, you have to do something with
it,'' Batesole said. ``(Gorman) did something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiroz (2-3) had only allowed one hit in four innings before
facing Gorman _ and that was J.T. Stott's infield single in the
previous at-bat. CSUN also received quality relief pitching from
Mike Frick, who gave up one run in 31/3 innings, Jose Vasquez, who
threw 21/3 shutout innings and Darryl Grant, who shut out UCSB over
the last 11/3 innings to get his first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who started in left field, also hit a three-run homer in
the sixth to give the Matadors a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we expected of (Grant) all along,'' Batesole said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN closes its season at 2:30 p.m. today at home against Loyola
Marymount. The Matadors have won their last five games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are taking a lot of pride in their work,'' Batesole
said. ``We played the full 12 (innings).''
</P>
<P>
   UCSB right fielder Brad Wright, who played at Agoura High and
Crespi, entered the game with a .390 batting average and went 1 for
6.

success since the Kosovo conflict began, drawing Russia into the
outline of a deal which ideally would force Serbian President

eternity in war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, the West achieved its biggest diplomatic
success since the Kosovo conflict began, drawing Russia into the
outline of a deal which ideally would force Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday night, an errant NATO missile scored its most
devastating target imaginable _ a direct hit on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At a stroke the painstaking feat of the diplomats had been at
the least imperiled, conceivably reduced to as much rubble as
China's mission... &LR;  &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Minnesota forward Kevin Garnett thought he let his
team down Sunday when he failed to score in the final 21 minutes of
the Timberwolves' Game 1 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wasn't about to let that happen twice. Garnett scored 10 of
his 23 points in the fourth quarter to help the Timberwolves hold
off a San Antonio comeback and defeat the Spurs 80-71 on Tuesday
night in front of a shocked crowd of 22,494 at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   It evens the best-of-five NBA opening-round series at a game
each as the teams travel to Minneapolis for Game 3 on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew everybody had given up on us,'' Garnett said. ``People
were saying sweep, and that was like a spit in the face to us.
We're competitors, and we can play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett made sure the Wolves stayed in front down the stretch,
but the death blow came from guard Anthony Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota led 74-67 with 1:20 to go when forward Joe Smith had
the ball in the low post as time was running out on the shot clock.
Smith was double-teamed, so he tossed the ball outside to Peeler,
who was 30 feet from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler shot an off-balance fadeaway that went in with one second
on the shot clock, giving the Wolves a 77-67 lead and putting the
game out of reach for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves are 3-3 against San Antonio this season. The
victory ended an 11-game road losing streak for Minnesota and
stopped a 15-game home winning streak for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games that was meant to be for us,'' said
Minnesota coach Flip Saunders. ``Now we have a series. We are
playing the best team in the NBA, but now we have home-court
advantage. I told our guys this was a breakthrough game for us and
a character-builder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves surprised San Antonio by winning the rebounding
46-40, including 19 offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota came out and busted their butts and took the game
from us,'' said San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. ``That was the
main reason for the outcome. It's pretty obvious that's what
happened when they have 19 offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett had 12 rebounds, Smith added 10 (including six
offensive), and center Dean Garrett had nine (five offensive).
</P>
<P>
   ``We started a bigger lineup tonight, and we wanted to crash the
boards,'' Garnett said. ``It was just a matter of who wanted it
more. The difference tonight was that we stayed aggressive for 48
minutes and we matched their intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota made a lineup change from Game 1 and started Garrett,
which proved wise. Garrett did an outstanding job defensively on
San Antonio center David Robinson, who took only six shots and
ended the game with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring eight points in the first quarter, Robinson did
not make another shot until the last minute of the game after the
outcome had been decided. But Popovich placed some of the blame for
that on the poor outside shooting of the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make perimeter shots or our big men are going to
get double-teamed,'' Popovich said. ``Tonight we were pretty poor
from the perimeter when the ball was kicked outside.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio missed all eight 3-point shots it attempted. Tim
Duncan led the team with 18 points but failed to score in the
second and third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led 21-19 at the end of the first quarter, thanks
mainly to 14 points inside from Duncan and Robinson. San Antonio
had 16 points in the lane in the first quarter; the Timberwolves
had two.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed dramatically in the second quarter when
neither Robinson nor Duncan scored and Minnesota held the Spurs to
a 10-point quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led 23-20 before the Wolves had a 14-1 spurt to take a
34-24 lead after a jumper at the top of the key by Garnett.
Minnesota led 37-31 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-foot bank shot by Terrell Brandon, who had 18 points
and nine assists, gave Minnesota its biggest lead at 42-31 with
10:56 to go in the third quarter. The Wolves held a 60-51 lead
entering the final period.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was so utterly predictable. Up to 60 civilians are torn apart
in a NATO bombing attack on Saturday and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic releases three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And which event _ the tragedy or the melodrama _ do we regard as
more important? The freeing of three Americans, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday's NATO briefing spent more time discussing the
implications of their release than the bus massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss of innocent life is regretted,'' German Colonel
Konrad Freytag announced. Note the passive tense ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not bomb the bus,'' the colonel announced, adding that
the bridge was ``a military target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We bombed the bridge... We did not bomb the bus and we did not
target the bus.'' So that's all right then.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer will NATO get away with these dreadful attacks?
Aleksinac, Cuprija, the train massacre at Grdelica, the assault on
the civilian center of Pristina, the bombs dropped near Belgrade
university, the slaughter of Albanian refugees near Djakovica, the
mass killings in the air raid at Surdulica and now the bus blown
apart on the Lujane bridge...
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are making good headway with their propaganda: that
NATO is deliberately trying to kill innocent Serbs. And what do we
get from Colonel Freytag? ``It is regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's sorrow, we are supposed to believe, is reserved for the
continuing exodus of Albanian refugees from Kosovo, for the
three-quarters of a million Kosovo Albanian refugees hounded from
their homes, executed, raped, dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to believe that NATO feels this sense of outrage as
strongly as it claims. But I don't _ and after five weeks in
Yugoslavia, here's why.
</P>
<P>
   If I am walking down a street in London or Dublin or any other
European city and I see a man molesting a woman or trying to kill
an innocent civilian, I hope I would, like most ``Independent''
readers no doubt, cross the road and try _ whatever the cost _ to
save the life of the innocent person. But that has not been NATO's
reaction to the plight of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   What NATO has done _ faced with the atrocities of Kosovo _ has
been to stay on the other side of the road, to make a note of the
criminal's address, and to throw stones through the window of his
home later that night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sometimes damages the house, sometimes destroys it. Quite
often, in the dark, it throws stones through the windows of the
wrong house and hurts or kills those who are every bit as innocent
as the original victim. In which case NATO says that ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single NATO life has been lost in five weeks of war in the
Balkans _ because we do not regard the catastrophe of the Kosovo
Albanians as worth a single NATO life. It is as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want a ground war and there will not be a ground war
(unless the Kosovo Liberation Army are obliging enough to die for
us).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, perhaps. But we do not say so. Instead,
we are told why we must go on bombing day after day, week after
week, in NATO briefings that are becoming parodies of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even the word NATO is becoming a lie. The alliance is bombarding
Yugoslavia, we are told. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks in Serbia, I haven't seen any Portuguese
planes dropping bombs on the Serbs. I haven't seen any Spanish jets
rocketing Belgrade. Nor a single French jet. Nor Norwegian. Nor
Greek. Nor Italian.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of British Harriers and Canadian planes, perhaps. But
the rest are American. For in terms of a military offensive, this
is essentially an American attack on Yugoslavia, using American
aircraft dropping American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   So what could have been more important Sunday _ amid the
continuing war crimes in Kosovo _ than the release of three
American soldiers?
</P>
<P>
   Now it happens that I have seen Jesse Jackson in action before.
Last time, he was arranging the release of a U.S. pilot captured by
the Syrians in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turned up in Damascus talking about ``the cycle of
pain,'' met with Syrian President Hafez Assad, said a few prayers
and left with the man whose hi-tech jet had been shot down over
Lebanon by a Second World War anti-aircraft gun.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Milosevic, Jackson talked about
``the cycle of pain,'' said a few prayers and left with the three
American soldiers captured on the Serbian-Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Assad, however, Milosevic handed Jackson a letter for the
American president _ a letter which Bill Clinton will not like to
read.
</P>
<P>
   For negotiating with Milosevic, sitting down with the man now
bestialized as the Hitler of Belgrade _ when will we ever learn to
stop playacting the Second World War? _ is now impossible for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He is too terrible, his regime too ``bloodstained,'' his word so
unreliable for anyone to trust him to talk peace. Or so we are led
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   But what is he offering? An ``international force'' in Kosovo, I
suspect, under U.N. mandate but with no NATO participation and with
_ at most _ side arms for personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   It will be refused (as Milosevic will expect it to be refused)
but it will probably form the basis of peace, once NATO admits that
there will be no ground war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, unfortunately for NATO, is that _ barring coups
d'etat or a Western-provoked uprising in Montenegro or mass
desertions from the Yugoslav army _ the Serbs look set to grit
their teeth and take more American bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. is probably the only hope the Kosovo Albanians now have
of getting back to their homes _ some of them, that is, those who
might be able to claim citizenship of Yugoslavia or who might be
prepared to return without hope of independence or even real
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   They will not expect any apologies from the Serbs for the
``ethnic cleansing'' of the past five weeks. And should they ask
NATO why so many Albanians had to be murdered while the alliance
bombed, I can imagine the reply they will receive. ``It is
regretted.'' &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ We British had grown used to having a prime minister
who was ignorant, but now a far more worrying thought occurs. Has
he gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is a question that only doctors could answer. But
Prime Minister Tony Blair's recent self-justifying speeches,
delivered with laryngitic, manic jerkiness, persuade me that war is
almost always an act of madness.
</P>
<P>
   And the rhetoric that he has chosen to employ, with its
pseudo-Churchillian echoes and its allusions to the Second World
War, provoke disturbing, unwelcome thoughts, not merely about the
current conflict in Kosovo, but about the whole of 20th-century
history, and the brave sorrows which our parents' generation
underwent.
</P>
<P>
   The German culture minister, Michael Naumann, recently deplored
the fact that Hitler's war continues to obsess the British. Over
the last few weeks one sees not merely that Herr Naumann is right
but that the British way of viewing the Second World War is deeply
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair now seems to be by far the most hawkish of NATO's
leaders. The German peace proposals, which would have involved
bringing in the Russians to persuade Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to the negotiating table, have been dismissed by Blair as
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wants blood, toil, sweat and tears; he wants Bill Clinton
to give him the tools and we'll finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The early identification of Milosevic with Hitler was bizarre.
Milosevic has shown no desire for territorial expansion, let alone
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The unending story of minor, nasty warfare in the Balkans is
part of the story of the last 1,000 years. It is quite unlike the
resurrection of German nationalism in the 1920s as a reaction
against the unjust Versailles Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain went to war against Hitler not because he was
persecuting the Jews, as Blair implies every day, but because of
treaties designed to check German expansionism.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties to ``protect'' Czechoslovakia were quietly
forgotten _ some said to Britain's shame. The treaty to protect
Poland was observed, and it was because Hitler invaded Poland that
Neville Chamberlain declared war.
</P>
<P>
   As AJP Taylor caustically observes in ``The Origins of the
Second World War'': ``In 1938 Czechoslovakia was betrayed. In 1939
Poland was saved. Less than 100,000 Czechs died during the war.
Six-and-a-half million Poles were killed. Which was better _ to be
a betrayed Czech or a saved Pole?''
</P>
<P>
   When we consider the 56 million people _ most of them civilians
_ who died during the Second World War we of a younger generation
can understand why those who watched their comrades die in it were
obliged to tell themselves not only that it was an inevitable
conflict, but that it was the only noble way of defeating an evil
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Even this way of thinking only leads to more intolerable
thoughts _ namely that Poland, Czechoslovakia, and all the Eastern
bloc countries were ``liberated'' only in the sense that they were
taken away from the Nazis and given into Soviet slavery at the
insistence of Stalin, who outstripped Hitler in the numbers he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact about Hitler which nobody believed during the
Second World War was that he meant what he said about the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office and the BBC consistently refused to
believe the stories of extermination as they began to come through
from Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and elsewhere in the middle years of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1945, when people watched the shocking newsreels of
liberated concentration camps did the extent of the Nazi atrocities
become clear.
</P>
<P>
   And of course _ another intolerable thought _ this slaughter
only began after the outbreak of war. Could it be _ intolerable
question _ that it was the cover of war alone which made the
massacres possible?
</P>
<P>
   For Tony Blair to liken Milosevic to Hitler is to trivialize
every one of those 56 million deaths between 1939-45 and to miss
the point which, tragically, they make.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy thought. It is literally unbearable, but it
must be thought if politicians are not to go on repeating the
mistakes of the past. It is this.
</P>
<P>
   If the Second World War had never been fought, not only would
those 56 million, most of them, have died in their beds; not only
would the beautiful cities of France, Germany, Italy and Poland
which were destroyed have remained intact, but Hitler and his crazy
regime would almost certainly have been overthrown in the fullness
of time by his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blair tells us that the Second World War was ``a war started
by a dictator visiting racial genocide on his people.'' He tell us
that. ``You have to come down to the simple clear choice, to act,
or not to act.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even pseudo-Winston Churchill. It is government by
Biggles.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's and NATO's decision to ``act'' has escalated a war
which, in the three years previous to March 25, 1999, had killed
between two and three thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   To act or not to act. There are so many actions other than
bombing _ to increase aid, for example, to flood a distressed or
war-torn region with hospitals, schools, foreign observers who, if
they can't stop the fighting, can at least ensure that the
atrocities are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing raids have provided the biggest possible cover
for acts of genocidal slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   When one thinks of the war memorials all over Europe, and the
stories of self-sacrifice which they embody, and the unselfish
bravery of our parents' generation, one hardly dares to write these
words.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson they teach is that war never works, that the
notion of a just war is a political con.
</P>
<P>
   God help us if our world order is now in the hands of those
whose history books are closed and whose moral values are
conceitedly summed up by the doctrine that whatever Blair thinks
and does is right and whatever anyone else does is ``evil.'' &QL;

PARK'S NEW WEAPON TAILOR-MADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Chan Ho Park has given up nine homers
in seven starts, opponents are hitting .275 against him and his 3-2
record is far from what the Dodgers expected.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Charlie Hough has a theory: Park is tipping off
his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier in the week, Park got a new glove with a sewn-in
pocket to hide his index finger _ and conceal the upcoming pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would move his finger when he gripped the ball,'' Hough
said. ``He would straighten it out when he pitched a fastball and
press it (against the glove) with a curve ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Park could put his finger inside his glove to pitch, but the
comfort factor makes it easier to use a glove that has the pocket.
Park said it's most visible when he pitches with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some pitches, I move my finger,'' Park said. ``Now, I
don't have to worry about it. It's better to not show them
anything. There's 15 hitters in the dugout and they're looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, opponents hit .244 with 16 homers in Parks' 34
starts. This season is much different. Park has struggled since his
second outing of the season, when he yielded a grand slam to
Arizona's Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Park also gave up a pair of grand slams to St. Louis' Fernando
Tatis in one inning _ the only time that's been done _ and had a
miserable time Sunday against the Florida Marlins. Staked to a 4-0
lead, Park gave up three homers to the Marlins in a game the
Dodgers eventually lost.
</P>
<P>
   The tipping-off-pitches problem is also something Hough
corrected with former Dodgers left-hander Brian Bohanon, who is 5-1
with the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came over (from the Mets), he gave up three
homers in a game to the Padres and afterward said he may be doing
something in his windup,'' Hough said. ``We looked at it and
changed a few things. With Chan Ho, the (glove) at least gives him
confidence that they're not getting his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hero's welcome: Staff Sgt. Andy Ramirez, one of three
recently released prisoners of war in Yugoslavia, threw out the
ceremonial first pitch and watched the game from general manager
Kevin Malone's private box.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also presented Ramirez, 24, an East Los Angeles
native, with a lifetime pass to Dodger Stadium. Before the game
Ramirez toured the clubhouse with Malone and met the players and
manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez spent 32 days as a prisoner of war before being released
from captivity last Wednesday. He has been in the Army for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort
will make his scheduled start tonight. Team doctors gave him the
go-ahead after a CAT scan revealed there was no further damage to
his right shin. Dreifort, who had surgery on the leg during the
offseason to relieve shin splints, experienced swelling after his
last start. He said the condition is painful, but he'll pitch
through it. ``The only thing you can do (to relieve the pain) is
shut it down, and that ain't happening,'' Dreifort said. . . . Jose
Vizcaino made his eighth start in nine games, this time at
shortstop. Before the game, Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek was
hitting grounders to Kevin Brown at shortstop in an effort to hit
down on the ball and eliminate pop-ups. Grudzielanek went 0 for 5
with five fly outs in his last start and 64 percent of his outs
have come via strikeout or by hitting the ball in the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To misquote Humphrey Bogart: ``Of all the embassies in all the
cities in all the world, we had to hit that one'' _ the mission in
Belgrade of China, the country, after Russia, whose consent is most
vital if a United Nations resolution imposing a Kosovo settlement
is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But, remarkably, the signs last night were that the diplomatic
destruction wrought by the misdirected bomb might be less
devastating than initially feared.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, on both sides of the Atlantic a damage limitation
exercise was in full swing, even as the air strikes continued
during the weekend, primarily against communications targets.
</P>
<P>
   As British Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a written apology to
Beijing for NATO's bombing blunder, diplomats labored to ensure
that the outline agreement for a settlement secured last week by
the foreign ministers of the leading Western powers and Russia was
not imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful note, perhaps, lay in what the Chinese
authorities did not say. For all their country's outrage at a ``war
crime'' in which at least three people died, Vice President Hu
Jintao insisted that China would maintain its policy of opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Above all he gave no hint whatsoever that China was
contemplating direct diplomatic retaliation related to Kosovo _ the
nightmare scenario which must have flashed across the minds of a
thousand Western officials when they first heard the calamitously
embarrassing news of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   All along it had been assumed that notwithstanding its right of
veto in the Security Council, Beijing had no desire to become
directly embroiled in a crisis 6,000 miles away, in which it had no
direct stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deal's good enough for the Russians, it'll be good
enough for the Chinese,'' was the typical prediction of one NATO
official last week, after the outline plan agreed in Germany by the
G-8.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy bombing threatened to change that calculation _
and indeed still might, if the measured official reaction in
Beijing fails to keep demonstrations against American and British
missions under control.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the Chinese leadership might have no choice but to
be obstructive in the U.N. over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hope however is that once the indignation subsides, the
Chinese will act according to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership wants a decent relationship with the U.S.,''
one diplomat said, ``not least because China badly wants to join
the World Trade Organization, something for which Washington's
support is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally reassuring, Russia's commitment to the G-8 deal does not
seem to have been soured by the bombing, despite a predictably
scathing condemnation from Moscow, and the abrupt cancellation by
Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister, of a weekend trip to Britain for
talks with the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   After talks in Germany with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder on
Saturday, Moscow's envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke by phone with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be a meeting with Strobe Talbott, the U.S.
deputy secretary of state, in Moscow Tuesday, after which
Chernomyrdin said he would be taking ``concrete proposals'' to the
Yugoslav leader before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``New, very important, developments connected to the Balkan
settlement'' had emerged, he cryptically declared on his return to
Moscow Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that a draft U.N. resolution could still
be forthcoming within a fortnight, as diplomats had hoped before
the Chinese embassy uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s newly appointed envoy, the former Swedish Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, met Chernomyrdin in Germany. Sunday night he
met the French President Jacques Chirac in Paris, before holding
talks Monday in London with Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attempts to portray this activity as ``business
as usual,'' the incident will surely affect the dynamics of the
search for an agreed U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   However fleetingly, President Milosevic's hand has been
strengthened. Public support in the West for the bombing campaign
may falter, and the standing of the Russians has been indirectly
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   These considerations may make it harder still to come up with a
formula which satisfies NATO, above all on the terms for a halt in
the bombing and on the makeup of the international force to enter
Kosovo to keep the peace and allow more than 700,000 refugees to
return home. &QL;

   For the alliance, the ``effective international civil and

involve a well-armed force, with a NATO ``core'' and under NATO

<TEXT>
<P>
   To misquote Humphrey Bogart: ``Of all the embassies in all the
cities in all the world, we had to hit that one'' _ the mission in
Belgrade of China, the country, after Russia, whose consent is most
vital if a United Nations resolution imposing a Kosovo settlement
is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But, remarkably, the signs last night were that the diplomatic
destruction wrought by the misdirected bomb might be less
devastating than initially feared.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, on both sides of the Atlantic a damage limitation
exercise was in full swing, even as the air strikes continued
during the weekend, primarily against communications targets.
</P>
<P>
   As British Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a written apology to
Beijing for NATO's bombing blunder, diplomats labored to ensure
that the outline agreement for a settlement secured last week by
the foreign ministers of the leading Western powers and Russia was
not imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful note, perhaps, lay in what the Chinese
authorities did not say. For all their country's outrage at a ``war
crime'' in which at least three people died, Vice President Hu
Jintao insisted that China would maintain its policy of opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Above all he gave no hint whatsoever that China was
contemplating direct diplomatic retaliation related to Kosovo _ the
nightmare scenario which must have flashed across the minds of a
thousand Western officials when they first heard the calamitously
embarrassing news of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   All along it had been assumed that notwithstanding its right of
veto in the Security Council, Beijing had no desire to become
directly embroiled in a crisis 6,000 miles away, in which it had no
direct stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deal's good enough for the Russians, it'll be good
enough for the Chinese,'' was the typical prediction of one NATO
official last week, after the outline plan agreed in Germany by the
G-8.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy bombing threatened to change that calculation _
and indeed still might, if the measured official reaction in
Beijing fails to keep demonstrations against American and British
missions under control.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the Chinese leadership might have no choice but to
be obstructive in the U.N. over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hope however is that once the indignation subsides, the
Chinese will act according to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership wants a decent relationship with the U.S.,''
one diplomat said, ``not least because China badly wants to join
the World Trade Organization, something for which Washington's
support is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally reassuring, Russia's commitment to the G-8 deal does not
seem to have been soured by the bombing, despite a predictably
scathing condemnation from Moscow, and the abrupt cancellation by
Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister, of a weekend trip to Britain for
talks with the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   After talks in Germany with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder on
Saturday, Moscow's envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke by phone with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be a meeting with Strobe Talbott, the U.S.
deputy secretary of state, in Moscow Tuesday, after which
Chernomyrdin said he would be taking ``concrete proposals'' to the
Yugoslav leader before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``New, very important, developments connected to the Balkan
settlement'' had emerged, he cryptically declared on his return to
Moscow Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that a draft U.N. resolution could still
be forthcoming within a fortnight, as diplomats had hoped before
the Chinese embassy uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s newly appointed envoy, the former Swedish Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, met Chernomyrdin in Germany. Sunday night he
met the French President Jacques Chirac in Paris, before holding
talks Monday in London with Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attempts to portray this activity as ``business
as usual,'' the incident will surely affect the dynamics of the
search for an agreed U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   However fleetingly, President Milosevic's hand has been
strengthened. Public support in the West for the bombing campaign
may falter, and the standing of the Russians has been indirectly
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   These considerations may make it harder still to come up with a
formula which satisfies NATO, above all on the terms for a halt in
the bombing and on the makeup of the international force to enter
Kosovo to keep the peace and allow more than 700,000 refugees to
return home. &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ The question was serious, but the answer came back
with a full, shoulder-heaving laugh.
</P>
<P>
   No, replied the senior NATO diplomat, the alliance had not made
contact with dissident elements in Belgrade: ``Quite frankly,'' he
said, ``we are not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost seven weeks into the bombing campaign a sudden outburst
of frankness has struck NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to avoid the self-criticism last week when the
organization's most senior military official, General Klaus
Naumann, sparked a debate about its frailties in an unusually blunt
farewell press conference.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, he said, had failed in its initial conflict aims,
squandered its chances of surprising the Yugoslav army and needed
``to find a way to reconcile the conditions of a coalition war with
the principles of military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   This profound soul-searching is, however, only half the picture.
NATO's top brass have not just admitted their weaknesses, but have
begun to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in an unexpectedly protracted air campaign, the
alliance's lethargic military bureaucracy has had to adapt to
survive. And NATO has done so by expanding its responsibilities,
beefing up its diplomacy and aiming to forge a new, transnational
political entity.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, in the aftermath of the Cold War, the
alliance had been searching for a role and, ahead of last month's
Washington summit, the organization was busy debating its mission
statement, or ``strategic concept.''
</P>
<P>
   As one NATO diplomat put it: ``Suddenly Kosovo appears and
presents NATO with a hothouse flower. Theories had been going
around about what will be required in the Europe in the coming
century _ and then it presents itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation has proved more successful than theory. NATO's
immediate decision to assume humanitarian work was, in the words of
one senior diplomat, ``extraordinarily successful in responding
quickly to a situation which was overwhelming the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees and the other agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the public gaze, NATO embarked on an escalation of
diplomacy and a politicization which had not been foreseen before
the Kosovo campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The central task was to keep the alliance together. Through
astute stewardship and skillful avoidance of the most divisive
issues, the 19 member states have stayed reasonably united _
despite the fact that in one of their number _ Greece _ 96 percent
of the population oppose the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy has been active within the alliance, it has
extended well beyond it too. Javier Solana, NATO's secretary
general, was the first to hold high-profile meetings with
politicians from countries neighboring Yugoslavia, cajoling
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania into handing over their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been visits to the region from British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
U.S. General Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are even some worries that Yugoslavia's neighbors
are experiencing ``VIP fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has NATO been afraid to improvise on the diplomatic side,
particularly in the case of Macedonia. As one senior diplomat put
it: ``The Macedonian government has been very uncomfortable about
the volume of refugees it was receiving and worried about the
ethnic balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some worry about the presence of NATO troops in
Macedonia, but also a feeling that the country was not getting its
payoff in terms of cash, security guarantees and pledges on NATO
and EU membership.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the solution NATO installed its own representative in
Skopje, Hans Eiff, Bonn's former ambassador to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   On the global stage NATO has acted as a clearinghouse for
international efforts. Again the process has been pragmatic, with
the alliance's key member states applying pressure through the
different bodies to which they are affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The oil embargo against Yugoslavia, for example, was initiated
by the European Union, thanks to British, French and Dutch
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to bind the Russians and the United Nations to a peace
proposal compatible with NATO's five conditions was brokered with
German help through the Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are pursuing these plans through a variety of
forums,'' said one official, ``but the ideas are coming out of
NATO.'' &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   All of this is part of a wider awakening. NATO was always a
marriage of military and political structures, but the civilian
side was muted during the Cold War because the objectives were
consensual ones. The case for the air bombardment has taken much
more selling.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the media war has been given a new priority,
boosted by the influx of a new unit, equipping the alliance with
all the expertise now available to modern political parties when
they fight elections.
</P>
<P>
   A team of around seven full-time press officers and 23
back-office and technical staff has been augmented by another 30
personnel, linking the civilian and military machines and
coordinating with the important NATO capitals.
</P>
<P>
   And the pursuit of NATO's ``message'' has been taken to new
rhetorical heights. In the process the familiar separation in which
the military handle the weaponry and the politicians, who deploy
the rhetoric, has all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, this recent condemnation of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic: ``Those of us who have grown up in liberal
democracies have had a hard time truly appreciating what is
happening right now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grand combination of terror and ethnic cleansing on a
vast scale, it's being perpetrated largely against defenseless
civilians by the last vestige of a Communist dictatorship in
Europe. Man does not do this to his fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was delivered not by a political leader but by
General Clark.
</P>
<P>
   While the military results in Kosovo may have been
disappointing, NATO as an organization has undoubtedly been
energized. The downside to this expanded new role is that the
stakes have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has,'' said one diplomat last week, ``very much defined
the new NATO and this is why everyone is determined to see it
through. If this is what we say we are all about, and then we don't
do it, we will have proven our ineffectiveness.'' &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ One unremarkable rectangular building of the type to be
found in any modern city, with windows of blue mirrored glass, and
a red flag with five golden stars flying from its roof.
</P>
<P>
   Three bombs dropped by a single aircraft, possibly an American
B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, the most expensive aircraft mankind has
ever built, costing $2 billion a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The result: just possibly the beginning of the end of NATO's
attempt to impose its will over Kosovo by force.
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlantic alliance, Monday was the most ominous day yet
in the campaign it launched seven weeks ago with the noblest of
motives, to put an end to the monstrous repression of the Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   An American president vacillates. Britain's government faces its
strongest domestic criticism yet. The German government trembles,
its ruling coalition strained close to breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing his opponents' vulnerability, Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic opens the bidding for a negotiated end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO's attempts to steer a settlement onto the safer ground
of the United Nations now risk being held hostage by Russia and
China, two great powers that have occasionally been its friends,
but by history and world outlook, are instinctively its
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The air strike against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade confirms
the first law of those who adhere to the screw-up theory in life:
the more sophisticated the means at hand (in this case the
intelligence-gathering capability of the CIA), the more elementary
is likely to be the inevitable mistake (in this case, it would
appear, relying on an out-of-date map. Alas, if only someone had
slipped out to buy a ``Fodor's Yugoslavia 1999'' guide).
</P>
<P>
   It also constitutes an astonishing turning point in a war that
has already seen several of them.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign that NATO misguidedly thought would wrap up
matters in a few days has succeeded in transforming a dirty little
conflict in a benighted southeastern corner of Europe into a world
war.
</P>
<P>
   Not of course a world war in the sense of the one ignited by
other Balkan goings-on 85 years ago _ but in the geographic sense
of a European war whose successful prosecution may now depend upon
decisions taken 6,000 miles away in the Far East, by a country that
until Friday night had only the most academic of interest of what
was happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At first, as rioting swept the streets around the American,
British and other NATO-country missions in Beijing, the Chinese
seemed to be walking a deliberate tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   China sanctioned the protests, even breaking off trade and
security talks with the U.S., but stopped short of threatening to
interfere in the crucial work at the U.N., where of course they
have the right of veto.
</P>
<P>
   That fond hope vanished Monday as Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president, declared that unless the alliance first stopped the
bombing, Beijing would prevent the U.N. Security Council from even
discussing a plan to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly, NATO sticks to its mantra: the air strikes go on
until Milosevic ``demonstrably'' starts to withdraw all his troops
from the province.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, with malign and practiced timing, the Yugoslav
president delivers a new gambit _ announcing a partial troop
withdrawal, as of Sunday evening, that apparently would reduce
their number to that of the eve of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the U.S. and Germany instantly rejected the concession
as too little, insisting the strikes would continue until NATO's
five conditions were met. But doubts may have been sown, widening
the cracks on NATO's home front. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 300 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the Commons since the war began,
bipartisanship splintered Monday as the Conservative Shadow Foreign
Secretary Michael Howard called the embassy bombing as an act of
``gross incompetence'' and suggesting that ``the action is being
made up as we go along and has not been properly thought through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Labour's indignation was predictable. Even so, in the
country which has consistently been most hawkish on Kosovo, the
exchange was noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, the cracks are visible and gaping. A
malicious fate has decreed that the first NATO leader in Beijing
since the fiasco will be Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, fighting to
keep an ever more rebellious Green party within his government.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, who has been peremptorily told to leave behind the
imposing delegation of businessmen that was to accompany him, and
to come for just one day instead of five, will undoubtedly be sent
home with an unnerving scolding.
</P>
<P>
   All this too, on the eve of a special Green party conference
that at the very least will vent fierce misgivings at the war _
misgivings now shared by a section of the Chancellor's own Social
Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
   If public skepticism in Britain is starting to grow, in Germany
it is becoming deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ground war which offers the best guarantee of NATO
securing its five points, looks less likely than ever. If the
Kosovo refugees are to start going home before the winter, a land
operation must start by the end of July at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, despite an extra 1,000 troops here, an extra 2000
there, no coherent buildup appears to have even begun. Given the
required lead time of at least two months, May 31 constitutes a
kind of deadline. Almost certainly, it will not be met. &QL;

<P>
   ``A kind of Catch-22 prevails,'' notes Anatole Lieven of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ``The air
war is becoming increasingly unpopular, but _ with the possible
exception of Britain _ no one is getting more enthusiastic about a
ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   That bleak analysis applies above all to the U.S., without whose
participation a ground war is inconceivable. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, malicious fate has also decreed that America's leader
should be a man disqualified by his own record from leading the
country into a conflict where lives will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   So the chimera will be pursued, of a war which must be won
comprehensively, but without Western casualties. Ineluctably, the
trail is leading to the U.N., whose cover even NATO countries
accept is essential for the diplomatic endgame to be played out.
</P>
<P>
   Short of popular uprising in Belgrade, or a bomb on Milosevic as
lucky as the one on the Chinese embassy was unlucky, it is far
harder to construct a scenario for NATO securing the terms it is
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Almost impudently, Slobodan Milosevic, responsible for savagery
unknown in Europe for 50 years, ignores the West's demands for a
strongly armed, NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   His latest offer, relayed via Yasushi Akashi, the former U.N.
envoy to Yugoslavia, apparently is acceptance of a U.N.-led force,
lightly armed, and containing no soldiers from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The allies doggedly insist that American, British and French
forces will be at its core, but even with an ambiguous U.N.
resolution, the chances of their having their way have surely been
diminished by the events of the last 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, has
acquired fresh weight. Subtly, he has been transformed from NATO's
mailman to Milosevic, into a potential independent peacemaker, with
new room to navigate between the two sides _ his own calls for an
end to the bombing now reinforced by the president of distant
China. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO may yet prevail. But a trio of bombs on a building in
Belgrade has made the task infinitely more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If only someone had bought a Fodor's. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Q: WHY HAVE THE CHINESE TURNED AGAINST THEIR FORMER ALBANIAN
COMRADES? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: The stoning of the Albanian embassy in Beijing by Chinese
protesters would have astonished Albania's former leader, Enver
Hoxha. Furious with Nikita Khrushchev's liberalizing policies in
the Soviet Union, and with his attacks on Stalin, Albania's former
Communist dictator for four decades made Tirana a lonely Maoist
outpost in the Russian-dominated Communist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically the KLA guerrillas fighting Serb troops in Kosovo are
often still using the atrociously poor quality guns that China's
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung supplied to his Albanian ally.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing remains of the strange Chinese-Albanian alliance.
After Mao's death, and China's tentative moves towards
liberalization, Albania was left alone to carry the banner for
Stalinist orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hoxha died in 1985 and the Communist system collapsed
in 1990, Albania turned to the West.
</P>
<P>
   China, meanwhile, has also radically changed its Balkan
priorities. While Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito lived, it despised his
brand of Communism as a heresy. But today it cherishes Yugoslavia
as an ally against America.
</P>
<P>
   In the wars that have pitted Belgrade against secessionists in
Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Beijing staunchly supported the
central government against breakaway forces. Now Beijing is furious
with Albania for encouraging the West to intervene militarily in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: DO ALBANIANS LOOK LIKE SERBS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. Of course the differences are only approximate but it is
often very easy to tell a Serb from an Albanian in Kosovo long
before he or she opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs often have black or dark brown hair and are generally
darker and more heavily built than Albanians. Their appearance is
fairly typical of southern Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Kosovars look Celtic. They have curly hair,
which is often blonde or rust-colored, and their skin tends to be
very pale and covered in freckles. Their eyes are often green or
blue and their build is much more slender than that of the Serbs.
They have longer heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that they look so different as they belong
to different races that have very rarely intermarried. &QL;

   &UR; Q: WHY HAVE THE CHINESE TURNED AGAINST THEIR FORMER ALBANIAN
COMRADES? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: The stoning of the Albanian embassy in Beijing by Chinese
protesters would have astonished Albania's former leader, Enver
Hoxha. Furious with Nikita Khrushchev's liberalizing policies in
the Soviet Union, and with his attacks on Stalin, Albania's former
Communist dictator for four decades made Tirana a lonely Maoist
outpost in the Russian-dominated Communist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically the KLA guerrillas fighting Serb troops in Kosovo are
often still using the atrociously poor quality guns that China's
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung supplied to his Albanian ally.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing remains of the strange Chinese-Albanian alliance.
After Mao's death, and China's tentative moves towards
liberalization, Albania was left alone to carry the banner for
Stalinist orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hoxha died in 1985 and the Communist system collapsed
in 1990, Albania turned to the West.
</P>
<P>
   China, meanwhile, has also radically changed its Balkan
priorities. While Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito lived, it despised his
brand of Communism as a heresy. But today it cherishes Yugoslavia
as an ally against America.
</P>
<P>
   In the wars that have pitted Belgrade against secessionists in
Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Beijing staunchly supported the
central government against breakaway forces. Now Beijing is furious
with Albania for encouraging the West to intervene militarily in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: DO ALBANIANS LOOK LIKE SERBS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. Of course the differences are only approximate but it is
often very easy to tell a Serb from an Albanian in Kosovo long
before he or she opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs often have black or dark brown hair and are generally
darker and more heavily built than Albanians. Their appearance is
fairly typical of southern Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Kosovars look Celtic. They have curly hair,
which is often blonde or rust-colored, and their skin tends to be
very pale and covered in freckles. Their eyes are often green or
blue and their build is much more slender than that of the Serbs.
They have longer heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that they look so different as they belong
to different races that have very rarely intermarried. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ If a week is a long time in politics, 36 hours is an
eternity in war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, the West achieved its biggest diplomatic
success since the Kosovo conflict began, drawing Russia into the
outline of a deal which could force Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday night, an errant NATO missile scored the most
devastating target imaginable _ a direct hit on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At a stroke the painstaking feat of the diplomats had been at
the least imperiled, conceivably reduced to as much rubble as
China's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The war that, after almost seven weeks, had seemed to be gaining
a purpose, now appeared to be back to bombing for bombing's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 extra American warplanes are being sent to the
front-line, in furtherance of an implausible strategy of blowing up
power stations, bridges (and now foreign embassies) in the name of
saving a province in the south of Yugoslavia that had already been
reduced to an almost uninhabited wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO capitals and on the floor of the U.N. in New York, the
diplomats and politicians who should have been concentrating on
building a watertight accord with the Russians have been forced to
devote their energies to apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   And not just for the debacle at the Chinese embassy. Obscured by
Saturday's diplomatic pandemonium was the small matter of the
cluster bombing which killed a dozen people in a residential area
in Nis, the third largest city of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however absurdly, supposed to be a ``humane'' bombing
campaign. But for the distraction of the embassy hit, more people
might have asked why NATO was using cluster bombs designed to
terrorize and kill people _ and not on a battlefield, but close to
a densely populated civilian area.
</P>
<P>
   NATO now can only hope that indignation at its dreadful blunder
will quickly subside, allowing the diplomatic process to resume.
That may yet happen. But the process was never going to be simple.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement in principle reached in Germany by the foreign
ministers of the Group of Seven leading Western powers and Russia
is merely a road map to a settlement, which omits a host of hazards
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several weeks before a detailed offer is ready to
present to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Nonetheless, the
satisfaction etched on the faces of British Foreign Minister Robin
Cook and his colleagues on Thursday as they left the imposing
Petersberg residence, high above the Rhine near Bonn, was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   It is not because they possess nuclear weapons, or because they
might join the war on Yugoslavia's side, or because they are the
one country Milosevic listens to, that the Russians matter in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They matter because they hold the key which opens the door to
U.N. involvement in the crisis. From the outset it was clear, even
to NATO hawks such as Britain, that a lasting Kosovo settlement
could only come under the aegis of the U.N. That, however, meant
heading off the threat of a Russian veto in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the G8 deal has done this. The road map no longer
points to endless NATO bombing, followed by a creeping occupation
of Kosovo, of dubious international legality. Instead, a
copper-bottomed U.N. resolution beckons, perhaps within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbia is to lose Kosovo, Russia as well as Milosevic would
far prefer to lose it to an ``interim'' mandate of the U.N. than to
a de facto NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   But now everything is more uncertain. The real question is not
the destination, but whether the road to it is passable. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Petersberg was a major setback for Milosevic. If he had banked
on using the Russians as a diplomatic shield against the need to
make concessions, he had miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the Russian shift were equally clear. Virtually
isolated in its previous support for Serbia, Moscow would have had
scant chance of securing the international financial aid it so
desperately needs, had it persisted in blocking progress.
</P>
<P>
   Far less clear was whether the price of getting the Russians on
board was too high _ whether unity on the U.N. Security Council
perforce means a fudge that lets Milosevic off the hook, and hands
NATO a ``victory'' that is really a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The strike on the Chinese embassy has redoubled these
uncertainties. Russia may be less inclined to cooperate, and now
Peking's veto power on the U.N. Security Council is a factor which
must be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Even harder to quantify is the effect on public opinion;
conceivably, Friday night's debacle could contribute to a fatal
undermining of support for the war.
</P>
<P>
   The details too will be tricky, none more so than the makeup of
the peacekeeping force that will move into Kosovo and shepherd
700,000 or more returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By speaking of ``effective international civil and security
presences,'' the foreign ministers left the question open. But a
gulf remains between the positions of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Though the alliance agrees that the force may be designated a
U.N. force, it is adamant that at its heart must be NATO troops,
wielding heavy NATO firepower, working within an exclusively NATO
command structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as that's understood, it doesn't matter what we call
the force,'' a senior alliance diplomat says, citing the example of
the SFOR contingent, U.N.-wrapped but NATO-filled, which has kept
the peace in Bosnia for four years.
</P>
<P>
   From Belgrade, however, there have been only hints of
acknowledgement that an armed international force is inevitable _
and not the slightest sign that a single NATO soldier should be
allowed in its number.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, said on Thursday that
Yugoslavia must approve the composition of whatever force does move
in, an indication perhaps that Moscow's conversion to Western
arguments is less than complete. And that was before the Chinese
embassy strike.
</P>
<P>
   All hinges on the fudge word ``effective,'' apparently inserted
by Cook to ensure an agreed outcome. But when the drafters start
writing a U.N. resolution and its detailed annexes, the issue will
have to be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Ivanov were to have met in Edinburgh this weekend, and
might have sorted it out, but the bombing in Belgrade has blown
their talks away. &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Europe has put a price of up to $3.5 billion on
rebuilding Kosovo, and highlighted the need for immediate
preparations so that reconstruction can start as soon as there is a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission has also estimated that the cost of
catering for the 700,000 refugees in the region will range from
$340 million to $780 million, depending on the length of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected Europe to provide 50-60 percent of
the funds, a figure in line with the aid given to Bosnia after the
1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting of finance ministers several governments,
including that of Holland, argued that the money should come from
within existing spending plans _ the first indications of the
political sensitivities surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission's analysis points to one central difficulty in
channelling aid to Kosovo and to the republic of Montenegro, which
has taken in about 70,000 refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since neither is a sovereign country, neither is eligible for
membership of the International Monetary Fund and hence not for
membership of the World Bank,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The document puts the estimated costs of reconstruction in
Kosovo at ``$2-3.5 billion over perhaps three years.''
</P>
<P>
   It warns: ``Since Kosovo is likely to enjoy a significant degree
of political and administrative autonomy, significant resources
will have to be directed to rehabilitate or create from scratch the
necessary institutions within the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says economic assistance may need to extend to
countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   It adds: ``Preparations should begin immediately so that, as
soon as there is cease-fire the EU and the rest of the
international community is able to put in place within a short
space of time a priority reconstruction programme with financing
assured for at least the first three months and committed for the
first year.''

   BRUSSELS _ Europe has put a price of up to $3.5 billion on
rebuilding Kosovo, and highlighted the need for immediate
preparations so that reconstruction can start as soon as there is a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission has also estimated that the cost of
catering for the 700,000 refugees in the region will range from
$340 million to $780 million, depending on the length of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected Europe to provide 50-60 percent of
the funds, a figure in line with the aid given to Bosnia after the
1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting of finance ministers several governments,
including that of Holland, argued that the money should come from
within existing spending plans _ the first indications of the
political sensitivities surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission's analysis points to one central difficulty in
channelling aid to Kosovo and to the republic of Montenegro, which
has taken in about 70,000 refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since neither is a sovereign country, neither is eligible for
membership of the International Monetary Fund and hence not for
membership of the World Bank,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The document puts the estimated costs of reconstruction in
Kosovo at ``$2-3.5 billion over perhaps three years.''
</P>
<P>
   It warns: ``Since Kosovo is likely to enjoy a significant degree
of political and administrative autonomy, significant resources
will have to be directed to rehabilitate or create from scratch the
necessary institutions within the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says economic assistance may need to extend to
countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   It adds: ``Preparations should begin immediately so that, as
soon as there is cease-fire the EU and the rest of the
international community is able to put in place within a short
space of time a priority reconstruction programme with financing
assured for at least the first three months and committed for the
first year.''

<P>
   In any war, the wrong targets are going to be hit and civilians
are going to be killed, but in this war the misjudgements and
mistakes just keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one building in Belgrade we would like not to have
hit, it was the Chinese embassy,'' a Foreign Office official
admitted on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply a matter of faulty intelligence. The use of
cluster bombs _ which are designed to maximize casualties _ in a
residential area of Nis was a terrible mistake. The bombing of the
Serbian television station likewise, and that was a quite
deliberate target.
</P>
<P>
   This was the biggest blunder yet, however, because it threatens
the diplomatic house of cards so carefully constructed over the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The wooing of the Russians last week had a twin purpose: to
sideline Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's only significant
external ally, and to remove the Russian veto on the U.N. Security
Council, thus allowing U.N. authorization for ground forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But that, in turn, depended on the Chinese veto staying out of
the fray. The assumption was that China would not block NATO if
Russia did not, but that was always a doubtful assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership has its own particular reasons for
regarding as sacrosanct the principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign states. It is especially keen to keep
the sensitive issue of Tibet out of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is no hope at all of Chinese acquiescence at the U.N.
in the short term, as the government in Beijing tries to ride the
anger of its own people _ not that there is anything especially
oriental or inscrutable about it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the British (or American) response if China had
accidentally killed three people in one of our embassies.
</P>
<P>
   All of Tony Blair's kowtowing to Zhu Rongji, the Chinese premier
whom our prime minister described as a fellow modernizer, is
unlikely to weigh much in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Britain helped to block a resolution
attacking China's human rights record at a United Nations
conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   And last week Downing Street made it clear that when Blair met
the Dalai Lama, they would be talking about reincarnation and
Christian-Buddhist relations, and definitely not the ``doctrine of
international community,'' as outlined by the prime minister in an
important speech in Chicago last month.
</P>
<P>
   Funny that, because the parallels between the situation in
Kosovo and that in Tibet are inescapable. Indeed, the case for
intervening in Tibet is rather stronger.
</P>
<P>
   It was, unlike Kosovo, a sovereign nation, annexed in 1951. It
does not contain religious sites of national significance to the
Chinese. And its national leader has pursued a model campaign of
nonviolence in pursuit of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it must be said that the Western failure to press the
cause of Tibet in no way undermines the moral foundations of the
attempt to halt ``ethnic cleansing'' in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important sub-clauses of the Blair doctrine is
the recognition that the failure to do good in one part of the
world does not excuse inaction in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to right every wrong that we see in the modern
world then we would do little else than intervene in the affairs of
other countries,'' as Blair put it in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That is absolutely right, and the complaint from the likes of
playwright Harold Pinter that the West should not act to defend the
Kosovar Albanians because it did nothing for the Kurds or the
Rwandan Tutsis should be robustly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the sub-clause cannot be extended to the point where the
West is selling out the rights of the Tibetans in order to keep
China on board for U.N. action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Blair should have taken a more robust line on Tibet. He could
have argued that a policy of pragmatic appeasement was more likely
to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. The bombing of the Chinese embassy of Belgrade has
not simply set back the cause in Kosovo: it threatens the cause of
human rights in China and Tibet as well. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Saturday that it was
one of the tragic accidents of war, but the NATO bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   It was an act of monumental incompetence in a war that has been
characterized from the start by military bungling and political
cowardice _ or, in the case of Tony Blair, political recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   This war began in folly, it has proceeded in folly, and now,
following the G8 meeting on Thursday, looks as though it may end
not in outright victory for NATO but in a peace settlement with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However humiliating, a peace deal is better than a war that has
aggravated the very evil it sought to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy, while shocking, should not have
surprised us unduly, however. Most of NATO's bombs have found their
targets, but too many have not.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence sources must have known that the Chinese embassy
was dangerously close to its Friday night targets, and that the
embassy staff were living as well as working there.
</P>
<P>
   There could have been few more sensitive sites. China is a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, whose support
Western leaders decided last week they needed if they were to make
their new seven-point peace plan acceptable to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member, China has veto rights on any U.N.
decision. Until now the assumption was that Peking would not
exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Chinese government has been especially
hostile to the NATO action in Yugoslavia; with its own troops
occupying Tibet, it does not relish the precedent of the West
intervening inside other people's national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion is behind its government; the Chinese
press depicts President Bill Clinton with a Hitler moustache and
points out that the words Nato and Nazi are similar in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   But China usually exercises its veto only when its national
interests are directly threatened. It was assumed that the Russians
could persuade the Chinese to, at least, stay silent in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's bombs may have shattered more than an embassy
building. And the longer the bombing continues, the more
complicated things will become.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs have resolved nothing. As we predicted at the
beginning of this war, they have failed utterly in their original
intention of preventing a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has little credibility left. There can be no justification
for the use of cluster bombs, and none for hitting TV stations,
electricity plants and other targets that will deprive the ordinary
people of Serbia food, fuel and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO has had to resort to nonviolent measures, like the oil
embargo and the diplomatic moves to bring Russia on side, which
ought to have been tried before the bombers were scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not come well out of all this. His government last
week passed the second anniversary of its arrival in office. Such a
milestone ought to have been the occasion for a measured review of
his not inconsiderable achievements.
</P>
<P>
   His party, though it lost seats in the local elections, retained
a percentage of the vote which was enviable for this point in the
lifetime of a parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His policy in Northern Ireland, though a settlement has proved
elusive, maintains the peace, which is no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of Europe has, with a few exceptions, proved
sure-footed. He has followed through on devolution, though we have
yet to see how willing he will prove to cede control behind the
scenes. His approach to welfare reform seems generally sound.
</P>
<P>
   But any review of the comparative successes of his first two
years must now be overshadowed by the way he has propelled the
country into what may prove its greatest foreign policy blunder
since Suez.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has been a hawk among the Western leaders. U.S. President
Bill Clinton has constantly cast one eye back to a reluctant
Congress, and an American public among which what little support
there ever was for ground troops has fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   The German Chancellor has hesitated too, as public opinion
becomes increasingly hostile to the bombing. Only Blair's
hawkishness seems to have increased as the conflict has progressed.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the embassy bombs fell his vocabulary got even
stronger; he made repeated comparisons to ``Hitler's evil regime''
and talked of Victory in Europe Day and the challenge our parents'
generation faced.
</P>
<P>
   He could not, he later said, see a future for Serbia under
Milosevic _ against whom he said there was ``serious evidence'' of
war crimes. ``I'm not sitting down and dealing with Milosevic,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   All this is an unwarranted gamble. Important differences of
detail remained unresolved in the G8's document of ``seven agreed
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible of course that Milosevic might back down; if so
it will probably be Russian diplomacy which is accorded the
success.
</P>
<P>
   A second option is that Milosevic might remain defiant, deciding
like Saddam Hussein that a military defeat could bring him domestic
political victory; for the hawks of NATO that might secure the
reverse _ military victory but political defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely now is some kind of fudge. That's where we are after
seven weeks of bombing, God knows how many deaths and the creation
of almost a million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The war should never have been launched, as we have argued from
the start. Serbia, of course, cannot win in all this, but it is not
inconceivable that the hawks of NATO, Blair foremost among them,
might yet lose. &QL;

aggravated the very evil it sought to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy, while shocking, should not have
surprised us unduly, however. Most of NATO's bombs have found their
targets, but too many have not.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence sources must have known that the Chinese embassy
was dangerously close to its Friday night targets, and that the
embassy staff were living as well as working there.
</P>
<P>
   There could have been few more sensitive sites. China is a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, whose support
Western leaders decided last week they needed if they were to make
their new seven-point peace plan acceptable to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member, China has veto rights on any U.N.
decision. Until now the assumption was that Peking would not
exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Chinese government has been especially
hostile to the NATO action in Yugoslavia; with its own troops
occupying Tibet, it does not relish the precedent of the West
intervening inside other people's national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion is behind its government; the Chinese
press depicts President Bill Clinton with a Hitler moustache and
points out that the words Nato and Nazi are similar in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   But China usually exercises its veto only when its national
interests are directly threatened. It was assumed that the Russians
could persuade the Chinese to, at least, stay silent in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's bombs may have shattered more than an embassy
building. And the longer the bombing continues, the more
complicated things will become.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs have resolved nothing. As we predicted at the
beginning of this war, they have failed utterly in their original
intention of preventing a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has little credibility left. There can be no justification
for the use of cluster bombs, and none for hitting TV stations,
electricity plants and other targets that will deprive the ordinary
people of Serbia food, fuel and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO has had to resort to nonviolent measures, like the oil
embargo and the diplomatic moves to bring Russia on side, which
ought to have been tried before the bombers were scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not come well out of all this. His government last
week passed the second anniversary of its arrival in office. Such a
milestone ought to have been the occasion for a measured review of
his not inconsiderable achievements.
</P>
<P>
   His party, though it lost seats in the local elections, retained
a percentage of the vote which was enviable for this point in the
lifetime of a parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His policy in Northern Ireland, though a settlement has proved
elusive, maintains the peace, which is no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of Europe has, with a few exceptions, proved
sure-footed. He has followed through on devolution, though we have
yet to see how willing he will prove to cede control behind the
scenes. His approach to welfare reform seems generally sound.
</P>
<P>
   But any review of the comparative successes of his first two
years must now be overshadowed by the way he has propelled the
country into what may prove its greatest foreign policy blunder
since Suez.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has been a hawk among the Western leaders. U.S. President
Bill Clinton has constantly cast one eye back to a reluctant
Congress, and an American public among which what little support
there ever was for ground troops has fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   The German Chancellor has hesitated too, as public opinion
becomes increasingly hostile to the bombing. Only Blair's
hawkishness seems to have increased as the conflict has progressed.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the embassy bombs fell his vocabulary got even
stronger; he made repeated comparisons to ``Hitler's evil regime''
and talked of Victory in Europe Day and the challenge our parents'
generation faced.
</P>
<P>
   He could not, he later said, see a future for Serbia under
Milosevic _ against whom he said there was ``serious evidence'' of
war crimes. ``I'm not sitting down and dealing with Milosevic,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   All this is an unwarranted gamble. Important differences of
detail remained unresolved in the G8's document of ``seven agreed
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible of course that Milosevic might back down; if so
it will probably be Russian diplomacy which is accorded the
success.
</P>
<P>
   A second option is that Milosevic might remain defiant, deciding
like Saddam Hussein that a military defeat could bring him domestic
political victory; for the hawks of NATO that might secure the
reverse _ military victory but political defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely now is some kind of fudge. That's where we are after
seven weeks of bombing, God knows how many deaths and the creation
of almost a million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The war should never have been launched, as we have argued from
the start. Serbia, of course, cannot win in all this, but it is not
inconceivable that the hawks of NATO, Blair foremost among them,
might yet lose. &QL;

ARIZONA RELATIVES PREPARE FOR ARRIVAL OF REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vjollca Berisha's mind sometimes flashes to her missing
brother-in-law and uncle in Kosovo. They lived just three miles
from a village that was burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She hears of people being burned and worries, ``Maybe that might
have been them.''
</P>
<P>
   Berisha has filed papers so that 33 of her relatives _ &UR; including
her mother and three sisters, and her husband's parents and four
brothers _ can come to the Phoenix area and escape the tragedy that
is Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha, an Albanian, doesn't know how many may come, or when
they will arrive. All she can do is imagine the day when their long
journey to freedom brings them to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to touch them, hug them, just kind of look at
them to make sure they are alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Kosovo refugees may be headed for the Phoenix area,
and at least 84 have local relatives, who are cleaning out spare
bedrooms and planning favorite meals.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha said that at first her family didn't want to leave for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `We don't want to go anywhere.' We said,
`Just consider yourself a guest and you can go back when things get
better.' I think they're looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Berisha, who's over 40. She hasn't seen some relatives in
years, and wonders what they look like, how tall they are.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to explain the emotion, she says, the feeling of
relatives waiting to see whether their loved ones will be among
those brought to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they went through before they got to Macedonia.
We kept in touch very closely by phone,'' she said, though they
once lost contact for about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   There's celebration in knowing some relatives are alive, &UR; but
others have been missing since March.
</P>
<P>
   Even those that make the trip face many hurdles, from learning a
language to dealing with ``the horrible things they saw,'' Berisha
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Arben Rizvanolli, 35, an Albanian who has lived in Phoenix
for 12 years, it's the rumors and vague news reports coming out of
Kosovo that tear at his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he read on the Internet about a battle between the
Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbs, and he wonders about the fate
of his missing 40-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got killed,'' Rizvanolli said. ``Maybe he has joined
the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rizvanolli knows the plight of another brother, a cousin and
the man's wife and young children.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest days of the war, they escaped Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, with only the clothes on their backs and made it
to a home in Macedonia that they share with about 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   Rizvanolli says he expects them to be among the refugees headed
for the Phoenix area. For a time, they may all crowd into the
two-bedroom apartment Rizvanolli shares with his wife, Linda, son
and parents. Resettlement groups also have plans to temporarily
place refugees in apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just lucky they got out,'' Linda said of her
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She and her mother-in-law plan to welcome three relatives with a
menu of rice and hamburger rolled up in cabbage and a
``checkerboard'' cake for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Zuriya Amedovski, 44, of Phoenix, is cleaning out a bedroom and
planning to buy a bed for her cousin and the woman's two sons _
ages 13 and 16 _ who have been living in a Macedonian refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   She has not seen the cousin since she left Macedonia 18 years
ago, and knows little about what happened to them when the war
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her husband was killed by the Serbs,'' she said. ``But
she will tell me everything when she gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to introduce her family to freedom, she said: ``I will
teach them English. I will do everything they need and take them
everywhere they need to go. It is terrible what is happening over
there. It is the same like Hitler did.''
</P>
<P>
   While relatives are preparing for the refugees, so are
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   A Brownie troop is collecting toys. Businesses are donating new
clothes and kits of emergency supplies or hygiene products. Others
are offering jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Cultural Center said Scottsdale City Council
representatives called and said the council will try to provide
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural center said there will be a meeting Sunday at 9:30
a.m. in Cactus Park, near Cactus Road and 35th Avenue. Anyone is
welcome to donate items or to hear about what help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mary Barolli of the cultural center said another gathering is
planned soon: a large picnic in the park after the refugees arrive
to welcome them to town. &QL;

   KOSOVO-CHINA-STUDENTS (Beijing) _ Exactly 10 years ago, with
protesters in Tiananmen Square, a small grassy triangle in the
center of Beijing University became a shrine to democracy. In
recent years it had become a temple for the professions, filled
with notices about computers and exams. But in the last four days,
the plaza has been transformed anew, into a museum of frenzied

HIGH SCHOOL STRUCTURE A TIME BOMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Copyright 1999, Daily News of  Los Angeles 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES  &UR; -- &LR;  An underground electrical vault at the Belmont
Learning Complex lacks a ventilation system, literally creating a
``time bomb'' that could trigger an explosion of methane gas rising
from old petroleum wells beneath the site, the Los Angeles Daily
News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete vault houses electrical panels and switches for the
complex -- which, at more than $170 &UR;  &LR; million, is the nation's
costliest high school. It could fill with volatile vapors seeping
into it from the oil- and gas-contaminated site, state
environmental officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call it a time bomb,'' said Frank Simpson, a
spokesman for the state Department of Toxic Substances Control
(DTSC).
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district has made no allowance for venting the box
that is underground. There is a high degree or potential for
explosion at some time in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no precise measurements of the vapors in the
vault but state officials confirmed that volatile gasses are
seeping into it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the contractor, Turner/Kajima, did not return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District officials downplayed the
report but offered no explanation of how the vault could have been
built without ventilation or other safeguards to prevent an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed there is no electricity running through the vault
components because construction had been halted in February after a
long series of controversies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no ignition or explosion sources within the vault at
this time,'' said Erik Nasarenko, a spokesman for the district's
facilities division.
</P>
<P>
   Nasarenko said all construction at Belmont, including the vault,
stopped in February when the state launched its environmental
review of the school site. ``We are not going to proceed in any
respect with the vault without approval from the DTSC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 7 letter to Yi Hwa Kim, deputy director of the
district's environmental safety branch, the state advised that
inspectors ``observed potential ignition and explosion sources
within the vault.''
</P>
<P>
   One day later, in an internal office memo, state project manager
Jesus Sotelo noted that Turner/Kajima opted not to build the vault
with ``explosive proof'' electrical components. Without the more
expensive, but safer, components, sparks from electrical
connections and switches could ignite methane and hydrogen sulfide
vapors caught in the vault, Sotelo wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sotelo said Turner/Kajima never submitted plans to the state to
build the vault on the project, which has been beset by delays,
cost overruns and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nasarenko, state inspectors discovered the
potentially disastrous situation after Turner/Kajima asked
inspectors to allow them to complete the electrical power supply
system ``given its importance to the entire project.''
</P>
<P>
   That request was denied, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the ``time bomb'' problem raised new questions
about safety, planning and quality control on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what we'd find if state inspectors were constantly
down there,'' said board member David Tokofsky. ``This dripping out
of information runs the risk of not giving the state all the
information up front so the district and the agency can make a work
plan with controls and the proper safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't endanger the lives of children in a rush to get kids
off the bus and into a school with toxins,'' Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   David Koch, the district's chief administrative officer,
reiterated Tuesday night that the district plans to comply with the
state orders and will completely rebuild the vault or install a
ventilation system if ordered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   If electrical components are going to be placed into a
potentially explosive atmosphere, the state requires builders to
install explosion-proof fixtures, which cost up to 10 times more
than normal components. The requirement is only removed if a
builder can guarantee that there is no threat of an explosion
through ventilation methods, DTSC officials said. &QL;

SEATTLE OFFERING INCENTIVES TO LAND WNBA TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the American Basketball League abruptly shut down
last December, women's basketball fans in Seattle had one glimmer
of hope: The WNBA might expand its league here.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, city officials confirmed that hope is alive _ with
conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Schell has sent a letter to The Ackerley Group,
owners of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association
team, confirming the city is willing to sweeten the KeyArena lease
to minimize start-up costs for a new women's pro team.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if The Ackerley Group thinks the city is
offering enough. The Sonics owners did not respond to requests for
comment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard that we can pop the cork yet,'' said Seattle
Center Director Virginia Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Association is to announce four
expansion teams for the 2000 season before June 10, the start date
of the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has supported Seattle's interest in obtaining a WNBA
franchise _ with the Sonics apparently high on the list for a new
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league is very interested in Seattle,'' Anderson
said. ``We have a good building for basketball, and a good city for
supporting women's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell sent The Ackerley Group a letter of support on Tuesday to
demonstrate the city's enthusiasm to the NBA, which controls the
women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have the support of my colleagues on the City Council
in saying that the city welcomes the opportunity to be partners
with (the Sonics' marketing group) Full House in bringing the WNBA
to Seattle,'' Schell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the deal, Schell offered:
</P>
<P>
   - Reduced rent for all WNBA home dates to actual operating costs
plus $2,500, about a tenth of that paid by the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   - Giving all ticket and concession revenue to Full House.
</P>
<P>
   - Granting priority scheduling to the women's team during its
summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city would keep all parking and admission tax
revenue from WNBA games and control staffing.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Schell's letter gives the Sonics the green light to
tell WNBA officials that Seattle is ready for an expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long supported women's basketball, first at the
University of Washington and later with the American Basketball
League's pro team, the Reign. The Reign averaged about 3,900 fans
per game, with a record crowd of 7,358. The Sonics, by comparison,
commonly draw more than 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the city and the Sonics appear ready to partner
up for the new sports enterprise, city officials are concerned The
Ackerley Group is seeking something far more sweeping. All but four
of the 12 WNBA franchises have complete control of their arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics owners have been negotiating, so far without success,
for complete year-round control of KeyArena in exchange for a
guaranteed return to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Full House has been jockeying for months to take control of
KeyArena, sources say, and to scrap the 5-year-old deal between the
team and the city made after Sonics owner Barry Ackerley lost his
bid to build a privately owned arena south of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerley instead made a deal that renovated the deteriorated
Seattle Center Coliseum. To do it, the city sold $74 million in
bonds. Ackerley kicked in $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the city gets to keep most of the revenue, which so
far has covered the $7.5 million annual debt without a tax
increase. However, the NBA lockout this winter wiped out the city's
modest profit.
</P>
<P>
   If Ackerley is saying the city could have ``peace of mind'' in
handing over KeyArena in exchange for a guaranteed annual return,
city officials aren't buying it. City Councilwoman Tina Podlodowski
on Tuesday said any move in that direction would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council is very commited to bringing the WNBA,'' she
said. ``But if there are any other (conditions), we need to know
about them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Podlodowski said Full House has not formally requested full
control of KeyArena as a stipulation to start a WNBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``in the past, what they have requested is the ability
to book and manage KeyArena for 365 days a year,'' Podlodowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the city ``did not build KeyArena for one tenant,'' and
added that the city has an interest in controlling the arena to
allow ``diversity in events'' there.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said Tuesday that league officials have
not given any indication about where the new franchises will go. He
said at least 12 NBA teams have expressed interest in operating a
WNBA franchise, the Sonics among those.

TICKET BUYERS: FORCE IS WITH YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The force will be with Star Wars fans waiting
in line today to get the first tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank police force, that is. For the past week, police
have been working with the local AMC Theaters to cope with what is
expected to be a crush of fans lining up at ticket offices.
Although the movie does not open until May 19, tickets will go on
sale at noon today at theaters throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department have left the planning up to individual police
stations and have no special plans to cope with the lines, other
than to monitor them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll respond to incidents as they occur,'' said Sgt. Robert
Courtland of the LAPD's West Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Canyon Country, a suburb north of Los Angeles, Edwards Cinema
officials plan to provide their own security to ensure crowds
expected to line up for the first screenings don't get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Burbank, AMC will have a security guard at each of its ticket
sale locations and extra parking attendants on hand to handle the
potential crowds. Burbank police will supplement their normal
patrols in the downtown area to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously going to be a big rush at noon,'' said Capt.
Gordon Bowers of the department's Special Operations Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be ticketing and towing to keep things as orderly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers in Burbank's Traffic Bureau have been asked not to take
any time off during the next week and a half so a full complement
of officers will be available to handle any problems in the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Public Works Department will be at the ready to close
down Palm Avenue to traffic if the crowds get too thick for
sidewalks in downtown Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said the city worked out a plan with AMC because it will
be selling tickets at two of its three downtown locations, the AMC
14 on Palm Avenue and the AMC 6 on First Street. Because the
theaters are located in the city's crowded downtown area, the lines
are expected to stretch well beyond the property owned by the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he is relieved that tickets are being sold in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way they are not struggling to get in to see the movie,
they're just struggling to get a ticket,'' Bowers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the city Fire
Department, said stations have been alerted and are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well prepared for it. We're used to these kinds of
things,'' Humphrey said. ``Our people are ready to go as this
reaches its zenith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be concerned if there was a sudden change in the weather
with a sudden spike to over 90 degrees where people could become
ill or pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canyon Country, Sheriff's Department officials are prepared
for the crowds that might gather at the new Edwards Cinemas, said
Sgt. Joe Efflandt of the Santa Clarita Valley station. The theater
chain will foot the bill for crowd control, either by hiring
private security guards or contracting with the Sheriff's
Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tieger, managing director at the AMC Theaters in Burbank,
said fans will be able to buy 12 tickets at once if they stand in
line and nine tickets at a time if they get through on a phone to a
movie ticket service.
</P>
<P>
   He expects that AMC will be selling tickets at least for the
first several days of the release of the movie. Decisions have not
yet been made about how far in advance the tickets can be sold and
many details were left unsettled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first showings at the AMC theaters in Burbank will start at
12:01 a.m. May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Tieger said he is excited about the advance ticket sale today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most highly anticipated film of all time. This is
what we live for,'' Tieger said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Adamson, a spokesman for AMC, said the company's theaters
have been encouraged to sell concession stand items to those in
line and to even hire jugglers and mimes to entertain the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Burbank, ``Phantom Menace'' tickets will be available at
other AMC sites including the Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills, and
AMC theaters in Covina and Puente Hills. On May 19, the movie will
be shown on five screens at the Burbank sites and on five screens
at other AMC locations.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater chains Tuesday were still working out the details
for ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Brower, a spokeswoman for the Edwards chain, said as of
Tuesday that Edwards would be selling advance tickets only for the
first early morning shows May 19 but that the situation could
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' tickets will be on sale at several area
Edwards locations including Calabasas, Camarillo, Canyon Country
and Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The Mann Theater chain will be selling advance tickets at the
following sites: the Chinese in Hollywood, the Village in Westwood,
the Mann 9 Granada Hills, the Mann 9 Valley West in Tarzana, the
Plant 16 in Van Nuys, Mann 8 in Agoura Hills, the Janss Marketplace
in Thousand Oaks, Mann 6 in Simi Valley and the Glendale Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman Fisher, a spokesman for Loews Complex Entertainment,
said the company's 18-screen theater at Universal Studios does not
expect a crowd control problem. Fisher expects many people will buy
their tickets through Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   As for crowd control, there is already a Sheriff's Department
substation on the lot and Loews and Universal have plenty of
security in place. Unlike the theaters in Burbank, there is plenty
of room at Universal for people to wait in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can line up as many people as we want and not impede any
traffic flow or commerce,'' Fisher said. ``Obviously we're excited
by it. This is a phenomenon that is unequaled.''

HIGH SCHOOL SETS RECORDS WITH 57-0 WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ If only Pilgrim High could have gotten out
Christian Hariot and Julio Bautista in Tuesday's Heritage League
baseball game, the Patriots could have held visiting Faith Baptist
to 35 hits and who knows how many fewer runs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hariot was unstoppable (9 for 9 with four home runs and 12
RBI) and Bautista almost as tough an out (6 for 8 with four doubles
and 13 RBI), and Faith Baptist wound up setting or tying at least
five Southern Section records in a 57-0 five-inning mercy-rule win.
</P>
<P>
   The Contenders (15-5, 10-1) established single-game marks for
runs (breaking a 77-year-old record), hits (50) and tied records
for team home runs (nine), individual homers (four by Hariot) and
doubles (four by Bautista, who raised his area-leading average to
.686.

RED SOX DROP THE BALL
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-MARINERS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Headaches replaced history as the operative principle at Fenway
Park Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, when the Red Sox' five-game winning streak
disappeared as ingloriously as the fan who took a Seattle home run
off the coconut in the Mariners' 8-5 win before an irritated
gathering of 24,416.
</P>
<P>
   Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, in a muted encore to his
three-homer, two-grand slam, 10-RBI performance the night before,
came to bat four times with runners on base but came away with a
mere mortal's run-scoring double off Mariners winner Jamie Moyer
and a walk in five plate appearances. The hit extended his hitting
streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight-reel material Tuesday night was the header by the
spectator, who was hardly culpable for the Sox loss compared to the
six Boston pitchers who combined to give up 14 hits and 10 walks
while throwing an absurd 204 pitches. Nonetheless, he did no favors
for Tim Wakefield, whose record dropped to 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield was in a 1-1 game until Tom Lampkin's fourth-inning
flyball down the right-field line caromed off a noggin in the
shadow of Pesky's Pole instead of coming to rest in the glove of
Sox outfielder Darren Lewis, who was preparing to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic case of knuckleball meeting knucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bead on it,'' Lewis said. ``I hit my ribs on the
fence, which dropped me pretty good, so I was just trying to get my
bearings. I could have sworn I had it, and somebody told me I could
have caught it if that guy hadn't jumped in front of me at the last
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, he could have been a Mariners fan. Fans come out
there looking for souvenirs. You see it happen all the time. Just
the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin's home run was one of three struck by the Mariners, who
lead the majors with 62 homers and hardly needed the audience
participation. But the fan, who was escorted from the premises
after trying to retrieve the ball that outfielder Damon Buford had
tossed to another fan, was not the last party to act generously
toward the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox bullpen did its part, too, as Rheal Cormier made a
damaging error in a four-run Mariner sixth that broke a 2-all tie
and Jim Corsi, whose sinker has been less bowling ball than
balloon, was touched in the seventh for two more runs, including a
home run by Butch Huskey that cleared the Monster.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Cormier, who had inherited nine runners in his
previous 11 appearances and stranded all nine, entered and induced
pinch hitter Dan Wilson to bounce into a double play as a run
scored, breaking a 2-all tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Domingo Cedeno, one of seven Mariners to play shortstop in
the absence of injured All-Star Alex Rodriguez, followed with a
run-scoring double to left, and Cormier then permitted Brian
Hunter's groundball to pass uncontested through the 5-hole for an
error as another run scored.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell, whose 10th home run had given the Mariners a 1-0
lead in the first, followed with a run-scoring single to make it
5-2, and Ken Griffey beat out an infield hit against an overshifted
infield for the sixth Seattle run.
</P>
<P>
   This being the Mariners, a team that came into the game with the
worst ERA in the majors, the Sox were still alive in the eighth,
when three singles off reliever Jose Paniagua, the last an RBI hit
by pinch hitter Reggie Jefferson, made it 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox brought the tying run to the plate in the ninth against
Mariners closer Jose Mesa, after a single by John Valentin, a walk
to Nomar Garciaparra, and a two-out throwing error by Bell made it
8-5 and left runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Frye's bid for a base hit instead caromed off Mesa
directly to shortstop Cedeno, who threw out Frye to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, a better finisher than starter these days, left after
loading the bases with none out in the sixth on a ground-rule
double by Huskey, a walk, and a single by Russ Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good,'' Wakefield said after a yield of nine
hits and three walks in his return from a successful four-day stint
in the bullpen. ``The numbers just didn't come out in my favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one of those years, maybe,'' Wakefield said, ``but I'll
keep taking the ball, every five days.''

ROCKIES DEFEAT METS, 8-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Other than their given and proper names, and their
current occupations, Robert Joseph Jones of the New York Mets and
Robert Mitchell Jones of the Colorado Rockies have frighteningly
little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets' Bobby Jones had 63 major league victories
compared to only eight for his counterpart going into this unusual
matchup of starting pitchers _ the first this century in which both
starters shared the same first and last names _ it was the Mets'
right-hander who had trouble keeping up with the other Jones on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton blasted a pair of two-run home runs off the Mets'
Jones, who tied his career high in earned runs allowed with eight,
as the Mets dropped their third straight game and sixth in the last
seven with an 8-5 loss to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for two pitches, it could have been a different game,''
Jones said of the hanging fastballs that Helton knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive game, a Mets' starter has either
equaled or surpassed his career high by allowing eight earned runs.
On Sunday, Rick Reed allowed eight runs to Arizona, the most in his
career. And on Monday night here, Al Leiter was pounded for eight
runs, a career high, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, it was Jones' turn. Two years ago, he allowed
10 runs in a start, but only 6 earned. The only other time he had
surrendered eight earned runs was on Aug. 21, 1993, the second
start of his major league career. The setting? About a mile
southwest at Mile High Stadium, where the Rockies used to play.
</P>
<P>
   The two home runs the Mets' Jones allowed on Tuesday night were
the first two he has allowed in seven starts this season. And
Helton is now 6 for 8 versus Jones in his career. But Coors Field
has never been kind to Bobby J. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great lineup,'' said Jones (3-1). ``And I just
don't like pitching here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting any blame on the ball parks,'' said Bob
Apodaca, the pitching coach. ``Where they've hit it the last few
days, we wouldn't have caught it anyway. We're just not pitching
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday evening, Jones' 7.91 earned run average at Coors
Field, which opened in 1995, was sixth-highest among active
National League visiting pitchers. But considering that Bobby M.
Jones was lugging a 7.88 era into his seventh appearance of the
season _ and first start _ the game figured to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies did not disappoint. After the Mets scored an
unearned run in the first, Helton answered with his first two-run
homer in the bottom of the inning. Mike Lansing, who had four hits
in front of Helton, scored on a third-inning Dante Bichette
groundout to make it 3-1. And then Helton blasted his second
two-run shot of the game in the fifth to give the Rockies a 5-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby M. Jones, meanwhile, made his first start this season one
to remember, allowing four hits and just two runs, 1 earned in
five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The start was one to remember regardless of the outcome.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, prior to 1900, there were
three major league games _ all in the National League _ in which
same-name starting pitchers opposed each other: April 16, 1899:
John B. Taylor of Cincinnati versus John W. Taylor of Chicago. And
twice in 1876, when George H. Bradley of Boston and George W.
Bradley of St. Louis squared off in the inaugural season of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But in this century, no pitching namesakes had started against
one another until Tuesday night. Before the series, Bobby M. Jones
had said, ``There are not a lot of similarities outside of our
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the two pitch in the major leagues at the same time,
they are often confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get his stuff in the mail all the time,'' Bobby M. Jones
said. ``It baffles me, when I'm with the Rockies and he's with the
Mets. He's 6-4 and I'm 6-foot. He's white and I'm black. He's
right-handed and I'm left-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the two Jones' have another thing in common this season:
After Tuesday night, each has one loss.

SEATTLE OFFERING INCENTIVES TO LAND WNBA TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY AND STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the American Basketball League abruptly shut down
last December, women's basketball fans in Seattle had one glimmer
of hope: The WNBA might expand its league here.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, city officials confirmed that hope is alive _ with
conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Schell has sent a letter to The Ackerley Group,
owners of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association
team, confirming the city is willing to sweeten the KeyArena lease
to minimize start-up costs for a new women's pro team.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if The Ackerley Group thinks the city is
offering enough. The Sonics owners did not respond to requests for
comment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard that we can pop the cork yet,'' said Seattle
Center Director Virginia Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Association is to announce four
expansion teams for the 2000 season before June 10, the start date
of the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has supported Seattle's interest in obtaining a WNBA
franchise _ with the Sonics apparently high on the list for a new
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league is very interested in Seattle,'' Anderson
said. ``We have a good building for basketball, and a good city for
supporting women's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell sent The Ackerley Group a letter of support on Tuesday to
demonstrate the city's enthusiasm to the NBA, which controls the
women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have the support of my colleagues on the City Council
in saying that the city welcomes the opportunity to be partners
with (the Sonics' marketing group) Full House in bringing the WNBA
to Seattle,'' Schell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the deal, Schell offered:
</P>
<P>
   - Reduced rent for all WNBA home dates to actual operating costs
plus $2,500, about a tenth of that paid by the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   - Giving all ticket and concession revenue to Full House.
</P>
<P>
   - Granting priority scheduling to the women's team during its
summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city would keep all parking and admission tax
revenue from WNBA games and control staffing.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Schell's letter gives the Sonics the green light to
tell WNBA officials that Seattle is ready for an expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long supported women's basketball, first at the
University of Washington and later with the American Basketball
League's pro team, the Reign. The Reign averaged about 3,900 fans
per game, with a record crowd of 7,358. The Sonics, by comparison,
commonly draw more than 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the city and the Sonics appear ready to partner
up for the new sports enterprise, city officials are concerned The
Ackerley Group is seeking something far more sweeping. All but four
of the 12 WNBA franchises have complete control of their arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics owners have been negotiating, so far without success,
for complete year-round control of KeyArena in exchange for a
guaranteed return to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Full House has been jockeying for months to take control of
KeyArena, sources say, and to scrap the 5-year-old deal between the
team and the city made after Sonics owner Barry Ackerley lost his
bid to build a privately owned arena south of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerley instead made a deal that renovated the deteriorated
Seattle Center Coliseum. To do it, the city sold $74 million in
bonds. Ackerley kicked in $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the city gets to keep most of the revenue, which so
far has covered the $7.5 million annual debt without a tax
increase. However, the NBA lockout this winter wiped out the city's
modest profit.
</P>
<P>
   If Ackerley is saying the city could have ``peace of mind'' in
handing over KeyArena in exchange for a guaranteed annual return,
city officials aren't buying it. City Councilwoman Tina Podlodowski
on Tuesday said any move in that direction would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council is very commited to bringing the WNBA,'' she
said. ``But if there are any other (conditions), we need to know
about them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Podlodowski said Full House has not formally requested full
control of KeyArena as a stipulation to start a WNBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``in the past, what they have requested is the ability
to book and manage KeyArena for 365 days a year,'' Podlodowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the city ``did not build KeyArena for one tenant,'' and
added that the city has an interest in controlling the arena to
allow ``diversity in events'' there.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said Tuesday that league officials have
not given any indication about where the new franchises will go. He
said at least 12 NBA teams have expressed interest in operating a
WNBA franchise, the Sonics among those.

AVONDALE BOARD OKS TALKS WITH LITTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shipbuilder Avondale Industries Inc. said Tuesday
its board approved talks with Litton Industries Inc. regarding the
company's $38-per-share cash offer for Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   When Woodland Hills-based Litton made its offer for the
Avondale, La.-based company last week the deal was valued at about
$503.9 million. Avondale had earlier agreed to merge with Newport
News Shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Avondale issued a brief statement, saying its board
decided Litton's offer ``could lead to a proposal which is superior
to the terms of (the) agreement to merge with Newport News
Shipbuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to engage in a discussion in order to evaluate the
proposal so I could guess you could say this is the first step''
toward a deal, said Avondale spokesman Tom Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable for the talks has been set but executives from the
two companies will likely meet sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all anxious to enter into meaningful discussions,'' said
Litton spokesman Randy Belote. ``This allows us to move to the next
step, to enter into formal discussions . . . and answer in-depth
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Litton offered to buy Avondale, it made a $1.25
billion offer for Newport News. At the time, Newport News directors
said they were willing to discuss the deal with Litton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board authorized preliminary discussions with Litton to
review the offer but that by no means means acceptance,'' Newport
News spokeswoman Jerri Dickseski said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Litton's acquisitions are approved by federal regulators, the
company would become the nation's largest builder of military
ships. Combined, the three companies would have revenue of about
$7.4 billion and more than 58,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Litton-Avondale-Newport News would create a company
able to build a wide range of military ships, including
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and noncombat support ships.
</P>
<P>
   It would reduce the number of major players in the market from
four to two, with General Dynamics Corp. providing competition for
Litton. Regulators sunk General Dynamics' attempt to buy Newport
News because it would have concentrated too much construction and
research and development work with one company.
</P>
<P>
   But they also approved the Newport News combination with
Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   The Litton-Avondale-Newport News merger would spread the work
more evenly across the country and to different contractors and
subcontractors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's military warship work is done at its Pascagoula,
Miss.-based Ingalls Shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News, based in Newport News, Va., is the only U.S. maker
of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Avondale manufactures
amphibious assault vehicles and other military ships.

WEST UNCERTAIN ABOUT RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Jerry West won't say how much longer he'll
run the Lakers, but he will say this much: He's not trading his
Lakers gear for a Knicks jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' executive vice president once again hinted Tuesday
that he's considering retirement but wouldn't specify when or how
he plans to leave the organization he's helped define for the last
three decades. But he laughed when confronted with a persistent
rumor that he'll become general manager of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fellas, I'm not going anywhere,'' West told reporters. ``I'm
not going anywhere. I'm gonna live in Los Angeles, period. I'm not
looking for another job. . . . This has been more than just a job
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a job that continues to take a toll on West, who turns
61 this month. This is the second straight year he's openly
contemplated retirement, though the talk subsided last summer when
he signed a four-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   West won't say if he plans to fulfill that contract, which
begins next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I really don't know,'' he said. ``There's times
I think I'd maybe like to take a year off. When I signed that
contract, I had every intention of finishing that. But there are
times, as I mentioned, these jobs are very wearing. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this team more than anything. I care about this team so
much that sometimes it brings me a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially this season, as the Lakers have gone through a
coaching change, a major trade and the Dennis Rodman drama while
underachieving on the court. West opposed the signing of Rodman,
but Lakers owner Jerry Buss insisted on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for me, because I didn't think he was a good
fit for us,'' West said of Rodman. ``It put a terrible burden on
Kurt (Rambis) as a coach. I do think it's an experiment that
hopefully we would try to shy away from something like that in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   West said that has not affected his relationship with Buss but
implied that he regrets not taking a stronger stand against the
Rodman move.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Buss) owns this team, and if you want to criticize him,
criticize me because maybe I wasn't in there, holding onto his leg,
like Jeff Van Gundy was holding onto Alonzo Mourning's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his future, West said he will discuss the matter with
Buss in the offseason. But he's got at least one, 330-pound reason
to stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made some promises to one player in particular here,
Shaquille O'Neal,'' he said. ``I almost feel like he's a family
member for me now, someone who I care a lot about. . . . I told him
I'd be here.''
</P>
<P>
   For how long remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my future, I think the most important thing for me
is to have the enthusiasm that's really necessary to do this job,''
West said. ``And sometimes when the walls seem like they're kind of
closing in on you, sometimes you really question that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Options open: For his part, O'Neal is slightly more
definitive on his future here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 97 percent chance I'm gonna be back here next
year,'' said O'Neal, who can opt out of his contract this summer,
``but I'm not even thinking about that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that other 3 percent, O'Neal said, ``I wouldn't worry.''

LAKERS KNEW WHAT THEY HAD TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The TV set at one end of the Lakers' locker
room has been playing the same videotape over and over the past few
days, a tightly edited loop of Houston Rockets scoring plays from
the regular season, each flying by as quickly as a Kurt Rambis
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The tape wasn't merely a scouting tool, it was a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charles Barkley backing in for a layup. And Hakeem
Olajuwon hitting a jump shot. Barkley again. And Scottie Pippen
slashing through the lane. Barkley again. And Sam Mack nailing a
3-pointer. Barkley AGAIN. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, the Rockets must have averaged 200 points a game
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only in comparison to that rapid-fire video did the Lakers slow
down the Rockets in their series-opening victory the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they celebrated that one-point win, the Lakers knew
there was reason for worry, knew they wouldn't win many more
playoff games if they kept giving up 100. They had to improve their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, they responded to the challenge, improving their
``D'' to an ``A'' in a 110-98 victory at the Forum that gave the
Lakers a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shooting, man. Their shooting,'' Kobe Bryant had said
before the game when he was asked what worried him most about the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Lakers, by the time the Rockets' shooters
found the range, pulling the visitors close to the 100 mark in
garbage time, they already were out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lakers' best defensive quarter of the season, they took a
31-12 lead after 12 minutes as the Rockets made just 23.5 percent
of their shots and got a big fat zero from Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be frightening for the Rockets, who came out of Game 1
full of confidence, thinking they'd let one slip away, only to run
into improved Lakers in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen more wins like this, and some of us will be convinced
the Lakers are NBA-title material.
</P>
<P>
   Good defense can be hard to explain. Rarely can you put a face
on it, as Shaquille O'Neal did with his last-second block of a
Cuttino Mobley layup on Sunday, as Derek Fisher did by diving for a
steal seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why it's hard to teach NBA players the importance
of defense. There's so little star potential in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is a team thing. It's a developmental (practice)
thing,'' Rambis said the other day. ``Players have to learn to
trust that somebody is going to get their back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the stage we're trying to get to. That's why it's so
important for a coach to have a team that's tied into each other.
To me that builds teamwork faster than anything you do on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But if good defense is hard to define, bad defense can be plain
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up 100 points is a bad sign in this era of shrinking NBA
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 101-100 victory Sunday made them the only team to
give up three figures and win in this NBA postseason. There won't
be many more.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up 100 has meant trouble for the Lakers: When they gave
up 100 or more in games against playoff-bound teams this season,
they went 2-11.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 100 has meant success for the Rockets: When they put up
100 or more in games against playoff-bound teams this season, they
went 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   That described the Lakers' task Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Game-1 self-assessments of the defense had ranged from ``up
and down'' (Fisher) to ``pretty good'' (Glen Rice).
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't stop Barkley. They let the Rockets hit 52.1
percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, their interior defense improved, holding
Barkley to 19 and Olajuwon to 8 and the Rockets under 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' only breath all night came from their guards, who
hit five straight 3-pointers to briefly cut the Lakers' lead to
single figures in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Rockets made that videotape in the Lakers locker
room look like a work of fiction. &QL;

WARNER BROS., D.C. WIN DAMAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has ordered two Los Angeles toy
makers to pay $3.6million in fines and damages for counterfeiting
consumer products based on Warner Bros. and D.C. Comics characters.
</P>
<P>
   In his judgment against Los Angeles-based CBB Group Inc., U.S.
Federal District Judge Manuel Real ordered its two principals,
Raymond Hung and Hank Tsan, to stop importing any consumer retail
goods until they can show they have ended all counterfeiting
activities. Real also found the men in contempt of court for
violating two previous orders against counterfeiting and said they
could be fined up to $10,000 per day if they fail to comply with
the latest judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Warner Bros. and D.C. Comics are owned by Time Warner
Entertainment. Warner Bros. Consumer Products licenses the rights
to characters from properties including Looney Tunes, Batman,
Superman, Scooby-Doo and Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at CBB Group's downtown Los Angeles facility, Hung said
he knew nothing of the judge's Thursday order. ``I don't know what
you're talking about,'' Hung said Tuesday. ``I was out of town for
about a month at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsan could not be reached Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Warner Bros. said the judgment was a victory but
added they are skeptical they will ever see the large award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make efforts, but whether the money is actually
collectible, I don't know,'' said Gary Simon, vice president of
legal affairs at Warner Bros.' consumer products division. &UR;  &QL;

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Lakers held serve with their 110-98
victory over Houston on Tuesday night at the Forum, fully aware
that keeping homecourt advantage makes a dreaded trip to the Lone
Star State just a little less dicey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely will be nice to keep home court advantage,''
Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said. ``We (wanted) this game really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' victory not only gave them a 2-0 lead over the
Rockets, it also makes Game 3, and if necessary, Game 4 in Houston
something less than must-win. After all, the last time the Lakers
played at Compaq Center on April 26, they were routed by the
Rockets 102-80.
</P>
<P>
   That alone is a reason for the Lakers to feel a twinge about the
next two games, but Bryant said the blowout will only serve as
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to go there and kick their butt,'' Bryant said.
``As far as our confidence factor, that game won't be in our
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   But that loss remains fresh in the memories of the Lakers for
another reason. Shortly afterward, they held a team meeting and
confronted each other about their shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about getting our act together,'' Bryant said. ``It was
a pretty good meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did get their act together, a trend that has
continued in the playoffs, and was most visible at the outset
Tuesday, when the they jumped out to a 29-12 lead and never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Rockets had gotten their joints loose, the Lakers
blasted past them as point guard Derek Fisher kept his hot hand by
scoring 11 points in the first quarter, including three shots from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   When Fisher is burying baskets, the Rockets know they are in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Although being down 2-0 might seem insurmountable, the Rockets
are so experienced (old?) that they just don't seem to panic over
much these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine it's going to be a five-game series,'' forward
Antoine Carr said. ``I really don't think it matters that much that
they have homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would like to have it. It's do or die now.''
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the first two games _ from the Rockets'
perspective _ is that the Lakers merely did what they were supposed
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't put us in a hole at all,'' Houston forward Scottie
Pippen said. ``We were in a hole when we got here. We're going to
see what we're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr and Charles Barkley, among others, still believe that both
teams are capable of getting hot and winning the NBA title, even
one down 0-2 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either one of these teams gets on a roll, it's over for the
rest of the league,'' Carr said. ``We know if we go out and play,
we can play with anybody anywhere. When we mess around, and do
pretty-boy moves, we can get in trouble.''

O'NEAL, BRYANT SHOW ROCKETS THE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The vigorous rubbing sound reverberating in
the upper reaches of the Forum on Tuesday was an echo of the Lakers
furiously erasing doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about their season, about their personnel, about their
ability to work together and stay together.
</P>
<P>
   All of it was wiped out with a few quick strokes across the
blackboard, and an etched-in-slate 110-98 victory over the stunned
Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five first-round
series, which heads to Houston for Game 3 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Enchanted evening as it was, the Lakers even got an assist from
Magic Johnson, who caught guard Derek Harper as he chased down a
loose ball and stumbled out of bounds in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored a game-high 28 points to go with nine
rebounds and seven assists. Kobe Bryant scored 19, and Derek Fisher
provided a scoring boost for the second straight game, adding 16.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering a 13-point lead in Game 1, the Lakers could
take nothing for granted Tuesday, so their 55-40 halftime lead
seemed anything but safe in context. They had already watched the
Rockets battle back from as much as a 23-point deficit in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis hoped the Lakers had ironed out the hitches
that nearly cost them Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes. We made some mistakes that cost us 12
points or more,'' he said of Sunday's game. ``And those are
mistakes that the team knows about and shouldn't have made. That's
the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston probably figured the Lakers' gaudy lead could be sliced
and diced again. And indeed, the Rockets had a run at them,
short-lived though it was.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the third quarter with five straight points to cut
the lead to 55-45, but they couldn't break the 10-point barrier.
The Lakers, with 3-pointers from Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher and Glen
Rice, blew the game open again, and less than four minutes into the
quarter, they led by 21.
</P>
<P>
   Houston never threatened the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   Defense ruled early, as the Lakers held Houston to 12 points in
the first quarter, a season-low for an opponent. But the Rockets
won the second quarter to make it semi-respectable by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest part of it all was that Charles Barkley was a
nonfactor for the first 24 minutes of the game. Coming off a
25-point effort in Game 1 _ and threatening to shoot the ball 25
times if the Lakers stuck to single-coverage _ Barkley sat the
entire second quarter following a poor opening period _ two points,
missing 3 of 4 shots.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make a dent until the third, when he scored 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 23 early in the second, the Rockets reeled off a 13-3
run amid a flurry of 3-pointers from Sam Mack and Brent Price,
cutting the lead to 40-27. Price and Mack continued their 3-point
assault in an 8-2 run that cut the Lakers' lead to single digits,
44-35, for the first time since early in the first.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers closed out the half with an 11-5 run, including
five points from Rice and four from Shaquille O'Neal, to make it
55-40 at halftime. O'Neal scored 11 points in the half, and Bryant
scored 14 as the Lakers shot 55.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wasted no time proving that Sunday's 20-point game was no
fluke. He scored a team-leading 11 points in the first quarter as
the Lakers built an unbelievable 31-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held a three-point lead early in the first when
Fisher hit the first in a trio of 3-pointers in the period. That
started the Lakers on a run that never seemed to end. After Houston
pulled within four, the Lakers outscored the Rockets 20-5 in the
last seven-plus minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The win also included a rejuvenated Lakers bench. After
contributing a season-low five points Sunday, the reserves scored a
combined 29 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done a good job whenever we've played well, it's
different people stepping up at different times,'' Rambis said.
``Some nights it's the bench, sometimes it's the starters,
different starters different nights. It's just the nature of our
team, different people step it up.''

Astro-nomical.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the farewell season of the Astrodome, it was only fitting
Tuesday night that the Astros turned in one of the most complete
offensive outbursts in their 35 years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we begin?'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said after
the Astros tied a team scoring record with a 19-8 victory over the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   When the 3-hour, 22-minute marathon was complete, the numbers
were staggering: twenty-seven runs, 32 hits, 83 at-bats, 14 doubles
and 10 pitchers used between the two clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Things turned so lopsided that the Pirates sent a catcher, Keith
Osik, to pitch the eighth inning. And like the previous four
Pittsburgh hurlers, Osik had trouble getting anybody out.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 runs by the Astros tied a team record set against the
Chicago Cubs on June 25, 1995. They also had 10 doubles in the
game, eclipsing the old team mark of eight set in 1977. Carl
Everett, who entered the fourth inning in an 0-for-13 slump, wound
up matching a career high with five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros broke open a close game by twice batting around
during five-run outbursts in the fourth and fifth innings. By the
end of the fifth, they led 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't finished. For that matter, neither were the
Pirates. The Astros added five more runs in their final two at-bats
and watched as Pittsburgh staged a mini-rally with a pair of home
runs off righthander Sean Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an ugly game from both teams' standpoint,''
Dierker said. ``This is not the type of game I would have
preferred, but you certainly want to be on the winning end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Astros had at least two hits, including three each by
Everett and Richard Hidalgo. Jeff Bagwell (three walks), Ken
Caminiti and Everett, the Astros' three through five hitters, were
a combined 7-for-11 with 13 RBIs and seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bogar added three RBIs on a bases-loaded double in the
eighth to cap the scoring. Glen Barker grounded out with Bogar at
third as the Astros fell just short of scoring 20 runs for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Astros enjoyed one of their most productive nights
ever, Bergman was not at all pleased with his performance. It isn't
every game a pitcher is backed by 19 runs, but Bergman felt he
should have delivered the knockout punch after the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman (2-1) allowed six runs and 11 hits, including the two
home runs, over five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense was definitely the story. The way I pitched was
unacceptable,'' Bergman said. ``We scored runs, and I should have
been able to get guys out. I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a way for Pittsburgh to give away the game, the
Pirates found it. They had 14 hits but offset them with five errors
_ one short of the team record. Six of the Astros' 19 runs were
unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Ritchie (2-2) was pounded for eight runs _ five earned _
and seven hits in 3 innings. Chris Peters gave up six runs _ three
earned _ and seven hits in 1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put our heads together like this, there's no telling how
many times we can do it,'' Everett said. ``It's a great club, and
everyone can hit. I think we were more anxious to try and get this
game over with. Your feet start hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 1, the Astros went up in the third when
Craig Biggio was hit by a pitch, Derek Bell reached on a fielding
blunder by shortstop Pat Meares and Bagwell hit a two-run double
into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Astros sent nine batters to the plate. With
one out, Biggio doubled, Bell reached on third baseman Ed Sprague's
throwing error to first base and Bagwell walked to load the bases.
Caminiti, who extended his hitting streak to 12 games, hit a
two-run double off Ritchie to put the Astros ahead 6-1. Everett
followed with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   In almost a repeat of the fourth inning, the Astros tacked on
another five runs in the fifth. They had six hits in the inning,
the big blow being Bagwell's second two-run double of the game.
Everett and Paul Bako, who went 2-for-5, followed with RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   In the Astros' four-run eighth, Osik became the first Pittsburgh
position player to pitch since outfielder John Cangelosi on May 3,
1998.

TUINEI OVERDOSE FAR FROM ISOLATED; HEROIN DEATHS ON RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the field of substance abuse treatment, there is an
old acronym for the kind of person who most responds to help:
</P>
<P>
   YAVIS _ Young, attractive, verbal, insightful and successful.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've begun to realize,'' said Dr. John Talmadge, ``it also can
be an acronym for a dead heroin user.''
</P>
<P>
   Latest example is Mark Tuinei, the popular, charismatic former
Dallas Cowboy lineman who accidentally killed himself May 6 with a
walloping drug cocktail of heroin and the amphetamine Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's death at 39 and his choice of weapon is a shocker for
the Cowboys, where he was a 15-year fixture who retired in 1998, as
well as the sports nation.
</P>
<P>
   But for the town where he died, the wealthy Dallas suburb of
Plano, it was largely a sad case of same old, same old.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years in the suburbs of Dallas and Fort Worth,
34 young people have died from heroin overdoses. While Tuinei is a
little older than the YAVIS profile, he still fits well the
cultural label: A guy the middle class would never suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the long string of high school deaths, Plano has been
the object of much media attention, including a major story in the
current issue of Rolling Stone magazine, ``Texas Heroin Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sprawling corporate 'burb is little different from its
counterparts throughout America. Especially in and around Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin deaths in King County set a record in 1998: 144, six more
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A compilation over the last three years of heroin deaths by the
county medical examiner's office disclosed that 83 percent of the
victims were white, and 13 percent were African-American. More than
80 percent were male and about half were in the 35-44 age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we typically find is that these people are mixing their
drugs,'' said Jon Nakagawara, the examiner's administrative
assistant. ``It's not uncommon to see heroin used with alcohol and
other drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Seattle menu is typically black tar heroin from Asia,
the Texas prep preference comes from Mexico in gel capsules and
leaves no tell-tale physical evidence, not even red eyes or runny
noses.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin, or chiva, as it's called in Mexico, is also cheap,
so that even the upper middle-class kids of Plano, much less
professional athletes, have no trouble indulging their fatal
pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible problem,'' said Talmadge, a Dallas M.D. with a
specialty in addiction psychiatry and medicine. ``A lot of
community energy is going into what amounts to a heroin epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once Seattle was tagged by national media as the heroin
capital of America, the cursed label now falls to Plano, even
though the problem is countrywide. Tuinei's death has again brought
the spotlight, but much of the sports coverage is focused on
further damage to the Cowboys' already tattered reputation.
</P>
<P>
   That consequence is minimal compared to the larger problem,
particularly since heroin use among young people is growing instead
of shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Dallas 10 years ago, there were several good
treatment programs for high school-age kids,'' Talmadge said. ``The
troubled kids typically fell into two categories, users and
rehabbers. Each school had dozens involved in Alcoholics Anonymous,
or Narcotics Anonymous, or other kinds of counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's really only one group _ users.''
</P>
<P>
   Talmadge said that use of rehab programs has fallen off
dramatically because most health insurers increasingly do not pay
for specialty care, particularly regarding mental problems and
addictive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the discrimination stems from a society that is
generally not sympathetic to problems of alcohol and drugs, as well
as the belief that abuse is a moral issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep dismantling the treatment system, what outcome can
be expected?'' he said. ``This is not a crime problem; it's a
public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had slain the moral issue in the '80s, when half
the cast of `Saturday Night Live,' along with Eric Clapton, Betty
Ford, and members of the McGovern and Dukakis families, accepted
treatment and started turning the corner on public perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, because treatment is fading, Talmadge said there are no
longer kids telling their stories about recoveries. He said that
1992 was the last year that extensive, insured treatment programs
were available to most Dallas-area students.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's unconscionable that insurance coverage is denying
treatment to kids,'' he said. ``It's a national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're killing all the evangelists.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probable that Tuinei could have afforded any treatment.
What he didn't have, apparently, was knowledge that he either had a
problem or was toying with almost instant death.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is individual or societal, the root of the problem is
the same _ ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the shocking squandering of Tuinei's life might make a
few points that his athletic career never did.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, America's stupidity about drugs is an almost
unbeatable opponent.

CUBS RIP DODGERS WITH PEREZ'S HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers haven't put together a
winning streak to separate themselves from most of the National
League. That's what manager Davey Johnson has said the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon Johnson mentioned it again, but added the
Dodgers have been on the precipice of such a streak, yet unable to
get it going despite a five-game winning streak on a recent road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Another opportunity was lost as the Chicago Cubs hit three
homers off starter Carlos Perez and went on for a 10-5 win at
Dodger Stadium. The teams, who have each won a game in the series,
conclude their three-game series tonight. The only encouraging sign
for the Dodgers was the continued hot-hitting of right fielder Raul
Mondesi. He hit a pair of homers for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi had three RBI and scored three runs. He hit a two-run
homer in the sixth and added one in the eighth. The second put
Mondesi atop baseball with 13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   While Mondesi was the good, Perez was the bad. Scratched from
his scheduled start last Wednesday in Montreal after a mysterious
knee ailment, Perez gave up six runs for the third time in six
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hoped Perez had recovered from early-season
difficulties in which he gave up 16 runs in three starts, pitching
seven innings just once. Instead, Perez, who was also skipped in
the rotation because of off days last month, saw his ERA shoot from
5.65 to 6.23.
</P>
<P>
   While Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa hit his eighth homer of the
season, a solo shot to right-center in the sixth, it was shortstop
Jose Hernandez who was the offensive catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was a single shy of a cycle. He had three RBI and
scored three runs. Hernadez's two-run homer off Perez (1-4) in the
third inning gave the Cubs a 2-0 lead. Mark Grace made it
back-to-back homers as the Cubs went ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pulled within 3-2 in the fourth on a two-run double
by Eric Karros, but Hernandez's leadoff triple in the sixth helped
the Cubs cushion their lead. He scored on a sacrifice fly and Sosa
homered to give Chicago a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the long-ball attention placed on Sosa, his
counterpart continued his torrid pace. Mondesi's two-run shot
helped the Dodgers creep within 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Kyle Farnsworth then surrendered a single to Todd
Hundley and was promptly lifted in favor of Rodney Myers.
Farnsworth (2-0) allowed four runs on six hits in five-plus innings
and won thanks to a blockbuster five-run seventh inning in which
the Dodgers used three pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago started the inning with a single to left, which
was all Johnson needed to see, given Perez's seventh-inning
dilemmas this season. Twice Perez has allowed four runs in the
seventh inning, and Johnson vowed to keep a close eye on him from
now on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson turned to right-hander Antonio Osuna, who did nothing to
alleviate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blauser smacked Osuna's first pitch for a double to left
and Santiago scored on a wild pitch, diving to avoid Osuna's tag.
Myers followed with a run-scoring single. After Lance Johnson
grounded out to third, Hernandez doubled to the base of the right
field wall to score Myers and give the Cubs an 8-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna walked Mark Grace before recently recalled right-hander
Mike Maddux came in to face Sosa, who doubled to right. Gary
Gaetti's sacrifice fly plated Sosa and put the Cubs ahead 10-4.
It's the fourth time in 33 games the Dodgers have given up at least
10 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi then led off the eighth with a homer, the third time
he's hit two homers in a game this season and the 11th time in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the only piece of interest remaining in the game was
whether Hernandez would be able to hit for the cycle. However,
Dodgers left-hander Onan Masaoka retired Hernandez on a long fly to
center.

GIVEN SECOND CHANCE, MARINERS MAKE RED SOX PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With his spot likely slipping away a few time zones
over, Domingo Cedeno was losing time to make his first Mariner days
count. And if Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek had held onto
his foul tip in the sixth inning Tuesday night, the
lightest-hitting Mariner might have left without a highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox reliever Rheal Cormier had just gotten a bases-loaded
double-play ball, and though a run had scored, he seemed secure
with two strikes on Cedeno. But when Varitek dropped the foul tip,
it gave Cedeno another chance.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered, rapping a run-scoring double to left-center. It
was the pivotal hit in a four-run rally that sparked Seattle to an
8-5 win over the Red Sox and helped Jamie Moyer earn his second
victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just waiting for my pitch,'' said Cedeno, who added an
RBI single in the seventh. ``He threw me another changeup. I was
looking for it, he went a little bit up, and that's where you can
hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been 13 games since Cedeno's last start, and with a .225
average, he likely will be sent to the minors when Alex Rodriguez
returns on Friday. Rodriguez played shortstop in a rehab stint
Tuesday at Peoria, Ariz., with no reported problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's return from knee surgery will help the Mariners, who
have struggled to sustain offensive rallies. Their first two runs
Tuesday came on solo homers, and they left runners in scoring
position in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth inning, they scored four runs on five hits, a
walk and an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a young season, but I can't remember too many
times when we've come up with clutch hitting like we did tonight,''
said catcher Tom Lampkin, who was taken out for a pinch-hitter that
inning after hitting a double and a homer earlier. ``Cedeno had two
big hits, David Bell, Butch Huskey, Junior. ... It was
unbelievable, everybody that got in the game did something major to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two hits of the inning did not leave the infield. Bell
singled to second to bring in Cedeno, and Ken Griffey Jr. brought
in the last run, which gave the Mariners a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey one-hopped a ball to short, where Nomar Garciaparra had
to cross over second base to field it, and beat the throw. The Red
Sox had three infielders on the first-base side of the bag in a
``Ted Williams Shift,'' an increasingly popular strategy against
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time that you do something to help your team, that's the
important thing,'' Griffey said. ``It doesn't matter what they do.
I'm not looking to hit the ball in the infield. I think it'd bother
me if they put four or five outfielders out there more than the
infielders putting the shift on. Boston started that last year, and
I hit .385 (.333) off them. If you're going to give me a hit, I'll
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer will take his outing, in which he allowed three runs in
six innings to meet the minimum requirements for the so-called
quality start _ the first for Seattle in 12 games. The Mariners
needed the innings _ manager Lou Piniella wanted to save long
reliever John Halama for Wednesday night, and he is still
short-handed in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But Moyer walked four, and threw 52 balls among his 106 pitches.
A control specialist, he now has nine walks in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you're locked in where you need to be,
and other times when you're just not there,'' Moyer said. ``I feel
great, I feel strong, and I felt good in the sixth inning. It's
something I'm not going to panic over or make something out of
nothing. Sooner or later, it's going to come. It's going to click
and be right back in stride. My feeling is there's no sense in
trying to force things to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 50 balls in 100 pitches _ that's not good for my style of
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer's counterpart Tuesday was knuckleballer Tim Wakefield, who
is far different from Wednesday night's starter both in style and
performance. Boston will pitch the dominating Pedro Martinez
Wednesday, as the Mariners finish a nine-game road trip, and the
mention of his name soured Piniella's post-game press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll worry about Pedro tomorrow,'' said Piniella, whose team
has lost five times in eight games on this trip. ``Let me enjoy
this one tonight _ please.''

LAKERS GET AN `A' for `D' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The TV set at one end of the Los Angeles
Lakers' locker room played the same videotape over and over the
past few days, a tightly edited loop of Houston Rockets scoring
plays from the regular season, each flickering past as quickly as a
Kurt Rambis nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The tape wasn't merely a scouting tool, it was a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charles Barkley backing in for a layup. And Hakeem
Olajuwon hitting a jump shot. Barkley again. And Scottie Pippen
slashing through the lane. Barkley again. And Sam Mack nailing a
3-pointer. Barkley AGAIN. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, the Rockets must have averaged 200 points a game
this year!
</P>
<P>
   Only in comparison to that rapid-fire video did the Lakers slow
down the Rockets in their series-opening victory the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they celebrated that one-point win, the Lakers knew
there was reason for worry, knew they wouldn't win many more
playoff games if they kept giving up 100. They had to improve their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, they answered the challenge, improving their
``D'' to an ``A'' in a 110-98 victory at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The 98 is misleading. The game was over after the Lakers turned
in their best defensive quarter of the season to hold the Rockets
to 12 points and 23.5-percent shooting in the first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was any magic to what we were doing,''
said Lakers guard Derek Fisher, who drew two charging fouls in a
stretch of three Rockets possessions in the early going. ``We just
came out with intensity and tried to set the tone. In basketball
you set the tone with defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the flawed Lakers team that squeaked by in Game 1,
raising the prospect of a hard-fought series, is not just in
control of the best-of-five at 2-0 but dominating the Rockets and
their three Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who had 25 in Game 1, was held to 19. Olajuwon was held
to 8, on 3- for-10 shooting. Pippen had 3, and was 0 for 7 from the
floor while guarded mostly by Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen more wins like this and some of us will be convinced
the Lakers are NBA-title material.
</P>
<P>
   Good defense can be hard to explain. Rarely can you put a face
on it, as Shaquille O'Neal did with his last-second block of a
Cuttino Mobley layup on Sunday and as Fisher had by diving for a
key steal seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why it's hard to teach NBA players the importance
of defense. There's so little star potential in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is a team thing,'' Rambis had said the other day.
``It's a developmental (practice) thing. Players have to learn to
trust that somebody is going to get their back.''
</P>
<P>
   But if good defense is hard to define, bad defense can be plain
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up 100 points is a bad sign in this era of the incredible
shrinking NBA score.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 101-100 victory Sunday made them the only team to
give up three figures and win in this NBA postseason. There won't
be many more.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up 100 has meant trouble for the Lakers: When they gave
up 100 or more in games against playoff-bound teams this season,
they went 2-11.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 100 has meant success for the Rockets: When they put up
100 or more in games against playoff-bound teams this season, they
went 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   That summed up the Lakers' task Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Game-1 self-assessments of the defense had ranged from ``up
and down'' (Fisher) to ``pretty good'' (Glen Rice).
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't stop Barkley. They let the Rockets hit 52.1
percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, their interior defense improved and the Rockets
wound up under 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Shaq's game-saving block on Sunday persuaded the Lakers to
trust each other. Somebody DID have their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we want to play defense,'' Rambis said
afterward. ``You take care of your business one-on-one and the
other four guys are there to help you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we stayed focused to our game plan tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' only breath all night came from their guards, who
hit five straight 3-pointers to briefly cut the Lakers' lead to
single figures in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the Lakers made that Rockets videotape in the
locker room look like a work of fiction.

LAKERS DEFENSE RULES
</HEADLINE>
 - WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The vigorous swooshing sound reverberating
in the upper reaches of the Forum on Tuesday was an echo of the Los
Angeles Lakers furiously erasing doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about their tumultuous season, about their personnel,
about their ability to work together, to stay together and to
somehow fuse all that talent into the dominant team billed as the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   All those doubts, and more, were wiped out with a few quick
strokes across the blackboard, and an etched-in-slate 110-98
victory over the stunned Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense was stifling, their offense as fine-tuned as a
Stradivarius _ and their confidence? It was somewhere in the
stratosphere after they took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five
first-round series, which heads to Houston for Game 3 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling very confident in ourselves, but it's good to
know where that's coming from _ the defensive end,'' said Kobe
Bryant in an understated tribute to the Lakers' newfound dominance.
</P>
<P>
   How shut down were the Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   They never led.
</P>
<P>
   They scored 12 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 39.7 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed by double digits for all but five-and-a-half
minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, he of a stamped Hall of Fame pass, scored 3
points and failed to hit a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, himself Hall-bound, topped out at 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   And the third piece of the Hall trio, Charles Barkley, had two
points at halftime, scoring the rest of his 19 in a futile
second-half charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that when we go out and play aggressive defense and
stop them from doing the things they want to do, we feel the sky's
the limit,'' Glen Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as Bryant was concerned, the Lakers shouldn't even be
surprised at the havoc they wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``because we're an explosive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Explosive, as in Shaquille O'Neal's 28 points, nine rebounds and
seven assists, to go with Bryant's 19 points and a
see-I-told-you-so 16 from new scoring whiz Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   As enchanted an evening as it was, the Lakers even got an assist
from Magic Johnson _ who caught guard Derek Harper as he chased
down a loose ball and stumbled out of bounds in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a good omen?
</P>
<P>
   And now the Lakers, confident and gaining momentum through six
straight wins, can close out the Rockets on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet and we realize that,'' Rice said. ``The
hardest fight is still ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly expected more fight Tuesday after squeaking out a
last-second victory in Game 1. But there was no need for an O'Neal
swat at the buzzer this time.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering a 13-point lead two days earlier, the Lakers
could take nothing for granted, so their 55-40 halftime lead seemed
anything but safe in context. And they had already watched the
Rockets battle back from as much as a 23-point deficit in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But lessons learned Sunday stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lot,'' Rice said. ``We know when you get a good
veteran team down, you have to keep the pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston probably figured the Lakers' gaudy lead could be sliced
and diced again. But the Rockets were not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the third quarter with five straight points to cut
the lead to 55-45, but they couldn't break the 10-point barrier.
The Lakers, with 3-pointers from Bryant, Fisher and Rice, blew the
game open again, and less than four minutes into the quarter, they
led by 21.
</P>
<P>
   Houston never threatened the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expected this game to be tougher than Game 1 was,''
Fisher said. ``We didn't expect to get out to such a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``One team came out chewing jock, one team came out for a day at
the beach,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They kick our (butts) right from
the gun. . . . I was disappointed, and I expected . . . a
competitive game. It was a collective, nonaggressive ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense ruled early _ the Lakers held Houston to 12 points in
the first quarter, a season low for an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher wasted no time proving that Sunday's 20-point game was no
fluke. He scored a team-leading 11 points in the quarter as the
Lakers built an unbelievable 19-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers, who sluggishly meandered through parts of the
regular season, were just waiting for the playoffs to peak, they've
timed it beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying for a while now, this team is coming
together, but we're still developing as a team,'' coach Kurt Rambis
said. ``We're still improving. We still haven't played our best
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did Tuesday night was pretty darn close.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ If an octopus had hands, there still wouldn't
be enough fingers to point at all that went wrong with the Rockets
this time.
</P>
<P>
   No breakdowns in the final minute. Just a train wreck from the
opening quarter. No game that got away. Just a team that never
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   No offense.
</P>
<P>
   No defense.
</P>
<P>
   No chance.
</P>
<P>
   No Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Now no margin for error after the 110-98 thumping by the Lakers
on Tuesday night that was never that close.
</P>
<P>
   The last four minutes of this one found a lineup of Sam Mack,
Brent Price, Othella Harrington, Matt Bullard and Stanley Roberts
on the floor for the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions?
</P>
<P>
   Just one: Why even bother?
</P>
<P>
   On a night when he had something to prove, Pippen scored just
three points. In a game when he had a reason to be inspired, Pippen
was limp, taking seven shots and missing every one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to play after sitting around for two days,''
Pippen said. ``I know myself that I had spent enough time sitting
around thinking about the mistakes we made in the first game, the
things we didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they didn't do them even more.
</P>
<P>
   So much for redemption
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a night for redemption, a time to show
that the final horrific minute to Game 1 hadn't left the Rockets
physically and emotionally fractured from Pippen's comments that
were seen by most as selling out his teammate and good buddy
Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it came out was that I was throwing rocks at Charles,
and that's not what I was doing at all,'' Pippen said. ``I still
don't think it was a very smart play to foul Shaq with 28 seconds
left. All I was doing was giving my opinion on that one play.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was the only play of the Rockets' collapse Pippen
singled out for dissection and conveniently omitted his own blunder
with 7.6 seconds to play when he fell down and had the ball stolen
by Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of season for Pippen, who signed his
five-year, $67 million contract at the end of the NBA lockout in
January and has struggled to fit into the Rockets' overall team
picture as either a savior or a perfect complementary part ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's travails began on opening night right here at the Great
Western Forum when Lakers phenom Kobe Bryant lit him up for 25
points while Scottie shot like a man wearing a blindfold, going
just 4-for-18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to take a few weeks to feel comfortable, then a few
months, and now here is Pippen in his first playoffs wearing a
uniform other than the Chicago Bulls' and he has yet to find his
place among the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   His comments concerning Barkley's intentional foul on Shaquille
O'Neal with 28.4 seconds left in the game and the Rockets holding a
two-point lead could have provoked an explosive reaction from
within the team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barkley uncharacteristically chose discretion and did
not allow the situation to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Unaddressed topic at dinner
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Charles and Scottie went out to dinner together Sunday
night. But the subject never came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a word,'' said Barkley, ``and that's all right. I
understand that he said something that he probably shouldn't have
and didn't really mean. I also understand that he's under a lot of
pressure. And pressure can make people do funny things.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Rockets ought to be more laughs than a
barrel of monkeys for Game 3 on Thursday night, since all they have
to do is stop a runaway Lakers locomotive that is gaining
confidence and momentum with plenty of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Like 4-for-17 shooting with six turnovers by the Rockets in the
first quarter. Which is how the Lakers managed to take a 37-14 lead
and the win almost before Jack Nicholson made it to his courtside
seat.
</P>
<P>
   As Jack might say, the Rockets couldn't handle the truth. Which
is that they flat-out didn't come to compete. And didn't really
have a chance when Hakeem Olajuwon picked up his third personal
foul just 14 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, Antoine Carr and Barkley could not stop O'Neal's power
game inside. The Rockets couldn't stop Bryant anywhere, and nobody
in this series understands yet that you have to guard Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen drove and stumbled. He shot twice and stumbled at the
start. He struggled and spent most of the fourth quarter on the
bench, while his buddy fought and battled almost to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game plan was to be aggressive,'' he said. ``I was going to
shoot the hell out of the ball tonight. But that plan only lasted
three or four minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, there were no fingers pointed. No friendships
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and I are the last thing you've got to worry about,''
Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least they are way down on a growing list.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Rockets Rookies were as cute as they could
be a week ago, all dressed up and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   They were looking all grown up with their wildly impressive
scoring performances, their hip talent, their speed, their
veterans' guile and their bright eyes beaming as their first
playoff experience fast approached.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson are rookies. It's very
clear _ as clear as the Rockets' offense seems to be in a fog _
that they are rookies. And rookies they will remain until this
season is over, which might be any day now.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers 110, Rockets 98 Tuesday night at the Great Western Forum
turned into a yawner early and was a lot of things for a lot of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant turned the floor into a personal playground,
bouncing around as if he had turbocharged his sneakers. Hakeem
Olajuwon turned into a fan for much of the first half, sitting on
the pine like just another beautiful person, thanks to too much
Shaquille O'Neal and too much foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal slammed down dunks seemingly at will, finishing with 28
points. Charles Barkley struggled to find any room for his burly
spins and barreling drives.
</P>
<P>
   And not to point fingers or anything, but Scottie Pippen could
just as well have raided the concession stand for goat-cheese sun
crackers like all the other onlookers. He was shut out on field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   But as difficult as the 2-0 deficit in this best-of-five series
against the Lakers might be to overcome, you have to believe coach
Rudy Tomjanovich and the Rockets' veterans will find a way to make
a few adjustments as the series heads to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, however, cannot be changed: Mobley and Dickerson are
rookies in this series. They always will be. And it's looking like
it will be as difficult to overcome as Pippen's search for the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets expected much production out of their young
backcourt against the Lakers, and there was every reason to believe
they would get it.
</P>
<P>
   There were those terrific late-season efforts by the rooks,
particularly Dickerson's back-to-back 31- and 27-point games in the
last week of the season. There was Dickerson's cool demeanor. There
was Mobley, with his free spirit and sweet game, looking every bit
like one of those rare first-year players who could remain unfazed
no matter the stakes. There even was a decent matchup against the
Lakers' underwhelming point guard, Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   But the best Rockets backcourt combination that Tomjanovich put
on the floor Tuesday night was the one he didn't even have to begin
the year: Sam Mack and Brent Price.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who arrived from Vancouver before the trading deadline,
scored 20 points. Price, who came off the injured list, showed
veteran experience on the way to 18 points and several nice
moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Price and Mack subbed for the rooks in the second quarter,
there even were brief thoughts that the Rockets might claw back
into this thing. Very brief.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Dickerson and Mobley showed only that they were
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   They succumbed to the immense pressure of the moment almost from
the opening tip, which rookies do in the playoffs. They never got
going, like most rookies in the playoffs. They got no calls, which
rookies rarely get in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no picture better illustrated the fate and status of
Mobley and Dickerson than an offensive foul called against Mobley
midway through the first quarter, when the Lakers were getting
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley drove toward the Lakers' free-throw line, much like
Bryant did in the critical and decisive final moments of Game 1.
Fisher, who finished with 16 points Tuesday and has looked like
Magic Johnson thus far, sprinted in front of Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   The two players bumped and became tangled in one another's feet
as the ball bounced away. It was a moment that looked like the
mirror image of Bryant's crash with Mack in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the call went against Mobley. Offensive foul.
Mobley screamed in agony and got a brief scolding from the
official.
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk back to me, Rook.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went the other way, and the Lakers kept running and
scoring. Thus, the hole dug early, when the Lakers built a 19-point
first-quarter lead, was far too much.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was nowhere. But the rookies were not enough, either. In
the first quarter, Dickerson and Mobley committed a combined five
turnovers and two fouls, with no assists on 1-of-5 shooting. They
both sat through the entire second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson ultimately finished with zero points on 0-of-8
shooting from the field. Mobley finished with six points, managing
just three field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Before this series began and the pressure of going to the
playoffs with a rookie backcourt was brought up, Barkley said of
Mobley and Dickerson, ``That's something we can't change. We have
confidence in them, but we can't change that they're rookies. We
have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless things change, they'll have to die in this series because
of it, too.

CUBS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 -- WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi hit
two home runs, has four in his last two games and leads the major
leagues with 13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for the good signs from the Dodgers' 10-5 loss to the
Chicago Cubs at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Onto the pressing concern regarding the Dodgers, and
particularly the plight of right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna. He
says he's well. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson isn't so sure, which
again throws a monkey-wrench into the never-stable bullpen
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna allowed four runs in just a third of an inning. In that
span the Cubs turned a 5-4 lead into a 10-4 laugher, and in the
process resurrected talk that Osuna may be too hurt to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned about Osuna,'' Johnson said. ``He had
rest and didn't have his best stuff. I would imagine it's been a
while since he's been hit that hard. His fastball had no life on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna has a bone spur in his right elbow and Dodgers team
physician Dr. Frank Jobe recommended surgery three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Osuna, who had a bone spur removed from the same spot
last September, spurned the bone spur surgery and said he wanted to
pitch with it since it wasn't causing him pain. Osuna was placed on
the disabled list April 21 (retroactive to April 18) for the second
time this season and told he would have to prove he could pitch
through the pain before he was activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling good,'' Osuna said. ``I feel strong. I tried to
throw hard and the ball was up. I told them, `If you want to use me
today, I feel good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   How Osuna felt and how he pitched were very different, and
pitching coach Charlie Hough said it looked like Osuna lost
velocity on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Cubs' five-run seventh inning that broke the
game open was an RBI single by Chicago reliever Rodney Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of line drives for (Osuna) to be strong,''
Johnson said. ``I'm concerned. I'm concerned that he's healthy. I
need to find out. The first time he threw he had a lot of pop in
San Diego. Next time out it was a little bit less and this time out
it was a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in four outings that Osuna has given up a
run, but since Johnson views the bullpen as one of the most
important part of a baseball team (the bench is included in that
group), and given Osuna's medical resume, there's a reason the
Dodgers will be anxious to see Osuna at the ballpark today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Osuna's inability to hold the Cubs at bay in the
seventh inning _ not to mention starter Carlos Perez's fourth loss
in five outings _ cost the Dodgers a chance for a winning
homestand. The best they can do is split the six-game stand.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa and shortstop Jose Hernandez
deserve the blame _ or credit _ for that. They combined for six of
the Cubs' 11 hits and each came within one hit of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez needed only a single in his final at-bat but flied to
center. His third-inning homer gave the Cubs a 2-0 lead, which Mark
Grace extended to 3-0 with a homer. Sosa was missing a triple, but
he did deliver excitement in the form of his eighth homer of the
season. His solo shot in the sixth gave the Cubs a 5-2 lead but he
grounded to second in his last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Sammy to homer his last time up and miss the home
plate,'' said Grace, who hit for the cycle six years ago. ``They're
both trying to catch me, but I'm still the last one to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, combined with Osuna's problems, more than
overshadowed Mondesi. He hit a two-run homer in the sixth to cut
the Cubs' lead to 5-4 and then hit a solo shot in the eighth to
make it 10-5. He has four homers in his last five at-bats.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Rockets had their extended Southern
California weekend, played some ball, saw some sights. They just
never had time for the beach.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That came Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The control of their Western Conference series that seemed
theirs until the final eight seconds two days earlier was proved to
be made of sand. Tuesday, the Lakers kicked the sand in the
Rockets' faces, manhandling them with embarrassing ease.
</P>
<P>
   Routed from the opening minutes, the Rockets only occasionally
earned their opponents' attention, with the Lakers easily brushing
aside the few brief Rockets runs before settling for a 110-98 win
not nearly that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I saw it, it was one team chewing on the jockstraps
and the other team coming out for a day at the beach,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``They kicked our butts from the start. The biggest
adjustment we've got to make is coming to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Lakers a commanding 2-0 lead in the
best-of-five series, forcing the Rockets to win three straight
after having not beaten teams with winning records in three
consecutive games all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done it before,'' Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said of the
long-shot Rockets comeback chances. ``Not against us, but Rudy
Tomjanovich has experience with that. When we get down to Houston,
we have to take care of business like the series is 0-0.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets looked a long way from winning even once. And
that was just in the opening minutes when the game was already a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kicked our butts,'' said Rockets forward Charles
Barkley, forced to team with Sam Mack and Brent Price to form the
revised but insufficient version of the Big Three. ``I can't say
what was wrong. Anything I say would be excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Barkley would not blame teammates or even the
disheartening loss Sunday, the reasons for Tuesday's debacle were
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, in immediate and unrelenting foul trouble,
never found the touch that he had going so well two days earlier.
He made just three of 10 shots and finished with eight points.
Without Olajuwon around to at least make him work on defense,
Shaquille O'Neal rolled to a game-high 28 points, nine rebounds,
seven assists and five blocked shots, while triggering the Lakers'
unstoppable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go to Shaq, and it creates mismatches with his size,''
Olajuwon said. ``When he moves it around and passes the ball and
shoots the ball so well, we have to find a different way to defend
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what troubles Olajuwon had, he shined compared to
Scottie Pippen. Determined to attack the basket and make something
happen from the outset, Pippen was no more effective offensively
than when he fell Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen missed all seven of his field-goal attempts, finishing
with three first-half free throws, his three-point total bringing
howls from the Forum crowd when it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get myself going early, but that sort of went to
hell,'' Pippen said. ``Those opportunities never came again. They
started to pull away, and we just never got ourselves back in the
game. It's pretty difficult. It was just one of those nights we
were never in the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bryant) makes me expend a lot of energy. I got cross-matched
(defending Glen Rice). Now Rice is resting (on the other end). And
Kobe comes up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen and Olajuwon absent without leave offensively, Mack
led the Rockets with 20 points, with Barkley getting 19 points and
13 rebounds, Price 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Mack and Price got into the game in the second
quarter, it was all they could do to try to force an improbable
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam and I have been giving a lift all year with scoring off
the bench,'' Price said. ``But when he and I are a couple of the
leading scorers in a game, we're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have the starters doing their thing. We have to
have the Big Three. They're veterans. They're our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bench created the Rockets' only runs, their only moments
of respectability.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' last burst, completed with Barkley's second 3 of
the night, brought them to within 13 with 8:49 left. But that was
something of a fraud, as unlikely to last as a torrent of Barkley
3s.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was resting during that brief run, and when he returned
he put in four consecutive baskets to blow the lead back out to
100-79 with 6:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt after the Lakers' fast start, it had long
since been put aside. The Lakers had built a 23-point lead in the
first half, let it slide to nine, then built it back to 23 in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, guard Derek Fisher, who made six of 11 shots,
including four of six 3s to finish with 16 points, burned the
Rockets for double-and triple-teaming O'Neal. Bryant finished with
19, Rice 14.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They jumped on us,'' Barkley said. ``Fisher got off to another
great start, and Kobe got of to a great start. I'm not going to sit
here and dissect our team. We just got our butts kicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got killed, no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Having left their day at the beach badly sunburned, the Rockets
were not ready to deal with such problems, anyway. Instead, they
watched the intensity and effort of Game 1 go out with the tide and
knew nothing would work until they got that back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected a hell of a competitive game,'' Tomjanovich said.
``It was a collective non-aggressive game. We have to go back and
regroup.''

By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Point blank, Charles Barkley was asked a
simple question.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Houston Rockets ever have a chance against the Los
Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Barkley replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets hope their stay in the NBA playoffs isn't as short
as Barkley's answer, but things are turning desperate after they
dropped Game 2 110-98 before 17,505 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   At least after Sunday's opener, the Rockets could talk big about
how they gave that one-point loss away. But there was no way to
rationalize this debacle, even for someone as skilled as Sir
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got our butt kicked,'' Barkley said. ``I'm not going
to sit here and dissect our team, we just got our butts kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had grand strategies for Game 2. None more than
those of forward Scottie Pippen, trying to atone for his turnover
at the end of Game 1 that probably cost the Rockets the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my game plan to come out and be aggressive and shoot
the hell out of the ball,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   The end result: Pippen had three points and missed all seven of
his shots from the field. He's made 5 of 20 shots in the series,
including 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen felt the Lakers' fast start took him out of the
offense more than any problems he's having shooting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing well offensively; it took us out of what we
wanted to do,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen looking less and less influential in this series,
maybe the Rockets could get a boost somewhere else, like rookie
shooting guard Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson missed all eight of his shots and did not score a
point. It was the type of performance that allows critics to say
rookies are usually out of their league once the playoffs begin. A
point Dickerson vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference. I don't see any difference,'' Dickerson
said. ``I'm not frustrated. I'll bounce back. There's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With two starters going 0 for 15, it's a wonder the Rockets lost
by only 12 points. Did we mention that center Hakeem Olajuwon went
3 for 10 from the field and scored eight points? He's about had it
after two games, although his complaints are directed more at the
officials. Olajuwon picked up his first foul one minute into play
Tuesday and had two in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' Olajuwon said. ``We just have to make the
necessary adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   But exactly what are those adjustments? The Rockets seem unable
to contain the Lakers inside (Shaquille O'Neal had 28 points) or
outside (Derek Fisher had 16).
</P>
<P>
   And offensively, they've gone AWOL with the exception of
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gotta go back and regroup,'' Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``I just need to go back and look at everything. It will be a
hard one to watch (on tape). We just need to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many ways Tomjanovich tries to adjust, however,
the Rockets are going nowhere unless Pippen starts playing a little
more as he did when he could rely on Michael Jordan to bail his
team out in pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing,'' Pippen said. ``I'm trying to do whatever
it takes to win. It's not happening now. They're just overshadowing
whatever we're trying to do.''

 HOW INSECTS USE SEX TO PROTECT THEIR MATES FROM PREDATORS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the wedding gifts that male animals can offer their
brides, the lovely rattlebox moth must surely be the most generous:
In the act of copulating, he gives his female partner lifelong
protection against being devoured by voracious spiders.
</P>
<P>
   The rattlebox isn't the only insect that mates so protectively.
The male queen butterfly, scientists have found, includes a
chemical with his package of sperm that protects the female
butterfly's hundreds of eggs against predatory ants, ladybird
beetles and mites as well as spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Studying these interactions in insects _ as well as other
curious relationships between chemistry and living organisms _ is
known as ``chemical ecology.'' A pioneer in the field is Thomas
Eisner of Cornell University, a noted biologist and specialist in
the protection of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   To Eisner, a bug collector since he first learned to walk, the
male rattlebox moth's strategy for transmitting chemical defenses
against predators to his mate during sex offers a fascinating
insight into the complex ways that nature keeps the insect world
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and a team of his graduate students describe the latest
insights into the helpful uses of sex among insects in the current
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The
story offers an intriguing glimpse of a world that few people
besides entomologists know about: the insect tribes that far
outnumber humans on planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Eisner said he has recently returned
from field work in Florida studying the rattlebox moth in greater
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely pink, white and black females, he said, are about as
sexually active as any animal alive. They live for only a month,
but during that brief life span they mate as often as 10 times _
with 10 different males. In fact, Eisner said, he observed one
Florida female mating a total of 23 times _ most probably with 23
different males, although he couldn't be certain that the same male
didn't come back a second time in a few cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlebox moth copulation is a feat of endurance, he noted, for
once the moths start to mate, they remain coupled together for as
long as nine hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eisner and his colleagues, the male rattlebox moth,
known scientifically as Utetheisa ornatrix, feeds exclusively while
still a caterpillar on a bean plant that contains alkaloids called
pyrolizidines. Those chemicals, it seems, are totally repulsive to
at least two species of spiders _ orb weavers and wolf spiders _
and the male caterpillars retain the plant's alkaloids in their
bodies through the pupal stage of their lives and even after they
emerge from their cocoons as winged moths.
</P>
<P>
   When they copulate, the males include the alkaloids in their
``sperm packages,'' which are rich in both nutrients and the
protective alkaloids.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after mating, the female moths transfer the alkaloids to
their eggs and retain enough in their own bodies to make themselves
repulsive to spiders, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
   When a hungry spider traps a female moth in its web, the Cornell
researchers observed, the moth secretes a disgusting chemical in a
froth of bubbles, and the spider promptly liberates the moth by
cutting the web away with its fangs and feelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a human bridegroom would buy life insurance for his
bride,'' Eisner told Cornell associates. ``This classy moth gives a
gift she can really use _ a life insurance policy, if you will _
that keeps paying off every time her life is in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the male moth gets his reward, too, for when the female
casts about to select a mate, she has a way of sensing which male
bodies are richest in the protective chemical she needs _ and those
are the ones she chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's colleagues during the team's most recent series of
moth-and-spider experiments, as well as during observations in the
wild, include his wife, research associate Maria Eisner, and his
graduate students, the husband-and-wife team of Andres Gonzalez and
Carmen Rossini. Gonzales is the lead author of their published
report.

 EX-CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN TO HEAD GORE CAMPAIGN  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and ROBERT G. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., was named Tuesday as the
general chairman of Al Gore's 2000 presidential effort, in a move
designed to energize the vice president's lagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of Coelho, 56, the former head of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, may also bring with it
controversy about financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who represented the Central Valley town of Merced in
Congress, is considered an energetic strategist and top-notch
fund-raiser who excelled in tapping ``soft money'' donations from
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   But critics note that Coelho resigned suddenly from Congress in
1989 during an investigation into his personal finances, though no
charges were ever filed against him on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair game,'' Coelho said Tuesday, referring to questions
about his finances. ``I have been investigated . . . and vetted by
everybody,'' he said. ``The Reagan-Bush Justice Department
investigated me for two years, and they gave me a clean bill of
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho termed ``poppycock'' the questions already raised by some
watchdog groups: that his past money troubles could focus more
attention on Gore's fund-raising problems. ``There were no
violations on my part. . . . Obviously Al was cleared of anything
on his part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said he welcomes any questions about his past, saying
``there's nothing there, and all they have to do is look.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, an investment banker and agricultural landowner in
California, said he has agreed to work for Gore without pay for the
next 18 months on the condition that the vice president will not
consider Coelho for, or even ask him to discuss, a job in a Gore
administration. ``I'm doing this because I believe in him,'' Coelho
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has also asked lawyers to review whether he should resign
from several business boards in California. ``I'll do whatever they
want me to do so there's no conflicts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said he intends ``no shakeups'' in Gore's campaign
organization. The campaign, which has suffered from perceptions of
inertia, ``is in better shape than people think,'' he said. ``The
structure is there, the talent is there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see some perceptual change . . . and major
policy speeches'' in the next phase of the campaign, Coelho
promised. ``We're going to have fun, and get the job done and help
people understand what Al Gore is all about, what is his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho declined to talk about Gore's state fund-raising goals,
but added, ``California is critical for us . . . for finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state political veterans say Coelho's appointment proves
Gore's campaign is on top of the game in crucial California. The
vice president has visited California more than 50 times, but polls
show him running virtually neck and neck with both Texas Governor
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is a very significant asset. . . . If the ability to pick
raw talent is a measure of Gore's campaign, it was a very smart
move,'' said political consultant Richie Ross Tuesday. ``(Gore)
needed a major league move . . . and Tony Coelho brings a level of
energy. This is not some tired figurehead. He's a guy who will make
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ross predicted, ``the campaign will roll _ or heads will
roll.''

FRANCO RIDES GOLF FROM DIRT POOR TO TOUR RICHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Perhaps a bit of Jack Nicklaus' magic rubbed off
last month at the Masters Tournament when he picked up Carlos
Franco's 5-iron during a practice round and hit an approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps golf fans in the United States simply didn't recognize
the potential of a PGA Tour rookie who grew up playing barefoot in
a country with only three golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Franco has stunned the PGA Tour since that
day at Augusta National Golf Club. The native of Paraguay followed
up a sixth-place tie in his Masters debut with last week's triumph
at the Compaq Classic of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of six golfing brothers from a family that shared
a one-room shack with a dirt floor heads into tomorrow's opening
round of the GTE Byron Nelson Classic with more earnings in his
brief career ($910,549) than Sam Snead ($620,126), who won a
tour-record 81 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Of Franco's total, $593,200 has come in his last two outings.
But the real eye-opener came in the aftermath of Sunday's victory
at New Orleans, when tournament officials treated Franco to his
first limousine ride, complete with champagne and five Colombian
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, came the phone calls. Friends and relatives from five
different countries, roughly 15 in all, offered heartfelt kudos.
Franco, 33, was touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so emotional, they were crying. They couldn't even
talk,'' said Franco, who joined Roberto DiVicenzo (Argentina) on
the short list of PGA Tour winners from South American countries.
``When you're crying and saying, `Congratulations,' it means a lot
more. You can tell it's genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of support, said Franco, caused him to reflect on
his humble beginnings. On the long odds he has beaten. From his
days of playing with borrowed equipment, Franco has become a
celebrity in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better known there than Bill Clinton would be here,'' said
Franco, whose strong finish at the Masters triggered a parade in
his hometown of Asuncion. ``The people who drive the taxis stop and
wave. I like it. Everyone knows who Tiger Woods is, but the people
there think of me as the king of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of his 30 tournament victories worldwide, Franco has
eclipsed the celebrity status of a fellow Paraguayan athlete,
tennis star Victor Pecci, who lost to Bjorn Borg in the finals of
the 1979 French Open. But his initial PGA Tour triumph, Franco
said, has taken his fame to a new level and provided him confidence
that he can continue his roll this week at the Four Seasons Resort
and Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,'' said Hal Sutton, who finished five
strokes behind Franco in New Orleans. ``We've never been paired,
but he looked pretty good to me on TV when the heat was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco ranks among the top tier of touring pros in driving
distance, putting and sand saves. His scoring average (70.2) is
13th among tour participants in 1999. He is adjusting, he said, to
a new home in Miami, a city he selected ``because everyone speaks
Spanish and my wife doesn't speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't plan to forget the folks who flooded him with
phone calls after Sunday's career-turning triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a champion on the PGA Tour, coming from where I've come
from, is one of the toughest things to do,'' Franco said. ``Having
so many people call me after I won in New Orleans showed it's
important to have ... a South American presence that will make more
people in South America want to understand and play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parade in Asuncion, now that he's a PGA Tour champion,
may not be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to continue celebrating because I've had so
much success, so close together,'' Franco said. ``It makes me very
happy, too.''

brief career ($910,549) than Sam Snead ($620,126), who won a
tour-record 81 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Of Franco's total, $593,200 has come in his last two outings.
But the real eye-opener came in the aftermath of Sunday's victory
at New Orleans, when tournament officials treated Franco to his
first limousine ride, complete with champagne and five Colombian
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, came the phone calls. Friends and relatives from five
different countries, roughly 15 in all, offered heartfelt kudos.
Franco, 33, was touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so emotional, they were crying. They couldn't even
talk,'' said Franco, who joined Roberto DiVicenzo (Argentina) on
the short list of PGA Tour winners from South American countries.
``When you're crying and saying, `Congratulations,' it means a lot
more. You can tell it's genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of support, said Franco, caused him to reflect on
his humble beginnings. On the long odds he has beaten. From his
days of playing with borrowed equipment, Franco has become a
celebrity in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better known there than Bill Clinton would be here,'' said
Franco, whose strong finish at the Masters triggered a parade in
his hometown of Asuncion. ``The people who drive the taxis stop and
wave. I like it. Everyone knows who Tiger Woods is, but the people
there think of me as the king of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of his 30 tournament victories worldwide, Franco has
eclipsed the celebrity status of a fellow Paraguayan athlete,
tennis star Victor Pecci, who lost to Bjorn Borg in the finals of
the 1979 French Open. But his initial PGA Tour triumph, Franco
said, has taken his fame to a new level and provided him confidence
that he can continue his roll this week at the Four Seasons Resort
and Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,'' said Hal Sutton, who finished five
strokes behind Franco in New Orleans. ``We've never been paired,
but he looked pretty good to me on TV when the heat was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco ranks among the top tier of touring pros in driving
distance, putting and sand saves. His scoring average (70.2) is
13th among tour participants in 1999. He is adjusting, he said, to
a new home in Miami, a city he selected ``because everyone speaks
Spanish and my wife doesn't speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't plan to forget the folks who flooded him with
phone calls after Sunday's career-turning triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a champion on the PGA Tour, coming from where I've come
from, is one of the toughest things to do,'' Franco said. ``Having
so many people call me after I won in New Orleans showed it's
important to have ... a South American presence that will make more
people in South America want to understand and play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parade in Asuncion, now that he's a PGA Tour champion,
may not be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to continue celebrating because I've had so
much success, so close together,'' Franco said. ``It makes me very
happy, too.''

TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY TO ADD HEIGHT TO FENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The catch fencing at Texas Motor Speedway
likely will be raised by as much as 41/2 feet and the overhang
extended before the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's Longhorn 500 on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and general
manager, said he is anticipating those changes once engineers
employed by Speedway Motorsports Inc. complete their investigation
into the spectator fatalities and injuries that occurred during the
IRL's VisionAire 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., on
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the anticipated changes come on the heels of a
conversation he had with Bruton Smith, the chairman of the board of
SMI, on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to the engineers,'' Gossage said yesterday during
an Indianapolis 500 sendoff for IRL driver Greg Ray of Plano at The
Speedway Club. ``He \RSmith\S told me he felt like they were going
to come back with some recommendations on raising the height and
changing the design of the fences. Specifically `what' is in their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's going to happen with our track. We are going to
make some changes to the fence before the Longhorn 500. I would
suspect that Charlotte \RLMS\S would make changes before The
Winston, so we're talking about a lot of work in a very short
period. But it can be done. And we can do it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Motor Speedway is scheduled to play host to The Winston,
the all-star race of NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, on May 22. The
next points-race scheduled at LMS is NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 on May
30.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators were killed and eight injured at LMS when a
three-car crash sent a wheel and debris flying over a 15-foot-high
fence in Turn 4. LMS and TMS are sister 1.5-mile tracks and among
four Speedway Motorsports Inc.-owned facilities scheduled to play
host to five IRL races this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the catch fencing at TMS, which also will play host
to the IRL's season-ender on Oct. 17, currently measures between
151/2 to 16 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be raised to as much as 20 feet tall,'' Gossage said,
``so we're talking about a tremendous addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the current overhang fencing at TMS, which he
estimated at between three and four feet, also likely will be
extended. The overhang is designed to prevent debris from shooting
up and over the fence into the stands when a car makes contact with
the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be other suggestions as well,'' Gossage said.
``There is the possibility they will say there's no reason to do
anything. But from the discussions we've had, I anticipate those
two changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, of Team Menard, is scheduled to begin practice at the
2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday. The IRL's premier
event, the 83rd Indy 500, is scheduled for May 30. Ray, who will
attempt to qualify for his third Indy 500 on May 22, called for the
IRL to accelerate its efforts to make open-wheeled cars safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to eliminate the danger completely. There is
risk involved,'' said Ray, who favors using tether straps to keep
wheels and tires attached to the car's tub section upon impact with
a wall. ``You can't put a Band-Aid on it. You can't do a quick fix.
What we have to do as a human race is look at it, use our
technology and our common sense to put more countermeasures in
there to protect not only the spectators but the participants.''

COWBOYS KEEP MILLS WITH THREE-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys reached an agreement with free-agent
wide receiver Ernie Mills yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year deal is worth $2.275 million, including a
$375,000 signing bonus, said a source who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Under terms of the deal, Mills would get a $400,000 base
salary in 1999, a $300,000 roster bonus in June of 2000, a $400,000
base in 2000 and an $800,000 base in 2001, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of the contract is voidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's happy in Dallas and wanted to stay there,'' said
Mills' agent, Doug Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is entering his ninth NFL season, caught 28 passes
for 479 yards and four touchdowns last season. He suffered a
lacerated small intestine Nov. 22 against Seattle and missed the
final five regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be the Cowboys' third receiver in 1999 behind
Michael Irvin and Raghib Ismail.
LaFleur fractures ankle
</P>
<P>
   Starting tight end David LaFleur fractured his right ankle in a
morning workout yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys officials, however, said they are confident LaFleur will
be back in time for the start of training camp July 26. He is
expected to be in a cast three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur, a third-year veteran, missed the final three games last
season with a sprained right knee.
Davis banned
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Billy Davis' absence from the Cowboys'
twice-a-week workouts is quite telling about his future. Davis, who
is under contract, was told his presence at the workouts wasn't
necessary and was banned from using the Cowboys' facilities for
personal workouts, said a source close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' name no longer adorns a locker in the team locker room.
He is expected to be released, but the Cowboys benefit under the
salary cap if they wait until June 1.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed rookie cornerback Kevin Brooks from the
University of South Carolina to a free-agent contract.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys guard Nate Newton visited the Oakland Raiders
last week as his search for a new team continues.

PREAKNESS FIELD FAVORABLE TO SILVERBULLETDAY ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mike Pegram was dead set against running his
3-year-old filly, Silverbulletday, against the boys in the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Now the owner seems to believe running her Saturday in the
Preakness Stakes is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there isn't a 20-horse field'' in the Preakness,
Pegram said. ``When I saw what happened at the Derby, I just looked
up at the sky and said, `Thank you for not having my filly in
there.' That was like a Roller Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram said Silverbulletday, who easily won the April 30
Kentucky Oaks the day before The Derby, will be entered today for
the 13/16-mile Preakness at Pimlico Race Course, the second leg of
thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't necessarily mean she will run. She also was
entered in Friday's Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for fillies, the
Maryland equivalent of the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be made today, based in part on what post
position she draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to \Rtrainer\S Bobby \RBaffert\S and \Rjockey\S Gary
\RStevens\S,'' Pegram said. ``But as it sits right now, she's going
in the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also is planning to enter his other filly, Excellent
Meeting, who finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby. She was entered
yesterday in the Black-Eyed Susan and will be entered today in the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pimlico track is narrower than Churchill Downs', the
Preakness field is limited to 14 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting turned in strong workouts
Monday and yesterday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Each was
timed in 59 seconds for five furlongs. They are to be flown to
Baltimore today.
</P>
<P>
   Only four fillies have won the Preakness, the last being Nellie
Morse in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she continues to run like she's training, I think she can
beat the boys,'' Pegram said of Silverbulletday. ``That's why she's
in there right now.''
Prime Timber to skip Preakness
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Prime Timber, fourth in the Derby, will skip the
Preakness and start in the Sir Barton Stakes on the undercard.
After First American defected with an injury, that leaves 14 or 15
likely entrants, depending on the status of local long shot Lead Em
Home.
</P>
<P>
   Pimlico officials are almost certainly rooting for Lead Em Home
to stay in the barn. If Lead Em Home is entered, either Valhol or
Torrid Sand would be excluded based on career earnings. To decide
which one, the track would be forced to take a position on the
continuing Arkansas Derby controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol's Arkansas Derby purse was ordered stripped last week by
the Arkansas State Racing Commission, which concluded that jockey
Billy Patin carried an illegal electrical device. Torrid Sand was
moved from third to second place.
</P>
<P>
   However, Valhol's owner, James Jackson of Rockport, obtained a
court order before the Kentucky Derby to force Oaklawn Park to
credit Valhol with the Arkansas Derby purse.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas commission attorney Byron Freeland said he believes
that order remains in effect. Pimlico director of racing Lenny Hale
said yesterday that if a decision has to be made at entry time
today, the court order probably will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   That would put Valhol into the race at $344,100 with local
riding star Edgar Prado aboard and force Torrid Sand _ also
excluded from the Kentucky Derby _ back to the sidelines at
$91,400.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pimlico should instead side with the Arkansas commission
verdict, Torrid Sand ($141,400) would get into the Preakness, and
Valhol ($44,100) would rank 15th behind Lead Em Home ($95,487) and
go instead in the Sir Barton Stakes.
Training hard
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was a busy day for final workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic went five furlongs in 1:01,
and D. Wayne Lukas stablemate Cat Thief went in 50 1//5 seconds for
a half-mile, both at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Other five-furlong workouts at Churchill were recorded by
Patience Game (:583/5) and Worldly Manner (1:002/5). Also going a
half-mile, or four furlongs, was Torrid Sand (:481/5).
</P>
<P>
   Vicar topped the Pimlico work tab with his five furlongs in 59
3/5 seconds. The Nick Zito-trained duo of Adonis (1:01 3/5) and
Stephen Got Even (1:01 4/5) worked the same distance. Lead Em Home
went four furlongs in 49 seconds, and Valhol was timed in 50
seconds.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Ways to Speed Up Your Web Surfing  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently saw a piece about speeding up Web surfing
as well as overall system performance by cleaning out old, unused
files. It mentioned deleting old program installation files, which
I assume are only used once when you install a program. It also
suggested cleaning out the Internet cache folder. How do I identify
these without deleting something I'll need later?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Unless you've installed dozens of programs, getting
rid of old installation files probably won't boost your system's
performance. But you might get a lift from emptying the browser's
cache folder, which can accumulate hundreds of little files over
time (these files are used to speed up the loading of Web pages
you've previously visited).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to empty the cache: If you're using Internet
Explorer, choose Internet Options from the Tools menu. In the
section labeled Temporary Internet files, click Delete Files. If
you're using Netscape Navigator, choose Preferences from the Edit
menu. Click the plus mark next to Advanced in the directory on the
left. Choose Cache and then click the button labeled Clear Disk
Cache.
</P>
<P>
   Decoding MIME
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hope you can help: What does it mean when someone sends me
an attachment that I download, only to find it is a ``multipart
mime message''? I've tried various programs to open (Notebook,
Word, Excel) only to find Greek symbols instead of English text. I
have America Online.
</P>
<P>
   A: I know the feeling, because I had the same experience over
the weekend with some photos that someone sent to my AOL account.
AOL's Help section claims that ``When you receive a MIME-encoded
attached file from an Internet address, the AOL software will
decode the file for you _ invisibly and automatically.'' WRONG!
</P>
<P>
   I had the photos resent to another e-mail account and was able
to download them just fine using Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of MIME is to ensure that files can be sent over the
Internet and opened at the other end. But obviously that doesn't
always work with AOL. To decipher your files, you'll need a program
that can decode MIME. Two that come to mind are Winzip, a $29
shareware program that also happens to be great for compressing
files; and Wincode, which is free. Both can be downloaded from
www.hotfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   No Upgrade
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Microsoft Exchange 4.0 for e-mail. It came on my
computer nearly three years ago. Is there a free upgrade for this
program? If not, what alternatives are there?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no upgrade for the consumer version of Exchange,
which is no longer being shipped with Windows. But several free
e-mail programs are available that might suit you. If you want to
stick with Microsoft, try Outlook Express, which comes with the
Internet Explorer browser. You can download it for free at
www.microsoft.com/ie.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is the Netscape Messenger, an e-mail client that
comes as part of Netscape Communicator. Also free, it can be
downloaded at www.netscape.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the Big Two, but there also are a couple of other
terrific free e-mail programs out there. One is Eudora Light from
Qualcomm, which you can get at www.eudora.com. The other is Pegasus
Mail, which is available at www.pegasus.usa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Addresses
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any file in America Online 4.0 dedicated to my
list of e-mail addresses. AOL 3.0 had such a list called
addrbk.lst. I just had a hard drive crash and had no backup for the
address list and am slowly recovering one name at a time. Is there
a way I can back up my address book?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed there is. AOL stores your addresses in a file that has
the same name as your screen name. You'll find it in the Organize
folder inside the America Online folder on your hard disk. To back
up the file, simply save it to another place on your hard drive, or
to a floppy or Zip disk.
</P>

   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   You work at a company that doesn't let you access your corporate
e-mail when you're out of the office. Maybe they're paranoid, or
maybe they just don't have a way to get you around the firewall.
But if you use Microsoft Outlook at work, and your company uses
Microsoft Exchange, there is a way. Just set up a message rule that
forwards copies of your e-mail to another address _ either an
Internet account you have at home, or maybe a free Web-based e-mail
service like Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   With your Outlook Inbox open, go to the Tools menu and choose
Rules Wizard. The wizard will guide you through the process of
setting up a rule that automatically forwards messages for you.

MR. SHIMPI GOES TO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Internet publishers have millions of dollars to play with,
and some merely have a life-consuming passion. Never bet against
the fellow with a fire in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Time Warner Inc. announced it would shut down
Pathfinder, its ambitious effort to establish the first great
Internet portal. Time Warner began Pathfinder in 1994, when hardly
anybody else was even thinking about such a venture. And the
company spent $15 million a year in an effort to build an audience.
All for naught.
</P>
<P>
   How can the publisher of Time and People and Sports Illustrated
fail to attract Web users? By burying its most valuable properties
at the Pathfinder site, Time Warner failed to capitalize on the
appeal of its biggest brands.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mistake made by my favorite Web 'zines. These
low-budget start-ups create their own brands through their sheer
fervent love of technology and good writing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Anand Shimpi. He lived in Northampton till
1991, then moved with his family to Raleigh, N.C. A couple of years
ago, while taking a shower, Shimpi had an idea for a personal Web
site celebrating his passion for technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shimpi had little hope of becoming a Web celebrity. After all,
gearhead Web sites abound, from amateur efforts like his own to
major tech sites developed by major companies. Besides, Shimpi had
only one computer to write about _ his own. After all, he was only
a 14-year-old high school freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimpi took a month to design his site and write a review
of a new processor chip he'd bought. ``It wasn't the highest in
quality,'' Shimpi recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1997, Shimpi's site was good enough to attract a
stream of visitors, including the owner of a now-defunct computer
business who offered to provide sample parts in exchange for free
advertising. Soon, the site was truly worth visiting, crammed with
dozens of up-to-date hardware reviews, most of them written by
Shimpi himself at night, on weekends, and between classes.
</P>
<P>
   Today Shimpi has his own Internet domain, www.anandtech.com, a
couple of part-time employees, a steady stream of advertising
income and, he claims, 40,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   I applied another rough-and-ready test of Web-site popularity.
With the AltaVista search engine, you can see how many Web pages
contain links to a particular site. People link to someone else's
site if they like it and want others to visit it, so this is a good
popularity test. There are about 11,000 Web pages with links to
Salon, the red-hot Internet magazine backed by millions of Silicon
Valley bucks. Meanwhile, Anandtech, run out of Shimpi's bedroom and
relying on word of mouth, has built up over 4,000 links.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do this,'' says
Shimpi. ``All you have to be, I think, is dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say _ he's planning to attend MIT. Then again,
maybe he's right. Ken Fisher is no rocket scientist. He's studying
ancient languages at Harvard Divinity School. But when he's not
reading Caesar's Commentaries, he becomes ``Caesar,'' self-taught
computer network administrator and technology buff.
</P>
<P>
   He and three of his Divinity School buddies run Ars Technica
(www.ars-technica.com), a relatively new, absolutely cool
technology site. Born in September of last year, Ars Technica takes
in only enough ad revenue to cover its Web hosting fees. But
already it's come to be regarded as an authoritative source of
information on the latest processors and graphics accelerators.
``We set out to make ours a biased news source,'' says Fisher.
``We're kidding ourselves if we try to say we're totally objective.
So we just set out to do this great thing, have a lot of fun, and
all of a sudden we're an authority.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of sites like Ars Technica and Anandtech out
there, assembled by dedicated amateurs with brains and attitude.
They're entering the game a lot later than Time Warner's
Pathfinder, and with a lot less money to burn _ just talent and
passion. And often, that's plenty.

TAKE A BYTE OUT OF CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer theft is the crime that keeps on going.
</P>
<P>
   First there is the financial loss: when somebody steals your
computer, the cost of replacing the machine can easily run into
thousands of dollars. It can take even longer to replace your data
and reinstall all of your applications _ provided that you have
backups. Then there is the opportunity cost: if you use your
computer every day , you can't work until the machine is replaced.
Finally, there is the possibility for data crime: if somebody has
the audacity to steal your computer, what will they do with the
data that they find on your hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   Laptops are certainly the easiest kinds of computers to steal:
they are small, portable, easily concealed, and easily resold. But
desktop computers are commonly stolen as well. I once wrote an
article about a company in San Francisco that had its entire
network of workstations and file servers stolen over a weekend. The
thieves had come over an inside wall that separated the office from
a hallway; apparently, the partition had only gone up as far as the
false ceiling. Data wise, the company was wiped out: besides
stealing the computers, the thieves also took the company's only
tape drive.
</P>
<P>
   I'm continually surprised by the large number of homes I see
leaving themselves open to this kind of data loss. There are many
houses that have laptop or desktop computers easily visible through
first-floor windows. A simple ounce of prevention is to arrange
your home office so that valuables are not visible from the street.
</P>
<P>
   To further protect your computers, you might consider tagging
them, bolting them down, or equipping them with a tracking program.
Computer tags are my favorite physical security deterrent. The best
are made by Security Tracking of Office Property
(http://www.stoptheft.com). These tags are 2-inch square metal
plates that you can stick to a plastic or metal-cased computer.
Each plate has a serial number and requires more than 800 pounds of
force to remove. If somebody does pry off the plate, an indelible
tattoo is left underneath which proclaims that the computer is
``stolen property.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is illegal to knowingly purchase stolen property, these
tags dramatically cut the resale value of a stolen computer _ and
thus provide a disincentive to theft. Single plates cost $25 each
and include three years of the company's tracing service. It's a
great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Computer recovery isn't enough for most institutions: schools,
libraries and other organizations that do business with the public
have long used security plates to keep their computers locked down.
These plates consist of two metal pieces that lock together. The
bottom piece bolts to a table. The top piece attaches to the bottom
of the computer using a high-strength adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $50 to $250. If you put a computer in a public
place, be sure to lock the computer's case as well: a common trick
on college campuses is to steal the memory chips out of desktop
computers. The chips are worth more than their weight in gold, and
are easily resold because they have no serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   CompuTrace is a tracking system that's used by some businesses
and schools to locate stolen computers. The system is based on a
``stealth program'' that hides on your computer's hard disk and
periodically calls the company's tracing phone number when your
computer is otherwise idle. Normally, the program simply calls up,
says ``hello,'' and hangs up. But if you report a
CompuTrace-protected computer as stolen, CompuTrace will record the
phone number from which the next call is made. CompuTrace will then
work with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant
for the location and return the stolen property to you.
</P>
<P>
   I have no personal experience with CompuTrace, but Vanstar, the
Canadian Mounties, and the First Tennessee Bank have used the
system successfully, according to information on the company's Web
site. The program costs $70, which includes one year of monitoring.
You can find more information about CompuTrace at
http://www.computrace.com/.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you choose to protect your computer, you should
also be sure that you back up its contents regularly. You should
make and keep several backups, and you should keep them in a
variety of places.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of backups: full backups, which back up your
computer in its entirety, and partial or incremental backups, which
just back up the data that has changed on your system. You can back
up a computer to a tape drive, a write-once CD-ROM, or to another
hard disk. I frequently back up laptop computers to the 18GB hard
drive on my server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows comes with its own built-in backup software.
While Microsoft Backup is good enough for saving copies of your
data, I don't like to use it for making full system backups. The
reason is disaster recovery: using Microsoft Backup, it is very
difficult to restore a crashed computer to its pre-crash condition.
</P>
<P>
   A better product is Seagate Backup Exec, which costs $60 for
Windows 98 and $95 for Windows NT. Besides making a backup of your
hard drive, Backup Exec makes a ``disaster recovery disk.'' To
restore your backup, just boot the disk and put your backup tape or
CD-ROM into the drive. Although this disaster recovery feature is
present in most other backup programs as well, I found Seagate's to
be among the easiest to use. (Indeed, it's a slimmed-down version
of Backup Exec that Microsoft ships with Windows as Microsoft
Backup.) Seagate's software also works with a wide range of tape
drives, CDR drives, and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   On the Macintosh, the clear choice for backup software is
Dantz's Retrospect. This program comes bundled with most tape
drives sold for the Macintosh. You can also buy additional packages
of Retrospect to let you back up Mac clients or even PCs on your
network. Indeed, if I had a network of PCs to back up, I would
probably buy a Mac to be my backup server and use it to run
Retrospect.

SMART KITCHENS WILL HAVE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BETH DALEY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Beneath a glass bowl and a jar of peanuts on
the fourth floor of the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge rests the single person's answer to a
cooking catastrophe: an intelligent kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   How many nuts? Too few means candy with no crunch; too many
makes the dessert crumbly.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the recipe; just pour those peanuts into the bowl. Yawn,
maybe daydream. The counter top will tell you _ yes, it will speak
to you _ to stop when there are enough nuts in the bowl. It'll tell
you to pick up the butter next, and let you know when you've added
the right amount. A few more steps and presto: perfect peanut
brittle, every time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept, anyway, behind a five-year research project
at MIT called Counter Intelligence. Started last October, the
kitchen of the future is being created here: Intelligent coffee
machines that know to make a double espresso at 8 a.m., microwaves
that know how long to cook frozen French toast to perfection,
refrigerators that know exactly what needs to be reordered on
grocery day.
</P>
<P>
   The founding spirit behind this project is Joseph Kaye, a
22-year-old MIT graduate whose goal is to create a completely
personalized kitchen. Kaye will begin studying for his master's
degree next year by donning an apron and mixing cutting-edge
item-identification technology with coffee, cookies, and anything
else he can figure out how to make ``smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Kaye wants to turn your entire kitchen into a
humming computer. Appliances could communicate with each other.
Lights, for example, could flash when the washing machine reaches
the spin cycle. The kitchen would track coffee gone from the pantry
shelves, ice cream taken from the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   The technology relies on a replacement for bar codes called
Radio Frequency Identification, or RFID. It's already used in
automated toll collecting _ like the new Massachusetts Fast Lane
program in effect at the eastern end of the Massachusetts Turnpike.
Like bar codes, RFID tags contain specific information: In the case
of Fast Lane, names and addresses for billing; in grocery shopping,
the price of, say, a bag of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Java, Counter Intelligence's first creation, uses the tag
technology. A souped-up Acorto 2000 coffee maker, it sits in a
cramped student and faculty kitchen on the third floor of the Media
Lab.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people in the building have coffee cups with round RFID
tags glued to the bottom of the cup. The tags contain a computer
chip that holds information about the cup owner's coffee
preferences. A sensor underneath the spout on the machine reads the
tag and pours: latte, a little extra milk, extra large. Your
special coffee, perfect every time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a computer keeps careful track of the coffee that
leaves the machine, whether it goes into the special tagged coffee
mugs or a visitor's styrofoam cup. It registers what type of coffee
is dispensed, how much, and at exactly what time.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent demonstration, Mr. Java was feeling fickle. But
when running smoothly and efficiently, it is easy to see that its
ability to gather specific data about individual cups of coffee has
huge implications for tracking information not only in coffee
shops, but in grocery stores and warehouses. It's why Kaye has
companies like Kraft and Nestle underwriting his research.
</P>
<P>
   Today, grocery stores keep track of items when their bar codes
are scanned in at the register. But the process can be cumbersome;
bar codes must be read individually and can be difficult to scan if
they are dirty or torn. Meanwhile, expensive manpower must be used
to take inventory of the products still on the shelves. With RFID
technology, inventory could become completely computerized and more
efficient. Because the RFID tags can be read through a product and
from farther away than bar codes, each item could be equipped with
a tag and the shelves embedded with sensors, enabling workers to
know exactly what's on every shelf at all times. Sold items can be
reordered more easily, items found more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the RFID technology could mean that many tags are
read almost at once: Just push your shopping cart past a device
that reads the tags on all your items and tallies the final price.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, your kitchen will do essentially the same thing:
Keep constant track of almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a computer on a table, you'd have a computer all
around you, all the time,'' says Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, particularly if it is linked to kitchen
machines, may mean big business for appliance makers. Kaye is now
consulting for a European appliance manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology is not complete and, like Mr. Java, the
machines are just prototypes. And some ideas simply didn't work
out, like a refrigerator with a bar code scanner: it was too
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sketches out the future, he sees great things: a smart
washing machine, a revised refrigerator. Kaye, a bachelor, doesn't
plan on letting kitchens do all the work in the future. He adores
cooking. He just wants the milk to be fresh and in the
refrigerator, the flour on the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he wants the peanut brittle to be perfect, every
time.

HOME VIDEOS STINK? WITH THIS SOFTWARE, YOU'RE A SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID ARMSTRONG   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images are familiar to millions of video camera owners
around the world:
</P>
<P>
   The wedding shots that linger far too long.
</P>
<P>
   The blurry video of children playing.
</P>
<P>
   The footage from that time you thought the camera was off, but
it was actually recording and videotaping your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great if there was an easy way to edit your very
obviously amateur video efforts?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since I bought my first video camera earlier this decade, I
have struggled with one crude editing solution after another. The
best solution to date: Dumping my 8mm camera tape onto a VHS
cassette and fast forwarding through the less appealing scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the quest for better editing, I recently experimented with
four products that promise high-quality, easy-to-use video editing
on your home PC.
</P>
<P>
   The results of my efforts after far too many hours of plugging,
loading, playing, and editing are mixed. Video editing on your
desktop computer is possible, and in some cases, worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, be prepared to spend several, sometimes
frustrating, hours installing a video capture card, learning the
editing software, and trying to figure out how to hook up your
video camera to the various devices that link it to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Be advised that video editing software promises to test the full
ability of your PC. These programs, and the video clip files they
create, are space hogs. To edit a video that will run 30 minutes,
you can plan on using a couple of gigabytes of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition you need a computer with optimal processing speed
and as much memory as possible. If you have an older model PC,
forget about video editing.
</P>
<P>
   When the evolution of PC video editing is traced, these will
certainly be considered the primitive years. However, a quantum
leap in technology is just around the corner; by the end of the
year, several products are expected to exploit a new video standard
that will dramatically improve the editing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The four products I used all sell for about $100. But software
is not the only expense you will incur if you want to edit videos
on your PC. You're going to need a video capture card to link your
PC to your video camera or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting your PC to an external device became much simpler
with the advent of the Universal Serial Bus, known as USB,
installed in most PCs built after 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzle Multimedia's Photo Maker comes with a small, colorful
external video adapter that connects through your computer's USB
port. You simply plug it in to the back of the machine and it is
ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   For those who get queasy at the thought of taking apart a
computer and inserting an internal video card, this external drive
is the perfect solution. The Dazzle installation guide and user
manual are clearly written and simple to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzle comes with the necessary cables to connect your video
camera directly to the video adapter. After completing a simple
software installation, you can begin using the editing interface.
The video creator allows you to split, cut, trim and rearrange your
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the slickest video editing package available, but it
does a nice job of performing the type of bare-bones editing many
home users desire.
</P>
<P>
   There are several software packages that offer slicker editing,
complete with tools to add music, titles, narration, and fancy
transitions between scenes.
</P>
<P>
   I tried three of the best-sellers: Ulead's Video Studio 3.0,
Avid Cinema 1.0, and MGI's VideoWave 1.5.
</P>
<P>
   The products are similar in terms of the kind of editing that is
possible and the extra features you can add to your home video. The
differences are apparent in the ease in which you can edit your
video and the time and effort involved. The clear winner in this
regard was Avid Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing video from your camera is easy, and within minutes I
was busily trimming video, adding background music, creating
titles, and introducing voice narration.
</P>
<P>
   The Avid Cinema editing interface was the most intuitive of the
products I sampled. A series of tabs at the top of the viewer
window takes you through the four steps of editing your video and
creating a new home movie. In the editing tab, a series of new tabs
appear to add sound, create special effects and add titles. At the
bottom of the viewer, a complete outline of all your editing
efforts appears and various video and audio sequences can be moved
about to suit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done editing your video, Avid Cinema allows you to
preview your finished product on the full computer screen or save
it directly to videotape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks to Avid Cinema is that it will work only
with five kinds of video capture cards. It will not work, for
instance, with the Dazzle video capture device that connects to the
USB port.
</P>
<P>
   I used the ATI All-In-Wonder Pro video card, which has to be
installed in an expansion slot inside your computer. Installing the
card took only 10 minutes. However, I encountered a problem trying
to get the audio to work with the card. After an hour of
troubleshooting and checking all of the possible audio settings on
my computer, I logged onto the ATI homepage. In a troubleshooting
section, under audio, I learned there was a ``patch cable'' I had
to connect between the card and my line input plug to get the audio
to work. It was disappointing that this information was nowhere to
be found in the manual that comes with the card.
</P>
<P>
   While the audio problem was frustrating, the added bonus of
buying the All-In-Wonder card is the ability to watch TV on your
PC. After plugging the TV cable into the video capture card, you
can take advantage of a slick TV tuner that adjusts to whatever
size you want.
</P>
<P>
   I purchased the All-In-Wonder card for $169, but it came bundled
with several software products, including MGI's VideoWave.
VideoWave does many of the same things as Avid Cinema and has a
useful video tutorial. I didn't find the editing interface to be as
friendly or intuitive as Avid Cinema's.
</P>
<P>
   The final product tested was Ulead's VideoStudio, billed as the
fastest way to great home videos. My biggest problem with this
product was the so-called ``rendering'' process, in which video
files are compressed and uncompressed.
</P>
<P>
   I found rendering often took hours, even for clips only minutes
long. In fact, the user's manual suggests rendering really big
projects ``overnight or while you are at work.''
</P>
<P>
   And here I thought the days of having to let a program run
overnight had gone the way of dual 5 1/4-inch floppy disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Ulead product manager Brent McKendry suspected the problem with
my excessive rendering time was the format of the files I captured,
and suggested several helpful tips for reducing rendering time. One
was to create a template reflecting the exact capture rate of the
video file I was using. This helped, but not to the extent that I
could ever recommend using the product.
</P>
<P>
   On an optimistic note, McKendry said problems with rendering
time are certain to become obsolete with the advent of a new
standard for capturing video files.
</P>
<P>
   The standard adopted by most of the computer industry is MPEG-1,
which stands for Motion Pictures Expert Group. As your video is
captured, it is compressed and decompressed using a mathematical
algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, several programs are expected to start using
a new compression scheme known as MPEG-2, which McKendry said will
offer DVD-quality videos and dramatically reduce the demands placed
on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is fantastic,'' he said. At least it will have
better home videos.

A HOUSE THAT ANTICIPATES YOUR EVERY MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By YVONNE ABRAHAM   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ubiquitous computing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the watchword ``plastics'' whispered in Dustin Hoffman's
ear a generation ago, this latest catch-phrase has the tech-heads
buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   No longer just boxes on desks or laps, computers soon will be
embedded all over your house, your car _ even your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Unobtrusive, perhaps, but still ubiquitous. These computers will
have cameras or sensors for eyes, and microphones for ears. They
will link all of the appliances in your house, and connect your
house to your office computer, and to your car. And they'll get to
know you, responding to _ even anticipating _ your needs.
</P>
<P>
   In the intelligent home, you will interact with computers the
same way you interact with other people _ with speech and gesture,
and even with body language.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous computing goes far beyond user-friendly: This stuff
is downright sycophantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is not just something that makes
dinner for you or a robot that vacuums, because computers will be
more useful, and they'll get their hands on everything that we
do,'' says Michael Coen of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``From running a bath at the
right temperature, to letting you know who's in your house, or who
has borrowed one of your books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promises a revolution in quality of life the way indoor
plumbing or the light bulb did. It rivals those in changing the way
people live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're depressed, if you come home in the middle of the day
and ask the room to shut the blinds and turn off the lights and
you're not moving, it indicates you're interested in somber
music,'' says Coen, who runs a project called The Intelligent Room,
partly funded by the Department of Defense. ``It will know you're
probably not interested in listening to swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The intelligent home will recognize its occupants and act
accordingly: Kitchen cabinets will lock automatically when toddlers
go near them. If the house detects an elderly occupant lying on the
floor, it will immediately call for an ambulance. If you watch
David Letterman's monologue every night, but are stuck at an
endless dinner party, the embedded computers will automatically
record it for you. If you like to jump in the Jacuzzi at 9 every
evening, it will be bubbling at 8:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've lost my keys, I would simply like to ask the room, and
it will have seen me put my keys down, and it can tell me where
they are,'' says Coen.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, even garbage cans might contain embedded
computers that will know what empty packages you're throwing away
and re-order products for you via a link to the supermarket. Over
time, it might learn how long it takes for you to consume certain
foods, so that an order for more is placed even before you throw
the old package away.
</P>
<P>
   In the new world, teenagers will lose big, but, hey, somebody
has to. It is already possible for a home security system to snap a
picture of latch-key kids returning from school and automatically
e-mail it to anxious parents at the office. But intelligent homes
will go further, contacting you when you're out of town to tell you
your 16-year-old has 200 of her closest friends over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Sounds great, eh? But let's be realistic: How will the
average Jane, who, let's face it, can barely program her own VCR,
teach an entire house full of computers about her penchants?
</P>
<P>
   She won't have to.
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the most remarkable thing about ubiquitous
computing: After an initial set-up by somebody who knows what she's
doing, the computers will learn for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mozer's house is getting to know him. The computer
science professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder lives in
a 90-year-old converted three-room schoolhouse on a prairie near
the campus. In the early '90s, he and his students installed five
miles of conductor wire and 75 sensors in the house.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of ``watching'' him, Mozer's house has
learned his habits. It knows when he is most likely to be at home,
what rooms he uses at different times of the day, and how much
light and heat he prefers in each. Its default setting is to use as
little energy as possible, until Mozer teaches it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It learns my habits,'' says Mozer. ``I live in the house as an
ordinary person would. If I'm cold, I turn up the thermostat. Every
time I perform one of those (manual) actions, the house punishes
itself: `I should have anticipated that,' and learns for the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people would like to think their lives are less predictable
than that. But, Mozer says, even the most exciting person has
subtle patterns on which the computer, using hundreds of examples,
can easily pick up: If one goes to bed later than usual, for
instance, one likely wakes up later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, his preferences will be transportable. ``It
would be nice to turn up in a hotel room and have it know who I
was,'' he says. ``My house could transmit my parameters to the
hotel room, and I wouldn't have to fumble to find CNN like I always
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozer says he's gotten to like his house, and even to let it
tell him what to do sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to anthropomorphize it,'' he says. ``It knows my
preferences, it knows my schedules. Sometimes, when it indicates
it's time for me to go to bed, I'll oblige it.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long before this brave new world comes to your living
room?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the giant house of _ who else? _ computer magnate Bill
Gates, some of this is already up and running. Visitors are asked a
few questions about their tastes, pinned with a nifty electronic
badge, then sent off to wander the house. When they enter a room,
works by the artist of their choice appear on high-resolution TV
screens, and their favorite music begins playing. And the
all-seeing, all-knowing computer follows them wherever they go.
Gates always knows where his guests are, because the pins work like
homing devices. If the visitor has a call, only the telephone
closest to him will ring.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who don't have $60 billion, Coen says this brave
new world will be here sooner than you might think. ``Probably 10
or 15 years away, but not further than that,'' he says. And, Mozer
says, new homes are being built now with IBM network wiring that,
for a couple of thousand dollars, will allow ubiquitous computing
to just slide right into them when it becomes widely available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Look for ubiquitous computing to show up in cars first. Some
vehicles are already equipped with navigation systems, but they're
pretty primitive compared to what's being developed by companies
like Motorola. Pretty soon, says Brian McCalley, market development
manger for driver information systems at Motorola, in Austin,
Texas, a small screen where the car radio is now will display a map
if you're lost, and help you find the closest Thai restaurant if
you're hungry. It will read your e-mail to you and help schedule
your appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all little pockets of things, and then one day, all of
a sudden, they're all connected,'' McCalley says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the myriad possibilities for personalizing the
car itself, in the way Mozer's and Coen's work tailors homes to its
occupants. Before you get into your car, it will recognize you and
customize the seats, mirrors, steering wheels and radio to your
height, your _ ahem _ breadth, your favorite stations. Parents will
be able to program the car so that speed is limited when teenagers
drive it. McCally says the car will even be able to tell you in
great detail when something is wrong, and show you _ with video, if
necessary _ how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   McCalley says some of this technology will show up in cars as
early as 2001. Folks are usually more techno-minded about their
vehicles anyway. ``It's a status symbol to have technology in your
car,'' says Coen.
</P>
<P>
   But he says it won't be long before it spreads further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking into rooms that don't respond to your being there in
20 years will feel like walking into a log cabin,'' says Coen. ``It
will feel like going into a hut in a Third World country.''
</P>
<P>
   Or living in a world without plastic.

WINMODEM IS A LOSERMODEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I can't use Linux on the Web because I have a
Winmodem, which only works with Windows. Unlike other modem cards
I've seen, this one connects to other cards via small cables. Do
you know if a standard, non-Winmodem card were to replace the
existing one, would it work?
</P>
<P>
   _Linux Wannabe
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WANNABE: Just take the sucker out and see what happens. You
can always put it back later if removing it hammers your system.
I'm guessing you tossed the instruction book like most people, so
this is about the only way to do it unless you can find some
documentation on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what those wires are for. I've seen some goofy modems
in my time, like the ones that were part sound card. They hooked up
to other stuff. I've seen ones that were built into the motherboard
or relegated to a proprietary slot that grabbed the communications
port you really needed for something else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since you have a Winmodem, the real solution is to
take a big wooden mallet and pound it into its component molecules.
These cheesy things use your microprocessor instead of on-board
chips like regular modems do. The software that drives them only
runs under Windows, so if you want to play with DOS or Linux,
you're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out you absolutely need to keep that piece of junk
in your PC to make other stuff work right, there's no law against
having two modems, assuming you have a free slot. Just make sure
you set the new modem's communications port and interrupt to
something different from the Winmodem's. Yes, that means you have
to keep the instruction book this time.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're serious about playing with Linux, avoid Plug and
Play, a Windows abomination that automatically assigns ports and
interrupts. You'll have to set a few jumpers on the modem, but
you'll save yourself a ton of migraines later.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I don't think Bill Gates has a great deal to
fear until the Linux documenters learn to use English instead of
Linux-speak. They are so enamored of their jargon that they make it
next to impossible, even for an experienced user like myself, to
understand what they're saying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forms Complete Sentences
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FORMS: On the other hand, they probably didn't understand a
single word you wrote. You know how it is: Linux-speak is like the
secret handshake of the geek fraternity. I suppose it makes them
feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember how bad DOS documentation used to be, though. I'm
sure as soon as Linux goes mainstream, all the people running Linux
companies will realize the value of users actually being able to
understand the documentation, and they'll be clamoring for me to
write it for a seven-figure salary. Then I guess all the geeks will
have to make up a new language.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I find your comment ``You know who I'm talking
about: the four-eyed geek in Information Systems who gives
`socially dysfunctional' a whole new spin'' to be absolutly
repulsive! As an IT proffesional I am outraged that you would use
such a discription in a new artical.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a Snit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SNIT: Gee, I thought a big-time IT ``proffesional'' would
at least know how to use his spell-checker.

PRODUCTS TO TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A PHOTO ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM COAKLEY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your neighbor Jill sent out Christmas cards containing computer
photos of her kids, and admit it, you're jealous.
</P>
<P>
   But you're also not so sure you want to completely give up the
security of holding a real live snapshot in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   An array of photo digitizing services available everywhere from
camera shops to supermarkets and drugstores is targeting an
increasing demand for computer imaging among the mainstay of the
business: customers who want their film developed and turned into
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: ``Mom'' is still the biggest user of photo
developing services, and as Brian Noble of Hingham-based Noble
Camera points out, Mom ``isn't going to trust her kid's baby album
to a computer hard drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always going to want a hard copy, something she can put
in that album,'' Noble says.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, Mom and her family are computer users who
relish the notion of getting both prints and digitized copies of
those prints that they can transfer to their computers, improving
the quality of shots, cropping them, printing them, copying them,
e-mailing them to friends and family, and, like Jill, dropping them
into greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   More computer-savvy customers _ those who own their own scanners
and digital cameras _ can input photos directly into their PCs. But
it's the average picture taker who is creating a huge demand for
digitizing services. As more and more services become available,
more people try them and get hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that the next wave of amateur photographers
is poised to enter the digital arena, and in a big way,'' says Paul
Gordon, vice president of marketing and corporate communications
for Konica Photo Imaging. ``Consumers understand electronic media,
are comfortable with it, and want in on the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble says 3 to 5 percent of his customers now ask about
digitizing services, but ``we expect that to increase dramatically
now that computer and printer prices are dropping,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   And Eastman Kodak reports that customers asked for its new
Picture CD product with 4 to 6 percent of the rolls processed in
test marketing conducted in Salt Lake City and Indianapolis. Most
of the customers asking for the new service did not have scanners
or digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Floppies and CDs
</P>
<P>
   These days, customers can put their photos on floppy disks,
compact discs, and in special files on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to buy special software to view or manipulate
your photos; the floppies and compact discs contain software that
allows you to view, change, copy, and print photos. The Kodak
Picture CD, with a larger capacity than a floppy, allows it to
carry even more options, such as adjusting brightness and contrast.
(Most of this software is designed for use on PCs, although some,
such as Konica's Picture Show and the Kodak Picture CD, also offer
Macintosh software. But even with those products that do not have
Macintosh options, the digitized photos can be brought up on the
computer screen with any program that can read images in the JPEG
format, such as Picture Viewer, which is part of the Macintosh
operating system.)
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers also have kiosks where prints can be digitized
through a scanner and then enlarged or otherwise modified. Or you
can have photos that are already on a floppy or CD enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   However, there also is software you can buy at your local
computer store that lets you do a lot more with your digitized
photos: programs such as Adobe Photo Deluxe ($50) and Microsoft
Publisher ($70).
</P>
<P>
   Photo Deluxe is a scaled-down version of Adobe's expensive Photo
Shop program. In addition to the basic photo fix offerings, it
allows you to resize photos by dimension (5 by 7 inches, 8 by 10
inches, etc.) and by file size (bytes to megbytes), to balance
colors (more yellow, less blue, more red) and to prepare image
files for upload to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Publisher is a basic desktop publishing program that
allows you to drop photos into text, such as many other word
processing programs, but also provides greeting card and other
templates and a fairly extensive clip-art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for retail-level digital services vary, and often are in
addition to costs for developing and printing. Putting a roll of
film on a floppy runs about $5 or $6, and getting images on a CD
will cost about $10 or $12 for regular consumer versions and much
more for professional quality. In-store enlargements cost about $7
per print.
</P>
<P>
   Film is often shipped out to labs and the disks/discs are
returned in two days to a week. But a trend in the industry is to
install sophisticated equipment to develop and print film and turn
images into digital files on site in less than a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision right now is we wanted people not to have to pay a
penalty in time to get their image digitized,'' says Rory Gumina,
Kodak's director of marketing for digitization products. ``Whenever
you want your pictures, you should be able to get your digitized
images as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble's Hingham store has equipment that can put photos on
floppies or compact discs the same day you bring in the film.
</P>
<P>
   And Cameras Inc. in Arlington, Lexington, and Stoneham has
ordered similar equipment from Fuji Photo Film USA. If the company
decides to install the machine, it, too, will offer same-day
service on digitized products, says Rick Gaskell, who runs photo
labs for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Internet photos
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to store your digitized photos not on a disk
or disc, but on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You simply check the Internet box on your photo order when you
bring in your film. It costs $5 or $6.
</P>
<P>
   Along with your negatives or prints, the film processor will
return a card containing the Internet address you use to get to the
online photo service (such as www.konica.com or
www.kodak.photonet.com) and an access code.
</P>
<P>
   Connect to the Internet, go to the page, and use the code to
access your photos, which are stored on a page for 20 or 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The photos pop up as thumbnail images. You can choose among
several thumbnail sizes. You can also download photos (including a
higher resolution image for $1), e-mail them, or give others the
Web address so they can look at the photos on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, more consumers are buying into the digital age. Tom
Hoerrner, Fuji's marketing manager for lab systems, says Fuji will
sell more digital mini-labs this year than traditional
photo-processing equipment, even though the digital setups are 15
to 20 percent more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuji equipment, like other such mini-labs, allows even
customers with digital cameras to bring in photos on digital camera
storage cards such as Smart Media and get finished, glossy prints.
</P>
<P>
   So after you import your favorite photos into your Christmas
cards, you can also tuck them securely into that photo album.

IT'S ALL IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think about technology in the home, and your mind instantly
focuses on Internet access. Or wide-screen TVs. Or even wireless
phones possibly replacing your old, wired phone.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of PC and Mac users, the best technology in
their homes is anything that will allow them to drive faster, shoot
better, or hit a golf ball or baseball farther _ all on their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   They're the Serious Gamers, and when it comes to their favorite
hobby, they spend Serious Money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when you can get a decent home computer for $500, some
Serious Gamers spend that much just on a set of computer speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent $6.3 billion on computer games last year, nearly
as much as we spent on movies. For most of us, the games provide a
convenient fantasy break in the midst of a busy day. Half an hour
of blowing up aliens, and then back to work. But then there's a
hard core of fanatical gamers who devote every free moment to the
latest digital diversions. And for these fervent players, only the
finest equipment will do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  The first item on the serious gamer's shopping list is a
top-notch 3D graphics accelerator. Despite the sexy name, an
accelerator isn't much to look at _ just a drab-looking circuit
board covered with chips.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't ordinary chips. A 3D accelerator is actually a
computer in its own right, one that's faster in some ways than the
fastest Pentium III or Power PC chips. And all that power is used
for just one thing _ drawing realistic three-dimensional images on
your computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to a really, really good 3D gaming system is a 3D
accelerator card,'' says Dan Amrich, associate editor of
Gamepro.com, a leading computer games Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest modern games can make your computer screen appear to
be a window into a fully realized three-dimensional world. This is
achieved by constructing all the game's images out of millions of
little triangles, or polygons. When a character in the game moves,
all those millions of polygons change their angles. As a result,
every object in the game shifts its relative position, just as
you'd see while walking through a room in real life.
</P>
<P>
   But to do this in a computer requires a monstrous amount of
mathematics. Worse yet, for the game to be realistic, the images
must change smoothly and without any delay. In other words, all
that math has to happen literally in millionths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what 3D accelerators do. Top-line products, like the
3Dfx Corp.'s Voodoo 3 chip, can perform 100 billion calculations in
a second. Accelerators, like standard computer chips, also need
memory to store the data they process. Today's high-end cards
generally come with at least 16 megabytes of memory devoted solely
to 3D processing. Cards like these range from $150 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Some gamers are upgrading their entire computers to get
better graphics performance. That's because of a new system for
connecting the accelerator to the computer's motherboard. It's
called the advanced graphics port, or AGP. A computer with AGP
transmits data to the accelerator much faster than with older
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Just as gamers want 3D images, they're also demanding 3D sound.
In some newer games, like the shoot-'em-up Unreal, sound becomes a
vital part of the playing experience. Players who can hear the
enemy coming up behind them have a big advantage over those who
rely on the cheap speakers that came with their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   So Newton-based Cambridge SoundWorks is helping gamers fight
back, with a line of four-channel speakers especially for computer
buffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really taken a strong position that the future in
high-end audio for gaming is four-channel sound,'' says Tom
Hannaher, Cambridge SoundWorks' senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to work with four-channel computer sound
cards made by the company's Singapore-based parent, Creative
Technology Inc. Four small ``satellite speakers'' are positioned
around the room, with a subwoofer to provide powerful low-frequency
sounds, like things going ``boom!''
</P>
<P>
   The setup sells for $199, not counting the sound card. ``It's
about as much as a computer person's willing to spend on
speakers,'' Hannaher says.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again, Tom. Some fervent computer audiophiles will spend a
lot more. Eminent Technologies Inc. of Tallahassee, Fla., offers
its LFT-11 speakers, listed by Computer Gaming World magazine as
essential pieces of hardware for ultimate gaming fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   And at $500 for a pair _ $600 with auxiliary amplifier _ these
speakers are definitely priced with the fanatic in mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Still, for sheer gaming frenzy, it's hard to beat the
thousands worldwide who log onto the Internet to compete in auto
racing tournaments. Today's high-end car racing games allow players
to challenge each other on the world's greatest courses.
</P>
<P>
   Graphically, these games are accurate to the smallest detail.
But most players use game controllers that don't measure up. Many
use mock steering wheels and pedals that plug into a computer's
game port and boost the illusion of driving. But most of these
devices are cheaply made, with an unrealistic feel to them. After
all, building a racing wheel that would really emulate the
experience of driving a race car would cost a small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many who are happy to pay. Business is good at
Extreme Competition Controls Inc. in Minneapolis. ECCI charges up
to $1,400 for its ultra-realistic racing wheels and pedals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an automotive-quality product,'' says company president
Andy Cers. An ECCI wheel-and-pedal set is made of steel and
aluminum and weighs 50 pounds. The steering wheel offers
progressive resistance that stiffens the farther you turn it. The
braking effect varies depending on how quickly you step on the
pedal. You can even get a version that comes with a hand-made
steering wheel produced by the Italian firm Momo, renowned for
making wheels for real race cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grandy of Scotia, N.Y., repairs cable television set-top
boxes by day and drives the on-line NASCAR stock car circuit by
night. He'd never touched a computer until four years ago. Today,
he's one of the top on-line racers, and he swears by his ECCI
steering rig. ``It's just perfect,'' Grandy says. ``I don't even
know how to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would know exactly how to describe it _ wildly
extravagant. But for the die-hard gamer, it's worth every dime.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Valley of unexpected millionaires, Meg Whitman is the
unlikeliest of billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman recalls the day in November 1997 that a headhunter
urged her to leave her comfortable job promoting Teletubbies at
Hasbro Inc. The proposition: to head up a no-name Silicon Valley
startup that needed a chief executive. Her answer was ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Like legions of graduates coming out of elite business schools
in the late 1970s, Ms. Whitman had taken her Harvard MBA and
slipped quietly into a successful career at a blue-chip consulting
firm. She later moved to corporate America, happy to work for the
likes of Disney and Stride Rite.
</P>
<P>
   So it would take more than Internet stock options in a company
she had never heard of for Ms. Whitman to give up the peaceful life
she enjoyed with her husband and two sons in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Ms. Whitman visited the cramped San Jose, Calif.,
offices of Ebay Inc., the person-to-person Web auction community
that was already attracting a following so devout it bordered on
the cultish. After a few days being wooed by venture capitalists
and hearing the testimonials of users so addicted they slipped out
of business meetings to monitor their auctions, Ms. Whitman was
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought something was very right here,'' she said. ``They
had touched a consumer nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman's ``No'' became ``Yes.'' And 14 months ago, she
packed up her family and moved to California to begin preparing
Ebay for the initial public stock offering that the company's
founder, Pierre M. Omidyar, was already mulling.
</P>
<P>
   Since its $735 million offering last September, the company's
market capitalization has blossomed to $22.1 billion _ the stock
price skyrocketing 1,019 percent. And the 42-year-old Ms. Whitman,
along with a cadre of early investors, has become very rich _ at
least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But more to the point, she is also one of the new generation of
Internet executives who is bringing conventional corporate bona
fides and consumer product-style marketing to the Web. In the
process, executives like Ms. Whitman are changing the way Web
companies are run _ even as they are developing a new management
style suited to this emergent medium.
</P>
<P>
   With no technology background to speak of, Ms. Whitman leaves
the heavy lifting to the tech experts. But what she does seem to
have are many of the skills that may be necessary if Ebay is to
prove itself more than a hot stock or consumer fad and become an
established brand. In some ways, executives like Ms. Whitman are
becoming to technology what Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's,
was to fast food and consumer culture in the early 1960s. In those
days, an executive didn't need to understand the chemistry of
ground beef to deliver a hamburger people wanted. Likewise, today's
Internet executives don't have to be computer geniuses, but
seasoned brand managers who immerse themselves in the culture they
are trying to foster online.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagle, a partner at the venture firm Benchmark Capital,
an early Ebay investor who hired Ms. Whitman, may put it best: ``I
was looking for a brand builder to help make Ebay a household name.
Understanding technology was not the central ingredient. You have
to get the emotional component of the customer experience in your
gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Ebay brand is becoming synonymous with Ms.
Whitman, something she is not entirely comfortable with. A man
moving furniture at Ebay's headquarters last week pointed at her, a
spark of recognition lighting up his face. ``There she is,'' he
shouted. ``My wife said she's seen you on TV. Maybe 10 times.
You're real popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman smiled and waved at the man. But the grin faded as
she turned away. ``That's what I hate,'' she said. ``I even have
the furniture man noticing me.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention isn't all that surprising, though. Ms. Whitman
campaigns for Ebay as fervently as any candidate on the trail. In
recent weeks she attended a press conference with the governor of
Utah; spoke to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington,
where she also met with congressional leaders to discuss online
privacy, and been interviewed for a handful of upcoming profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't care,'' she said, commenting on the media
swirl. ``But it is the right thing to do for Ebay.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman never planned on a Web career. After a summer
selling advertising for her college magazine at Princeton
University, she switched from pre-med studies and graduated with an
economics degree in 1977. She got her MBA from Harvard Business
School two years later, and briefly worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble
before moving to San Francisco in 1981 with her husband, Griffith
R. Harsh IV, who landed a neurosurgery residency at the University
of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There, she was hired by the consulting firm Bain &AMP; Co., where
she worked for eight years. But the demands of her husband's career
(they moved to Boston in 1992 when he became director of the brain
tumor program at Massachusetts General Hospital) and the fact that
headhunters called every time a new job surfaced, led to a number
of jobs at several companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was her two years as chief executive of Florists' Transworld
Delivery in Michigan, though, that proved her biggest
disappointment. Ms. Whitman had been hired by the florist-owned
member association in 1995 _ better known as FTD _ to help smooth
its transition to a privately held company. But several key members
opposed the idea, quick decisions were politically impossible and
competition was eroding market share. Conceding defeat, Ms. Whitman
quit in 1997, moved briefly to Hasbro and the next year found
herself at Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   As if to test the new chief's technical mettle, Ebay's Web site
crashed during her first day on the job, crippling trading for
eight hours. ``The No. 1 job at Ebay is keeping the site up,'' she
said, so she assembled a team of senior managers to assess the
site's reliability. As a result, Ebay added enough backup software
and computer servers to increase trading capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But intermittent problems have persisted, and Ms. Whitman has
not hesitated to tap powerful Silicon Valley connections to help
her. ``Last January, we were having short outages _ 10 to 15
minutes,'' she recalled. ``It made everyone here crazy.'' So she
called Scott G. McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc., who she
has known for a decade. ``I said, `Scott, I need a nanny for this
system until the baby gets better.' '' Now Sun technicians are on
call 24 hours. But the baby can still be fussy; just last Monday
trading was interrupted for four hours because of a computer
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Ms. Whitman's job is understanding who uses the auction
service. About a year ago, Ms. Whitman set up a consumer insight
and analysis group to find out. Unlike traditional retail
companies, she said, ``there is no one between us and the
consumer.'' So twice monthly Ebay posts customer surveys on the
site. Among the suggestions that were adopted is ``Ebay Life,'' a
newsletter chock full of feel-good stories _ like the woman who
collects wedding cake decorations, 50 of which she found on Ebay,
or the stay-at-home mom who is an avid Ebay trader at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, at times, can come off as a bit homespun, but that doesn't
concern Ms. Whitman. ``I didn't create this culture, but I want to
maintain it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kagle can attest to that. It was he who prodded her to set up a
feature that customers had been requesting: notification by e-mail
whenever favorite items are up for bid. And everyone is a source of
feedback. Even the architects who redesigned their headquarters
were asked to buy something and report back to Ms. Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Ms. Whitman meets with staff members to
review what competing auction sites have that Ebay does not. Ebay's
recent $260 million acquisition of auction house Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield was spurred, in part, by the threat of competition, she
said. And Ebay is rushing to expand into untapped regional as well
as foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the sense of urgency that drives her, Ms. Whitman
displays a calming, down-to-earth veneer _ perhaps a result of her
upbringing as the youngest of three children in the comfortably
affluent village of Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island's North
Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was a businessman, her mother a full-time homemaker
with a sense of adventure. Ms. Whitman recalls the summer she was 6
years old when her mother, the three Whitman children and a family
friend with five children of her own, embarked on a three-month
camping trip across Canada to Alaska. Driving for long stretches in
a camper with canvas bunks in the back, the children would
sometimes get antsy and start to squabble. So Ms. Whitman's mother
came up with an unusual solution to tire them out.
</P>
<P>
   She would stop the camper, order the children out on the
deserted Alaskan highway and let them run ahead, creeping behind in
the camper until they were weary. More than once, a passing trucker
would stop to ask if something was wrong. ``You could always hear
the hiss of the air brakes,'' Ms. Whitman recalled. ``We finally
put up a sign on the back of the camper that said, `We're OK'''
</P>
<P>
   And one year, during the family's annual Christmas camping trip
on the island of St. John in the Virgin Islands, her parents were
too late to make a reservation at the usual campground. Undaunted,
the family bivouacked in a toolshed.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to make do may help explain why Ms. Whitman was
willing recently to move with her husband and children into a
subdivision in Menlo Park that the locals refer to as ``Woodside
training houses,'' because executives there typically aspire
eventually to the exclusive homes in that nearby town. ``We didn't
want to buy a statement house,'' she said (although not buying a
statement house is a statement in itself). They do plan to move
once they have finished remodeling a 3,800-square-foot home they
bought in well-heeled Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Ebay will be her last job, Ms. Whitman said. Her
stock options _ worth about $1.3 billion as of Friday's closing
price _ vest over four years, and she plans to stay at the company
at least five years. But by then, if she has not delivered, her
options could be worth significantly less or, depending on the
capriciousness of the market, nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   For it is not yet certain whether the new brand-conscious
executive is indeed the blueprint for the future, or simply an
expensive experiment in Internet management. Yahoo and Amazon.com
are already fast on the heels of Ebay hoping to grab the company's
loyal customers for their own. And more are sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this constant roar,'' Ms. Whitman said. ``The
challenge is to reorganize your business every three months.'' And
being on the run makes missteps inevitable. ``You will be wrong
sometimes,'' she said. ``That is just going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty is a condition with which Ms. Whitman, and any
investors in Internet stocks, for that matter, must learn to live
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has done a great job so far with the stock,'' said Alberto
Vilar, president of Amerindo Investment Advisors, and one of Ebay's
largest shareholders. ``Anyone who wants to pick her off as a
second-rate manager is barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   But though a fan of Ms. Whitman, Vilar sounded the kind of
warning that is an implicit part of being one of today's new Web
chiefs: ``Her board and shareholders are going to lynch her if she
doesn't execute.''

PUBLISHING INDUSTRY CONTENDS WITH THE UNCERTAINTIES OF E-BOOKS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Mayer felt the slim weight of an electronic book in
the palm of his hand, he suffered instant pangs of dread.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reassuring crackle of paper or the faint scent of
ink that had been a constant in his career in publishing, for two
decades as chief executive of Viking Penguin and now of his own
independent company, Overlook Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect it,'' Mayer said of the electronic book that could
change the dynamics of his business, ``but I have an emotional and
professional investment in what I know. And when I was young, I
knew that I could conquer any change, and now I don't know what's
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Such wariness is prompting Mayer, and some authors and agents,
to shy away from books made of bytes until a clear view develops of
the rapidly emerging market for electronic readers. The culture of
technology has collided with the slower-moving book industry, which
is engaged in a tense, early clash over how to divide up the spoils
of an infant business that is still difficult to picture in scope
and potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scramble over who controls what,'' said Laurence
Kirshbaum, chief executive of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time
Warner unit that includes Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co. He
noted that ``we're not being motivated by what's to come, but a
fear of being left out as the train is pulling away from the
station, with some exotic station in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, the New York-based Authors
Guild mailed out contract warnings last month to some 7,500
members. The letter criticized current e-book contracts as bad
deals. The guild said it considered distribution fees for
electronic book manufacturers a payment scheme that would deny
publishers and authors the rewards of the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent literary agencies are also advising authors to
refuse electronic book agreements unless the contracts promise to
revise the deals if electronic editions rapidly gain popularity.
But in turn, some publishers are refusing to make that concession,
which means that many popular books are staying firmly on the
bookshelves instead of a digital page.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, start-up technology companies have
pushed forward with plans to make electronic books as ubiquitous as
mass market paperbacks. This month, Nuvomedia will expand its sales
of $500 versions to stores, while Librius is preparing to begin
selling its slender 12-ounce pocketbook-sized model for $200 in
July. Softbook Press has been lining up deals with corporations and
school districts that are eager to eliminate lockers and reduce
backpack strain on students laden with textbooks. Softbook's
version, with note-taking and scribble functions, sells for $299.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-books became available late last fall.
Barnesandnoble.com, for example, has about 500 titles available for
sale and downloading and has sold about 15,000 copies in this
format. In general, the privately held manufacturers will not say
how many of the electronic readers have been sold, but a
Barnesandnoble.com spokesman, Ben Boyd, said the company had been
``pleasantly surprised with the pace that customers have purchased
these devices and titles.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may seem small now, says Chuck Verrill, a literary
agent with Darhansoff &AMP; Verrill, but ``the issues are profound in
their long-term impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to see the market grow, but we want to make sure
the terms are fair,'' he said. The agency's authors, including
Arthur Golden and E. Annie Proulx, are avoiding the electronic
format until they reach better deals with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The devices that are inspiring all this anxiety weigh from 12
ounces to more than two pounds and carry brand names like Rocket
eBook, Millennium E-Reader and the Softbook. They seem rather
expensive now for leisure reading, but eventually the manufacturers
expect the cost to fall below $100 or plunge to nothing as e-books
are given away like cellular phones to entice customers to buy and
download books, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   With almost missionary zeal, the entrepreneurs developing the
e-books from the West Coast and a culture of technology are
predicting changes in a publishing industry centered in New York
and steeped in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be everywhere,'' said Devin McKinney,
director of content services for Softbook Press. ``I think that 50
percent of the books are going to be published in electronic form
and not in paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers say they do not feel threatened by the development of
the electronic book because they do not think the form will replace
conventional books for adult readers who will always want to savor
the familiar touch of paper.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of young readers may have different notions
about what constitutes a good book. Some school districts are
already negotiating to buy the Softbook for students to essentially
create ``textbook-free'' schools where students can download books
and packets of course information over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Davis Joint Unified School District in Davis,
Calif., is expecting to learn this month whether it has received a
$6 million federal grant to subsidize the purchase of some 3,000
electronic books that will be shared among 7,700 students.
</P>
<P>
   But if educators see immediate benefits, publishers are showing
more caution as the first deals are struck for electronic rights
that could set a pattern to last the life of a copyright. When
authors try to make the case that paperless books will result in
cost savings, Random House, the top-ranking publisher, expresses
private misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo, the company said that ``a generally held
misconception is that publishers will make greater profits on
e-books since the costs of paper, printing, warehousing and
delivery are saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ignores the different kinds of costs that are incurred in
handling e-books,'' the memo said. It then listed the added
expenses of formatting manuscripts for electronic books, protecting
digital material from piracy and granting higher discounts to
e-book distributors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Authors Guild does indeed expect savings from lowered
paper and printing costs and so, as the guild's director, Paul
Aiken, put it, ``the result seems clear: Authors should receive a
significantly higher royalty for e-books than they do for physical
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Authors Guild says that now, a writer might get a share as
great as 15 percent of the list price of a book as a royalty. The
structure for an electronic book is about the same, but can run as
low as 4 percent. In a conventional contract for a hard-cover book,
the publisher gets about 35 percent of the list price while the
distributor gets 15 percent and the bookseller keeps 35 percent.
With the new electronic rights agreements that e-book manufacturers
are getting from publishers, this structure shifts, with publishers
getting 25 to 40 percent, booksellers 35 to 40 percent and
distributors 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the guild has assailed the new cut for Nuvomedia,
which it describes as a combined ``whopping 60 percent distribution
fee'' to Nuvomedia and Barnesandnoble.com, which sells the
electronic titles.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such sentiments anger e-book manufacturers
like Martin Eberhard, the chief executive of Nuvomedia of Mountain
View, Calif., even though the parent company of Random House,
Bertelsmann AG, has invested in his company and in Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Book Expo America in Los Angeles, which draws
thousands of booksellers and publishers, Eberhard sat in his
exhibit booth, fuming about Random House's arguments and the
Authors Guild letter, which also contended that ``profit margins
for publishers and royalty rates for authors should soar with these
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the publishing industry doesn't let up on these squabbles,
it will hurt them,'' he said, adding that the combined 60 percent
share for the distributor and bookseller had since dropped to 55
percent of the list price of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard contends that the costs of publishing an electronic
version are lower than conventional formats and so authors can
improve their shares. But he complained that Random House was
taking credit for bearing the costs of encrypting digital material
``because they're trying to get the best royalty rate that they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Random House's general counsel, Harriette Dorsen, said:
``Publishers do the formatting and each device needs to be
individually done. Upgrades are required for new upgrades of the
devices.'' In addition, she said, the costs of encryption are
passed back to the publishers through higher discounts granted to
e-book manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some literary agents contend that Random House has taken tough
negotiating positions by refusing to allow contract revisions as
the market grows. But Ms. Dorsen said: ``This is emphatically not
correct that we have refused to revisit the issue of royalties. In
fact, we understand that in a changing environment, with a business
in its infancy, there will be changes in the way this business is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tension is such that Nuvomedia is prevented from
selling an electronic version of Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a
Geisha,'' one of the titles published by Random House's Knopf unit
that was used to test Rocket eBooks with customers. ``We had it all
ready to go, and it was pulled at the last minute because the
author wasn't happy with the deal,'' Eberhard said.
Barnesandnoble.com, which was offering it on its site, deleted it
when a dispute emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Golden's literary agent, Verrill, said that they chose not to
permit an electronic version more out of concern about the
uncertainties of the future. In general, he said, he thinks that
publishers should allow contracts to be revised after a limited
number of years to gauge the impact of electronic books on
publishing economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to commit a book that was likely to sell for
the next 20 years over terms that seemed so unthought-out,''
Verrill said..
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is aware of the impact if authors continue
to shy away from electronic versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it has an impact,'' Verrill said. ``It affects the
content that Nuvomedia can offer, and if they have nothing but
books nobody wants, then they're likely to fail.''

ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT PURSUES ITS WHALE, THE DIGITAL SET-TOP BOX
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Bill Gates become the Captain Ahab of the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Gates' white whale remains an elusive digital set-top cable box
that his company, Microsoft Corp., is hoping will re-create the
personal computer industry by blending the PC, the Internet and the
television set into a leviathan living-room entertainment and
information machine.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an obsession for more than six years for Gates,
whose ``Windows everywhere'' software strategy has led the company
to look to extend its Windows operating system monopoly into every
cranny of the computing industry _ from mighty mainframes to the
computers embedded in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the tantalizing possibility of the computerized
television set that has fixated Gates most, leading to the
construction some years ago of a faux living-room laboratory in a
building on Microsoft's office campus in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that is because the prospect of digital television _
part PC, part boob tube _ promises the greatest return on the
company's research and development investment. Digital television
holds out the Holy Grail: the intersection of the nation's most
vibrant industries, including media, computing, entertainment and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Microsoft agreed last week to invest $5
billion in AT&AMP;T, as part of that company's deal to add MediaOne
Group, the cable television company, to its recently acquired
Tele-Communications Inc. cable empire.
</P>
<P>
   Television sets are in some 98 percent of American households,
while personal computers are having trouble breaking the 50 percent
threshold. Thus, a Windows operating system monopoly on the set-top
box would dwarf the scale of the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television is the 3,000-pound gorilla,'' said Nicholas
Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, just as Captain Ahab's quest for Moby Dick led to a
miserable outcome, there is no certainty that Microsoft's quest for
the television set top will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, Microsoft proposed a joint venture with Time
Warner Inc., AT&AMP;T and TCI called Cablesoft, in an effort to harness
the cable and phone industries to the Microsoft Windows software
operating system standard. Since then Gates has repeatedly tried to
forge pacts with partners in those industries.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have welcomed such overtures, like Comcast, the
cable company in which Microsoft acquired a 11 percent stake a few
years ago, others have held back. The laggards feared they would
inevitably fall victim to the same forces that enabled Microsoft to
reduce many PC hardware makers to mere purveyors of commodity
goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's considerable financial heft has eroded most
resistance. Besides the Comcast stake, Gates' investments in his
pursuit of interactive digital TV have included WebTV, Time
Warner's Road Runner, four European interactive cable television
investments and, finally, last week's investment in AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a $5 billion stake, AT&AMP;T has warily agreed to
license a minimum of 5 million copies of Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system and engage in several showcase tryouts of the
software, the consumer-electronics version of Microsoft's
industry-dominating Windows software for PC's.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will ensure that Microsoft gets an inside track in the
new interactive television industry, which after years of delay
appears to be showing some signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Microsoft's chairman believes with great certainty that
interactive digital television is the Next Big Thing. And yet just
as Gates, the visionary, entirely missed the dawning of the
Internet, there is growing evidence that rapid technology
transitions are not predictable _ let alone manipulable.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for multimillion-dollar test runs, Gates may be
ignoring years of consumer indifference and outright interactive
television failures like Time Warner's debacle in Orlando, Fla., a
few years back _ not to mention the rapid emergence of a range of
alternative technologies for delivering Internet content that may
quickly bypass the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to Gates is that the interactive television set, upon
which he is betting most heavily, may prove a mirage that wastes
billions of dollars of investment capital and Microsoft development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The offspring of a dream that stretches as far back as the
1970s, digital television has long been a Chimera pursued by
high-technology executives _ whether in the form of videotext,
video on demand or, more recently, Internet via television.
</P>
<P>
   The new hope is that while no one has been able to figure out
the challenge of how to supply more than several channels of
compelling programming for a television audience simultaneously,
the World Wide Web would offer an easy solution.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Microsoft envision that the DTC-5000, a set-top
box due this fall from General Instrument, will serve as a choke
point for all the digital information flowing into and out of the
home.
</P>
<P>
   The original vision of interactive cable has now stretched far
beyond 500 channels to include telephone service, video on demand,
stereo audio, video games and Internet access. As a result of this
``all things to all people'' impulse, the DTC-5000 has sometimes
been derided as an information-age Cuisinart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the joke inside AT&AMP;T labs, where engineers are testing
the box, is that DTC-5000 has so many connectors that the physical
integrity of its back panel has been compromised. The prototypes
include connections for cable, power, Ethernet and Firewire
networks, Universal Serial Bus, telephony, audio, video, infrared,
PCMCIA card, smart card and computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   While simpler and more compelling alternatives _ ranging from
the home PC to a growing array of wireless and hand-held computers
and phones _ offer a seemingly more convenient way to obtain
Internet data, Gates has continued to pursue the parallels between
the world of interactive digital television and the personal
computer industry, and to re-create a dominant role for Microsoft.
Indeed, forcing Windows CE on the cable industry has become a
virtual religious crusade inside Microsoft's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big frontier, and Bill is scared to death that it's
going to pass him by,'' said a member of the AT&AMP;T team that
negotiated the deal with Microsoft. As described by Microsoft's
deal-maker and chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, the investment
makes sense as a bet on the future of high-capacity _ or broadband
_ telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is finally a plan to go out and deploy something, and
that's a great opportunity for us,'' Maffei said in a telephone
interview Thursday, after the deal closed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives argue that a business rationale now exists
for interactive television _ as opposed to the Orlando interactive
television pilot that Time Warner started with great fanfare in
1994 only to unceremoniously shut it down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation is allowing a single supplier and pipe into the
home to provide digital television, telephony and high-speed
Internet access,'' said Hank Vigil, vice president for consumer
strategy at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the crusade to bring E-commerce to the family-room sofa is
probably no closer this week than before the arrival of last week's
alliance between the software and the telecommunications industry
giants.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, AT&AMP;T will be competing with other technologies
challenging cable as a means to deliver Internet data: fixed and
cellular wireless telecommunications; the phone industry's digital
subscriber line and interactive satellite systems from the Hughes
Electronics subsidiary of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, other technologies _ including the PC, digital
videocassette recorders from companies like Replay Networks Inc.
and Tivo Inc., as well as a new generation of video game players
from Sony, Sega and Nintendo _ will all contribute to the
accelerating fragmentation of the mass cable-television market.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T may even become its own largest competitor, especially for
providing consumers access to Internet electronic commerce. The
company has quietly accelerated plans for a nationwide introduction
of Internet-ready cellular phones, skipping 64 kilobits a second
and going directly to 384 kilobits.
</P>
<P>
   Such a network will be ideal for a new generation of
Internet-compatible telephone-Web browsers now being shown by Nokia
and Ericsson. Though a shift to mobile Web browsing would be warmly
greeted by AT&AMP;T, it is likely to sharply limit the market for
consumers willing to buy an expensive additional Internet account
just to permit them to browse the Web on their TV.
</P>
<P>
   And in the mobile and wireless world, Microsoft is already at a
clear disadvantage competing with the cellular phone industry,
which has shown little interest in a Microsoft Windows CE operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Gates appears to have nearly infinite capital to invest in his
dream, but there seems to be little to ensure that he will be able
to enact his vision. That, of course, is the risk of being a
visionary.

MICROSOFT AGREES TO EXPERIMENT WITH NORTEL'S OPTICAL NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., known as a company that runs on e-mail, may be
right when it says that it demands more from its internal data
network than perhaps any other company in the nation. To expand the
capacity of that network, Microsoft has turned, at least
tentatively, to Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the two companies plan to announce that Microsoft has
agreed to try a new Nortel optical networking technology _ one
designed to expand the capacity of fiber-optic networks by a factor
as great as 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of looking for a supplier for our
next-generation backbone,'' said Gregg Atkins, a senior network
engineer for Microsoft's internal information technology group,
referring to Microsoft's core corporate network. ``And we are
looking at this emerging technology and we see this as a solution
for our corporate network.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite the solution yet. Microsoft, which does not plan
to revamp its network until early next year, wants to take the next
six months or so to determine which communications equipment makers
will get the lion's share of its business.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft trial is a big vote of confidence in the
optical networking group at Nortel, the former Northern Telecom
Ltd. Nortel is locked in battle against companies including Lucent
Technologies and Ciena to become the leader in a new sort of
communications technology called wave division multiplexing.
</P>
<P>
   Wave division multiplexing, or WDM, transmits multiple
wavelengths, or colors, of light through a single strand of optical
fiber. The system that Microsoft has agreed to use could employ as
many as 32 different wavelengths.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nortel said it had developed a long-distance WDM
system that uses 160 different wavelengths. But a network for a
local area like Microsoft's offices in the Seattle vicinity must be
capable of adding or removing traffic at many different points. For
that reason, the WDM technology for a smaller area cannot yet
achieve the raw performance of a system that transmits information
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's internal data load quadruples about every 18 months,
Atkins said. The system is used not only for internal
communications including electronic mail, he said, but also as a
testing and proving ground for Microsoft developers who want to
make sure that their software will work in congested networks.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Microsoft installed fiber-optic technology
from Fujitsu of Japan and Alcatel of France. But Atkins said those
systems were nearing obsolescence, at least for Microsoft's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel said the technology that Microsoft will use came to
Nortel through its acquisition of Cambrian Systems Corp. of Canada
last year for about $300 million.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: AN UPFRONT APPROACH TO INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every consumer study on the subject of online privacy has been
unequivocal: People fear being bled by data vampires on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this gnawing contradiction: If consumers are so
fearful of their privacy, why did more than a million people reveal
virtually everything personal, short of their DNA sequences, in
hopes of getting free computers and Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is more subtle than the polar arguments of either
free-market or privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Free PC, a hatchling from the Idealab technology incubator in
Pasadena, Calif., announced earlier this year that it would give
away PCs and network access to 10,000 households between April and
June. To be considered, applicants agreed to accept continuous
on-screen advertising. They also had to complete an exquisitely
detailed personal survey so that if they were chosen, Free PC could
create their household's custom advertising profile.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, collecting personal information solely to
deliver custom advertising sounds like the epitome of what most
would call data abuse. But what Free PC has started, albeit
clumsily, appears to be precisely the model for handling personal
data that privacy advocates have been championing for years.
</P>
<P>
   And if it succeeds, it may also signal a death rattle for
today's multibillion-dollar industry for personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, no one really cares about privacy; they care
about being surprised,'' said Seth Godin, an online marketer whose
book ``Permission Marketing,'' was just published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster (www.permission.com).
</P>
<P>
   People claim to cherish their privacy, he said, but ``your
credit card company already knows everything about you _ when
you're having an affair or trouble at work, when you're seeing a
bankruptcy counselor _ and this doesn't bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   What does bother people, Godin contends, is when the possessors
of such personal information do something unexpected with it. Say,
when e-mail in-boxes suddenly start filling with pitches for cable
descramblers or Viagra-by-mail ads. Or when, the day after closing
the deal on a new home, unsolicited letters from mortgage insurance
and interior design companies start arriving.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite their deep distrust of most companies that
collect data on the Web, a majority of consumers say they are
interested in providing personal data to marketers _ under the
right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Vanderbilt University analysis of consumer responses,
``Building Consumer Trust in Online Environments: The Case for
Information Privacy'' (www2000.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu/papers.html),
reported that more than 72 percent of Web users would relinquish
their data if they were assured of ``a cooperative relationship
built on trust'' _ specifically, if the sites would provide
statements about how the data were going to be used.
</P>
<P>
   In Godin's lexicon, that cooperation is the essence of
permission marketing, which has three basic components: It is
anticipated, it is personal and it is relevant.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one successful permission-style online promotion,
for H&AMP;R Block, started with banner ads that said, ``Click here if
you want H&AMP;R Block to pay your taxes next year.'' Those who
responded, Godin said, were obviously interested in both the
subject _ taxes _ and the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Then the respondents were asked whether they would participate
in an eight-week e-mail contest. The incentive was that H&AMP;R Block
would pay the winner's taxes for a year. The campaign's response
rate was a remarkable 35 percent, Godin said.
</P>
<P>
   Before being acquired by Yahoo several months ago, Godin's
company, Yoyodyne, created and ran 150 of these permission-style
promotions. He says that the typical response rate for them has
been 10 to 20 percent, compared with about 2 percent for
traditional direct-marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't more companies embraced the permission model?
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct marketers are scared,'' Godin said. ``The key to their
multibillion-dollar industry is the buying, renting and selling of
mailing lists. Permission marketers know that selling your list
guarantees it becomes worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   And though permission is Free PC's marketing model, Bill Gross,
the company's founder, says he has been shocked by the vehemence
with which privacy advocates have attacked him. ``The issue is not
privacy,'' Gross said. ``It's disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Free PC never made any bones about what it would do with the
data, Gross said. It has also agreed to protect information about
its customers rigorously. The privacy policy on Free PC's Web says:
``Rest assured that we will never give out your personal
information to anyone. No one, including our advertisers, will be
able to identify you individually. And we will never sell, trade or
give away your information.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gross described even more fastidious
protections: customer data will be used only within Free PC and not
by any other company affiliated with Idealab. ``We've even said
that our agreement with you is transferable to any potential
acquirer of the company,'' he said, ``so we can't sell the company
to anyone who would potentially change our privacy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these important provisos, however, is stated on the
company's site (www.free-pc.com), nor does it state whether
advertising partners must match its stringent privacy rules. And
Gross might also want to state the company's intentions for the
data submitted by the million-plus applicants who will not receive
free PCs. (He has not decided, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Another good idea might be to tell people whether accepting a
free PC means that they subject themselves to a lifetime of e-mail,
or whether Free PC will expunge them from the company's database if
they decide they no longer want the service.
</P>
<P>
   These questions are too serious to leave unanswered. But despite
_ or maybe even because of _ the controversy that Free PC has
generated, the company finally may have forced open the door to a
marketing model that puts control of personal information in the
hands of consumers, and even gives them something in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to a consumer and say, `I'll pay for your attention,'
that is so much more interesting than an advertiser who can
interrupt your life without you getting any benefit out of it,''
Godin said of Free PC's strategy. ``People calling you at home
during dinner, you can't stop. Billboards on the highway, you can't
stop. But if you don't like their deal, you can stop.''

 Pretty Web Pages Can Be Ugly to the Disabled  
 By Benny Evangelista   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blazing 3-D graphics, video and sound that enliven
multimedia Web sites also can create barriers for people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web design is primarily driven by retinal chauvinists,'' said
Jerry Kuns, a visually impaired sales representative who uses
computer speech and Braille synthesizers to read information on the
Internet. ``Pictures are great, but they are stumbling blocks to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, audio clips can present a barrier for hearing
impaired people if no text translation is available.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a worldwide Internet standards body has just created
guidelines to help Web designers avoid problems that make their
sites cumbersome or unusable for people with physical or learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The World Web Web Consortium, called the W3C for short, released
its ``Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has become a very visual medium,'' said Judy Brewer,
director of the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative. ``It's a
wonderful way to exchange information. But if you have someone who
can't see that information, they wouldn't necessarily know what's
in that content.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a button graphic on a company's Web site that links
a sighted person to products they can buy online may not be visible
to a person using software that converts text into speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with sight might see `products, services, a business
plan, news,' but someone who can't see that would hear, `image,
image, image, image,''' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   And sites that rely solely on mouse clicks for navigation may be
difficult for people with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines ``take that into account, so a developer doesn't
have to think through all of that,'' Brewer said. For instance, she
said the guidelines say ``when you are putting in an image, add
alternative text.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300-member W3C also created a list of 10 tips for making
pages more accessible, such as always using the ``alt'' key to
display text that describes what visual elements like buttons do.
</P>
<P>
   Web accessibility is not just an issue of aesthetics, Brewer
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 opinion written by the U.S. Department of Justice said
the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act _ a sweeping bill that
mandates that buildings and services be made accessible to people
with disabilities _ also applies to companies and government
agencies offering products and services through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, the W3C also tried to create guidelines that could
bring about better Web designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid an accessible page is dull or
boring, but multimedia can be effective support for
accessibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are available at www.w3.org/wai. For a list of 10
quick design tips, go to www.w3.org /WAI/References/QuickTips.

TECHNOBUDDY: Use your computer to take a shortcut to shortwave 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be a Bulgarian in my PC.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's sitting next to a German woman singing opera, who
is not far from a pompous-sounding British guy reading the news.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, I turned my PC into a shortwave radio. I did
not need the eye of a newt (newts across the nation should be
grateful for that), nor was it necessary to whisper the secret
words (you won't see them here; they wouldn't be secret anymore if
I told you).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for $300 I added on a computerized shortwave radio. For
the money, you get a radio that performs just about as well as the
fancy $2,000 shortwave transceiver I use in my ham radio hobby. The
radio doesn't look like much _ it's small (about the size of a
brick) and doesn't have dials or knobs. That's where the computer
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   You hook up the radio to the computer (using a serial cable),
load in some software that comes with the radio and _ all of a
sudden _ you have a working shortwave. You use your mouse to tune
the radio, clicking on an on-screen control panel. That's part of
the reason you get so much radio for so little money _ the computer
does a lot of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is made by a relatively small company called Ten-Tec
that's located in Sevierville, Tenn. (You can read about it on the
Web, or even order a radio, by going to www.tentec.com.) The fact
that the radio is made in the United States is a big deal, at least
to me. Shortwave radios _ like almost any other electronic gadget
you can name _ just aren't made here anymore for the most part.
Most of the big names _ Kenwood, Yaesu, Sony, Icom, among others _
are made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   I was halfway afraid when the folks at Ten-Tec offered to send
me one of the radios to try. I like the idea of American-made
radios (and cars and steel and almost anything else you can name),
but if the radio had been really lousy I would have had to let you
know. But I didn't need to worry. Not only is the radio about the
size of a brick, it works and feels as sturdy as one.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about a shortwave radio that plugs into a
PC? After all, you can buy shortwave radios that don't plug into a
PC all day long. That's precisely the point ... you can buy them
all day long but, mostly, people don't buy shortwave radios. It's
seen as a hobby that is old-fashioned and sort of geeky, the very
same way that computers were seen when I started messing with them.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, computers are trendy and seen as a lot of fun. So
I am hoping that some of you find this great hobby of shortwave
listening through the back door. Maybe because the Ten-Tec radio
(it's called the RX-320 PC radio) works with a computer, some of
you will give it a try. Then, once you have it, maybe you'll pretty
much forget about the computer for a while and get lost _ in a good
way _ searching the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The night I tried the radio, I listened to an American fighter
plane communicate with his controllers, two ham radio operators
talking about cornbread and bird dogs, a really intelligent
commentary on the troubles in Kosovo from the BBC (arguably the
best radio news service in the world), and some opera from Germany.
Compare that to what you can find on your local cable television
lineup at any given time of the evening and _ unless you actually
like programs designed for dull normal people _ you'll see why I
think shortwave radio is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent a lot of time bragging on the Ten-Tec radio, and
everything I've said is true. But don't get hung up on that
particular radio if it is too pricey for you or if you'd rather
have a radio that you can take camping. You can find less-expensive
models from companies such as Grundig, Sony and Radio Shack, and
any of them can literally transport you to new places.

NETWATCHER: NPR missing boat on online shopping 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to National Public Radio: Want to raise money? Think about
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, NPR ``Weekend Edition'' anchor Scott Simon read
aloud from a children's book called ``Polka Bats and Octopus
Slacks'' by Calef Brown. Many listeners were charmed by the offbeat
nonsense poems and logged on to Amazon.com to order one or more
copies of the book for the little ones in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But as it happened, Amazon underestimated just how many people
listen to NPR. There was a sudden flurry of requests for what was a
relatively obscure children's book. My friend Janet, who wanted
three copies, received a note from Amazon, sadly informing her
there was a ``surprise sellout.'' This is not an isolated case.
Another friend tried to order a CD featured on NPR, only to be told
of a similar ``sudden sellout.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise? Oh please. Let's think about this for a minute, shall
we?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to me that if you are Amazon.com and have
experienced several ``surprise sellouts,'' this might be something
you would want to look into. You might find out either from your
own internal reconnaissance or from readers like the one from
Youngstown, Ohio, who posted a note on the ``Polka Bats'' page
telling fellow book lovers that the reason the book was sold out
was because it had been featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   NPR is woefully underrepresented on the Web. I recently spent
two or three weeks searching on and off for a book I heard featured
on ``Weekend Edition.'' This was particularly rough since I could
remember only one word of the title.
</P>
<P>
   I finally found the book by searching through a long list of NPR
programs and trying to remember exactly which Saturday it was that
I heard the review. Clearly, there has to be a better way to
capture folks like Janet and myself, who are referred to in the
retail industry as ``motivated buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Major media organizations like CNN and even online-only
publications like Salon have deals with Barnes &AMP; Noble. Visitors to
each site are directed to Barnes &AMP; Noble to purchase books and
music featured on the sites. NPR has something of a relationship
with Borders online and offline bookstores to sell feature books
and CDs mentioned on its programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of books in Borders' ``Heard on NPR'' Web page is
painfully short, doesn't tell you much about the books and does not
include the beloved ``Polka Bats'' book.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio, home to such popular programs as ``All
Things Considered,'' ``Fresh Air,'' ``Car Talk'' and ``Prairie Home
Companion,'' boasts an upscale, literate and educated audience.
These are the same people analysts say are most likely to have
computer access and engage in online shopping. Pointing people to a
Web site where they can buy these books, CDs and other NPR-related
items seems like a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of NPR's subject matter and its upscale,
computer-savvy audience is an e-commerce bonanza waiting to happen.
Borders.com, which seems to have some relationship with NPR, should
work to get more and more featured materials on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For an online bookseller running a distant third to Amazon and
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders.com has a great opportunity to drive
traffic, build out its brand and establish itself as the
``do-gooder'' shopping site that supports the noble cause of
National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the subject of underwriting. Anyone who has
had their favorite NPR programs interrupted by the sounds of
ringing phones and pleas for pledges knows that NPR is
listener-supported radio. There is no advertising. So maybe instead
of interrupting my drive-time commute to ask for a donation, why
not encourage me to go to a Web site and buy something?
</P>
<P>
   All or part of the proceeds could go to NPR. If these sudden
sellouts of books and CDs mentioned on NPR say anything about NPR
listeners, it says this is an audience that uses the Internet to
buy books and music. NPR's television counterpart, the Public
Broadcasting Service, has its own online store at shop.pbs.org. All
proceeds from books and videos sold on the site go to support
public television. Why not shop.npr.org?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is simple: Organizations that need money a lot
less than NPR are using online shopping to increase brand
awareness, drive traffic and make money. NPR listeners will spend
the time and the money online purchasing books, CDs and other
materials mentioned on its programs. If there's any organization
that needs to get deeply into electronic commerce, it's National
Public Radio. And if there's anybody who needs to be thinking about
funding NPR, it would be the online book and music retailers who
are, or could be, supported in part by NPR listeners.

Palm V sticks with basic design, improves screen and software 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's expensive at $430, but the Palm V represents a big
improvement over earlier models of this hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac users, what's most important is that manufacturer 3Com
has finally got the PalmPilot's backup and synchronizing software
right for their platform.
</P>
<P>
   The company has successfully converted Apple Computer's old
Organizer software into a new release called MacPac 2.0. It's a
reliable and sophisticated personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   But MacPac is no longer the only choice. Several other personal
information managers, such as Consultant and BrainForest, are also
offering versions for the Mac PalmPilot. That makes the PalmPilot
the only hand-held alternative for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Software is just the beginning of the improvements for Palm V.
There's nothing radically new about this latest model, which is
good news. The company has wisely decided to stick with the basic
design. What it has done is tweak the original design in important
new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the screen. One of the big problems with
earlier PalmPilots was that the screen was hard to see in dim or
direct light.
</P>
<P>
   With the Palm V, you can see the screen in almost any lighting.
Images are sharp and clear. There's a backlighting button included
with the Palm V, but you almost never need it.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change with the Palm V is that it doesn't use
batteries. Instead, you recharge it from a cradle that plugs into
the back of your Mac. It is from this cradle that you also back up
your calendar, to-do list, notes and contact list into the
Organizer software.
</P>
<P>
   One charge lasts days, if not weeks, depending on how often you
use the Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of these technical improvements. What really grabs
people about the Palm V is its looks. This PalmPilot sports a
wafer-thin, silvery body that fits snugly into any palm or pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In this design, 3Com has stolen a page from Steve Jobs' playbook
at Apple and discovered that style in designing computers is
important.

More than art that works, it's a mouse-terpiece! 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pity, for a moment, the abuses suffered by your
garden-variety computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Manhandled and squeezed by uncaring palms. Forced to run laps
around the mouse pad or crawl with exacting precision on an Excel
spreadsheet. Retrieved with a pull of the tail when it is
accidentally shooed off the desk by a clumsy hand. Often forced to
live a bland white-beige existence.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Miller, a University of Texas graduate and former Power
Computing Corp. salesman, is doing something about the unjust life
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner Reid Dickson founded Custom Mouse Co., a
small operation they run from Miller's apartment. There, they make
mice with personality _ custom-designed mechanisms with color, odd
shapes and designs.
</P>
<P>
   Custom Mouse Co. has its roots in Dickson's garage, where the
two first took apart broken mice and experimented with black
leather, and later, paints and silk-screen logos. But not just any
paints _ specialty painting and silk-screen companies that work
with Custom Mouse do a three-layer paint job on the mice that
yields what you'd find on a Lexus or a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a colorful collection of mice that look ready for
the race track.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dickson buy mice from a supplier, then take custom
orders from companies, hoping that instead of the usual coffee mug
or key chain, companies in today's computer age will give away mice
with their company logos as promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In bulk, the mice run about $36 a piece _ about three times the
cost of a typical bargain-basement mouse. Custom Mouse has only
worked with a few clients so far, including Falcon Imaging
Solutions, but Miller hopes the company will make a splash this
year at a trade expo for the promotion industry in August.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful mice may become a booming industry _ the popularity of
Apple Computer's iMac proved there's a market for more colorful
computer goods. Miller said the small variety of computer colors in
the PC world led to his partner's idea for the company. He claims
he hasn't heard of any other company doing similar work.

CYBERSCENE: Meet someone new via personal Web pages 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked between the Web pages that sell you books, urge you to
download music, and extol the virtues of Fords and Chevrolets are
some pages that have nothing to sell. For the most part, the
designer of the page and the owner are the same person.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, these are personal Web pages. For the most part, what you
read and see on them won't help you with a term paper or provide
you with information you need at work, but it may introduce you to
some interesting people. Almost all personal Web pages have links _
usually at the bottom of the page _ that let you send e-mail to the
creator. It's a nifty way to meet people around the world (this is
the World Wide Web, remember) and, worst case, you'll probably
enjoy the old-fashioned nature of a home page. Many of them are
filled with family snapshots and stories.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find random home pages? After all, it's not like
doing a search for the gross national product of Brazil. But there
are ways, and today we'll show you some of the keys that will get
you into home pages from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a start that may keep you busy for a few days. Yahoo!
(www.yahoo.com) has a section that includes 64,000 or so personal
home pages. Just go to
http://dir.yahoo.com/SocietyandCulture/People/PersonalHomePages/
and start clicking. You'll find that this directory is organized
alphabetically. And that leads us to one of the really entertaining
things that today's adventure into the personal offers us.
</P>
<P>
   Why not start the journey by looking up home pages by people
with your last name? Now for a person named Husted, that can be
especially entertaining. Most of the pages are in Denmark _ based
on the origin of the name _ so it offers a chance to learn about
that part of the family who stayed home. Admittedly, if you are a
Williams, Smith, Miller or Jones, the appeal may be less, but even
then you may find a distant relative in Des Moines. So click on a
letter of the alphabet and read the information that should include
the name of the page and a brief description of what it contains.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest repositories of personal home pages on the
Web is located at www.geocities.com. You can peruse the pages there
by starting at www.geocities.com/Avenues/PeopleandChat/. You'll
find that the vast GeoCities site is divided into neighborhoods.
It's very similar to real-world neighborhoods: Members select a
neighborhood area for their home page and build there.
</P>
<P>
   Since these are big neighborhoods _ true virtual cities _ you'll
need to use the search capability to find the sort of home pages
that interest you. For instance, let's say that you decide to visit
the College Park neighborhood at www.geocities.com/CollegePark/.
Then you can use the search function (it's on the left side of the
page) to type in a search word. The name ``Husted'' brings up a
list of sites that are either run by someone named Husted, or that
discuss that name. But you could just as easily search for
``skiing'' or ``pets'' or ``games.''
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines, including AltaVista (altavista.digital.com)
have the same sort of search functions you'll find at Yahoo! or
GeoCities. But you are not limited to formal collections of
personal home pages. You can also use any search engine, type in
search words that include ``home'' and ``page'' and ``personal,''
and search out the most specialized pages easily.
</P>
<P>
   If, after spending a lazy afternoon searching other home pages,
you find that you like the charm of visiting with real people from
around the world, remember that it's fairly easy to build your own
home page and join the fun. And sites such as GeoCities offer free
space for home pages so _ if you get the building urge _ you can
soon have a home on the Web of your own.

APPLE INTRODUCES NEW POWERBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A resurgent Apple Computer introduced a new,
lighter Powerbook Monday that the company maintained would permit
it to retain its performance lead over the larger Intel-based
computing world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's co-founder and interim chief executive, Steven
Jobs, announced two new models at the company's annual development
conference, which began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, which are priced at $2,499 and $3,499, are both
built around a PowerPC microprocessor that employs the advanced
copper-based chip technology developed by IBM Corp., which
significantly reduces the power requirements and thus increases
battery life.
</P>
<P>
   The new machines, which have 333-megahertz and 400-megahertz
processors, are about 20 percent thinner than Apple's current line
of G3 Powerbooks. However, at 5.9 pounds they are still heavier
than the ultralight Windows-compatible notebooks, typically around
four pounds or less, from companies like Sony, Toshiba, Sharp and
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   On the retail computing front, Jobs said the iMac consumer line
of computers would soon be carried by more than 800 Sears, Roebuck
stores. That will give Apple a distribution channel into the
no-computer consumer world, which it needs following a decision
last month by the Best Buy chain to stop carrying the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs was also vague about the announcement date of the company's
long-rumored ``consumer portable,'' with which Apple is planning to
duplicate the company's iMac strategy in the low-end retail
computing arena. While Apple's sales have increased significantly
in the last year, it is still under pressure from the Intel world,
where prices of Intel's own processors and those of competitors
like Advanced Micro Devices have continued to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, pricing pressure did not appear to be a
concern. Jobs at one point in a two-hour presentation told the
audience of 2,500 Apple developers that the company had beaten the
current leader in the Intel world, Dell Computer, on maintaining
minimum inventories in the last three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple has become the most operations-efficient computer
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the morning session was devoted to the company's
software strategy, and Jobs said that for the first time in years
the company now had a consistent message.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to introduce an enhanced version of its
Sherlock Internet search technology later this year. The software
will enable Macintosh users to query multiple shopping sites or to
gather other kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Apple announced that it was shipping a new update to its
operating system, version 8.6, and Jobs demonstrated two future
versions, one code-named Sonata and another that will be released
as Mac OS X sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the features of Mac OS X, including a new windowing
system dubbed Quartz and some new interface features, are
reminiscent of Jobs' Next software, which received high technical
marks but failed in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Apple has made significant progress in wooing
software developers, Jobs said that Dragon Systems Inc., publisher
of a popular speech recognition system, would once again produce a
version for the Macintosh. Janet Baker, the company's chief
executive, said the company would release its software for the
Macintosh early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs went to some lengths Monday to thank the developers for
standing by the company during several rough years. He said that
the new Apple Computer had shaken off the software doldrums and
noted that in the last year since the introduction of the iMac,
software companies had announced some 3,100 new applications for
the Macintosh.

IBM, NINTENDO SIGN $1 BILLION CHIP DEAL FOR NEW VIDEO GAME
MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing significance of inexpensive video game
machines in the computer industry, IBM Corp. and Nintendo Inc. plan
to announce Wednesday a $1 billion agreement for Nintendo to build
its next-generation system with IBM's PowerPC processors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the PowerPC chip has been best known as the processor
that powers the Macintosh line of computers from Apple Computer
Inc. The deal is something of a coup for IBM, which will gain a
coveted foothold in a booming market being fiercely contested by
three Japanese giants _ Nintendo, Sony Corp. and Sega Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the computer industry predict that powerful game
machines from the three companies will begin taking on a wide
variety of computing tasks in their next generation, including
Internet communications and music and video entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And because the business model for video games uses software
sales to subsidize the cost of hardware, the machines are almost
certain to cost less than even the least expensive personal
computers. What is more, by some measurements, they will outperform
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Nintendo and IBM refused to comment Tuesday, but
people close to the deal said the companies planned an announcement
at the E3 video game convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would also serve to revitalize IBM's beleaguered
PowerPC business, which was founded as a great strategic alliance
with Apple and Motorola Corp. in 1991, but has languished.
</P>
<P>
   Although the venture was originally intended to provide an
alternative hardware standard to processors made by Intel Corp.,
bureaucratic squabbling and the failure to bring several
next-generation operating systems to market undercut the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Nintendo, IBM will make a custom
400-megahertz PowerPC microprocessor for a new Nintendo game
machine, scheduled for worldwide introduction in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The chip, which will be made using IBM's currently most advanced
manufacturing process, will be paired with a high-performance
graphics chip being designed by Wei Yen, a former computer designer
from Silicon Graphics Inc., people close to the agreement said. Yen
leads a small computer graphics design firm, ArtX Inc., based in
Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo PowerPC chip will permit the game machine to
display realistic three-dimensional images and will be a source of
rivalry between Nintendo and Sony, which last month began
demonstrating its Playstation II.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony system is built around a high-performance graphics
processor that Sony is now designing with Toshiba Corp. The two
companies are investing as much as $2 billion in a new
semiconductor manufacturing plant to produce integrated circuits
for the game system, which is expected to go on sale in Japan later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Sony and Nintendo threatens to eclipse Sega,
which has built its Dreamcast machine around an alliance with
Microsoft Corp. The Sega system, which is now being sold in Japan,
has graphics processing power that is better than the current
systems, but it will be no match for new systems planned by Sony
and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Slater, editor of The Microprocessor Report, said,
however, that in the world of video game machines the capabilities
of the graphics processor, the chip that produces the actual images
on the screen, are more crucial than the set's microprocessor chip,
which carries out all the other instructions encoded in the game
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real performance comes from the specialized graphics
engines that perform 3-D operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the video game business, which will have sales
this year that surpass Hollywood's box office revenue, have led
both Nintendo and Sony to pre-announce their machines to build
enthusiasm, particularly among the software developers who supply
crucial titles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sony will begin selling its machines later this year in
Japan, the actual war for dominance of the next generation of video
game players will not take place until Christmas 2000. That is when
consumers will have a choice of machines that will offer remarkably
lifelike game experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations given by Sony officials earlier this year
suggested that the new game systems would be able to match the
visual effects seen in computer-animated movies like ``Toy Story,''
while at the same time allowing players to have interactive control
over the characters on the screen.

AMERICA ONLINE CHALLENGES MICROSOFT'S WEBTV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only weeks after completing the purchase of Netscape
Communications Corp. _ Microsoft Corp.'s archrival in Web browsing
software _ America Online Inc. announced Tuesday that it would take
on Microsoft in delivering the Internet over television sets.
</P>
<P>
   The new product, to be known as AOL TV, will compete directly
with Microsoft's WebTV, which already has about 800,000 users.
</P>
<P>
   AOL TV will be built around four partnerships announced Tuesday,
including a deal with Hughes Electronics, to deliver high-speed
access to America Online and the Internet via home satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The deals reinforce a growing rivalry between America Online and
Microsoft, which last week announced that it had invested $5
billion in AT&AMP;T to prepare for the convergence of
telecommunications and computing.
</P>
<P>
   That convergence, which will among other things bring high-speed
Internet access into homes over television cable systems, poses a
huge threat to America Online and other Internet service providers.
America Online, which was built around dial-up modem technology,
stands to lose many of its 17 million subscribers if they find
speed more alluring than the comfort of America Online's content,
design and features.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to deals America Online announced earlier for local
phone companies to provide high-speed access to its members, two
partnerships announced Tuesday _ with Hughes Network Systems and
DirecTV, both subsidiaries of the satellite giant Hughes
Electronics _ pave the way for America Online to be packaged with
DirecTV, the most widely used home-based satellite television
system, with 7 million users.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also announced partnerships with Philips
Electronics to create a set-top box for sending and delivering
material from the World Wide Web over telephone lines and other
cables. The box will be powered by National Semiconductor's GX
processor, a computer on a single chip _ a major break for
National, which last week announced that it was abandoning its
financially disastrous Cyrix line of processors, which compete with
Intel Corp.'s Pentium line.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another snub of Microsoft, America Online announced that
it was working with Network Computer Inc., a subsidiary of Oracle
Corp., to develop an operating system for AOL TV.
</P>
<P>
   Network Computer already builds set-top box operating systems in
Europe and Asia to compete against WebTV. Its alignment with
America Online will ``add momentum to a competitor to Microsoft,''
said Van Baker, director of consumer market research for Dataquest.
``This clearly reinforces the rivalry between AOL and Microsoft,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft purchased WebTV in August 1997 for $425 million. It
offers two pricing options, a standard service for $24.95 a month
and a slimmed-down version for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement helped boost the entire technology
sector, and all participants in the deal enjoyed gains. America
Online jumped 13 1/8 to close at 141 7/16, a gain of more than 10
percent. Hughes Electronics, a division of General Motors, rose 2
to close at 60 5/8, while National Semiconductor closed at 20 3/16,
up 9/16. Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV gained 1 3/16 to close
at 90 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3/16 to 79 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the success of AOL TV would depend on what type of
content the company planned to deliver over television sets. He
said WebTV had learned that consumers were not very enthusiastic
about general surfing of the Web. As a result, the company now
emphasize content that enhances the television experience, such as
highlighting Web pages associated with a given TV program.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Barry Schuler, president of America Online's
interactive services group, said his company did not plan simply to
stream the service's existing content onto television, but to
create ``an entirely different service'' that would emphasize
combining television and the Internet. For example, users could
chat with other viewers of the same program or could visit Web
sites associated with a program or could shop for, say, an album
while watching MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said the company planned to have a service available
sometime next year but had not yet made a decision on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   He said America Online planned to make more announcements in the
coming weeks regarding other providers of set-top boxes and
partners who would provide technologies to deliver America Online
over handheld devices, pagers and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said AOL TV would be marketed primarily to the company's
existing subscribers. He said members use the service 55 minutes a
day on average and were likely to be interested in porting the
experience to the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer will continue to be the anchor that people use to
get started,'' he said of the Internet experience, ``but as they
are incorporating it into their lives more and more, they will use
other devices in the household.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether America Online and Microsoft will end up competing
or cooperating in the set-top box space, Schuler said he was
``anxiously awaiting'' word about whether Microsoft would be
interested in providing AOL TV over WebTV or through the 5 million
set-top boxes it will be producing for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   William Keating, general manager of the platform division for
WebTV, said: ``I don't have a position on that. It's a complicated
question. I'm sure if we entered into discussions, we'd be happy to
talk with them.''

 &HT;    Avoid getting raked over coals: Clean grill
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ We're coming up on the first big grilling holiday
of the year (Memorial Day, May 31), and the retail trend of the
past decade seems to be continuing: It's easier to find a variety
of propane-gas grills than old-fashioned charcoal grills these
days.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a grill you haven't used since last fall, now's
the time to drag it out and get it into shape for cooking. You have
to be especially careful about maintaining it because a poorly
maintained gas grill can be more dangerous than a charcoal grill.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips for getting the most out of the grill:
</P>
<P>
   GAS GRILLS
</P>
<P>
   The best time to give your gas grill its thorough annual
cleaning is at the end of the grilling season in the fall.
Otherwise, grease and dirt will have all winter to corrode the body
of the grill. Plus, hardened food by-products will be harder to
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But if you didn't clean up last fall, expect to spend an hour or
two cleaning up now before using the grill.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need some warm water with grease-cutting dish soap or
other mild detergent, a vinyl-bristle brush, a soft cloth,
toothpicks, sandpaper, a nonmetal bottle brush and your owner's
manual.
</P>
<P>
   Following the instructions in your owner's manual, disconnect
the hollow burner tubes through which the gas flows and use the
bottle brush to thoroughly clean the insides of the tubes. Grease
blobs and spider webs can clog the small gas ports in the burner
tubes. Clean them carefully with toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing the burner tubes, clean the inside and outside
of the grill housing with the vinyl brush. Use aluminum foil to
keep water from getting inside gas orifices.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with chipped paint must be sanded, primed and repainted
with heat-resistant paint. Paint only while the grill is cold and
allow time for the paint to dry before turning on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Stove polish, a liquid or paste polish with black pigments, can
also help restore the grill's original, lustrous-black look.
</P>
<P>
   Check your gas line, line connections and propane tank before
restarting the grill. You can check the lines and connections by
turning on the gas and brushing the connections with soapy water.
Bubbles will form at the site of any leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes tightening a connection will stop a leak, but
sometimes you'll have to replace a hose or an O-ring.
</P>
<P>
   Although propane tanks will last as long as the grill, dented or
badly rusted tanks must be replaced immediately. Minor tank
corrosion can be fixed the same way chipped paint on the housing is
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   When you're sure the grill is ready to turn on, burn some of the
grease off the briquettes and cooking grids.
</P>
<P>
   Flip the briquettes so the greasy side faces the burner and
return the cooking grids to their usual positions. Light the grill,
close the lid and set the flame on high for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the grill cools, remove the grids and briquettes and scrub
off any remaining grease with the vinyl brush and soapy water.
Rinse, towel dry and put them back in place.
</P>
<P>
   During the cooking season, flipping the briquettes over after
every use will help keep down the accumulation of grease.
</P>
<P>
   CHARCOAL GRILLS
</P>
<P>
   Read your owner's manual and follow its advice when it comes to
maintenance. Too many people who use charcoal grills base their
usage on family traditions and ignore the manufacturers' guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Charcoal grills should be cleaned thoroughly once a year, and,
again, fall is the best time. You'll need warm, soapy water, a
vinyl scrub brush, a scouring pad or pumice stone and a garden
hose.
</P>
<P>
   Start by emptying the ashes from past cookouts. It's a good idea
to have a metal trash can handy to dump used ashes, even if you
believe they're completely cool.
</P>
<P>
   Scrub the grill housing inside and out with the vinyl brush and
soapy water. Some enameled grills can stand up to household oven
cleaners, but check your owner's manual or call the manufacturer if
you're unsure. Rinse off the soap with the hose. Towel dry.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with chipped paint or rust should be sanded, primed and
painted with heat-resistant paint.
</P>
<P>
   The grilling grate can be cleaned with a scouring pad or a
pumice stone. Pumice stones are getting rather rare, but you should
be able to find them at hardware stores for a couple of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Before each use, clean the grate with a specially designed grill
brush or a piece of crumpled aluminum foil. Wipe with paper towels.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me what countries other than the United States
are taking in Kosovo refugees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Citing as its source information provided by the various
governments, the Associated Press released this list of countries
that have offered to accept the refugees on a temporary basis:
Turkey and the United States, 20,000 each; Germany, 15,000; Finland
and Italy, 10,000 each; Norway, 6,000; Sweden, Austria and Canada,
5,000 each; Australia, 4,000; Britain, ``up to 1,000 a week,''
without specifying the number of weeks; Switzerland, 2,500;
Netherlands, 2,000; Denmark and Romania, 1,500 each; Poland, 1,000;
Portugal, 500; and Iceland and Malta, 100 each.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says refugees already
evacuated from Macedonia have gone to these countries, as of May 7:
France (2,519 refugees), Belgium (1,205), Czech Republic (346),
Spain (208), Croatia (188), Slovenia (186), Israel (106) and
Slovakia (90). The countries and the number of refugees will be
changing as the exodus continues, according to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the child born to the Kosovo refugee
couple shortly after they arrived in the United States last week
was an ``instant American'' with full U.S. citizenship. Can you
explain the basis for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's in the Constitution: 14th Amendment, Section 1. It
states, in part: ``All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the state wherein they reside.'' The
amendment was ratified in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii still active? I'm planning
to visit there in June and would like to see it, but I haven't read
anything lately about any eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   A: The eruption continues at Kilauea, the most active volcano in
the world, says Norrie Judd of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on
the island of Hawaii. Kilauea is a ``very dynamic volcano,'' she
told Q&AMP;A. She added that despite its continuing activity, Kilauea
did experience a ``pause'' in the eruption recently, after which
the lava flow resumed.
</P>
<P>
   So Judd recommended that Internet users check the Hawaii Volcano
Observatory website _ http://www.nps.gov/havo _ then scroll down on
the first page to the bottom, and click on the Hawaii Volcano
Observatory connection followed by the Eruption Update. Those
without Internet capability can call the park headquarters visitor
information line, 808-967-8186; or the eruption information message
line, 808-985-6000.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasses 230,000 acres and
ranges from sea level to the summit of Earth's mose massive
volcano, Mauna Loa, at 13,677 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I are having a dispute about a new TV
commercial for Coca-Cola. It shows skydivers jumping out of an
airplane and forming the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle in the sky. He
thinks part or all of it is computer generated, but I say it's for
real, with real skydivers. Who is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: You both are. The creators of the commercial filmed four real
skydivers making more than a dozen jumps over a period of several
days at Paris Airfield in the Los Angeles area, said Susan
McDermott of the Coca-Cola Co. Then Digital Domain, which was
responsible for some of the computer-generated effects in the movie
``Titanic,'' created the images of more than 200 skydivers from the
footage of the four real ones. Jan De Bont, director of ``Speed''
and ``Twister,'' directed the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we used such a fabulous director and
special-effects house make it a very special commercial,''
McDermott said. ``It's captured the interest of TV viewers all over
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Sadie Hawkins Day? How did it get started?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the brainchild of the late cartoonist Al Capp, who
created the comic strip ``L'il Abner'' in the 1930s. In the strip,
Sadie Hawkins was characterized as the ``homeliest gal in all them
hills,'' so the mayor of Dogpatch staged a race in which the girls
could chase the boys in hopes of catching a husband. The concept
continues today with such things as a ``Sadie Hawkins dance,'' in
which a woman has the opportunity to turn the tables for a change,
taking the initiative to invite a man.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the new state quarters being issued in the order in which
the states gained admission to the union?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The quarters being issued this year are for these five
states: Delaware (statehood date, Dec. 7, 1787); Pennsylvania (Dec.
12, 1787); New Jersey (Dec. 18, 1787); Georgia (Jan. 2, 1788); and
Connecticut (Jan. 9, 1788).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a fan of MSNBC's John Hockenberry. Why does he use a
wheelchair? What did he do before joining MSNBC?
</P>
<P>
   A: As he explained in his book ``Moving Violations: War Zones,
Wheelchairs and Declarations of Independence,'' Hockenberry was in
an auto accident when he was 19. It left him with an irreversible
spinal cord injury at chest level.
</P>
<P>
   His broadcasting career is long and varied. He has been anchor
of ``Talk of the Nation,'' a live call-in show from Washington;
general assignment reporter, Middle East correspondent and host of
several National Public Radio programs; correspondent for the ABC
newsmagazine ``Day One''; and correspondent for NBC's ``Dateline
NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of two Peabody awards, Hockenberry also performed in
a one-man off-Broadway production based on ``Moving Violations,''
his memoir of life as a foreign correspondent. He also has written
for numerous national publications.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're planning on taking a trip up to Niagara Falls in June.
Will we need a passport or birth certificate to cross over into
Canada and then return back into the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: A passport or proof of U.S. citizenship (such as a birth
certificate) and official identification with photo, such as a
driver's license, are required to enter Canada. If you don't have
the necessary documentation and don't want or have time to obtain
it, you can view the spectacle from the New York side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've often read about the benefits of drinking green tea. I
drink hot tea every morning, but the kind I like is labeled orange
pekoe. Does it have the same benefits as green tea?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, some definitions: Orange pekoe doesn't refer to a type
or flavor of tea, but rather to a leaf grade or size. Orange pekoe
is from the finest leaves; among many others are souchong, broken
pekoe, fannings and fines (``dust''). The term ``orange'' is from
an ancient Chinese custom of scenting the tea leaves with orange
blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the health aspects: Both green and black teas contain
high levels of flavonoids (antioxidants), substances that many
scientists believe prevent or delay damage to a body's cells and
tissues. Both also are said to offer potential cardiovascular
benefits and research has linked black tea to lowered cholesterol
levels and a reduced risk of urinary- and digestive-tract cancers
for older women.
</P>
<P>
   Green and black teas are derived from the same plant, just
processed differently, said Chris Rosenbloom of the department of
nutrition at Georgia State University. Green teas were the first
ones studied by researchers, which explains why they were
publicized before black teas, she added.
</P>
<P>
   And one other benefit of either green or black tea: Compared to
coffee, they have about half the caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the number of deaths by firearms and/or
handguns in the United States with those in, say, England and
Canada?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest statistics available from the National Safety
Council are several years old, but they may give you a basis for
comparison's sake. In 1995, the National Safety Council reports,
firearms deaths in the United States (excluding those from legal
intervention) totaled 35,673. This number includes homicides,
suicides, unintentional deaths and ``undetermined'' (meaning the
intentionality could not be determined). Homicides involving
firearms that year totaled 15,551. The National Safety Council
doesn't have a separate category for handguns only.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics for deaths in other countries by all firearms are not
available. But according to organization Georgians Against Gun
Violence, homicides in 1996 involving handguns totaled 2 in New
Zealand, 13 in Australia, 15 in Japan, 30 in Britain, 106 in Canada
and 211 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what is the formula for calculating a pitcher's
earned run average?
</P>
<P>
   A: An ERA is the average number of earned runs scored against a
pitcher every nine innings. An earned run is one that is scored
without the aid of an error. To determine a pitcher's ERA, divide
the number of innings pitched by 9. Then divide that total into the
number of earned runs the pitcher allowed. Carry the answer to two
decimal places.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused about orange juice. Is there a nutritional
difference between ``from concentrate'' or ``fresh squeezed''? If
it's imported from Brazil or elsewhere, is it the same as that from
Florida?
</P>
<P>
   A: The different forms of juice have similar caloric and vitamin
C levels, so choosing between them is more a matter of convenience,
taste and expense.
</P>
<P>
   All orange juice contains water and sugar. The term ``fresh
squeezed'' is self-explanatory. Concentrate is created when water
is removed. You can restore the water yourself to frozen
concentrate, in the amount directed on the container, or you can
buy it with the water already added back in. And it doesn't matter,
nutritionally speaking, where the oranges were grown. They're all
from the same plant, whether it's grown in Florida or Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was an Army meteorologist in World War II when experiments
were conducted to see if clouds could be seeded with chemicals to
produce rain. What techniques are used now? And does it work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rainmaking procedures first were developed in the 1940s. The
methods involved airplanes above the clouds dropping flares with
silver iodide crystals; airplanes below the clouds releasing a
liquid fertilizer spray of ammonium nitrate and urea, with air
currents carrying the spray into the clouds; and ground-based
generators distributing vapor containing silver iodide, with wind
hopefully strong enough to carry the vapor into the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 50 years of research, scientists haven't been able to
demonstrate the effectiveness of rainmaking in all cases. So debate
continues about its validity. Also, some people believe that
attempts to artificially increase rain in some areas might cause
shortages of rain elsewhere. Many states impose regulations on
rainmaking, and some states have even prohibited it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you enlighten us about what Home Shopping Network did
that caused it to be fined more than $1 million for false
advertising on some kind of health issue?
</P>
<P>
   A: TV retailer Home Shopping Network agreed last month to pay
the government $1.1 million to settle charges that it made
unsubstantiated claims while peddling acne cures, diet pills and
other health and beauty products. The Federal Trade Commission
asked the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla., to approve the
settlement and order the cable network to obey a previous
government directive to back health-related product claims with
``competent and reliable scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also previously challenged the network over advertising
claims for a line of sprays touted to help consumers stop smoking
and recover from hangovers, among other things. The network said an
exuberant celebrity host was to blame, and settled the case by
agreeing not to make any more unsubstantiated claims.
</P>
<P>
   Home Shopping Network's corporate parent, USA Networks, declined
to comment on specifics of the FTC case, but its attorneys said
agreeing to the civil penalty was not an admission of guilt.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the host of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour
With Lou Dobbs.'' What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dobbs, 54, has a degree in economics from Harvard University.
So it came as a surprise to friends and family when he announced
his intention to pursue a career in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He began his broadcast journalism career as a police and fire
reporter for KBLU-AM in Yuma, Ariz., and was a copy editor for the
Los Angeles Times before joining Seattle's KING-TV as a financial
news reporter. While there he caught the eye of CNN, which hired
him in 1980 as the network's chief economics corresponent and
anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Four years later, Dobbs became vice
president and managing editor of ``CNN Financial News,'' and in
1992 was named senior vice president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He was named CNN's executive vice president in May 1995 and was
responsible for the launch of CNNfn _ the first network to launch
simultaneously on TV and on the Internet _ in December 1995. In
addition to being responsible for CNN Financial News, Dobbs anchors
``Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs,'' ``Business Unusual'' and
the weekend program ``Managing With Lou Dobbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel the other day showed the
launching of a Navy ship named the Carole Lombard. I've never heard
of it. Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a Navy vessel, said John Reilly of the Navy
Historical Center in Washington. The Carole Lombard was a Liberty
ship, one of the mass-produced merchant ships built for the Federal
Maritime Commission. It's a common misconception that ``anything
that floats'' during wartime is believed to be a naval vessel,
Reilly said, but Liberty ships had nothing to do with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Carole Lombard, Clark Gable's wife, had been killed in a
1942 plane crash in Nevada while participating in a bond drive for
the Hollywood Victory Committee, Reilly recalled. So, he said,
someone in authority decided it would be appropriate to honor her
memory by naming a Liberty ship after her.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said anyone interested in such vessels can find a wealth
of information in the book ``The Liberty Ships,'' by L.A. Sawyer
and W.H. Mitchell. It can be found at many libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the taxpayers pay the cost of the trip to Europe for the
delegation led by Rev. Jesse Jackson? Was the group flown over on
U.S. military aircraft?
</P>
<P>
   A: No on both counts. The Jackson delegation's trip was
privately funded, said James Gomez of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's
Washington office, and its members flew on commercial aircraft. The
White House press office said that as a privately funded
humanitarian mission, the group would not have been able to use
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that 751 people were contacted for a
nationwide poll. That amounts to about three people per million.
How could that be called accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poll-takers call the process ``probability sampling'' and
say it's the fundamental basis for all survey research. The Gallup
Organization says the basic principle is that a randomly selected,
small percentage of a population of people can represent the
attitudes, opinions or projected behavior of all of the people, if
the sample is selected correctly.
</P>
<P>
   For national Gallup polls, the objective is to present the
opinions of a sample of people which are exactly the same opinions
that would have been obtained had it been possible to interview all
adult Americans in the country. That not being possible, a sample
is taken. If every member of a population has an equal probability
of being selected, then the sample will be representative of the
population, Gallup contends.
</P>
<P>
   The 751 people you refer to is a bit smaller than Gallup's
preferred range. Gallup says the current adult population in the
continental United States is 187 million, and the typical sample
size for a Gallup poll designed to represent this general
population is 1,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us how to get into the lottery for Masters practice
round tickets for next year. My question: Are those of us who were
able to get tickets for this year's practice rounds automatically
in the drawing for next year, or do we have to resubmit?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll be included in next year's drawing, said Glenn
Greenspan at Augusta National Golf Club, so don't submit your name
again. For recorded information about the 2000 Masters and practice
rounds, call 706-667-6700.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something on TV about a study by Harvard or its
medical school proving conclusively the importance to children of
eating breakfast. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest in a series of Harvard research studies basically
affirmed just what parents have been telling their children for
years: Eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with improved
performance in school.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported at a U.S. Department of Agriculture
Symposium on breakfast and learning in children. Dr. Robert
Kleinman, a Harvard Medical School researcher, coordinated a series
of research studies sponsored by the Kellogg Co. ``The body of
evidence is still growing, and it points to the fact that children
who eat breakfast perform better in school,'' Kleinman reported.
``Breakfast positively impacts children's cognitive, emotional and
psychosocial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What to feed them is as simple as cereal, milk and fresh fruit,
the researchers said. Tracy Fox of the American Dietetic
Association said alternatives can be a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich or leftovers from the night before, and they can be eaten
either at home or at school. Whatever the food is, she concludes
that ``breakfast is the most important meal of the day'' for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Rep. Bob Barr (D-Ga.) was the
top House member taking privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips
last year. The item said Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and John
Conyers (D-Mich.) were second and third, but gave no details on
their travels. Can you shed some light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported initially by The Hill, the Capitol Hill
newspaper, Barr took 25 privately funded trips last year. Many were
sponsored by conservative organizations and some by news
organizations, such as NBC, that invited him to be interviewed
about the House impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Conyers both spoke frequently at the expense of
African-American interest groups. Waters ranked No. 2 on the list
with 17 trips last year, The Hill reported. Her husband, Sidney
Williams, former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, often joined
Waters on her trips. Essence Communications, on whose board Waters
sits, sent her on a three-day jaunt to the Bahamas for a music
festival empowerment seminar. Conyers came in third with 16 trips.
Most of his travel was for speeches to minority groups, The Hill
said, but he also attended the birthday of Lionel Hampton courtesy
of the jazz musician's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   These were among 790 expense-paid trips taken by members of
Congress last year at the expense of corporations, nonprofit
organizations and other interest groups. While critics contend that
the interest groups involved in such trips get a golden opportunity
to give members of Congress a skewed view of the facts, the
invitees defend the trips as invaluable learning tools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper sports section graded the NFL draft. The text on
each team began with the word ``skinny.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this context, it's slang for ``inside information.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently outlined the years when the new quarters
celebrating the nation's 50 states will be issued. Where can we get
these coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50 state quarters will be produced at both the
Philadelphia and Denver Mints and distributed by the Federal
Reserve through the commercial banking system nationwide, just as
regular circulating quarters are today. Consumers can expect to
receive the state quarters as change when conducting normal
commercial transactions. Some already are appearing routinely in
change, and the Mint says more should be in general circulation by
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint also is selling special collector sets. Call
202-283-2646, the U.S. Mint Customer Care Center, to receive more
information about them. Information also is available on the
Internet at www.usmint.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the people accompanying the Rev. Jesse Jackson on
his Yugoslavia trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delegation members: Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.); John Wyma,
chief of staff for Blagojevich, Washington; the Rev. Dr. Joan Brown
Campbell, National Council of Churches, New York; Bishop Dimitrios
of Xanthos, Greek Orthodox Diocese in America, New York; Dr. Nazir
Uddin Khaja, American Muslim Council, Los Angeles; the Rev. Leonid
Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church in America, New York; Rabbi Steven
Bennet Jacobs, Los Angeles; Father Raymond Glen Helmick, Boston;
Mark Schlansky and Charles McLean, UPLIFT International,
Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Rev. Roy Thomas Lloyd, National Council of Churches,
New York; Bishop Marshall Meadors Jr., United Methodist Church,
Jackson, Miss.; Pastor James Trent Meeks, Salem Baptist Church,
Chicago; Virgalem Tadesse and Marie Nelson, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
Washington; Landrum Bolling, Conflict Management Group, Cambridge,
Mass.; the Rt. Rev. Kodic Mitrophan, Eastern American Diocese,
Sewickley, Pa.; the Rev. Irinej Dobrijevich, Serbian Orthodox
priest, Cleveland; Dr. Zoran Svetislav Hodjera, St. Luke's Serbian
Orthodox Church, Bethesda, Md.; and Obrad Kesic, ICN
Pharmaceutical, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear comments about how hard it is to get
tickets to the Masters golf tournament. I've even heard that some
people bequeath their tickets to heirs as part of their will. Does
it actually happen, or is that just another urban myth?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a ticket-holding spouse dies, the surviving spouse then
can use the ticket, said Glenn Greenspan of Augusta National Golf
Club. But that's it. ``There's no leaving it in wills, no
bequeathing it,'' he added. ``That's a legend like the one saying
we pack ice around azaleas to keep them at their peak. It doesn't
happen.''

 &HT;    The home of Popeye
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: This is Ron Wiggins' latest dispatch on his
trip, Into Thin Hair, to Alaska.)
</P>
<P>
   When helpful reader Don Armstrong of Lake Worth, Fla. said to be
sure and include the ``home of Popeye'' on my way to Alaska, and to
please buy him a Popeye doll to replace the beloved doll that he
lost, I didn't see how my route to Alaska would take me anywhere
near Chester, Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I saw that my path through Tennessee almost grazed
Chester, I went back to his letter. Popeye? Popeye has fans?
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had written: ``I'm in a Popeye skit where I perform at
small social events, which is why I'm interested in Popeye.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong woefully understates the case. He is Popeye. I learned
this when Popeye _ complete with gigantic forearms, pipe and sailor
hat _ showed up at my bon voyage party in The Palm Beach Post's
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   I promised to do my level best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Yam what I Yam,'' is what I think Popeye said, scrunching
his face, squinting one eye and keeping the corn cob pipe clenched
in his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The real name of the Popeye museum is Spinach Can Collectibles,
smack dab in the middle of Chester, the city which claims itself as
the home of Popeye's creator, Elzie C. Segar. Segar introduced the
spinach-powered sailor man in 1929 and died in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach Can Collectibles is indeed a Popeye museum, with
memorabilia going back to the '30s. The owners also offer a web
site for fans: www.midwest.net/org/ace1
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 140 items,'' said Laurie Randall who, with
her husband Dave and partners Debbie and Mike Brooks, are probably
as nutty on the subject of Popeye as you can be without custodial
care.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have anything against Popeye, but what's to admire if
the guy can't remember to eat his spinach before tangling with
Bluto?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his take-me-as-I-am attitude,'' Randall explained. ``And
the way he says it is very important: `I Yam what I Yam and that's
all that I Yam.'''
</P>
<P>
   And after his arch-rival, the brutish Bluto, beats up Popeye and
then walks off with the beauteous Olive Oyl, Popeye becomes more
than he Yam by bolting a can of spinach, the greens' industry's
answer to methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't get it. Why did Olive Oyl even give Bluto the time
of day? He fought dirty, abused Popeye something fearful, and had a
beard you couldn't cut with metal shears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the eternal triangle,'' Randall explained patiently. ``I
think it's clear that Bluto was fond of Olive Oyl but that he dated
her more to get Popeye's goat than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, what's this? A Popeye memorabilia store selling Betty Boop
pencils and wrist watches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure this Betty Boop stuff belongs here?'' I asked.
Then I confessed: ``I used to have troubling thoughts about Betty
Boop when she alternated with Crusader Rabbit on Saturday morning.
Came on at 8 a.m., and I never missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall laughed. ``Betty has always been somewhat controversial.
And there was something of a scandal when frame art collectors
learned that the cartoonist would every once in a while sneak in a
nude frame of Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding? That explains the impure thoughts. I always thought
it was the skirt and garter belt ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it flashed by too fast for anybody to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' Randall continued, ``don't know that Popeye
made his movie debut in a Betty Boop cartoon. I think they dated
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That salty dog! No wonder Olive Oyl tormented him by flirting
with Bluto. I bought Donald Armstrong his doll and left Chester,
Ill. with an elevated respect for the sailor man and a rekindled
flame for Miss Boop.

 &HT;    Fort Hood allows followers of Wiccan faiths to worship despite
protests
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas _ The robed high priestess turned her back to the
fire, faced a makeshift outdoor altar and blessed the essentials of
life: water, bread and salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great goddess Freya, bless this creature of the Earth to your
service,'' she recited, after placing the shiny blade of her dagger
over a small bowl of salt. ``May we always honor the blessed Earth,
its many forms and beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation, holding hands in a circle around the fire,
replied in refrain: ``Great Freya be you adored.''
</P>
<P>
   This Wiccan celebration of the vernal equinox didn't take place
in some secret spot in the woods. The site was Fort Hood, and most
of the witches were active-duty Army.
</P>
<P>
   On the U.S. military's largest installation , more than 40
witches, male and female, celebrated the Rite of Spring on March
20, the day of equal daylight and darkness that symbolizes the
witches' goal of perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   Their on-post ceremony was possible because three years ago,
Fort Hood's top brass recognized Wicca as a legitimate faith,
making it the first U.S. military base to provide space for
neo-pagan rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The Wiccans, whose religion is a reconstruction of nature
worship from tribal Europe and other parts of the world, had to
meet the same criteria as other religions to conduct services on
the base, including sponsorship by a legally incorporated church,
in this case one in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood worked hard to understand and accommodate the Wiccans,
said Col. Jerome Haberek, a Catholic priest and head chaplain of
III Army Corps, which includes 75,000 soldiers stationed at Fort
Hood and other posts worldwide. ``We kind of struggled through,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Fort Hood's lead, other U.S. military bases around the
world have sanctioned Wicca. The top chaplains at Fort Hood are
considered the military's experts on the religion, fielding calls
from base chaplains and even the chief chaplain's office at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the volume of requests, the Fort Hood chaplain's
office keeps a packet of information handy to mail out, said Lt.
Col. Donald Troyer, a chaplain who oversees the post's Wiccan
group, called Fort Hood Open Circle.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, Wicca's popularity has grown steadily,
along with the Earth-centered spirituality of the New Age movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Covenant of the Goddess in Berkeley, Calif., one of the
oldest incorporated Wiccan organizations, estimates there are
50,000 adherents in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to gauge the religion's reach in the military.
Defense Department statistics on the religious preferences of
members place Wiccans under the ``other'' category, which
represents less than 2 percent of those in the armed forces. The
category includes Jews, Muslims, Orthodox Christians and followers
of American Indian faiths. But Pentagon officials said they believe
many Wiccans are among the 28 percent who claim no preference.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Hood, where 42,000 soldiers are stationed, the Open
Circle has more than 300 members, about 100 of them regular
attendees, said Army veteran Marcy K. Palmer of Killeen. Palmer is
a deaconess in the Sacred Well Congregation of San Antonio that
sponsors the Fort Hood Open Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood is so popular among Wiccans that some want assurances
from recruiters that they will be stationed at the post.
</P>
<P>
   Pfc. Marion Lloyd of Alexandria, La., said he was one of them,
though he does not advertise his religious preference. ``I'm still
not comfortable putting it on my dog tags yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Sacred Well founder and high priest David Oringderff
of San Antonio have helped set up congregations at Fort Polk, La.;
Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Kadena Air Base in Okinawa; and Fort
Barrancas in Pensacola, Fla. Sacred Well is opening congregations
on bases in North Carolina, New York, New Mexico, Guam and Germany,
said Oringderff, a psychologist who retired as an Army major in
1995 after 22 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   From Fort Hood to the Pentagon, officials are reluctant to talk
about how the armed forces are accommodating neo-paganists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a volatile subject,'' Troyer said. ``It just sparks
a fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Troyer, a Seventh-day Adventist, has faced guilt by association
from other military personnel and a cool response from some of the
post's other 95 chaplains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two years, fundamentalist Christians from communities
near Fort Hood showed up at the Open Circle's ritual site at the
post Boy Scout camp to protest. The chaplain's office responded by
beefing up security, Troyer said. Parts of the 335-square-mile post
are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thankful when it was finally over,'' recalled Pfc.
Michael Bourque, an Open Circle member. ``They stopped coming in
August or September.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter-writing campaign to Fort Hood's commander also did not
sway the post's commitment to accommodating the spiritual needs of
its Wiccan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, the general got letters that were strongly worded,''
Troyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the letters came from congregants at the Tabernacle
Baptist Church and School in Killeen, at the urging of their
pastor, the Rev. Jack Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no tolerance for evil or people who do evil,'' Harvey
said. ``We don't think anybody in the Army or otherwise should be
in favor of witchcraft. The Bible states explicitly, 'Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Troyer said it's that kind of reaction, fueled by popular myths
about witchcraft, that he must combat. ``I still get calls from
people asking me if they kill babies out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Russell Gunter, executive director of the Armed
Forces Chaplains Board at the Pentagon, said the military is
obligated to respect and make provisions for the religious needs of
its members without passing judgment on their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Haberek, the III Corps head chaplain, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I raised my right hand when I came in the Army to
support and defend the Constitution, and that's what I'm doing,
defending the constitutional right of soldiers and family
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicca adherents celebrate eight major sabbats, festivals that
mark the change of seasons and agricultural cycles, and believe in
both god and goddess. There are many branches of Wicca, just like
there are many Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the roots for the term Wicca means `to bend,' '' said
Derek Collins, who teaches a course on the history of witchcraft at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason they are interested in it is it's
empowering and gives them a sense of control over their own
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative religious leaders, including the Rev.
David Lucus of First Baptist Church of Oak Hill, warn of hidden
dangers. ''People can be drawn in real easy to what appears on the
surface as just another way for people to get together and have
fun. Suddenly, it becomes a struggle to maintain one's own
individuality from the spirits they are dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Wiccans face so much opposition, some practice their
faith alone. Others join covens or small communities of witches
that are closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the soldiers said they found Wicca after long spiritual
journeys. Others said they stumbled into it.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Cols. Marie and Ron Smith thank a born-again
Christian for leading them to Wicca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a joke,'' Marie Smith said. ``My husband has
a friend who is a born-again Christian who was trying to convert
everyone, so my husband came up with this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Smith told his friend he worshipped the hardwoods. ``No
softwoods,'' Smith recalled. ``Just hardwoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Smith said her husband just kept making things up from
there. ``It went on and on, and then another friend said if you
really want to get her going, read this book.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on Wicca. Ron Smith read it. ``He says, 'Marie, read
this. This is us,' '' she said. Now, Ron Smith is the Open Circle's
high priest.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges of the Open Circle is that it brings
together people from different branches of Wicca. To keep harmony,
the group rotates rituals from different traditions.
</P>
<P>
   At the vernal equinox, for instance, it used a Nordic service.
In April, the sabbat was celebrated in the Celtic tradition. On May
1 it celebrated the marriage of the god and goddess in the
Greencraft branch, which comes from a newer tradition founded in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a Celtic shaman who is the official high priestess for
the circle, appoints acting high priests and priestesses to conduct
ceremonies. Palmer served more than six years in the Army and now
is a civilian nurse at the Fort Hood hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Acting high priestess and priest Jennifer and Denson Flowers
conducted the Nordic service that ushered in the rebirth of spring.
She leaves for Army basic training May 12. He was medically
discharged in 1994 after a drunken driver cost him a leg.
</P>
<P>
   Denson Flowers asked the witches to write their dreams on a
piece of paper. ``So tonight they can be planted just like the
seeds . . . and they may grow true with time.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed his dagger over the chalice of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all come from the god and to him we shall return,'' Flowers
recited. ``We all come from the goddess and to her we shall
return.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the host of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour
With Lou Dobbs.'' What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dobbs, 54, has a degree in economics from Harvard University.
So it came as a surprise to friends and family when he announced
his intention to pursue a career in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He began his broadcast journalism career as a police and fire
reporter for KBLU-AM in Yuma, Ariz., and was a copy editor for the
Los Angeles Times before joining Seattle's KING-TV as a financial
news reporter. While there he caught the eye of CNN, which hired
him in 1980 as the network's chief economics corresponent and
anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Four years later, Dobbs became vice
president and managing editor of ``CNN Financial News,'' and in
1992 was named senior vice president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He was named CNN's executive vice president in May 1995 and was
responsible for the launch of CNNfn _ the first network to launch
simultaneously on TV and on the Internet _ in December 1995. In
addition to being responsible for CNN Financial News, Dobbs anchors
``Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs,'' ``Business Unusual'' and
the weekend program ``Managing With Lou Dobbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel the other day showed the
launching of a Navy ship named the Carole Lombard. I've never heard
of it. Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a Navy vessel, said John Reilly of the Navy
Historical Center in Washington. The Carole Lombard was a Liberty
ship, one of the mass-produced merchant ships built for the Federal
Maritime Commission. It's a common misconception that ``anything
that floats'' during wartime is believed to be a naval vessel,
Reilly said, but Liberty ships had nothing to do with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Carole Lombard, Clark Gable's wife, had been killed in a
1942 plane crash in Nevada while participating in a bond drive for
the Hollywood Victory Committee, Reilly recalled. So, he said,
someone in authority decided it would be appropriate to honor her
memory by naming a Liberty ship after her.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said anyone interested in such vessels can find a wealth
of information in the book ``The Liberty Ships,'' by L.A. Sawyer
and W.H. Mitchell. It can be found at many libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the taxpayers pay the cost of the trip to Europe for the
delegation led by Rev. Jesse Jackson? Was the group flown over on
U.S. military aircraft?
</P>
<P>
   A: No on both counts. The Jackson delegation's trip was
privately funded, said James Gomez of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's
Washington office, and its members flew on commercial aircraft. The
White House press office said that as a privately funded
humanitarian mission, the group would not have been able to use
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that 751 people were contacted for a
nationwide poll. That amounts to about three people per million.
How could that be called accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poll-takers call the process ``probability sampling'' and
say it's the fundamental basis for all survey research. The Gallup
Organization says the basic principle is that a randomly selected,
small percentage of a population of people can represent the
attitudes, opinions or projected behavior of all of the people, if
the sample is selected correctly.
</P>
<P>
   For national Gallup polls, the objective is to present the
opinions of a sample of people which are exactly the same opinions
that would have been obtained had it been possible to interview all
adult Americans in the country. That not being possible, a sample
is taken. If every member of a population has an equal probability
of being selected, then the sample will be representative of the
population, Gallup contends.
</P>
<P>
   The 751 people you refer to is a bit smaller than Gallup's
preferred range. Gallup says the current adult population in the
continental United States is 187 million, and the typical sample
size for a Gallup poll designed to represent this general
population is 1,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us how to get into the lottery for Masters practice
round tickets for next year. My question: Are those of us who were
able to get tickets for this year's practice rounds automatically
in the drawing for next year, or do we have to resubmit?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll be included in next year's drawing, said Glenn
Greenspan at Augusta National Golf Club, so don't submit your name
again. For recorded information about the 2000 Masters and practice
rounds, call 706-667-6700.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something on TV about a study by Harvard or its
medical school proving conclusively the importance to children of
eating breakfast. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest in a series of Harvard research studies basically
affirmed just what parents have been telling their children for
years: Eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with improved
performance in school.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported at a U.S. Department of Agriculture
Symposium on breakfast and learning in children. Dr. Robert
Kleinman, a Harvard Medical School researcher, coordinated a series
of research studies sponsored by the Kellogg Co. ``The body of
evidence is still growing, and it points to the fact that children
who eat breakfast perform better in school,'' Kleinman reported.
``Breakfast positively impacts children's cognitive, emotional and
psychosocial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What to feed them is as simple as cereal, milk and fresh fruit,
the researchers said. Tracy Fox of the American Dietetic
Association said alternatives can be a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich or leftovers from the night before, and they can be eaten
either at home or at school. Whatever the food is, she concludes
that ``breakfast is the most important meal of the day'' for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Rep. Bob Barr (D-Ga.) was the
top House member taking privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips
last year. The item said Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and John
Conyers (D-Mich.) were second and third, but gave no details on
their travels. Can you shed some light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported initially by The Hill, the Capitol Hill
newspaper, Barr took 25 privately funded trips last year. Many were
sponsored by conservative organizations and some by news
organizations, such as NBC, that invited him to be interviewed
about the House impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Conyers both spoke frequently at the expense of
African-American interest groups. Waters ranked No. 2 on the list
with 17 trips last year, The Hill reported. Her husband, Sidney
Williams, former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, often joined
Waters on her trips. Essence Communications, on whose board Waters
sits, sent her on a three-day jaunt to the Bahamas for a music
festival empowerment seminar. Conyers came in third with 16 trips.
Most of his travel was for speeches to minority groups, The Hill
said, but he also attended the birthday of Lionel Hampton courtesy
of the jazz musician's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   These were among 790 expense-paid trips taken by members of
Congress last year at the expense of corporations, nonprofit
organizations and other interest groups. While critics contend that
the interest groups involved in such trips get a golden opportunity
to give members of Congress a skewed view of the facts, the
invitees defend the trips as invaluable learning tools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper sports section graded the NFL draft. The text on
each team began with the word ``skinny.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this context, it's slang for ``inside information.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently outlined the years when the new quarters
celebrating the nation's 50 states will be issued. Where can we get
these coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50 state quarters will be produced at both the
Philadelphia and Denver Mints and distributed by the Federal
Reserve through the commercial banking system nationwide, just as
regular circulating quarters are today. Consumers can expect to
receive the state quarters as change when conducting normal
commercial transactions. Some already are appearing routinely in
change, and the Mint says more should be in general circulation by
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint also is selling special collector sets. Call
202-283-2646, the U.S. Mint Customer Care Center, to receive more
information about them. Information also is available on the
Internet at www.usmint.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the people accompanying the Rev. Jesse Jackson on
his Yugoslavia trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delegation members: Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.); John Wyma,
chief of staff for Blagojevich, Washington; the Rev. Dr. Joan Brown
Campbell, National Council of Churches, New York; Bishop Dimitrios
of Xanthos, Greek Orthodox Diocese in America, New York; Dr. Nazir
Uddin Khaja, American Muslim Council, Los Angeles; the Rev. Leonid
Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church in America, New York; Rabbi Steven
Bennet Jacobs, Los Angeles; Father Raymond Glen Helmick, Boston;
Mark Schlansky and Charles McLean, UPLIFT International,
Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Rev. Roy Thomas Lloyd, National Council of Churches,
New York; Bishop Marshall Meadors Jr., United Methodist Church,
Jackson, Miss.; Pastor James Trent Meeks, Salem Baptist Church,
Chicago; Virgalem Tadesse and Marie Nelson, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
Washington; Landrum Bolling, Conflict Management Group, Cambridge,
Mass.; the Rt. Rev. Kodic Mitrophan, Eastern American Diocese,
Sewickley, Pa.; the Rev. Irinej Dobrijevich, Serbian Orthodox
priest, Cleveland; Dr. Zoran Svetislav Hodjera, St. Luke's Serbian
Orthodox Church, Bethesda, Md.; and Obrad Kesic, ICN
Pharmaceutical, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear comments about how hard it is to get
tickets to the Masters golf tournament. I've even heard that some
people bequeath their tickets to heirs as part of their will. Does
it actually happen, or is that just another urban myth?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a ticket-holding spouse dies, the surviving spouse then
can use the ticket, said Glenn Greenspan of Augusta National Golf
Club. But that's it. ``There's no leaving it in wills, no
bequeathing it,'' he added. ``That's a legend like the one saying
we pack ice around azaleas to keep them at their peak. It doesn't
happen.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me what countries other than the United States
are taking in Kosovo refugees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Citing as its source information provided by the various
governments, the Associated Press released this list of countries
that have offered to accept the refugees on a temporary basis:
Turkey and the United States, 20,000 each; Germany, 15,000; Finland
and Italy, 10,000 each; Norway, 6,000; Sweden, Austria and Canada,
5,000 each; Australia, 4,000; Britain, ``up to 1,000 a week,''
without specifying the number of weeks; Switzerland, 2,500;
Netherlands, 2,000; Denmark and Romania, 1,500 each; Poland, 1,000;
Portugal, 500; and Iceland and Malta, 100 each.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says refugees already
evacuated from Macedonia have gone to these countries, as of May 7:
France (2,519 refugees), Belgium (1,205), Czech Republic (346),
Spain (208), Croatia (188), Slovenia (186), Israel (106) and
Slovakia (90). The countries and the number of refugees will be
changing as the exodus continues, according to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the child born to the Kosovo refugee
couple shortly after they arrived in the United States last week
was an ``instant American'' with full U.S. citizenship. Can you
explain the basis for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's in the Constitution: 14th Amendment, Section 1. It
states, in part: ``All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the state wherein they reside.'' The
amendment was ratified in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii still active? I'm planning
to visit there in June and would like to see it, but I haven't read
anything lately about any eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   A: The eruption continues at Kilauea, the most active volcano in
the world, says Norrie Judd of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on
the island of Hawaii. Kilauea is a ``very dynamic volcano,'' she
told Q&AMP;A. She added that despite its continuing activity, Kilauea
did experience a ``pause'' in the eruption recently, after which
the lava flow resumed.
</P>
<P>
   So Judd recommended that Internet users check the Hawaii Volcano
Observatory website _ http://www.nps.gov/havo _ then scroll down on
the first page to the bottom, and click on the Hawaii Volcano
Observatory connection followed by the Eruption Update. Those
without Internet capability can call the park headquarters visitor
information line, 808-967-8186; or the eruption information message
line, 808-985-6000.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasses 230,000 acres and
ranges from sea level to the summit of Earth's mose massive
volcano, Mauna Loa, at 13,677 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I are having a dispute about a new TV
commercial for Coca-Cola. It shows skydivers jumping out of an
airplane and forming the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle in the sky. He
thinks part or all of it is computer generated, but I say it's for
real, with real skydivers. Who is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: You both are. The creators of the commercial filmed four real
skydivers making more than a dozen jumps over a period of several
days at Paris Airfield in the Los Angeles area, said Susan
McDermott of the Coca-Cola Co. Then Digital Domain, which was
responsible for some of the computer-generated effects in the movie
``Titanic,'' created the images of more than 200 skydivers from the
footage of the four real ones. Jan De Bont, director of ``Speed''
and ``Twister,'' directed the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we used such a fabulous director and
special-effects house make it a very special commercial,''
McDermott said. ``It's captured the interest of TV viewers all over
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Sadie Hawkins Day? How did it get started?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the brainchild of the late cartoonist Al Capp, who
created the comic strip ``L'il Abner'' in the 1930s. In the strip,
Sadie Hawkins was characterized as the ``homeliest gal in all them
hills,'' so the mayor of Dogpatch staged a race in which the girls
could chase the boys in hopes of catching a husband. The concept
continues today with such things as a ``Sadie Hawkins dance,'' in
which a woman has the opportunity to turn the tables for a change,
taking the initiative to invite a man.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the new state quarters being issued in the order in which
the states gained admission to the union?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The quarters being issued this year are for these five
states: Delaware (statehood date, Dec. 7, 1787); Pennsylvania (Dec.
12, 1787); New Jersey (Dec. 18, 1787); Georgia (Jan. 2, 1788); and
Connecticut (Jan. 9, 1788).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a fan of MSNBC's John Hockenberry. Why does he use a
wheelchair? What did he do before joining MSNBC?
</P>
<P>
   A: As he explained in his book ``Moving Violations: War Zones,
Wheelchairs and Declarations of Independence,'' Hockenberry was in
an auto accident when he was 19. It left him with an irreversible
spinal cord injury at chest level.
</P>
<P>
   His broadcasting career is long and varied. He has been anchor
of ``Talk of the Nation,'' a live call-in show from Washington;
general assignment reporter, Middle East correspondent and host of
several National Public Radio programs; correspondent for the ABC
newsmagazine ``Day One''; and correspondent for NBC's ``Dateline
NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of two Peabody awards, Hockenberry also performed in
a one-man off-Broadway production based on ``Moving Violations,''
his memoir of life as a foreign correspondent. He also has written
for numerous national publications.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're planning on taking a trip up to Niagara Falls in June.
Will we need a passport or birth certificate to cross over into
Canada and then return back into the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: A passport or proof of U.S. citizenship (such as a birth
certificate) and official identification with photo, such as a
driver's license, are required to enter Canada. If you don't have
the necessary documentation and don't want or have time to obtain
it, you can view the spectacle from the New York side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've often read about the benefits of drinking green tea. I
drink hot tea every morning, but the kind I like is labeled orange
pekoe. Does it have the same benefits as green tea?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, some definitions: Orange pekoe doesn't refer to a type
or flavor of tea, but rather to a leaf grade or size. Orange pekoe
is from the finest leaves; among many others are souchong, broken
pekoe, fannings and fines (``dust''). The term ``orange'' is from
an ancient Chinese custom of scenting the tea leaves with orange
blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the health aspects: Both green and black teas contain
high levels of flavonoids (antioxidants), substances that many
scientists believe prevent or delay damage to a body's cells and
tissues. Both also are said to offer potential cardiovascular
benefits and research has linked black tea to lowered cholesterol
levels and a reduced risk of urinary- and digestive-tract cancers
for older women.
</P>
<P>
   Green and black teas are derived from the same plant, just
processed differently, said Chris Rosenbloom of the department of
nutrition at Georgia State University. Green teas were the first
ones studied by researchers, which explains why they were
publicized before black teas, she added.
</P>
<P>
   And one other benefit of either green or black tea: Compared to
coffee, they have about half the caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the number of deaths by firearms and/or
handguns in the United States with those in, say, England and
Canada?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest statistics available from the National Safety
Council are several years old, but they may give you a basis for
comparison's sake. In 1995, the National Safety Council reports,
firearms deaths in the United States (excluding those from legal
intervention) totaled 35,673. This number includes homicides,
suicides, unintentional deaths and ``undetermined'' (meaning the
intentionality could not be determined). Homicides involving
firearms that year totaled 15,551. The National Safety Council
doesn't have a separate category for handguns only.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics for deaths in other countries by all firearms are not
available. But according to organization Georgians Against Gun
Violence, homicides in 1996 involving handguns totaled 2 in New
Zealand, 13 in Australia, 15 in Japan, 30 in Britain, 106 in Canada
and 211 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what is the formula for calculating a pitcher's
earned run average?
</P>
<P>
   A: An ERA is the average number of earned runs scored against a
pitcher every nine innings. An earned run is one that is scored
without the aid of an error. To determine a pitcher's ERA, divide
the number of innings pitched by 9. Then divide that total into the
number of earned runs the pitcher allowed. Carry the answer to two
decimal places.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused about orange juice. Is there a nutritional
difference between ``from concentrate'' or ``fresh squeezed''? If
it's imported from Brazil or elsewhere, is it the same as that from
Florida?
</P>
<P>
   A: The different forms of juice have similar caloric and vitamin
C levels, so choosing between them is more a matter of convenience,
taste and expense.
</P>
<P>
   All orange juice contains water and sugar. The term ``fresh
squeezed'' is self-explanatory. Concentrate is created when water
is removed. You can restore the water yourself to frozen
concentrate, in the amount directed on the container, or you can
buy it with the water already added back in. And it doesn't matter,
nutritionally speaking, where the oranges were grown. They're all
from the same plant, whether it's grown in Florida or Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was an Army meteorologist in World War II when experiments
were conducted to see if clouds could be seeded with chemicals to
produce rain. What techniques are used now? And does it work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rainmaking procedures first were developed in the 1940s. The
methods involved airplanes above the clouds dropping flares with
silver iodide crystals; airplanes below the clouds releasing a
liquid fertilizer spray of ammonium nitrate and urea, with air
currents carrying the spray into the clouds; and ground-based
generators distributing vapor containing silver iodide, with wind
hopefully strong enough to carry the vapor into the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 50 years of research, scientists haven't been able to
demonstrate the effectiveness of rainmaking in all cases. So debate
continues about its validity. Also, some people believe that
attempts to artificially increase rain in some areas might cause
shortages of rain elsewhere. Many states impose regulations on
rainmaking, and some states have even prohibited it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you enlighten us about what Home Shopping Network did
that caused it to be fined more than $1 million for false
advertising on some kind of health issue?
</P>

   A: TV retailer Home Shopping Network agreed last month to pay
the government $1.1 million to settle charges that it made
unsubstantiated claims while peddling acne cures, diet pills and
other health and beauty products. The Federal Trade Commission
asked the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla., to approve the
settlement and order the cable network to obey a previous
government directive to back health-related product claims with
``competent and reliable scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also previously challenged the network over advertising
claims for a line of sprays touted to help consumers stop smoking
and recover from hangovers, among other things. The network said an
exuberant celebrity host was to blame, and settled the case by
agreeing not to make any more unsubstantiated claims.
</P>
<P>
   Home Shopping Network's corporate parent, USA Networks, declined
to comment on specifics of the FTC case, but its attorneys said
agreeing to the civil penalty was not an admission of guilt.

 &HT;    What the real '60s panel would say about the decade
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with TEX-SIXTIES-SYMPOSIUM.)
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Let the LBJ Library have its stuffy symposium on
the '60s. We got to wondering what the ultimate assemblage of
intellectual candlepower on the decade might look like _ factors
such as death or dementia being no deterrent. Such as it is, here's
our dream team:
</P>
<P>
   Moderator: Jann Wenner , Rolling Stone founder and poster boy
for wanton boomer excess and self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Panel: Timothy Leary , Harvard academic and LSD advocate; the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , leader of transcendental meditation
movement; Mama Cass , singer, the Mamas and the Papas; Hunter S.
Thompson , gonzo journalist; Malcolm X, civil rights activist and
subject of Spike Lee bio-flick; Janis Joplin, singer; Jimi Hendrix
, musician; Lee Harvey Oswald, got some 'splaining to do; Sly
Stone, singer (absent).
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: OK, before we getstarted can I get anybody a latte or a
subscription to Men's Journal?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson: Mrff ... glurg ... mescaline . . . BATS!
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: Genius, Hunter! We'll run it next issue. Dr. Leary,
you've been dead for three years now. What do the '60s mean to you?
</P>
<P>
   Leary: Dying is cool. It's the last, best trip. Unlock your
consciousness _ tune in, turn on, drop dead!
</P>
<P>
   Maharishi: Ah, but only by learning the unified field theory can
we embrace the oneness of all existence. Transcendental meditation
is the key to . . .
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm: You guys levitate, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maharishi: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm: So how come I just saw you get out of a cab?
</P>
<P>
   Mama Cass: I'd just like to say I don't think that one joke is
very funny. The one about how if I'd split that ham sandwich with
Karen Carpenter we'd both be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin: I think it's time we admitted something: I was awful. If
I hadn't died, I'd be playing Monday nights on Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: I've got no problem with that. Jimi?
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix: They're using ``Are You Experienced?'' to sell shoes,
man. Janis is pushing Mercedes and I got stinking jogging shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: We call it ``running.'' And Jimi, the '60s were being
commodified and repackaged by the spring of '68. It made me so much
money I need a truck to carry it around. You're just mad because
your estate was tied up in court for years.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: Wenner.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix: Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Maharishi: Have I mentioned I know the Beatles?
</P>
<P>
   Cass: ``Revolution'' in a Nike commercial. More shoes. The
economy absorbed the counterculture, reverse-engineered the ethos
and then sold it back to us as nostalgia for our failed revolution.
You know who owns the '60s? Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix: Chick sounds like she's on public radio.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald: I am so tired of people defining me by just that one
day. I had a pretty interesting life, you know. But it's always,
``Lee Harvey Oswald, presidential assassin.'' It's just not fair.
And people are still mad.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: Plus we know you didn't really do it.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald: No, it was me.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: Was not.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald: Was too.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: Uhhuh.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm: That's the chickens coming home to roost!
</P>
<P>
   Thompson: Mrphblb. . .Bad craziness. . .glub. . .ASSASSINS!
</P>
<P>
   Cass: Why does Johnny Depp think this guy is so cool?
</P>
<P>
   Oswald: My favorite part of the '60s was when Pete Townshend
bashed Abbie Hoffman's head in at Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Wenner: I really, really hate myself.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix: You're a yuppie sellout, Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald: Yes?
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix (simultaneously): I'll have what he's having.
</P>
<P>
   Leary: They shot my ashes into space with Gene Roddenberry's!
I'm tripping through the stars!
</P>
<P>
   Cass: In point of fact, I had a heart attack.

   Symposium on the Sixties promises to be, well, less freaked-out
than the decade it explores
</P>
<P>
   By Don McLeese
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My good friend Jimmy slept with a pistol under
his pillow until 1977. Toward the end of the previous decade, he
had returned from a tour of duty as a Marine in Vietnam with a bad
case of the jitters and a penchant for barroom fistfights. It was
only when he was drunk that he'd talk about the war, until he
passed out, and it was only by passing out that he could sleep.
When he awoke with a start, he'd grab for his gun. Home from the
war, he was still fighting a war that was raging inside his head.
</P>
<P>
   That was his Legacy of the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   I could never know exactly what he'd gone through, just as he
had only the faintest idea what he'd been missing back home. He
joked sardonically about catching up on some of that ``free love,''
but how to explain the long hair, the acid flashbacks, the street
protests, the infatuations with Buddha and Marx, the fashion
disasters of beads and bell-bottoms? How to explain the
inscrutable, amphetamine ravings of an electrified Bob Dylan, who
just a year or two earlier had been strumming protest songs on his
acoustic guitar?
</P>
<P>
   How had everything moved so far so fast? How had the passive
resistance of Martin Luther King Jr. escalated so quickly into the
aggressive militancy of the Black Panthers, the separatism of
Stokely Carmichael? How were ideals of peace transformed into the
``bringing the war home'' violence of the Weathermen's ``Days of
Rage''? How had universities become overrun by protestors who
seemed to be majoring in anarchy and minoring in hashish? Where was
the innocence of ``I Want To Hold Your Hand'' amid the marijuana
haze of ``Sgt. Pepper''?
</P>
<P>
   Was this the dawning of a new consciousness? Not the hokey ``Age
of Aquarius'' of ``Hair,'' but a shift in values more subversive
and pervasive, one that opened the doors of perception and threw
the very conception of reality up for grabs?
</P>
<P>
   Or was this a culture collapsing under the weight of a
collective nervous breakdown? A mass ``freak out,'' in the parlance
of the age, a time when ``blowing your mind'' was considered a good
thing. For the walking wounded of the psychedelic revolution, this
was another Legacy of the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that it's a different ``Legacy of the Sixties''
that will be explored through this week's symposium by that name at
the University of Texas. Sponsored by the LBJ Library and School of
Public Affairs, the event runs through Friday, with all of its
panels and speeches free and open to the public. Topics to be
discussed range from space exploration and foreign policy through
civil rights and the counter culture, with Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the NAACP's Julian Bond and
retired anchorman Walter Cronkite among the participating
luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its breadth of cultural concern and depth of academic
legitimacy, the event seems curiously at odds with the spirit of
the '60s, at least as this semi-blown mind remembers it. The
symposium will not, you can rest assured, be a ``freak out.'' It
will not be a ``happening.'' It will, instead, examine the
century's most culturally cataclysmic decade from the far side of
the generation gap, from the perspective of the institutions _
governmental, academic, journalistic _ that found themselves under
siege through that tumultuous era.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium is additionally serving as a reunion of the
Johnson administration (some 1,500 members have been invited),
which makes the '60s spin seem all the more peculiar. For the
Johnson alumni to celebrate the '60s is a little like Napoleon's
forces holding their homecoming at Waterloo. For if the '60s found
the American culture in a state of civil war _ and the images that
persist of tear gas, police dogs and the National Guard suggest
nothing less _ then the Johnson presidency was that war's most
notorious casualty. It could have withstood a political debate over
the war in Vietnam; what it couldn't survive was the daily chants
of ``Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?''
</P>
<P>
   History already has been kinder to Johnson than the street mobs
were. As the symposium is sure to highlight, his presidency was far
more aggressive in its commitment to racial equality than the
federal government had ever been before (or since). The progressive
programs of the ``Great Society'' reinforce the impression that
Johnson could have been a great domestic president if he hadn't
fallen into the quagmire of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the aftershocks of the '60s continue to
reverberate _ from the fallout from the sexual revolution to calls
for censorship on entertainment to political campaigns with
candidates who either ``didn't inhale'' or dismiss such behavior as
youthful folly. With the return of the pendulum toward Puritanism,
there are those who continue to scapegoat the '60s as the decade
when the American dream turned to nightmare, when parental
permissiveness, artistic license, pharmaceutical experimentation
and spiritual restlessness all contributed to the decline of
Western civilization and the death of common decency as we know it.
Too much freedom, too much rebellion, too much '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, once opened, Pandora's Box is awfully hard to close. For
the '60s found a country that was forged in the spirit of freedom
pushing those freedoms to their limits, renewing its revolutionary
fervor. We've learned from the excesses and indulgences of the
decade; we've long since realized that free love carries a heavy
price and that heaven isn't likely to manifest itself through a tab
of mescaline. It was rumored during the '60s that the ingestion of
certain drugs would change our chromosomes and alter the genetic
makeup of our babies. Instead, the '60s themselves were what
changed the cultural DNA, altering the psyche of the nation in a
manner that made it impossible to return to ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, those of us who questioned authority
throughout the '60s are learning from our babies how it feels to
have our own authority questioned. And parents raised on the rock
of the Doors and Jimi Hendrix now wring their hands over Marilyn
Manson.

 &HT;    Wicca Beliefs
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebar to MILITARY-WITCHES)
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The groups that practice modern-day Wicca are autonomous, though
some may associate with umbrella organizations in the neo-pagan
movement.
</P>
<P>
   While their rituals can vary, they share some common beliefs,
such as:
</P>
<P>
   _Ethics. Wiccan groups have their own version of the Golden
Rule, called the Wiccan Rede, which states ``an it harm none, do
what you will,'' meaning you don't harm yourself or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   _Deities. Wiccans worship the sacred in nature and believe in
dual deities, the god and goddess, who often are personified in
Mother Earth and Father Sky.
</P>
<P>
   _Magic. The use of the psychic energies witches believe surround
all living things. They use rituals, dance, chants, visualization
and hypnosis to focus and direct the energy for healing, protecting
and aiding each other.
</P>
<P>
   _Text. They do not have a sacred text, like the Bible or Koran,
but most Wiccan groups have a book of rituals and lore called ``The
Book of Shadows.'' They often add new material.
</P>
<P>
   _Holidays. There are eight major holidays, solar festivals
called sabbats. The dates of some depend on the lunar calendar and
the observances vary. The celebrations are Samhain, the Celtic new
year on Oct. 31 celebrating the fall harvest; Yule, winter solstice
in December, usually around the 20th or 21st; Imbolc or Candlemas,
recognizing the growing warmth of the sun, the first sign of the
rebirth of spring, observed Feb. 1 or 2; Ostara, the spring equinox
in March, usually around the 21st; Beltane, the May 1 observance of
the marriage of the god and goddess; Litha, the summer solstice
that usually falls around June 21; Lammas or Lughnasadh, observing
the first harvest on Aug. 1; and Mabon, the autumn equinox, around
Sept. 21, recognizing the second harvest time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In ancient times, pagans were the people who
lived in the countryside, but by the Middle Ages the meaning had
changed as the Roman Catholic Church used the word to describe
anyone who was Jewish, Muslim or practiced an indigenous religion.
</P>
<P>
   Things got messy from there, with charges of paganism and
witchcraft used against church heretics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1486, two Dominican monks wrote a book, ``Malleus
Maleficarum'' (``Witches' Hammer''), espousing myths that have
transcended the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the book that really defined the stereotype of the
modern witch,'' said Derek Collins, an assistant professor of
classics in the University of Texas religious studies program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book, witches are described as mostly women who are
more susceptible to the influence of demons,'' Collins said. ``It
also talks about women using the fat of babies for an ointment to
help them fly to meetings on broomsticks and chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The women, the book's authors purport, go to group meetings
where they worship and have sex with demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are largely monkish fantasies,'' said Collins, who
teaches a course on the history of witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-century Protestant Reformation brought some new ideas,
including the myths that demonic spirits can inhabit toads, frogs
and cats, and that witches carry the devil's mark: moles and
birthmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that in the 16th and 17th centuries, 50,000 to
100,000 people, about three-quarters of them women, were killed
after being accused of witchcraft, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   While people today continue to spread the myths about paganism
and witchcraft, many scholars and religious leaders are keenly
aware that some paganistic rituals have become Christian
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The date of Jesus' birthday, Dec. 25, is believed by many
scholars to have a direct correlation to the pagan festival of
Yule, the celebration of the winter solstice. A lighted tree and
burning of the yule log symbolized the divine gift of fire to
humanity in many European pagan customs. Easter is associated with
the rabbit and eggs that were used by pagans in Ostara, the
celebration of the spring equinox, to represent fertility and
eternal life. Many of the saints' days commemorated by the Catholic
Church fall on the holidays of pagan gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paganism as an idea really developed in the shadow of the
Roman Catholic Church, and as the Catholic Church conquered Europe,
it didn't reject the local pagan traditions _ it simply absorbed
them,'' Collins said.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Guns and politics remain an incendiary mix
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gabfest on youth violence which occurred at the White House
this week was notable for the absence of two key players: the
National Rifle Association and top Hollywood executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton used the meeting to reiterate the
gun-control package he proposed immediately after the Columbine
High School shooting massacre in Littleton on April 20. And, while
the NRA wasn't invited, the president did get support for his plan
from three major gun manufacturers and the American Shooting Sports
Council.
</P>
<P>
   That's because some of it, but by no means all of it, makes
sense. In particular, it's highly appropriate to close loopholes
that make it easier for minors or criminals to obtain weapons
through gun shows than at retail stores. Additionally, establishing
a more efficient system of tracing guns found at crimes scenes
could be useful in tracking people who act as conduits for
criminals to obtain weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan also calls for prohibiting people from ever
owning weapons if they have been convicted of violent crimes as
juveniles. While that is logical, it is largely symbolic with
little practical effect. One need only look to the numbers of
convicted adult felons who cannot legally own weapons but still
obtain them illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision would hold parents criminally liable if their
juvenile children use weapons to commit crimes. That's reasonable
if parents are willfully negligent in allowing their children easy
access to guns but not if the parents took normal precautions such
as keeping their guns locked.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton's plan would make it illegal for anyone under
age 21 to own guns of any kind. That's an overreaction. For
millions of normal and well-adjusted youngsters, getting that first
shotgun at age 16 or younger in order to sit in a duck blind at
dawn with Dad extends a time-honored American tradition. Moreover,
it seems a slap in the face to tell 18-year-olds they are old
enough to carry weapons, fight and possibly die for their country,
but they can't own a firearm in civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   On the cultural side, Clinton used the meeting to mildly upbraid
his buddies in Hollywood for churning out the violent nihilism
which is all too often emblematic of contemporay movie making. But
the only solid cultural proposal to come out of Monday's meeting
was an agreement with America Online and video-game manufacturers
to limit the availability of violent video games on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is merit to portions of Clinton's gun-control plan. A part
of that merit is political _ it will allow the president and
Congress to say to the American people, ``See, we've done
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the NRA said in absentia Monday, there is decidedly more
merit in most of the thousands of gun laws already on the books.
Better enforcement of those existing laws will do more to reduce
violence than adopting packages of new laws which are of little
practical value and only infrequently enforced.

 &HT;    How about the '50 smartest people'?
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ `Jeffie, do you think I'm beautiful?''
Bernard Thomas asked as I pulled up to the pump at the corner
service station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, B.T.,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   My old high school classmate shook his head sadly, took the hose
from its socket and began pumping my gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's with the vanity, B.T.?'' I asked. ``Since when have you
made looks your priority? (No answer.) ``Beautiful? No . . . but
you're definitely not the ugliest bean in the soup. Can you live
with that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can,'' he sighed, ``but I've been wondering whether my
grandchildren can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``B.T., those children love you. They're not about to stop
because you can't win a beauty contest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so sure, Jeffie. Teenagers look at things different.
Check out this week's People magazine for the list of ``The 50 Most
Beautiful People in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, and it's nothing new. They've been making that list a
cover story every year since 1990. It's mostly models and
entertainers. Don't be hurt you didn't make . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't make it, and neither did a lot of other people I
can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're thinking about me, don't. The editors' strategy was
to figure out which celebrities will sell the most magazines, throw
in pictures of a few other good-lookers and stir up a little
controversy. I'm looking forward to the letters to the editor. The
beautiful people issue sells out, and the publishers laugh all the
way to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not laughing, not even a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that, and I can't understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You would if you coulda seen my grandchildren when the
magazine came in the mail. They musta argued over a hour about who
shoulda made the list and who shoulda been left off. They argued
about hunks and babes until I just about puked. A senator got
picked, not 'cause he's doing such a good job but 'cause he looks
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to admit,'' I teased, ``being a hunk draws votes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffie, that could mean how you look's more important than
what you do or how you do it.'' The more B.T. talked, the gloomier
he looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give People credit. The list includes a little
something for everybody of every age, race and background.'' I said
to lighten the tone. ``That's good marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   My tactic didn't work. ``It's the 'marketing' what's got me
upset,'' B.T. said. ``Looks over substance. And we're buying it
everywhere. My grandchildren look like me, and I don't want them
thinking they got to be beautiful to be recognized for what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they won't. Magazine covers emphasize physical beauty
because beauty sells. It's not supposed to be a values statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not to us, but I'm not so sure about the kids. I noticed
that this month when my Ebony magazine came. This singer, Lauryn
Hill, one of People's 50 beauties, was on the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have that issue. She was also on the cover of Time a few
weeks back for getting more Grammys than any other woman in a
single year. At 23, the sister's definitely more than just another
beautiful face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``True. But inside that Ebony was a story about a neurosurgeon
named Keith Richards. The brother's 41 and world-famous 'cause he
can slice a cancer out of a person's brain without disturbing the
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? I've got the May issue at home. I've got to read about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you already read the cover story about this Miss Hill,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded, reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffie, now you understand why I want to know how I measure up
in the looks department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You take things too seriously, old friend. Just tell the
children our society judges people based on ability, not looks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold onto that thought, Jeffie.''

 &HT;    GOP lawmaker letting freak flag fly
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Has state Rep. Talmadge Heflin let his brown
hair grow down to his shoulders because he's fixing to join the
World Wrestling Federation?
</P>
<P>
   Is the Houston Republican sporting this very un-GOPish hairdo
because he's going to begin a new life on the Drag?
</P>
<P>
   Or is he wearing a hairdo that would have gotten him thrown out
of third grade in Bastrop a few years ago because he is starting a
grunge band?
</P>
<P>
   It sure looks like any of those could explain why the
conservative Heflin is letting his freak flag fly.
</P>
<P>
   But Heflin says his newfound hairstyle has nothing to do with a
philosophical shift. Heflin, 59, in his ninth term in the House,
says he let his hair grow long because he got a bad haircut here in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   So he's gone from having a bad hair day to having a bad hair
life.
</P>
<P>
   Heflin says he hasn't cut his hair since last July or August. Up
until the bad haircut, Heflin wore a regular businessman's haircut.
But now he looks like a new man, and the new man looks like David
Crosby. It's getting to the point where it looks like Heflin is
about to ask you for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the truth of the matter is, back last year I got a
bad haircut,'' Heflin said. ``I was forced to change barbers
because my barber retired. The reference I got just gave me a very
bad haircut, and I just decided I didn't need to pay for (another)
very bad haircut. I just let it grow, and I suppose I got used to
it and my family got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody has gotten used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to kind of nag on people around here, though,
'cause it seems out of character for me,'' Heflin said. ``I still
have people come up and comment that it's aggravating to them. I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Heflin added that part of the reason he hasn't cut his hair is
that he hasn't ``taken the time to find another barber. I've had
two or three people say, 'I've got a really good barber; why don't
you let me make you an appointment?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Why not indeed? I told Heflin the name of my barber, and he
didn't seem interested.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because Heflin just likes looking like a hippie. He
says this is the first time in his life he's had long hair. Maybe
he just enjoys that Woodstock skinny dip look. Maybe next session
he'll be taking up the mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how big Heflin's hair is? I'll tell you. I saw
Heflin on the House floor chatting with a woman Tuesday, and his
hair was bigger than hers.
</P>
<P>
   I should mention that on Ricky Williams Day back in late
January, Heflin had his hair done up in dreadlocks with rubber
bands by his administrative secretary, Jennifer Wilhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real envious,'' said Rep. Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat.
``Those of us who can't seem to grow any hair have to look every
day at this guy. He must be approaching the big 6-0, walking around
with hair way past his shoulders. It's pretty outrageous. It's
pretty radical. He could have entered the aging hippie contest at
Pease Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey added that if he was trying to guess which lawmaker would
grow long hair, Heflin's name would not come up. ``He is the most,
let's just say, conservative curmudgeon you would ever find,''
Maxey said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the reason Heflin has taken on that leftist look is that
the magical vibes from Barton Springs are getting to his brain.
After all, Heflin has been in the House since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you why you should have term limits,'' Maxey said.
``If you stay in Austin long enough, you turn into an Austinite.''

 &HT;    A touch of fate, a date with greatness
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Every time I visit the Golden Lamb, I peek into
the Charles Dickens room on the second floor and dream of staying
there one night, soaking up the stray molecules of literary
brilliance, that, who knows, may still be wafting around after 157
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night before Mother's Day seemed the perfect time.
I called the Golden Lamb and _ fate ordained it _ there had been a
cancellation: the Dickens room.
</P>
<P>
   What a perfect antidote to the rigors of the previous weekend,
when, along with hundreds of other journalists, I attended the
National Writers Workshop in Indianapolis _ all of us little names
lured by the big names (best-selling novelist Jacquelyn Mitchard,
three Pulitzer Prize winners, the works).
</P>
<P>
   One of the weekend's themes was ``Stealing from the Classics,''
or borrowing techniques from literary giants. A good idea, and a
humbling one, reminding us that even the finest newspaper writing
is a long way from Fitzgerald or Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would anybody be reading any of our stuff 50, 100 years from
now?'' I wondered. Surveying the assembled luminaries, I remembered
John F. Kennedy's 1962 speech at a dinner honoring American Nobel
Prize winners: ``I think this is the most extraordinary collection
of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered at the
White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson
dined alone.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you reconcile ambition and humility, dreams with
practicality? What's the point of trying to achieve good work, if
you can't be guaranteed greatness?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the conference headliners exhibited a modesty in
refreshing contrast with some of the brash young
hand-me-the-world-on-a-platter wannabes. The charmingly
down-to-earth Mitchard, author of the first Oprah Book Club
selection, The Deep End of the Ocean, said her success was a fluke.
Until ``anointed by the hand of Oprah,'' she said, she was ``an
obscure but respectable first-time author from Madison, Wis.''
</P>
<P>
   If her success was incidental, what were the odds against
Charles Dickens, a debtor's son? You're have a far better chance of
being ``Oprah-fied,'' after all, than being touched by the hand of
genius as was Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you're lucky, you can book the genius' bedroom. The
Dickens room boasts a walnut Victorian bed with a death-defying
12-foot headboard. But alas, its namesake never actually stayed
there overnight. On April 20, 1842, Dickens hopped a stagecoach to
Xenia, Ohio after an apparently unsatisfactory dining experience at
the Golden Lamb. In American Notes he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for brandy; but it is a temperance hotel, and spirits
were not to be had for love or money. This preposterous forcing of
unpleasant drinks down the throats of reluctant travelers is not
uncommon in America. . . . Perhaps the plainest course for persons
of such tender conscience would be a total abstinence from
tavern-keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds awfully mortal, this immortal, cranky and weary after
a hard day's journey on stagecoach. But that first bad review
brought the Golden Lamb untold business, and the Dickens room is
requested far and away more than those of any of the 10 presidents
who stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the Dickens bedroom is the closest I get to
greatness? The National Writers Workshop reminded me: It's a
privilege to write for a living.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a good conference, inspiring, invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the most extraordinary collection of literary
talent that has ever been gathered in the Midwest, with the
exception of when Charles Dickens dined at the Golden Lamb, alone.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Let sitting books lie
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I called my mother the other morning to
give her the bad news, a little something no good daughter should
do two days after Mother's Day, but I had no choice. I am, after
all, a fallen Catholic with substantial residual guilt.
</P>
<P>
   So I had to tell her.
</P>
<P>
   I had to tell her I was never going to make the cover of Cosmo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think you've got the bosom for it,'' she said in full
sincerity, proving in short order that all good mothers really are
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' I said, near tears. ``That's not the point. The point
is I've put my foot in my mouth. I've spoken out when I shouldn't
have. I've embarrassed myself and, thus, you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' I said. ``I've ostracized Kate White.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Who?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And I hung up and wept with wild joy.
</P>
<P>
   Kate White is the editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan magazine, a
big job which means she is in charge of instructing American women,
mostly white American women, how to do our hair, lose 10 pounds and
make ourselves more orgasmic. Not in that order, of course.
</P>
<P>
   She also writes books, two so far. The first one was called Why
Good Girls Don't Get Ahead ... but Gutsy Girls Do. I never read it
and, thus, have had only two promotions in the last five years as
opposed to the 35 she so slyly recommends.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I made that last part up, that part about the 35 promotions.
But this next part is true: The title of White's newest book is 9
Secrets of Women Who Get Everything They Want ($12, Three Rivers
Press). And the chapter titles are even, as White likes to say,
even more ``irreverent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't understand that,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 1: Covet They Neighbor's Things.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2: Bite Off More Than You Can Chew. (I did this and it
took me straight to Chapter 5. See title below.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 3: Don't Wait for the Right Moment. (Not a problem.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 4: Wear Your Heart on Your Sleeve. (Got that one
covered.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 5: Be Too Big for Your Britches. (See Chapter 2.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 6: Never Mind Your Own Business. (Done, ask my husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 7: Keep Your Elbows on the Table.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 8: Don't Sit Tight.
</P>
<P>
   And the ninth secret: Rest on Your Laurels. (I'm a master at
this; ask my editor.)
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, I didn't pick up White's book at first. Scared
maybe? All those empowering chapter titles. All that talk of new
shoes and corporate climbing.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from Chapter 3: To get what you want, you have to
feel you deserve it, and, unfortunately, pouncing and snatching
don't allow much time for working on your sense of entitlement. Try
this shortcut: Go out and buy something absolutely expensive and
wonderful to wear, and get a haircut that gives you a whole new
look. When you dress and act like a movie star, you often feel like
one.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So when Kate White called, when I actually had her on the line,
when I'd actually gotten past Miriam, her personal assistant, and
Celeste, her substitute secretary on Monday, when I'd actually been
given 15 minutes of her time, I just lost control of my senses.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this book annoy me? I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how I blew the cover of Cosmo.
</P>
<P>
   So I swear to you. If tabloid editor Steve Coz ever writes a
book, I am not picking it up. Not even one time. I swear I won't
and if I do I will never, ever request an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan is one thing. But my mother will never forgive me
if I blow the cover of the National Enquirer.

 &HT;    A new Basketball era has begun
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is Year 1 A.M. for the National Basketball Association
playoffs _ the first year After Michael _ and the verdict is in: We
miss him as much as the Bulls did.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you rooted for him or against him, Jordan was the focal
point of both the season and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If you avoided investing any emotional capital in this shortened
regular season, you chose wisely. Watching regular seasons that
lead to 16 playoff spots is like watching cars circling the parking
lot at a mall, waiting for a spot near the door. Eventually, only
the very bad or the very unlucky don't get one.
</P>
<P>
   I followed the regular season on two levels.
</P>
<P>
   Level One: How many days would go by between player arrests for
driving while impaired?
</P>
<P>
   Level Two: How would what Jordan called his ``supporting cast''
do without him?
</P>
<P>
   The latter was the more interesting because when Jordan retired,
there was a small but loud group of fans/experts/seriously-confused
folks who considered Jordan overrated, most of them being from the
extended family of Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   I've always liked Pippen, but he showed he was just another good
player in his failure to lift the Bulls in the 1 1/2 seasons when
Jordan was on his successful crusade to prove baseball is hard.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Pippen landed in Houston, surrounded by two other
future Hall of Famers _ Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley _ and
Pippen's leadership skills propelled the Rockets to a fine
fifth-place finish in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``supporting cast'' worked similar miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper stayed in Chicago and led the New
Bulls to a scintillating last-place finish in the East. Dennis
Rodman put in guest-appearances with Carmen Electra, Jay Leno and
the Lakers in that order, then retired after he couldn't find his
shoes and socks. Steve Kerr surfaced in San Antonio, where he is a
sub. Luc Longley went to Phoenix, got hurt and got a tan.
</P>
<P>
   Any other questions about how great Jordan was?
</P>
<P>
   Now we have reached the playoffs, and, with Jordan sharing
quality time with his family on a golf course somewhere, the table
has no centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and its television arm, NBC, are doing their utmost to
give us substitute themes:
</P>
<P>
   Are Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant capable of sharing one
lockerroom in LA?
</P>
<P>
   Is this Houston's last hurrah with the aging foursome of Hakeem,
Sir Charles, Scottie and Dorian Gray?
</P>
<P>
   What's the over-under on the number of civil disturbances
between the Knicks and Heat?
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone and John Stockton: Just good enough to lose again?
</P>
<P>
   Whose dome do you like better on those frisky 76ers _ Alan
Iverson's or Matt Geiger's.
</P>
<P>
   This is the peak time of the year for couch potatoes, carrots
and beans of all persuasions.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to my yearly mantra: Another playoff is going on
and the games are usually better than the NBA's, even if you can't
name 10 players or pronounce their names. (Hint: Roy is pronounced
``Wah.'')
</P>
<P>
   Miniscule TV ratings aside, there is no more exciting game than
playoff hockey. Every game is like the World Wrestling Federation
on skates, complete with morality plays and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a period one of these nights, and if you're not hooked,
I'll ask Claude Lemeiux (pronounced ``Game Misconduct'') to come to
your house and explain the finer points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Year 1 A.M. should be good, too, as soon as I figure
out the story line.

 &HT;    Sprint to the finish
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ You'll have to forgive Debbie Ferguson if she has
barely noticed this week's SEC Track and Field Championships. It's
just that, lately, life has threatened to lap the fastest woman in
University of Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ferguson had to study for finals and then take the
exams. Then, her family came up from the Bahamas for her
graduation, and she had to find places for them to stay. Next was
the graduation, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we had to move out of the dorms,'' said the defending
SEC and NCAA champion in the 100 and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much pressure on me to do well at the SECs and the
NCAAs, but I've had so much going on, I haven't really had time to
even think about them,'' Ferguson said. ``I'm trying to stay
focused, but. . . '' she said. ``Basically, I'm trying not to
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   One might wonder why she would. Ferguson, after all, has won
every notable race and every conceivable award in collegiate track
and field. She's a four-time NCAA champion, six-time SEC individual
titleist, 16-time All-American and the current Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Award recipient, which goes annually to the top female performer in
college track.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Ferguson so nervous about this week's meet, which is
going to be held in her own back yard on the familiar track at
UGA's Spec Towns Track?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much about this sport has to do with adrenaline,'' said
Ferguson, a 1996 Olympic silver medalist as part of the Bahamas 400
relay team in the '96 Atlanta Games. ``Being at home, I'm afraid
I'm going to be too relaxed. I want to be on the edge. That's when
I do well.''
</P>
<P>
   She has another distraction. With respect to the SECs, Ferguson
has been focusing all of her training this year on the Bahama
nationals and, ultimately, the World Championships in Seville,
Spain, in August. A semifinalist in last year's Worlds, Ferguson is
determined to win a medal this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very goal-oriented,'' the senior from Nassau said. ``I set
goals, then go out and try to achieve them. In college, basically
I've achieved them all. I've won the SECs and the NCAAs, and I
graduated last Saturday. My next goal is the World Championships,
and I'm really focused on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that defending her SEC 100- and 200-meter
titles is not important. On the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem I'm having right now. It is important to
me,'' Ferguson said. ``You want to be at your peak all the time,
but that's impossible. I'm not sure I'll be at my best. It's a
little frustrating, but I'll do my best and whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't count Georgia track coach John Mitchell among those
worried about Ferguson's performance this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be if it wasn't on our own track,'' said Mitchell, who
will retire after this season. ``She wants to win here, big-time;
she wants to win here major-league. And the girls she's got to beat
here, she's going to have to beat (at the NCAA Championships) in
Boise. She's a fierce competitor. She'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson will get all she can handle in the SEC field. Although
she owns last year's fastest 100-meter time _ 10.97 _ her personal
best of 11.09 this season ranks behind two of her conference
colleagues. Tennessee's Kelli White posted a wind-aided 10.96 and
LSU's Peta-Gaye Dowdie has run an 11.03.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson still ranks first in the 100 meters heading into next
month's NCAAs, with Dowdie second and White fourth. In the 200,
Dowdie's ranked No. 1, with Ferguson and White right behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's focus on life after college is understandable. She
has made enormous financial sacrifices while remaining an amateur
the last couple of years. She gave up at least $30,000 in prize
money last year, not including potential endorsements. And she
passed on the $10,000 that was offered along with her Olympic
silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferguson hasn't exactly wasted her time in the interim. She
graduated last week with a 3.07 in biology. When her track career
is over, she plans to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My academics come first, then athletics,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   With her college career drawing near a close, those priorities
will reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track is my life,'' Ferguson said. ``It's how I got my
education. It's allowed me to travel around the world, to meet
people and do things. It's affected my whole life. It's like a
religion _ I preach it, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Spec Towns Track, University of Georgia campus, Athens,

 &HT;    `Star Wars' preview wows members of its cast; critics less
enthusiastic
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Liam Neeson likens watching the highly anticipated
first Star Wars prequel to being very hungry and presented with a
tray of all your favorite foods. ``You have time to just grab the
french fries before it's taken away,'' said Neeson, who stars in
Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace as Jedi Knight Qui-Gon
Jinn.
</P>
<P>
   The first chapter of George Lucas' phenomenally successful space
saga flies by faster than the jet-propelled Podracers featured in
one of the film's most thrilling sequences. Five concurrent story
lines, nearly 2,000 visual-effects shots and a universe of
painstakingly detailed characters, sets and costumes whiz past.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, an Oscar nominee for Schindler's List, said he needed to
see the film a few more times ``to just digest it.'' The Phantom
Menace opens next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $120-million movie was screened over the weekend in New York
City for members of the foreign, television, print and radio media.
Attending the Saturday night screening were film stars Samuel L.
Jackson (Mace Windu), Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala), Jake Lloyd
(Anakin Skywalker), Pernilla August (Shmi Skywalker) and Ahmed Best
(Jar Jar Binks), as well as celebrity shock jock Howard Stern
(Jerk).
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were offered as much as $200 for an extra ticket by
fans and paparazzi staking out the Union Square movie theater and
Midtown Manhattan hotel, where interviews were conducted. The
individually numbered screening passes were scanned with
ultraviolet light at one of five security checkpoints for an
invisible watermark to verify authenticity. Under no circumstances
were they to be sold. Anyone secretly videotaping the film was to
be reported to management. ``We wouldn't want to see this film on
the Internet,'' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As the lights went down, the audience cheered the Fox and
Lucasfilm logos, as well as the title card, opening crawl and first
appearances by familiar characters such as R2-D2. The actors loudly
cheered their fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really good,'' Jackson said later. ``It worked. The whole
thing worked.'' The Oscar nominee for Pulp Fiction wasn't aware of
Episode 1's full story until he saw the film for the first time on
Saturday. ``I really hadn't had time to go on the Internet and read
the script,'' he said, laughing. ``So I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas only completed The Phantom Menace six days earlier, on May
1, with the final effects shot of horn-headed villain Darth Maul
(Ray Park) testing an electronic barrier with his double-bladed
lightsaber.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the second screening for Lloyd, a 10-year-old actor
who plays the future Darth Vader as an innocent slave boy who is
strong with the Force. ``You get to catch more of the story (the
second time), because the first time you're just looking at
yourself, seeing how you did,'' said Lloyd, who previously played
Arnold Schwarzenegger's son in Jingle All the Way. ``The second
time you try to get the story and the third time you get the
story.'' Lloyd loved the film.
</P>
<P>
   Critical reaction was less enthusiastic and widely mixed. While
many jaded critics cheered the exciting Podrace and battle
sequences and applauded the end of the film, others found the
biggest movie event of the decade to be a big disappointment. More
than a few naysayers felt that the film lacked romance and was
geared too much to younger children. They also had problems with
the performance of one of the film's digitally rendered characters.
``It took me out of the movie,'' said Rene Rodriguez, film critic
for the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Star Wars films have gotten generally bad reviews,
Lucas said. ``They have mostly been trashed one way or another,
especially in the major media. So I certainly expect not to do well
critically. I never have.'' He expects to do better with The
Phantom Menace than with some of the other films he has directed or
produced, such as Howard the Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the director's chair for the first time since the
original Star Wars 22 years ago, Lucas is pleased with the result _
largely because film technology has finally caught up with his
vision. ``This is the one time I was able to sit down and basically
let my imagination run wild and not be hampered by, `Oh, I can't to
this, I can't do that, I can't go to Coruscant, I'll never be able
to do the buildings, I can't do a Podrace because that's
impossible.' I could sort of dream up whatever I wanted and I was,
for the most part, able to pull it all off.'' Lucas plans to direct
Episodes 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Best, a former Stomp performer who created the movements and
provided the voice for the amphibious Jar Jar, said he was so
jazzed watching the film for the first time earlier last week that
it all went by too fast. ``Also, the first night I was sitting next
to Harrison Ford _ that flipped me out _ and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The original trilogy's Han Solo was on the edge of his seat,
according to Best, who divided his attention between Ford and the
screen. ``So I know I missed something, but that was like, I'm
watching Star Wars: Episode 1 and Han Solo is right there!''
</P>
<P>
   Best thoroughly enjoyed the film and said the same went for
Ford. ``It's like everything Star Wars is supposed to be: Great
action, great story, great effects.'' Echoing his co-stars, Jar
Jar's alter-ego said The Phantom Menace is also extremely
fast-paced. ``As soon as you sit down, it's like, `Take this,' and
everything just sets off.'' Lucasfilm certainly hopes that fans
will go back for second and third helpings of those fries.

 &HT;    Myths about Kosovo can be dangerous
 &HT;    (EDS: FREELANCE MATERIAL _ not for use by NYT subscribers.)
 &HT;    By John Price
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service3
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a great deal of ``information'' floating
around about Kosovo these days, much of it useful and
thought-provoking. There are also a fair number of pundits whose
solemn pronouncements have more to do with their points of view
than any real understanding of the area.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a Balkan scholar. However, as a U.S. State Department
official from 1989 to '96, I dealt daily with the ancient places
and forces at work in Kosovo. One of the lessons I learned was that
myths are dangerous weapons. As we make decisions about whether to
escalate our presence in the Balkans, we should be sure that those
decisions are grounded in reality rather than myths we ``know'' to
be true.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 1: Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem; they have a right to it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kosovo has tremendous emotional importance for Serbs.
However, in the past two months, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and his army have made the Serbs' emotional attachment to
Kosovo as irrelevant as English claims to Calais. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution recently featured a column by a writer who
maintained that our folly in Yugoslavia was in not reading Serbian
history, in not understanding how important Kosovo is to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, clutching the dead hand of the long ago is the
very source of Yugoslavia's tragedy. I have witnessed the ways in
which history can be used to justify all manner of atrocities;
crimes I cannot fully imagine even though I have seen the evidence
and talked to the victims. At some point, the international
community must be allowed to say, ``Enough.'' When a government
sets out to murder its citizens in a gruesome homage to history and
ethnic purity, we mock our creed by ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 2: Milosevic is Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It can be politically useful to dress up our adversaries as
Satan. However, Milosevic is not evil. Not like Adolf Hitler or
Joseph Stalin, anyway. When you sit in a room with him, he does not
conjure up visions of history's great villains. Rather, one
imagines Michael Corleone with a bad haircut. The way to deal with
him is not as a larger-than-life figure but as a calculating thug.
He will not be coaxed out of Kosovo. By the same token, he will not
disappear into his bunker with a pistol while flames lick Belgrade.
If we demonstrate a willingness to ``go to the mat,'' he will
consider his options and make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 3: This is simply none of our business.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your opinion of this president and his foreign policy,
do not fool yourself. Our national interest is now inextricably
bound up with the Kosovars and their sad little war. To the world,
this is not President Clinton's war but NATO's war, America's war.
Consider the results if we fail to roll back Milosevic. Ignore the
immediate consequences _ a ratification of butchery that borders on
genocide. Think instead of the geopolitical consequences of a NATO
bug-out. Actually, in Washington they have been thinking about it
for years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. foreign-policy planners long ago predicted that Serb
repression could lead to an armed conflict in Kosovo. This, they
forecast, would result in massive refugee outflow. (Any of this
sound familiar?) Hundreds of thousands of embittered refugees would
destabilize the region and imperil the new architecture of Europe.
This destabilization could easily spark a generalized conflict in
Central and Southern Europe. Are there any doubts that the United
States could remain aloof from such a conflict? Which leads us to
the final, most dangerous myth of all.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 4: The Cold War is over; NATO's success or failure is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Before this century was even half over, the United States had
sent troops to fight and die in two European wars. But, in the
years after, we averted another, even more cataclysmic war before
it could begin and ended a second before it could spread. In both
the Cold War and the implementation of the Bosnian peace, NATO made
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Having been sheltered behind this mighty bulwark for so long, we
forgot the world that preceded it. The 21st century can be a return
to that world: Today, in 1999, people are being rounded up, pushed
onto trains. Their daughters are being raped. Their sons are being
shot. Their houses are being burned. All because they belong to the
group that doesn't have the most guns.
</P>
<P>
   Or, we can build on the progress of the past 50 years. The way
to do that is not to abandon the fortress that protects us. Rather,
it is to jealously guard NATO's credibility and defend this world
we have built.

   The search for intelligent life in outer space is going so well,
scientists need a little help from you and your home computer.
Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens, or more
precisely, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for
a personal computer. His brainchild called SETI(AT)home is a
data-saving software program that masks as a screen saver and will
allow amateur computer jockeys to receive and collate chunks of
data from outer space from the privacy of their own homes.

   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>
<P>
   Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.: Ames conducts
wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and
the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in
Fairmont, West Va. _ are Ames subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.: develops
everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to
next-generation launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.: the birthplace of
Sojourner, Cassini, Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space
vehicles, JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space. The
labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert, Spain and Australia
communicate with spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Space Center, Houston: mission control, where astronauts
train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking. JSC coordinates the
development of the International Space Station. The White Sands
Test Facility, in Las Cruces, N.M., is part of JSC.

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>
<P>
   Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.: Ames conducts
wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and
the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in
Fairmont, West Va. _ are Ames subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.: develops
everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to
next-generation launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.: the birthplace of
Sojourner, Cassini, Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space
vehicles, JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space. The
labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert, Spain and Australia
communicate with spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Space Center, Houston: mission control, where astronauts
train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking. JSC coordinates the
development of the International Space Station. The White Sands
Test Facility, in Las Cruces, N.M., is part of JSC.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Research Center, Cleveland: specializes in supersonic- and
subsonic-engine design.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla.: receives all
the different pieces of a spacecraft, readies them for takeoff, and
launches them.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.: manages satellites,
with branches at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and the
Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.: develops new aircraft
designs.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signal. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.

   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>

wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, the software downloaded off the Internet
(http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) will allow amateur computer
jockeys to receive and collate chunks of data from the world's
largest radio telescope _ the 1,000-foot-diameter dish nestled in
the hills south of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(AT)home users don't need to know a thing about astronomy.
Nor do they need to know how to look for signals. The program does
all the work whenever the screen saver is on.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, Werthimer has directed the Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent
Populations _ SERENDIP, for short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio telescope is a curved mirror,'' Werthimer says. ``You
put your detector at the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming radio-wave signals bounce off the reflecting dish
and are collected at the focus and translated into electrical
impulses. In most radio telescopes the dish moves; that's how
reception shifts from one part of the sky to another. But the
stadium-size dish at Arecibo is built right into the earth, so it's
the receivers that must move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspended above the dish is a latticework of struts from which
receivers descend. Other groups attach their experiments, and our
SERENDIP receiver goes along for the ride. It's focused as well _
but on a different part of the sky. We have no control over where
we're going to point. But that works out okay _ because we don't
know where to look anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-year history of SERENDIP, the project has seen an
exponential growth in signal-detection capabilities. When the first
SERENDIP search was launched in 1979, the program could scan only
100 frequencies, or channels. Today that number is 168 million
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck in this giddy progress, paradoxically, is the
processing power of the program's mainframes. They simply can't
analyze the information as fast as it's pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the SETI(AT)home screen saver offers an ingenious
solution. Users can receive 256-kilobyte data chunks _ about 100
seconds of viewing _ fresh from the Arecibo Observatory. With
casual use on a typical home computer, the screen saver will take a
week or two to crunch the numbers. At that point, users are cued to
send the finished chunk in and download another.
</P>
<P>
   The version of the screen saver on Werthimer's monitor, with its
rainbow of spikes, is bare bones. Future renditions, Werthimer
says, will show users precisely where in the sky they're looking
and how many stars they have targeted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, users can watch the analysis unfold in real time _
and be the first ones on their block to detect signals from a
distant world.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred users tested the program last November. In February
some 210,000 SETI(AT)home volunteers were waiting to download the
software _ already by far the world's largest computer task force.
Werthimer and his colleagues are hoping the chances of finding
extraterrestrial intelligence will be enhanced by the increasingly
democratic nature of the quest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Paul Shuch, director of the SETI League's
grassroots Project Argus, has already been helping amateur
astronomers set up small radio telescopes _ and networking their
efforts into a global search for extraterrestrial beacons. The
project has more than 900 members in 51 countries, with 67 Argus
observing stations online _ just a small fraction of Shuch's
ambitious goal of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for the amateur SETI researcher have never
been better. Now, with the advent of SETI(AT)home, it's even
possible that the first proof of extraterrestrial intelligence may
begin as a spike on someone's screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   When we do find that signal (SETI researchers dislike the word
if), there's likely to be planet-wide jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   But will the long-awaited ETs be equally delighted to hear from
us?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first civilizations we find are likely to be far more
advanced than ours,'' Werthimer notes. ``So it really becomes a
question of motivation. Do they want to get in touch with us?
They're probably in direct contact with millions of civilizations
already. Whether we'll be welcome on that galactic Internet, I
don't know.''

<P>
   Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking for aliens. Or, to be
precise, he is listening for them via a modified screen saver for a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All day long in Werthimer's office at the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, spikes of
green, blue, pink and red pulse across his computer monitor. Each
spike represents an incoming radio signal. The higher the spike,
the greater the signal's intensity and power. Any sustained peak
could be a shout from across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at goldfish or flying toasters on your screen,''
Werthimer says, ``when you could be doing something that answers
the ancient question, Are we alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening for aliens used to be a passion limited to folks with
the biggest ears _ radio telescopes with giant dishes cupped toward
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly 40 years researchers such as Werthimer have
been scanning the cosmos with such high-powered instruments in
hopes of stumbling upon an alien broadcast _ something akin to an
extraterrestrial version of ``I Love Lucy.'' The search has been
slow and laborious.
</P>
<P>
   But what really frustrates Werthimer is that he doesn't have
enough supercomputers to sort through the mountains of
radio-transmission data they are collecting. Aliens may already
have tried to contact us _ but their message could be languishing
on a hard disk, waiting to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Werthimer, anyone with a personal computer can
join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Werthimer's
brainchild _ developed with colleague David Anderson _ debuts this
month. It's called SETI(AT)home: a data-sorting software program
that masquerades as a screen saver.

   &UR; DISCOVER DIALOGUE: JUST LET HER FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lucid, a biochemist and NASA astronaut, holds the record
for the most hours in orbit by a woman. In 1996 she was awarded the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton, the only
woman so honored. For six months aboard Russia's Mir space station
in 1996, she grew wheat, monitored gestating quail eggs and studied
how fluids be have in space.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where she helps train
crews for the International Space Station, she had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What inspired you as a child to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to know everything about the world around me. I
decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of
oxygen and hydrogen. I could not understand how two gases made a
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your fantasy career?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots. The
people who have access to resources get more and more, and the
people who don't are getting less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you reading now?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A Peoples Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924,'' a
book by Orlando Figes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could visit another planet, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mars, because it's similar to Earth in a lot of respects,
except that as far as I know it doesn't have life. Also, there's a
reasonable chance that you can go there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have nothing to read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you take any books to Mir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read about 50 books while I was up there, including several
by Dickens _ among them ``David Copperfield'' and ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else did you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A: We joked. And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could redesign the human body, what would you add?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were able to travel back in time, what era would you
choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right now is the best time for a woman to live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPINAL CORD CURE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments, injured spinal cords
never heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology,'' says
Richard Borgens of Purdue University. Such nerve damage invariably
causes permanent paralysis, a grim prognosis that Borgens, a
neurobiologist, hopes to change. He and physiologist Riyi Shi have
managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of
guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called
polyethylene glycol, applying it directly to the crushed parts of
the animals' spinal cords. The chemical attracts water molecules
and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, the proteins in the membranes cluster together,
``like soldiers closing ranks,'' Borgens says. This clustering
seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together.
After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>
<P>
   Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.: Ames conducts
wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and
the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in
Fairmont, West Va. _ are Ames subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.: develops
everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to
next-generation launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.: the birthplace of
Sojourner, Cassini, Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space
vehicles, JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space. The
labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert, Spain and Australia
communicate with spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Space Center, Houston: mission control, where astronauts
train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking. JSC coordinates the
development of the International Space Station. The White Sands
Test Facility, in Las Cruces, N.M., is part of JSC.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Research Center, Cleveland: specializes in supersonic- and
subsonic-engine design.
</P>

After a few minutes, Borgens adds water to the cells, restoring the
membranes to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Early results have been promising: Of the dozens of guinea pigs
tested, all regained some sensation and motor control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human trials,'' Borgens says, ``could begin in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEATH FLARES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for
those of us who live on Earth. He recently discovered that several
nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent,
shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a
billion miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the
biggest solar flares ever seen,'' Schaefer says.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such
fires. Schaefer's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the
magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause
the flares. The planet's field could become entangled with the
star's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   When the twisted fields snap apart, the stored energy is
released in one tremendous burst, creating what Rubenstein and
Schaefer call a superflare.
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury, which has a very
weak magnetic field. But if Jupiter occupied Mercury's orbit, we'd
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a
gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and
strip away the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe, causing
the food chain to die from the bottom up,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country:
</P>
<P>
   Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.: Ames conducts
wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research _ the study of what
life might be like on other worlds. Moffett Federal Airfield and
the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in

   Commentary

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It had to have happened this month. He had to
have been born in May.
</P>
<P>
   He was six or seven weeks old that sunny morning in early July.
I'd just left Newsday on Long Island and begun duties with a new
newspaper in Albany. My wife and I and our two little children were
moving into a new house.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he wandered out from the bushes into our new
driveway, skinny and scared. He meowed piteously. Can we keep him,
the kids asked?
</P>
<P>
   The family menagerie at that point consisted of a large and
good-natured Siberian husky, a burly yellow rabbit, a fuzzy guinea
pig, and two _ count 'em, two _ cats. And my kids wanted this one,
too. Wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, I don't think so,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please?` the kids begged. ``Please, please, please, please?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so now we had three cats. Since the new kitten was black and
white, like a pinto horse, the kids named him Tiger. It made sense
to them.
</P>
<P>
   My toddler, Kevin, was nuts about this new cat. This one was his
personal property. He took Tiger to bed with him that first night.
And for every night for years after that. In the family album, I
have a marvelous photo of Kevin, in his Spiderman underpants,
heading upstairs to bed with the little black and white cat slung
over his shoulder like a towel.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Tiger was high maintenance. Once, he climbed up
under the hood of a car during cold weather. He was peacefully
sacked out there when somebody got into the car and started it. The
fan clipped him. He dragged himself home with a broken hip that
cost me a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Another time he bounded up on my chest in the middle of the
night. He stuck his face an inch from mine and let out with a
ferocious yowl. When my heartbeat settled down, I managed to figure
out what he was telling me. He had a urinary tract blockage. It
took surgery to fix that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time a rear claw fell off. The wound wouldn't
heal. Another trip to the vet. Toe cancer. Luckily, they got it all
during that surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger came through every impoverishing health crisis just fine.
As time went by, the other beasts slipped away to their eternal
rewards. And the kids grew, of course. My little girl is now a
woman of 26 with a career in television news.
</P>
<P>
   And that little boy who loved his black and white cat so
desperately? Next month, he graduates from college in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tiger is still here, essentially unchanged in two
decades. The vet says his kidney function seems to be slowing, but
he's still feisty enough to bat around that upstart golden
retriever whenever the whim strikes him.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, I moved Tiger indoors. He was losing a step or
two. I didn't trust his judgment in dodging cars. Like many pro
athletes and some politicians, cats don't always know when it's
time to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sits on my lap at night as I watch television. Routinely,
he sneaks into bed when I'm deepest into sleep to run a sandpaper
tongue over my face at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he's a bit confused. He'll start howling frantically.
Apparently, he's asking, ``Where the hell am I? What's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   When Tiger was born, the president was a guy named Jimmy Carter.
That president is long gone, just like the little kids who fussed
over that terrified kitten in that driveway so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tiger howls like that, I pick him up. I stroke him and
assure him that everything is fine. After 20 years together, he
always takes my word for it.
</P>

JESSE JACKSON'S NO WARMONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's understandable that some people would mistake
the Rev. Jesse Jackson for a member of the legendary singing group
the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Temps, Jackson is tall, mustachioed and fast on his
feet. But William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly
Standard magazine and a commentator on ABC's ``This Week With Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' obviously believes that Jackson
possesses the supernatural powers the Temptations boasted about in
song.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol is critical of Jackson's successful mission to
Yugoslavia to win the release of three American GIs. So much so
that on ``Larry King Live,'' Kristol said Jackson's action had
``prolonged the war'' against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Jackson has a huge opinion of himself and would
love to have the power to stop all wars. But to accuse him of
prolonging the Yugoslav war exceeds the most strident criticisms
ever leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
   To lay at Jackson's feet a war that has its roots in
centuries-old conflicts and retaliations is rhetorical overkill at
best and contemptuous illogic at worst. (With what unit of
measurement will Kristol gauge just how long Jackson extended the
war?)
</P>
<P>
   Such is Jackson's power, obviously, that eventually we'll learn
he's to blame for tornadoes, the Y2K problem and blue M&AMP;Ms.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol reveals a fascinating reflection of Jackson's most
persistent critics: On one hand, they deem him an irrelevant
globe-trotting sideshow ``meddling'' in foreign affairs. On the
other hand, they attribute to him the ability to alter world events
to the detriment of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson confounds his critics and makes them say silly things
because they continue to underestimate him. He wasn't expected to
win the release of the three captive Americans, just as he wasn't
expected to win the release of Lt. Robert Goodman from Syria in
1983, just as he wasn't expected to be a serious presidential
candidate in 1984 and again in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so serious was Jackson's presidential run in 1988 (in
which he vanquished Al Gore) that there was a moment, after his 2
to 1 victory over Michael Dukakis in the Michigan caucuses, when he
scared the Democratic Party establishment with the possibility he'd
win the nomination. (The Blame Jesse Game continued when, in 1995,
Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich wrote a USA Today column all
but putting Dukakis' defeat to George Bush on Jackson, ignoring the
fact that her candidate had the personality of plywood.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson can be a caricature of himself. His love for the camera
can be both annoying and comical. But the essence of the man is
that since his days as a student activist at North Carolina A&AMP;T, he
has devoted his life to social justice, taking seriously the
nonviolence he learned from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   No, Jesse Jackson can't turn gray skies blue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can he prolong a war.
</P>
<P>
   But he has the imagination and courage to bring three soldiers
home to their families.
</P>
<P>
   That's good enough.

 &HT;    PLIGHT OF KOSOVO ALBANIAN CHILDREN, RUNS PARALLEL TO THOSE OF
BOSNIAN WAR
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ They joke and laugh and draw
pictures, just like so many children the world over. For a moment,
it's easy to imagine the eight- and nine-year-olds in Hamdija
Pasic's art class are just like other children.
</P>
<P>
   But these children have seen the worst the adult world has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the bloody civil war ended here, many of
Bosnia's youngest victims are still reeling from the horrors they
lived through. Horrors that aid officials worry are now being
repeated on a new wave of innocents from the war-torn Serb province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Pasic and scores of psychologists, psychiatrists, social
workers and teachers struggle to undo the damage the war did to
Bosnia's children, they hope that their work here sheds some light
on the problems sure to arise with Kosovar Albanian refugee
children.
</P>
<P>
   Pasic, a counselor with the Christian aid organization World
Vision, particularly worries
</P>
<P>
   about one little boy. There's one like him in every class, a
withdrawn, troubled child who won't talk about the memories that
haunt him. When he draws a picture of himself, he scribbles over
the face, obliterating the eyes and nose, scratching out the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a refugee, but we're not sure what else happened
to him,'' Pasic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some pretty serious problems, self-esteem issues. We
think there are family problems, but we're not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   So how will the children of Kosovo fare? What ongoing effects
will they feel years from now?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say, experts in Bosnia say. Nationwide statistics
aren't available, though counselors say they're seeing some very
serious problems, including an increase in juvenile crime and
suicide. A few months ago, a Sarajevo 13-year-old committed suicide
with a hand grenade, a method that's become increasingly common
since the war here ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the world will never understand what these children
have suffered,'' said
</P>
<P>
   sociologist Milanka Mikovic. ``Hundreds of thousands lost their
homes, their friends, their
</P>
<P>
   schools, their pets, and all the things that make the lives of
kids what it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikovic studied a group of 500 schoolchildren between the ages
of six and ten in Sarajevo. Twenty-three percent had seen a
relative wounded; 38 percent had seen dead bodies in the street; 46
percent were refugees within the city. Among those children, she
found an unusually high incidence of insomnia, aggressive behavior,
panic attacks, depression and problems in school.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, 45,000 children lost a parent. More than
3,000 lost both parents. And tens of thousands lost relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors like Pasic do what they can for the children. The
World Vision program includes music therapy and group discussions
about things like conflicts and how to resolve them, fears and how
to cope with them, memories and how to understand them. At
HealthNet, another humanitarian aid group working here, counselors
work one-on-one with the more seriously disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to make a prognosis,'' said psychologist
Amira Gradincic. ``What we're
</P>
<P>
   seeing, is it going to be a damaged generation in two years?
It's hard to know. In 15 years, yeah, maybe. They did suffer a lot
and they are still carrying those experiences with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's children are also struggling with the physical
consequences of the war. More
</P>
<P>
   than 35,000 were wounded and approximately 4,000 of those
suffered disfiguring injuries,
</P>
<P>
   according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed a lot of eye problems and more leukemia than we
used to,'' said pediatrician Mira Ademovic. ``But we don't have the
funds to do any kind of systematic analysis to be able to say for
sure, this child's problem is because of the war or we have more of
this type of problem because of the war. We don't even have the
equipment to do analyses to determine nutritional deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ademovic said she has seen many children who's growth was
stunted by poor diet and health care during the war and even three
years later; they're shorter and smaller than
</P>
<P>
   their ages would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, counselors at Moj Prijatelj, which means ``My
Friend'' in Serbo-Croatian,
</P>
<P>
   work with another group of children struggling just to be kids.
</P>
<P>
   The girls in the seven- to 12-year-olds group idolize the Spice
Girls and worship the
</P>
<P>
   Back Street Boys. They come to the center every afternoon to
practice dances they'll do
</P>
<P>
   in a play they're planning.
</P>
<P>
   A video-tape of last year's play, which the children wrote
themselves, seems to start like any other school play. The princess
complains she's bored and one of her friends suggests she have a
new dress made. No, the princess says, she has too many dresses.
Another friend suggests she start another war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We've already fought everyone. I'm bored with war,'' the
princess says, almost hopefully.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the host of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour
With Lou Dobbs.'' What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dobbs, 54, has a degree in economics from Harvard University.
So it came as a surprise to friends and family when he announced
his intention to pursue a career in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He began his broadcast journalism career as a police and fire
reporter for KBLU-AM in Yuma, Ariz., and was a copy editor for the
Los Angeles Times before joining Seattle's KING-TV as a financial
news reporter. While there he caught the eye of CNN, which hired
him in 1980 as the network's chief economics corresponent and
anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Four years later, Dobbs became vice
president and managing editor of ``CNN Financial News,'' and in
1992 was named senior vice president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He was named CNN's executive vice president in May 1995 and was
responsible for the launch of CNNfn _ the first network to launch
simultaneously on TV and on the Internet _ in December 1995. In
addition to being responsible for CNN Financial News, Dobbs anchors
``Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs,'' ``Business Unusual'' and
the weekend program ``Managing With Lou Dobbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel the other day showed the
launching of a Navy ship named the Carole Lombard. I've never heard
of it. Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a Navy vessel, said John Reilly of the Navy
Historical Center in Washington. The Carole Lombard was a Liberty
ship, one of the mass-produced merchant ships built for the Federal
Maritime Commission. It's a common misconception that ``anything
that floats'' during wartime is believed to be a naval vessel,
Reilly said, but Liberty ships had nothing to do with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Carole Lombard, Clark Gable's wife, had been killed in a
1942 plane crash in Nevada while participating in a bond drive for
the Hollywood Victory Committee, Reilly recalled. So, he said,
someone in authority decided it would be appropriate to honor her
memory by naming a Liberty ship after her.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said anyone interested in such vessels can find a wealth
of information in the book ``The Liberty Ships,'' by L.A. Sawyer
and W.H. Mitchell. It can be found at many libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the taxpayers pay the cost of the trip to Europe for the
delegation led by Rev. Jesse Jackson? Was the group flown over on
U.S. military aircraft?
</P>
<P>
   A: No on both counts. The Jackson delegation's trip was
privately funded, said James Gomez of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's
Washington office, and its members flew on commercial aircraft. The
White House press office said that as a privately funded
humanitarian mission, the group would not have been able to use
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that 751 people were contacted for a
nationwide poll. That amounts to about three people per million.
How could that be called accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poll-takers call the process ``probability sampling'' and
say it's the fundamental basis for all survey research. The Gallup
Organization says the basic principle is that a randomly selected,
small percentage of a population of people can represent the
attitudes, opinions or projected behavior of all of the people, if
the sample is selected correctly.
</P>
<P>
   For national Gallup polls, the objective is to present the
opinions of a sample of people which are exactly the same opinions
that would have been obtained had it been possible to interview all
adult Americans in the country. That not being possible, a sample
is taken. If every member of a population has an equal probability
of being selected, then the sample will be representative of the
population, Gallup contends.
</P>
<P>
   The 751 people you refer to is a bit smaller than Gallup's
preferred range. Gallup says the current adult population in the
continental United States is 187 million, and the typical sample
size for a Gallup poll designed to represent this general
population is 1,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us how to get into the lottery for Masters practice
round tickets for next year. My question: Are those of us who were
able to get tickets for this year's practice rounds automatically
in the drawing for next year, or do we have to resubmit?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll be included in next year's drawing, said Glenn
Greenspan at Augusta National Golf Club, so don't submit your name
again. For recorded information about the 2000 Masters and practice
rounds, call 706-667-6700.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something on TV about a study by Harvard or its
medical school proving conclusively the importance to children of
eating breakfast. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest in a series of Harvard research studies basically
affirmed just what parents have been telling their children for
years: Eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with improved
performance in school.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported at a U.S. Department of Agriculture
Symposium on breakfast and learning in children. Dr. Robert
Kleinman, a Harvard Medical School researcher, coordinated a series
of research studies sponsored by the Kellogg Co. ``The body of
evidence is still growing, and it points to the fact that children
who eat breakfast perform better in school,'' Kleinman reported.
``Breakfast positively impacts children's cognitive, emotional and
psychosocial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What to feed them is as simple as cereal, milk and fresh fruit,
the researchers said. Tracy Fox of the American Dietetic
Association said alternatives can be a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich or leftovers from the night before, and they can be eaten
either at home or at school. Whatever the food is, she concludes
that ``breakfast is the most important meal of the day'' for
children.

   Q: It was reported recently that Rep. Bob Barr (D-Ga.) was the
top House member taking privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips
last year. The item said Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and John
Conyers (D-Mich.) were second and third, but gave no details on
their travels. Can you shed some light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported initially by The Hill, the Capitol Hill
newspaper, Barr took 25 privately funded trips last year. Many were
sponsored by conservative organizations and some by news
organizations, such as NBC, that invited him to be interviewed
about the House impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Conyers both spoke frequently at the expense of
African-American interest groups. Waters ranked No. 2 on the list
with 17 trips last year, The Hill reported. Her husband, Sidney
Williams, former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, often joined
Waters on her trips. Essence Communications, on whose board Waters
sits, sent her on a three-day jaunt to the Bahamas for a music
festival empowerment seminar. Conyers came in third with 16 trips.
Most of his travel was for speeches to minority groups, The Hill
said, but he also attended the birthday of Lionel Hampton courtesy
of the jazz musician's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   These were among 790 expense-paid trips taken by members of
Congress last year at the expense of corporations, nonprofit
organizations and other interest groups. While critics contend that
the interest groups involved in such trips get a golden opportunity
to give members of Congress a skewed view of the facts, the
invitees defend the trips as invaluable learning tools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper sports section graded the NFL draft. The text on
each team began with the word ``skinny.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this context, it's slang for ``inside information.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently outlined the years when the new quarters
celebrating the nation's 50 states will be issued. Where can we get
these coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50 state quarters will be produced at both the
Philadelphia and Denver Mints and distributed by the Federal
Reserve through the commercial banking system nationwide, just as
regular circulating quarters are today. Consumers can expect to
receive the state quarters as change when conducting normal
commercial transactions. Some already are appearing routinely in
change, and the Mint says more should be in general circulation by
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint also is selling special collector sets. Call
202-283-2646, the U.S. Mint Customer Care Center, to receive more
information about them. Information also is available on the
Internet at www.usmint.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the people accompanying the Rev. Jesse Jackson on
his Yugoslavia trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delegation members: Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.); John Wyma,
chief of staff for Blagojevich, Washington; the Rev. Dr. Joan Brown
Campbell, National Council of Churches, New York; Bishop Dimitrios
of Xanthos, Greek Orthodox Diocese in America, New York; Dr. Nazir
Uddin Khaja, American Muslim Council, Los Angeles; the Rev. Leonid
Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church in America, New York; Rabbi Steven
Bennet Jacobs, Los Angeles; Father Raymond Glen Helmick, Boston;
Mark Schlansky and Charles McLean, UPLIFT International,
Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Rev. Roy Thomas Lloyd, National Council of Churches,
New York; Bishop Marshall Meadors Jr., United Methodist Church,
Jackson, Miss.; Pastor James Trent Meeks, Salem Baptist Church,
Chicago; Virgalem Tadesse and Marie Nelson, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
Washington; Landrum Bolling, Conflict Management Group, Cambridge,
Mass.; the Rt. Rev. Kodic Mitrophan, Eastern American Diocese,
Sewickley, Pa.; the Rev. Irinej Dobrijevich, Serbian Orthodox
priest, Cleveland; Dr. Zoran Svetislav Hodjera, St. Luke's Serbian
Orthodox Church, Bethesda, Md.; and Obrad Kesic, ICN
Pharmaceutical, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear comments about how hard it is to get
tickets to the Masters golf tournament. I've even heard that some
people bequeath their tickets to heirs as part of their will. Does
it actually happen, or is that just another urban myth?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a ticket-holding spouse dies, the surviving spouse then
can use the ticket, said Glenn Greenspan of Augusta National Golf
Club. But that's it. ``There's no leaving it in wills, no
bequeathing it,'' he added. ``That's a legend like the one saying
we pack ice around azaleas to keep them at their peak. It doesn't
happen.''

BILL OFFERS FREE COLLEGE FOR CAPTURED TEXAS GIS

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas soldier held captive in the Balkans
until his release early this month would be eligible for a free
education at a state-supported university plus a stipend to live
on, under legislation approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senators gave a unanimous thumbs-up Tuesday and sent to the
House the bill that would apply at present only to Army Spc. Steven
Gonzales of Huntsville. If other Texans were to be held captive
during future U.S. military actions, they too would receive
benefits under the bill introduced by Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr.,
D-Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 22, and two other soldiers were captured March 31 in
Macedonia by Serbian ground forces after NATO began a bombing
campaign in an effort to halt Serbian ``ethnic cleansing'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The three were released May 2 to the Rev. Jesse Jackson. While
Gonzales was in captivity, Huntsville was awash in yellow ribbons
in a gesture of support.
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting in the Army in 1996, Gonzales attended Texas
A&AMP;M University in College Station. Shortly after his capture, his
parents said he hoped to return to the university after completing
his military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll turn that yellow ribbon into a full scholarship _
hopefully at Texas A&AMP;M,'' said Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, whose
district includes both Huntsville and the College Station.

PLAY HAS DOS SANTOS SHOOTING TO FOREFRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Paulo Dos Santos sat on the bench for the New England
Revolution in 1996 before being selected by Tampa Bay in the '97
supplemental draft, but his status wasn't any different with the
Mutiny, who had numerous talented midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos hooked up with the Rhode Island Stingrays of the USL
last season, and found success as an attacking midfielder. So Dos
Santos, who moved to Brockton from Cape Verde at age 14, got
another with the Revolution last summer and made the team this year
after a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   He has played four games (156 minutes), including starting
against Colorado May 1. Then last Saturday, Dos Santos scored the
deciding goal in a 1-0 shootout victory against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that I like shootouts, but it's part of the
game,'' said Dos Santos, having practiced his one-on-ones against
backup goalkeeper Jeff Causey the last two weeks. ``Growing up an
an old-fashioned soccer fan, I was never involved with shootouts
but times have changed and it's a new thing here, and you have to
adapt to new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The key was Dos Santos's second touch. ``The goalie usually
waits for your second touch to see what you're going to do,'' he
said. ``He flew out and I thought about going around him but it was
too risky so I kept it simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident that I had a good chance to make it and you
have to keep thinking positive,'' added Dos Santos, who whose goal
gave the Revolution a 3-2 verdict in the shootout and sparked a
celebration. ``I blocked everything out on the shot. It was a great
moment. It was stuff that you always dream of.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been a standout everywhere: Brockton High (an
All-Scholastic), Mount Ida Junior College (his team was unbeaten in
two seasons), and the University of Rhode Island (ranked sixth in
the country his senior year before losing to Virginia in the
opening round of the NCAAs).
</P>
<P>
   Now Dos Santos wants to become a starter with the Revolution.
``It's the coach's decision and all I can do is keep working and be
patient waiting for the opportunity,'' he said, often running six
miles four times a week.
</P>
<P>
   He's never gotten frustrated with trying to make Major League
Soccer. ``That first season with the Revolution was the toughest
part of my career,'' said Dos Santos, his confidence saved by the
Stingrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to take people on when I play, just like playing for
the Stingrays, which allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I've always
thought I could make it in this league. It was just being in the
right situation. I've seen players from the A League and the USL
that I've had good success against and they did well in the MLS,
and I feel I could make it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Walter Zenga (groin), who didn't practice Tuesday
will probably play against Columbus Saturday, as might midfielder
John Harkes (knee) . . . Anthony Latronica, the Boston Bulldogs
keeper, is a spare with the Revolution and will travel to Columbus
. . . The Crew might be without forward Brian McBride, who broke
his cheek bone last weekend.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    In New England, home to Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt, firearms are
big business. But legal assaults and internal squabbles are
inflicting deep wounds on the industry.
 &HT;    The four-star Wigwam Resort outside Phoenix looks out over lush
golf courses and citrus groves to the Arizona desert and the purple
silhouettes of the White Tank Mountains beyond. But the firearms
industry executives who assembled there in February spent precious
little time admiring the scenery.
 &HT;    For the better part of two days, they sequestered themselves
inside a windowless conference room, emerging only to stretch their
legs and grab coffee and sandwiches. They had come on a survival
mission.
 &HT;    Just two weeks before, a New York jury had found that 15 handgun
makers had negligently marketed and distributed their weapons. The
suit was brought on behalf of shooting victims of urban violence.
 &HT;    The verdict sent a ripple of anxiety through the gun industry,
which, collectively, had never before been held legally responsible
for the negligent misuse of its products. And it emboldened
big-city mayors from around the country who were mounting their own
tobacco-style legal assault against firearms makers.
 &HT;    Now, the gun manufacturers were facing the specter of protracted
and expensive court battles that could bleed them dry. And the
stress was showing.
 &HT;    Robert Delfay, head of the Connecticut-based National Shooting
Sports Foundation and the host of the meeting, had been up since
2:30 a.m., preparing. ``I sleep like a baby,'' he recalled saying.
``I wake up every three hours crying.''
 &HT;    The group included some 30 top executives from around the
country, among them 10 from New England's influential ``Gun
Valley,'' the Connecticut River corridor of gun makers stretching
from New Hampshire to Long Island Sound. There were representatives
from O. F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons of North Haven, Conn.; Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co. Inc. of Southport, Conn.; Colt's Manufacturing Co. of Hartford;
and H &AMP; R 1871 Inc. of Gardner, Mass.
 &HT;    From Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass., the biggest
handgun manufacturer in the world, came Ed Shultz, a short and
plain-spoken pragmatist in an industry known for its ideologues.
 &HT;    Dismayed by the fractiousness that has plagued his industry for
years, Shultz studied his colleagues in the conference room,
wondering if they could mend their ways. From Shultz's perspective,
the last few months had not gone well. A legal-strategy meeting in
Tampa in November 1998 had ended with bruised egos and
door-slamming. The industry was riven by personality clashes, turf
battles, and the omnipresent conflicts between moderates and
hard-liners.
 &HT;    As the Phoenix meeting unfolded, the executives did their utmost
to present a unified front. The feuding trade groups were brought
together under the banner of a new organization, the Hunting and
Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation. To be funded by a voluntary
tax of 1 percent of member companies' annual sales, the new group
would coordinate the gun makers' legal and public-relations
counterattack.
 &HT;    One participant, James Garrison, CEO of H &AMP; R 1871 Inc., went so
far as to liken the gathering to the historic first session of the
United Nations in 1947. ``This is a revolutionary thing that
occurred,'' Garrison later recalled saying. ``For the first time, a
fractious industry has been unified. You have the whole industry
coming together.''
 &HT;    But some companies were already complaining that the new
Heritage Foundation board simply preserved the hegemony of old-line
manufacturers such as Colt, Remington, and Sturm, Ruger. Absent
from the board were the California makers of the so-called Saturday
night specials, inexpensive handguns associated with street crime.
Distributors and dealers also felt underrepresented.
 &HT;    And the new policy group had failed to quell disagreements over
strategy, including whether to support instant criminal background
checks of those purchasing firearms at gun shows, favored by
President Clinton.
 &HT;    After eight hours of attempted peace-making, weary gun
executives retired poolside for dinner, where a magician tried to
distract them with rope, coin and card tricks. In an interview
afterward, Delfay, the newly appointed head of the Heritage group,
fantasized about what the future might bring: ``I wish we could
make our problems go away like that magician made that ace of
spades disappear.''
 &HT;    But the gun makers' troubles, it seems, won't vanish by mere
sleight of hand; they require a more potent brand of alchemy.
 &HT;    High-profile gun incidents _ from the attempted assassinations
of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to school
shootings such as those in Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. _
provide fuel for the political debate.
 &HT;    For decades, major battles in the gun wars were waged in
legislative arenas. But late last year, frustrated by their lack of
progress and by 35,000 gun-related deaths per year, gun-control
proponents and mayors from around the country opened a potent new
front: the courts.
 &HT;    The first suits were filed in November by New Orleans and
Chicago. Both suits are testing some exotic legal theories, seeking
to hold the entire gun industry responsible for the costs to
society incurred by criminal or accidental misuse of guns.
 &HT;    The New Orleans suit, claiming that gun makers have violated a
Louisiana product-liability law by selling goods that are
``unreasonably dangerous,'' charges that 15 gun makers negligently
withheld safety features from their weapons.
 &HT;    The suit, bankrolled by New Orleans attorney Wendell Gauthier
and other lawyers from the legal war against Big Tobacco, employs
the tactics of lawsuits filed by states seeking compensation for
the public cost of smoking-related illnesses.
 &HT;    The Chicago suit alleges that gun makers, distributors and
suburban dealers oversupply the market with handguns, knowing that
they will be used in urban crimes. The suit cites a recent
undercover operation in which police, posing as motorcycle hoods,
street-gang members and mercenaries, bought 171 guns from suburban
dealers in the Chicago area and boasted that they would use them to
commit crimes in Chicago.
 &HT;    One example cites an undercover officer who bragged that the gun
would be used for a street shooting; the salesman allegedly
recommended a specific bullet for the job _ a bullet that wouldn't
go through the target ``and hit a little girl on the next block.''
 &HT;    So far, six cities _ Bridgeport, Connecticut, Miami-Dade County,
Atlanta and Cleveland, in addition to New Orleans and Chicago _
have filed suit. A number of others, including Newark and Boston,
have announced their intentions to board the legal bandwagon.
 &HT;    On Feb. 11 the legal picture got even bleaker for the gun
industry. That was the day a federal jury in Brooklyn returned a
$560,000 verdict in favor of Steven Fox, a 19-year-old man who had
survived an accidental shooting on a New York City street corner.
He had been joined by relatives of six homicide victims in a
class-action suit filed against 25 gun manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    The Brooklyn case, filed in the mid-1990s, marked the first time
that a jury had found gun makers legally responsible for the misuse
of their products. It was also the first time that a whistle-blower
_ former Smith &AMP; Wesson senior vice president Robert Hass _ had
testified against an employer.
 &HT;    In a strategy the Chicago suit mirrors, the plaintiffs argued
that gun makers pumped weapons into states with permissive gun
laws, knowing the guns would find their way into the hands of urban
criminals.
 &HT;    Firearms executives smelled trouble when the case was assigned,
at the request of the plaintiffs' lawyer, to a liberal activist
judge. But they were even more stunned by the jury's verdict.
 &HT;    Fifteen of the 25 companies, including Colt and Beretta, were
found liable. The popular press characterized the decision as a
crushing defeat for the gun industry. But it was not a total loss:
Ten of the companies, including Smith &AMP; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co., were cleared, and only three of the companies had monetary
damages levied against them.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, damage had been done. The gun industry no longer
seemed quite so invincible.
 &HT;    The litigation could not have come at a worse moment. With $2
billion in annual sales, the gun industry has nothing like the deep
pockets of the tobacco industry, and some insiders predict a wave
of bankruptcies if the legal battles are prolonged.
 &HT;    The titans of the trade, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Smith &AMP; Wesson,
each sell about $140 million worth of firearms each year. That's
less than two days' cigarette sales by Philip Morris Co. And
production of guns had dropped to 3.4 million in 1997, down from a
peak of 5.2 million in 1993, though it rebounded in 1998.
 &HT;    Whether or not the gun manufacturers begin to lose big in court,
the executives in Gun Valley are outraged by the incipient legal
tidal wave. They defiantly reject the notion that they could, or
should, do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or make
their products safer.
 &HT;    ``Do you really think I wake up in the morning and say, `Oh,
good, let's make guns so that kids can go out on the street and
shoot people'?'' demands Robin Sharpless, a vice president of H &AMP; R
1871 Inc., one of the nation's largest manufacturers of shotguns
and a defendant in the Chicago suit.
 &HT;    The Gardner, Mass.-based company, which employs 233 people, was
the first gun maker in the United States to allow electronic access
to its records. But the company is also known for its donation of
shotguns to hunter-education programs, a move that has been
criticized by gun-control groups as nothing more than a marketing
ploy to get kids hooked on guns. Sharpless counters that a ``wanton
process of demonization is underway.''
 &HT;    In North Haven, Conn., at the factory of shotgun manufacturer
O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the frustration is equally palpable. ``We
want people to use our products safely,'' says Georgia Nichols,
Mossberg's vice president and general counsel, smacking her desk to
emphasize the point. ``We want to end crime and violence. We're
just like the business next door.''
 &HT;    Nichols is the president of the industry trade association the
American Shooting Sports Council, and her company was the second
firearms manufacturer in the United States to ship locking devices
with its guns. Her office is adorned with shotguns and rifles,
plaques from gun clubs, bumper stickers and signs: ``Save the
Male'' and ``I love animals. They're delicious!''
 &HT;    Nichols knows that the battles ahead will be fought not only in
the court of law but also in the court of public opinion. Where in
the popular press, she asks, are news stories about people who have
used their guns successfully for self-defense?
 &HT;    ``There are some wonderful stories about guns,'' says Nichols,
pausing midsentence to swallow. Anxious not to be misunderstood,
she adds: ``Wonderful in that lives have been saved.''
 &HT;    ``It's a pity,'' she says, ``those stories are never told.''
 &HT;    Seven months after President Clinton's 1997 State of the Union
address, in which he embraced the idea of legislation that would
mandate the sale of firearms with child safety locks, Shultz
announced that Smith &AMP; Wesson would voluntarily provide trigger
locks with all its guns. Shultz decided to move before Congress
beat him to the punch.
 &HT;    Every year, an estimated 200 children between the ages of 1 and
14 are accidentally killed by guns. Approximately the same number
of children each year die in bicycle accidents.
 &HT;    But the recent Colorado school shooting has the potential to
cause a major shift in the American gun debate. With both the NRA
and the firearms industry again on the defensive, gun-control
proponents are re-energized like never before.
 &HT;    At Smith &AMP; Wesson, Shultz is bracing for a protracted war.
``It's going to be a long, tough deal,'' he says of the looming
lawsuits.

country, among them 10 from New England's influential ``Gun
Valley,'' the Connecticut River corridor of gun makers stretching
from New Hampshire to Long Island Sound. There were representatives
from O. F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons of North Haven, Conn.; Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co. Inc. of Southport, Conn.; Colt's Manufacturing Co. of Hartford;
and H &AMP; R 1871 Inc. of Gardner, Mass.
 &HT;    From Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass., the biggest
handgun manufacturer in the world, came Ed Shultz, a short and
plain-spoken pragmatist in an industry known for its ideologues.
 &HT;    Dismayed by the fractiousness that has plagued his industry for
years, Shultz studied his colleagues in the conference room,
wondering if they could mend their ways. From Shultz's perspective,
the last few months had not gone well. A legal-strategy meeting in
Tampa in November 1998 had ended with bruised egos and
door-slamming. The industry was riven by personality clashes, turf
battles, and the omnipresent conflicts between moderates and
hard-liners.
 &HT;    As the Phoenix meeting unfolded, the executives did their utmost
to present a unified front. The feuding trade groups were brought
together under the banner of a new organization, the Hunting and
Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation. To be funded by a voluntary
tax of 1 percent of member companies' annual sales, the new group
would coordinate the gun makers' legal and public-relations
counterattack.
 &HT;    One participant, James Garrison, CEO of H &AMP; R 1871 Inc., went so
far as to liken the gathering to the historic first session of the
United Nations in 1947. ``This is a revolutionary thing that
occurred,'' Garrison later recalled saying. ``For the first time, a
fractious industry has been unified. You have the whole industry
coming together.''
 &HT;    But some companies were already complaining that the new
Heritage Foundation board simply preserved the hegemony of old-line
manufacturers such as Colt, Remington, and Sturm, Ruger. Absent
from the board were the California makers of the so-called Saturday
night specials, inexpensive handguns associated with street crime.
Distributors and dealers also felt underrepresented.
 &HT;    And the new policy group had failed to quell disagreements over
strategy, including whether to support instant criminal background
checks of those purchasing firearms at gun shows, favored by
President Clinton.
 &HT;    After eight hours of attempted peace-making, weary gun
executives retired poolside for dinner, where a magician tried to
distract them with rope, coin and card tricks. In an interview
afterward, Delfay, the newly appointed head of the Heritage group,
fantasized about what the future might bring: ``I wish we could
make our problems go away like that magician made that ace of
spades disappear.''
 &HT;    But the gun makers' troubles, it seems, won't vanish by mere
sleight of hand; they require a more potent brand of alchemy.
 &HT;    High-profile gun incidents _ from the attempted assassinations
of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to school
shootings such as those in Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. _
provide fuel for the political debate.
 &HT;    For decades, major battles in the gun wars were waged in
legislative arenas. But late last year, frustrated by their lack of
progress and by 35,000 gun-related deaths per year, gun-control
proponents and mayors from around the country opened a potent new
front: the courts.
 &HT;    The first suits were filed in November by New Orleans and
Chicago. Both suits are testing some exotic legal theories, seeking
to hold the entire gun industry responsible for the costs to
society incurred by criminal or accidental misuse of guns.
 &HT;    The New Orleans suit, claiming that gun makers have violated a
Louisiana product-liability law by selling goods that are
``unreasonably dangerous,'' charges that 15 gun makers negligently
withheld safety features from their weapons.
 &HT;    The suit, bankrolled by New Orleans attorney Wendell Gauthier
and other lawyers from the legal war against Big Tobacco, employs
the tactics of lawsuits filed by states seeking compensation for
the public cost of smoking-related illnesses.
 &HT;    The Chicago suit alleges that gun makers, distributors and
suburban dealers oversupply the market with handguns, knowing that
they will be used in urban crimes. The suit cites a recent
undercover operation in which police, posing as motorcycle hoods,
street-gang members and mercenaries, bought 171 guns from suburban
dealers in the Chicago area and boasted that they would use them to
commit crimes in Chicago.
 &HT;    One example cites an undercover officer who bragged that the gun
would be used for a street shooting; the salesman allegedly
recommended a specific bullet for the job _ a bullet that wouldn't
go through the target ``and hit a little girl on the next block.''
 &HT;    So far, six cities _ Bridgeport, Connecticut, Miami-Dade County,
Atlanta and Cleveland, in addition to New Orleans and Chicago _
have filed suit. A number of others, including Newark and Boston,
have announced their intentions to board the legal bandwagon.
 &HT;    On Feb. 11 the legal picture got even bleaker for the gun
industry. That was the day a federal jury in Brooklyn returned a
$560,000 verdict in favor of Steven Fox, a 19-year-old man who had
survived an accidental shooting on a New York City street corner.
He had been joined by relatives of six homicide victims in a
class-action suit filed against 25 gun manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    The Brooklyn case, filed in the mid-1990s, marked the first time
that a jury had found gun makers legally responsible for the misuse
of their products. It was also the first time that a whistle-blower
_ former Smith &AMP; Wesson senior vice president Robert Hass _ had
testified against an employer.
 &HT;    In a strategy the Chicago suit mirrors, the plaintiffs argued
that gun makers pumped weapons into states with permissive gun
laws, knowing the guns would find their way into the hands of urban
criminals.
 &HT;    Firearms executives smelled trouble when the case was assigned,
at the request of the plaintiffs' lawyer, to a liberal activist
judge. But they were even more stunned by the jury's verdict.
 &HT;    Fifteen of the 25 companies, including Colt and Beretta, were
found liable. The popular press characterized the decision as a
crushing defeat for the gun industry. But it was not a total loss:
Ten of the companies, including Smith &AMP; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co., were cleared, and only three of the companies had monetary
damages levied against them.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, damage had been done. The gun industry no longer
seemed quite so invincible.
 &HT;    The litigation could not have come at a worse moment. With $2
billion in annual sales, the gun industry has nothing like the deep
pockets of the tobacco industry, and some insiders predict a wave
of bankruptcies if the legal battles are prolonged.
 &HT;    The titans of the trade, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Smith &AMP; Wesson,
each sell about $140 million worth of firearms each year. That's
less than two days' cigarette sales by Philip Morris Co. And
production of guns had dropped to 3.4 million in 1997, down from a
peak of 5.2 million in 1993, though it rebounded in 1998.
 &HT;    Whether or not the gun manufacturers begin to lose big in court,
the executives in Gun Valley are outraged by the incipient legal
tidal wave. They defiantly reject the notion that they could, or
should, do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or make
their products safer.
 &HT;    ``Do you really think I wake up in the morning and say, `Oh,
good, let's make guns so that kids can go out on the street and
shoot people'?'' demands Robin Sharpless, a vice president of H &AMP; R
1871 Inc., one of the nation's largest manufacturers of shotguns
and a defendant in the Chicago suit.
 &HT;    The Gardner, Mass.-based company, which employs 233 people, was
the first gun maker in the United States to allow electronic access
to its records. But the company is also known for its donation of
shotguns to hunter-education programs, a move that has been
criticized by gun-control groups as nothing more than a marketing
ploy to get kids hooked on guns. Sharpless counters that a ``wanton
process of demonization is underway.''
 &HT;    In North Haven, Conn., at the factory of shotgun manufacturer
O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the frustration is equally palpable. ``We
want people to use our products safely,'' says Georgia Nichols,
Mossberg's vice president and general counsel, smacking her desk to
emphasize the point. ``We want to end crime and violence. We're
just like the business next door.''
 &HT;    Nichols is the president of the industry trade association the
American Shooting Sports Council, and her company was the second
firearms manufacturer in the United States to ship locking devices
with its guns. Her office is adorned with shotguns and rifles,
plaques from gun clubs, bumper stickers and signs: ``Save the
Male'' and ``I love animals. They're delicious!''
 &HT;    Nichols knows that the battles ahead will be fought not only in
the court of law but also in the court of public opinion. Where in
the popular press, she asks, are news stories about people who have
used their guns successfully for self-defense?
 &HT;    ``There are some wonderful stories about guns,'' says Nichols,
pausing midsentence to swallow. Anxious not to be misunderstood,
she adds: ``Wonderful in that lives have been saved.''
 &HT;    ``It's a pity,'' she says, ``those stories are never told.''
 &HT;    Seven months after President Clinton's 1997 State of the Union
address, in which he embraced the idea of legislation that would
mandate the sale of firearms with child safety locks, Shultz
announced that Smith &AMP; Wesson would voluntarily provide trigger
locks with all its guns. Shultz decided to move before Congress
beat him to the punch.
 &HT;    Every year, an estimated 200 children between the ages of 1 and
14 are accidentally killed by guns. Approximately the same number
of children each year die in bicycle accidents.
 &HT;    But the recent Colorado school shooting has the potential to
cause a major shift in the American gun debate. With both the NRA
and the firearms industry again on the defensive, gun-control
proponents are re-energized like never before.
 &HT;    At Smith &AMP; Wesson, Shultz is bracing for a protracted war.
``It's going to be a long, tough deal,'' he says of the looming
lawsuits.

 By JILL ABRAMSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The vice president stood before 40 wealthy Democrats in the
Fifth Avenue palazzo of the Lazard Freres executive Steven Rattner,
a stunning place with marble columns and a view over the
Metropolitan Museum.
 &HT;    The guests, bathed in candlelight, nibbled at apple crisp and
whipped cream. To be here, each had promised to raise at least
$35,000 for Al Gore's presidential quest.
 &HT;    Gore began by recognizing some of the more luminous luminaries
in the room _ Eugene Ludwig, the former comptroller of the
Currency; Richard Gardner, former ambassador to Spain and Italy;
and a raft of Wall Street heavyweights.
 &HT;    Then it was time for a joke: the one Gore tells at every
fund-raiser, about an 8-year-old boy in Minnesota who wrote Gore a
sort of fan letter that called him ``the greatest vice president of
my time.'' There was a polite titter.
 &HT;    As Gore moved on to his studiously rehearsed vision for the 21st
century, the overwhelming impression was of a marble candidate in a
marble setting.
 &HT;    So far in this young campaign, the issues that Gore loves _ from
his ``practical idealism'' to his ``electronic-privacy bill of
rights'' _ have lacked a certain electricity.
 &HT;    But that is not to say that the Gore 2000 effort is a listless
one. To the contrary, the candidate may still seem like the robot
caricature of a thousand late-night monologues, but his campaign's
fund-raising calls to mind a dizzyingly effective machine.
 &HT;    In the first three months of 1999 alone, Gore fund-raisers piled
up $8.9 million in contributions - easily a record, and a sum that
has scared off all challengers for the Democratic nomination except
Bill Bradley.
 &HT;    Between now and the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in
August 2000, Gore intends to raise a staggering $55 million. The
soul of this fund-raising machine is the candidate himself, with
his vast and assiduously built network of supporters stretching
from his native Tennessee to Wall Street and west to Silicon Valley
and Hollywood, his reputation as an outstanding bottom-line
salesman and his plain old tirelessness.
 &HT;    Gore will spend countless hours on the
free-range-chicken-and-Chardonnay circuit in the months ahead,
rolling out a green carpet leading (he hopes) straight to the
Democratic nomination.
 &HT;    A massive early war chest is more important in this election
than ever before because New York and California, both key,
expensive states, now have early primaries. Gore's facility with
total-immersion fund-raising, then, may be his greatest strength.
 &HT;    Yet it may also prove to be his greatest vulnerability. There is
the danger that Gore will ultimately focus too much on
fund-raising, because he's simply so good at it, instead of solving
his campaign's weaknesses _ such as finding the issues and the
message that broad swaths of voters can really get excited about.
 &HT;    If he does not do this, and thus move the story of his campaign
away from fund-raising, the defining impression left in the minds
of the electorate could simply be his ability to charm the
deep-pockets crowd. That could be disastrous at a moment when his
standing in the polls is anemic and campaign-finance reform is
popular.
 &HT;    Gore's opponents are no doubt aware of this potential weakness.
Before it's all over, there will almost certainly be attack ads
from foes recalling his role in the 1996 election as the Democratic
Party's ``solicitor in chief,'' cold-calling donors for cash, not
to mention his star turn with a chorus line of Buddhist nuns in
saffron robes.
 &HT;    ``Political money is the wrong game to monopolize in the year
2000,'' says Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance-reform advocate.
``That's particularly true for Gore,'' Wertheimer adds, because of
the 1996 scandals. ``By raising so much money, Gore has become
emblematic of the Washington money culture that the American people
find repugnant,'' Wertheimer continues. ``It's a high-risk
strategy.''
 &HT;    Even so, for Gore or any other candidate these days,
fund-raising remains a necessity, not an option. Gore declined to
speak with me on the record about fund-raising, but did allow me,
as his campaign kicked into high gear, to tag along and get a
firsthand look at events that are generally off-limits to the
press.
 &HT;    The day that ended at chez Rattner was a typical jumble of
official appearances sandwiched between unofficial schmooze
sessions with fat cats. It began in the Bronx at the Helen Keller
Elementary School in the heart of the Co-op City housing
development, where Gore read aloud to a second-grader dressed in a
neat uniform, who confided that she wants his job someday.
 &HT;    Then the motorcade rushed him to a private dining room at the
Four Seasons, where he joined rich Manhattan executives for a feast
of black bass with squid-ink risotto. In the afternoon, there were
private chats with other prominent New York Democrats.
 &HT;    For cocktails, Gore met with a group of African-American
business leaders who have each pledged to raise $5,000 for the
campaign, at an apartment on upper Park Avenue. Dinner, with a
$10,000-a-head bounty, was with a group of executives from the
communications industry at the trendy East Side restaurant Daniel.
And finally, dessert at Rattner's.
 &HT;    The day's take: an impressive $1.5 million.
 &HT;    What is Gore's appeal? David Geffen, sitting in his $47.5
million, nine-acre Beverly Hills estate, tells me that he finds
fund-raising ``time-consuming and irritating.'' But he intends to
spend a lot of time doing it for Gore.
 &HT;    ``I view this as an important election,'' says the Hollywood
mogul, clad in a white polo shirt, jeans and white sneakers.
``We're going to work very hard to elect Gore and replace the most
radical House and Senate in history.''
 &HT;    Seated next to Geffen is Andy Spahn, formerly Gary Hart's
national finance director and now a fund-raising and political
adviser to Geffen and his Dreamworks partners, Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg. Geffen and Spahn say they will very likely hold
a dinner for Gore later in the campaign, much like the intimate
1996 meals Bill Clinton shared with Geffen and 15 or so Hollywood
execs, where $2 million was raised.
 &HT;    ``My biggest worry about the vice president between now and the
election is that he become the best communicator he can be,''
Geffen says. He worries that Gore does not have the sparkle that
his boss transmits so effortlessly. Some of Gore's other Hollywood
supporters voice the same concern. Famous directors such as
Spielberg and Rob Reiner are eager to race to Washington to give
their man some emergency speech coaching.
 &HT;    ``He's really funny, but he has a hard time letting his natural
personality emerge,'' frets Reiner, whose film ``An American
President,'' about a picture-perfect commander in chief, was made
with research help from Gore's staff.
 &HT;    The key to fund-raising is one-to-one networking, and Gore has
proven extremely effective at tapping connections from every phase
of his life. In Hollywood, for example, his longtime ambassador is
John Cooke, a Disney executive, who expects Gore's California
effort to raise millions. While Bradley has longstanding
friendships in Hollywood and is close to the Disney chairman,
Michael Eisner, as well as to Barry Diller, Gore has sewn up the
team from Dreamworks.
 &HT;    Farther up the coast are the executives in the high-tech
industry who have dubbed themselves the Gore Techs. During the
second Clinton-Gore inauguration, the vice president set aside two
hours to meet with a dozen executives from Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The group, which included the high-tech venture capitalist John
Doerr, the Intuit chairman Scott Cook and the Marimba software
founder Kim Polese, were wowed by Gore's fluency with the New
Economy.
 &HT;    ``He really gets it,'' says Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite,
who has attended several Gore Tech meetings and has kicked in
$1,000 to Gore.
 &HT;    At a Gore fund-raiser last month at the Woodside, Calif.,
mansion of Janina Pawlowski, co-founder of E-Loan, his Silicon
Valley supporters raised $400,000 for their candidate.
 &HT;    Besides the nice turnout and breathtaking view, Gore had a rare
loose public moment. He and Tipper bopped with a band that included
two former members of the Grateful Dead; Tipper even played the
bongos. Then they repaired to dinner at Doerr's house with 30
Democratic donors, who raised $10,000 apiece.
 &HT;    John Tyson, an international business investor, is even raising
money from Gore's class at Harvard, where he was one of the future
vice president's roommates. He recalls long discussions with Gore
about Vietnam and civil rights as they lay in their bunk beds.
 &HT;    ``I always knew he'd be president,'' Tyson says. ``He does well
in an environment where there is a lot of pressure.'' At a recent
gala in Washington, Tyson solicited $20,000 from the class of '69,
and is now expanding his efforts to other classes.
 &HT;    Gore's prowess at the money game is one of the things that
attracted Bill Clinton in 1992. As magnetic as Clinton was on the
fund-raising circuit, he always hated actually asking for money.
Gore, in contrast, is known as the best ``closer'' in the business,
someone who can get contributors to commit to a specific amount and
write their checks on the spot.
 &HT;    When he was a senator, his family kept an apartment on Capitol
Hill that he used as a fund-raising safe house, where he could make
calls between votes. And he did not disappoint Clinton, helping
raise millions after he joined the ticket in 1992 and a staggering
$40 million for the party in 1996.
 &HT;    Add to the Gore network, then, some of Clinton's cash
constituencies. One is Wall Street, although there is some
lingering doubt over the vice president's environmentalism, which
some deem as antibusiness. Gore has strategically set his sights on
some of the party's younger financial powers _ such as his recent
host, Rattner.
 &HT;    During the 1996 campaign, he orchestrated a seat next to Rattner
at a fund-raising reception and subsequently called him to seek his
counsel on economic issues. When it came time to gear up the 2000
fund-raising effort, Rattner signed on to play his part in a
process that even he concedes ``could not possibly be what
Jefferson had in mind.''
 &HT;    While politicians pay lip service to the need for Congress to
pass campaign-finance reform, the bottom line is that in the
absence of such reforms, they will play by the rules of the game as
they exist, and play with a vengeance. Skyrocketing campaign costs
have sparked the fund-raising equivalent of a nuclear arms race,
and the 2000 election will be the most money-infused in history.
 &HT;    George W. Bush raised $7.6 million in the first three months of
1999, while Bradley managed to pull in a respectable $4.3 million.
 &HT;    Post-Watergate election-law reforms aside, the campaign-finance
system has become shot through with loopholes. Laws limiting
individuals to giving $1,000 during the primaries simply mean an
emphasis on rounding up donors who have lots of friends who can
also write $1,000 checks.
 &HT;    Candidates who accept federal matching funds must limit their
spending to $33.5 million in the primaries, but there are legal
ways to skirt the rules. Money spent on fund-raising and on legal
and accounting costs does not count toward the limit, and
candidates are allowed to establish separate funds for complying
with the arcane and complex federal election laws.
 &HT;    In the general election, there is a much bigger loophole to
exploit. Although the nominees don't raise any more private money
and receive $70 million in public funds for the general election,
parties can raise ``soft money'' _ unrestricted donations from
unions, wealthy individuals and corporations _ to help elect their
candidates. The two parties combined raised more than $250 million
in such contributions in 1996 _ and it was in the soft-money arena
that most of the campaign fund-raising abuses occurred.
 &HT;    The ghosts of past scandals loom over Gore's current efforts
more than anyone else's. ``There will be heightened scrutiny after
1996,'' says Lyn Utrecht, outside counsel to the Gore campaign. So
the vice president's finance and legal advisers have created an
unusually onerous set of fund-raising rules.
 &HT;    First and foremost, Gore will not personally solicit donors with
telephone calls, a practice he stopped in 1997. He has also vowed
not to use his official residence for ticketed fund-raising events.
 &HT;    Campaign lawyers have held more than 300 briefings on election
law for volunteer solicitors, and the campaign is scrutinizing the
backgrounds of all solicitors and any checks drawn on foreign bank
accounts. Campaign workers are told to follow even the smallest
rules, right down to making sure all solicitation letters go out on
campaign stationery.
 &HT;    Still, concedes Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, ``No
system is going to be perfect.'' In fact, there have already been a
few glitches. Some suspicious donations that came in money orders
may be returned. And the 850,000 pieces of direct mail sent out by
the campaign in February went to some donors whose checks the
campaign would not want.
 &HT;    Among the recipients: Johnny Chung, the California donor who
recently told federal investigators that some of the $400,000 he
had contributed to Democrats (since returned) came from the Chinese
military.
 &HT;    Some of Gore's longtime fund-raisers are clearly irritated with
the ``by the book'' mentality. A Miami solicitor complained that he
had to get the text of his thank-you notes to donors approved by
Washington. A solicitor in Los Angeles griped about being inactive
while a background check was run: ``I could have raised $100,000 in
those two weeks.''
 &HT;    But perhaps most critically, Gore, to maintain his front-runner
status, may concentrate too much on the money. That's what Gary
Koops thinks is happening, and his opinion is worth a listen. Now a
Washington public-relations consultant, Koops was an adviser to
Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996 _ when Gramm raised $8 million in the first
three months of 1995, setting a record that Gore has just beaten.
 &HT;    Gramm too was a powerful fund-raiser, and he didn't even make it
to the primaries. As Koops puts it: ``'We've got the money' isn't a
good campaign message.''

 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Dieu-Donni Bima Bima is a nice young man with a gentle manner.
With becoming modesty, he describes how the chopped-up bodies of
three gorillas have come to be smoking over a fire outside his hut.
 &HT;    ``I shot the big male as it charged me. The baby was on the
mother's back, and when she turned around to look at me the baby
did, too.'' He does an imitation of a tiny scrunched face peering
at him.
 &HT;    ``I shot her in the face, and the bullet went through it too _
bouf! One bullet, two gorillas!'' he concludes triumphantly.
 &HT;    As a horrified listener clutches his chest, he laughs. ``Why do
you want to protect gorillas? They're just animals.''
 &HT;    Deep in Central Africa, the great humanlike apes _ gorillas and
chimpanzees _ are rapidly being wiped out by hunters. Bima Bima
will make about $60 for each adult gorilla, and would get nearly as
much for a full-grown chimpanzee. Chimps with their heads and hands
removed are sold as gorilla meat.
 &HT;    Much as that distresses conservationists, the need to stop the
hunting has suddenly taken on more urgency in the West. In January,
scientists announced that HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, came
from the subspecies of chimpanzee found here, Pan troglodytes
troglodytes.
 &HT;    They believe it passed into humans when hunters nicked
themselves butchering their kill or ate raw meat. Since the chimps
don't seem to get sick from it, they may be the key to a cure. It's
crucial that they be kept alive and are studied _ but that's not
the fate they're headed for now.
 &HT;    Until recently, the great rain forest stretching from Nigeria to
Rwanda belonged largely to Pygmies hunting with poisoned arrows.
Nibbling at the forest's edges, they posed no more threat to the
species within than the plains Indians did to the vast American
bison herds. But logging roads, shotguns and trucks are doing what
the horse, Winchester and railroad did to the buffalo.
 &HT;    As loggers extend a spider web of roads into the rain forest,
hunters are moving down them, snaring or shooting anything that
moves. There may be fewer than 120,000 troglodytes chimpanzees
left, and thousands are killed each year. They reproduce more
slowly than humans, one baby every four years.
 &HT;    Dr. Beatrice H. Hahn led a team from the University of Alabama
at Birmingham that proved the link between AIDS and chimps.
Research has established that the pandemic form of HIV-1 probably
began to spread in humans in the early 1940s. Hahn showed that it
came from the simian immunode-ficiency virus in troglodytes chimps.
 &HT;    What researchers most want to know is why the simian virus
doesn't kill the host apes. To that end, they need to know how
widespread infection is in the wild, which they might be able to
determine from stool samples gathered from the forest floor. And
they need blood samples drawn from wild animals.
 &HT;    ``These chimps are information we need,'' says Hahn, who has
become an antihunting campaigner. ``Killing them for the pot is
like burning a library full of books you haven't read yet.''
 &HT;    Environmentalists once thought most apes were killed in attempts
to steal their babies for the illegal pet trade. But that's wrong _
surviving babies are just extra cash for hunters supplying the
growing fad for ``bush meat'' on the tables of the elite in
Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, the Central African Republic and other
countries.
 &HT;    Hunting endangered species is illegal, of course, but the law is
rarely enforced here. The bush-meat market in Yaounde, Cameroon's
capital, is no secret. It's a 500-foot stretch of sidewalk only a
few blocks from the presidential offices and the $200-a-night
Hilton Hotel.
 &HT;    Vendors desultorily wave whisks over tables piled high with
smoked and fresh monkeys, duikers (tiny antelopes), bush pigs and
skinned snakes. Just behind them, watched over by rough-looking
men, are piles from which long arm bones protrude, obviously those
of chimpanzees and gorillas. At the fetish stalls, you can buy
chimpanzee hands, gorilla skulls, round slices of elephant trunk or
the bright red tails of endangered gray parrots.
 &HT;    ``If your child is weak and you want to make him big and strong,
you feed him gorilla meat,'' says Elie Bayoi, a vendor. ``Or you
can scrape the shoulder bone into water and bathe him in that. If
you have a broken bone, you heat a chimpanzee skull and press it
against the break.''
 &HT;    Chimpanzee hands cure stomach pains, he adds. Elephant skin
repels garden pests. The market isn't hidden, but the vendors are
touchy. Even the chatty Bayoi refuses to let his stall be
photographed; other vendors have mobbed photographers.
 &HT;    Karl Ammann is a Swiss hotelier who fell in love with the apes
he photographed while running luxury camps in Africa. He has since
become the chief nemesis of the bush-meat trade, and persona non
grata to governments whose indifference he exposes. He has spent
years photographing the trade, sometimes with concealed cameras.
 &HT;    ``The big conservation groups say only poor Pygmies eat bush
meat, but look at these customers,'' he says on a walk through the
market. ``Look how they're dressed _ they're middle class. People
don't want beef or chicken anymore _ they call it 'white man's
meat.' I know a woman who has to take chimpanzee meat to her family
whenever she goes home. You can order a gorilla for Christmas the
same way I'd order a turkey.''
 &HT;    To prove the point to a German television crew, he recently
bought two heads: a chimp's and a pig's. The chimp was $8, the
bigger, meatier pig only $5. Two gorilla arms cost $10, an equal
weight of beef less than $4. Ammann has a teen-age chimp at his
Kenya home, and even on a visit to the tiny Yaounde zoo, it's clear
that he is drawn to apes. He makes ooh-ooh noises and puts his head
in the hands they stretch through the bars to groom him.
 &HT;    ``They have feelings and emotions,'' he says afterward, turning
angry. ``A wounded chimp will beg for its life. They're like
retarded children, and we don't eat THEM. Where do we draw the
line?''
 &HT;    The DNA of chimpanzees is 98.5 percent the same as that of
humans, and Ammann calls eating them ``98.5 percent cannibalism.''
 &HT;    More mainstream conservationists have asked him to temper his
language, saying it smacks of ``cultural imperialism.'' One is
Steve Gartlan, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's Cameroon
office. Vivid photographs of dead apes and reminders of their human
qualities are ``emotionally understandable but biologically
unsound'' since whole ecosystems need protection, he argued in a
long critique of one of Ammann's articles. He also expressed
sympathy for the hunters, saying, ``We share an even larger
percentage of our genes _ 100 percent _ with the rural poor.''
 &HT;    At the urging of the fund, Cameroon has designated three new
parks, though Ammann dismisses them as mere ``lines on paper.''
According to a report provided on condition of anonymity by a
scientist working in the 3,300-square-mile Dja Reserve in southwest
Cameroon, about 100 hunters are camped inside. ``Despite the
European conservation money poured into the region,'' it says,
``unique species are being wiped out at an alarming rate.''
 &HT;    The explosion in bush-meat hunting is being propelled by two
converging forces: logging and corruption. As prices for coffee,
cocoa and oil have fallen, timber exports have soared. The roads
bulldozed to reach the 800-year-old hardwoods are wider and
smoother than the dirt national highways.
 &HT;    Rather than pay to ship beef or pork to the jungle dormitory
towns where their workers live, the logging companies encourage
hunting. The hundreds of log trucks headed for the coast become a
bush-meat caravan. Bleeding bags of meat can be spotted behind the
cabs; the drivers get a cut.
 &HT;    The political will to stop the hunting simply does not exist.
Hunters rent their guns from army and police officers; there are
roadblocks everywhere where police could seize the meat, but they
let anyone through for a $2 bribe; government officials serve bush
meat at banquets.
 &HT;    Transparency International, a not-for-profit corruption-fighting
group, recently rated Cameroon the most corrupt country of the 85
it surveyed. Next-door, Nigeria, famous for corruption, was only
No. 81.
 &HT;    Cameroonians say the problem is just getting worse. ``When I
came here in 1988, it was forbidden to kill animals,'' says Ndzana
Ndzana, an environmental official whose territory includes the
Gabon camp. ``But we had guns then. We had vehicles. We had
bullets. Now, with the economic crisis, the central government
gives us nothing. We can't do our jobs.'' Bima Bima, the hunter,
has agreed to join a project that Ammann wants to start. They hope
to find a group of gorillas they can protect and habituate to
humans, so they can prove that ``gorilla tourism,'' like that which
existed in Uganda until recently, is profitable.
 &HT;    Joseph Melloh, the first hunter Ammann converted to his cause,
will be in charge. For him, it's business. ``A gorilla is still
meat _ it has no soul,'' he says. ``But now I know that if you kill
a gorilla, you use it once. But if you keep it for 30 years, and
bring people to see it, you get more money. And you don't have to
carry the firewood to smoke it.''
 &HT;    Changing Africans' feelings about eating apes will be hard, Hahn
says. ``But it can be done,'' she says confidently. ``The Japanese
like to eat whales, but whales were being exterminated, so their
behavior is changing. And conserving chimpanzees might turn out to
be even more important than conserving whales or elephants or
rhinos.''
 &HT;    There's no guarantee that simian studies will reveal a cure or
vaccine for AIDS. But the extinction of vital chimpanzee species
surely guarantees that they won't.

ITALIAN CLUBS ARE NOW DOMINANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Italy's Serie A was being stifled by
insularity and rocked by betting scandals. Now, the best foreign
players flock to Italy. And Lazio and Milan, both relegated after
it was determined one of their matches had been fixed in 1980, are
the country's top two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has recovered from those dark days and president Sergio
Cragnotti has revitalized the club, even has it quoted on the Milan
stock exchange. Milan has thrived under Silvio Berlusconi, and
could begin a new cycle of success.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will be in the Champions League next year, with the
field expanded to include four Italian clubs. Juventus will not
qualify, though only two weeks ago it was on the verge of
eliminating Manchester United in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Juventus was the first Italian club to adjust to FIFA's
3-points-for-a-win change, and has consistently been the country's
best team since 1994. But Juve's motives must be questioned after
the departure of several top players. Certainly, Juventus could
hardly refuse Atletico Madrid's $20 million offer for Cristian
Vieri in 1997. But Vieri soon returned to Italy; he scored the
clinching goal off a marvelous pass from Roberto Mancini in a 2-0
victory over Bologna that maintained Lazio's 1-point edge over
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   European soccer is changing. And merchandising, shareholding,
and television rights are joining gate receipts and player sales as
major sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United has grasped this better than most clubs.
United has avoided instability with the combination of a regular
revenue stream _ it is rated the world's most profitable club _ and
the resoluteness of coach Alex Ferguson. Unlike Juventus,
Manchester United has seldom sold players in recent years. United
has made few changes in recent years and is headed for a showdown
with Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in Barcelona May
26, its first appearance in the final since 1968 and the first by
an English club since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.06 billion takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch was successfully
resisted by Manchester United supporters, who want to retain their
input into the club and also maintain a balance between soccer and
spectacle. This is the best example of Manchester United's
statement of purpose, though the club's director, Martin Edwards,
disagrees. Of course, Edwards would have made an enormous profit
had Murdoch's offer been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Lazio or Milan likely dispense with their top players
after this season. They simply cannot risk missing out on the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Building an advantage
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Crew Stadium is alliterative but hardly seems a name to
rival Maracana or Bernabeu. But when the Crew meet the Revolution
in the stadium's opener Saturday, it could signal one of the most
significant events in professional soccer in the United States. The
22,500-seat stadium is the first built primarily for soccer in the
US since Fall River entrepreneur Samuel Mark constructed the
15,500-capacity Mark's Stadium in North Tiverton, R.I., in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's Stadium drew capacity crowds for big matches involving
the Fall River Marksmen. But after the decline of the American
Soccer League in the 1930s, the stadium was abandoned. The Marksmen
won the ASL title six times, but Mark changed the name of the team
to the New York Yankees and moved the team to Yankee Stadium in
1931.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, professional soccer teams have seldom had control of
stadiums in the United States, almost insuring their demise. The
Boston Minutemen and New England Tea Men, for example, never had
dependable stadium setups in the 1970s. Though they often outdrew
the Red Sox, the Tea Men transferred to Jacksonville in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the aesthetics of the game, soccer, like baseball,
requires a specific stadium. The game thrives when performed on
wide, well-manicured fields, free from extraneous influences.
Soccer is also best viewed in relatively intimate surroundings,
with no running tracks surrounding the field, creating an
empathetic feel.
</P>
<P>
   This is among the most commendable of experiments conducted by
Major League Soccer and raises the question why other teams have
not built similar stadia.
</P>
<P>
   Le Stade Crew has a better chance of succeeding than Fort
Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium because the Crew should have more
control of its use.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Hunt, the primary investor in the Crew, has often been
ahead of sports entrepreneurs in this country. Hunt suffered for
his vision, enduring some heavy resistance from fellow NFL owners
in the 1970s and '80s, whose policies were later determined to be
restraint of trade violations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the sensibility of owners such as Hunt and the late
Joe Robbie, Hunt and others such as Phil Anschutz and the Kraft
family operate without having to fight for the right of
cross-ownership. This has opened the door to huge investments into
sport in the United States, and could lead to even more, especially
if the Columbus facility proves viable.

PATCHED-UP KLA FIGHTERS AWAIT RETURN TO BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The first shot did not stop him. Neither did
the second or the third. But by the twenty-third bullet Agron
Berisha was on the ground, awake and waiting to die.
</P>
<P>
   He lived.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 22-year-old soldier is recuperating in the six-room
alley apartment where the Kosovo Liberation Army sends its wounded
to heal. Open eight months, scores of foot soldiers and a few KLA
officers have been treated at what they call ``the hospital,''
where most of the medicine is dangerously outdated and the
intravenous stands are rusty with age.
</P>
<P>
   KLA doctors do visit daily, but surgery and other serious
medical procedures are performed at the Albanian military hospital
on the outskirts of Tirana. The one-bathroom apartment is for
afterward. Some soldiers stay for days, others for months. With two
dozen beds pushed against every available wall, they sometimes have
to double up.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers smoking on the long, narrow balcony or just staring
at the walls inside insist they do not mind. To them, the spare but
clean apartment is a place to ready themselves to fight again. Even
Berisha, injured nine months ago in an attack where the Serbs
outnumbered the KLA by two-to-one, hopes to return to the
battlefield one day. For now, though, he is limping on crutches and
using a colostomy bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I'll be OK, and when I am OK, I am going right
back to fight,'' said the softspoken Berisha, who joined the KLA
last spring. ``I'm really mad now. When I get better, I am going
right to Kosovo to get my revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's commander, whose chiseled cheekbones and crinkly eyes
could get him cast in that exact role in a Hollywood war movie,
ordered them not to discuss battle strategies, arms strength or
anything else that could help the Serbs beat them back into
Albania. But speaking through a Kosovar interpreter, the soldiers
appeared to have few secrets to give away.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the beds that are the apartment's only furniture,
they spoke openly of being outnumbered but remaining optimistic, of
watching comrades die and greeting newcomers to war. From the
conversation, fatalities appeared to be high, injuries higher,
although no one could offer any numbers. Several did say that at
least 30 KLA fighters are being treated at the local military
hospital at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   As the soldiers explained, reports filtering back from Kosovo
indicate fighting in every corner of the country. No road, they
said, is safe for the civilian Kosovars still stuck there and the
fighters who chose to stay, some of them women. Many of the
soldiers have had no word of their own families' plight in the last
month and have been unable to get word to them that they are
injured but alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Bajraktari, the most veteran soldier among the wounded
and also the oldest at 40, said two of the four soldiers traveling
with him were killed during a late January ambush by Serbian
police. Shot three times, he was treated in the field, went back to
fighting, and waited two months to come to Tirana to see what could
be done about his left arm. From shoulder to elbow, the bone is
shattered; connected only by muscle, it jiggles like jelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 32 soldiers in my group, and I want to get back to
them,'' said Bajraktari, who described his rank as something like a
sergeant. ``I have been fighting a long time, and I am very proud
of how many people want to fight with us now.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers said they would like the chance to fight alongside
US Army troops, and they urged President Clinton to send them. As
Osman Musliu, a 30-year-old who suffered a severe concussion and
other injuries when he fell during a skirmish, put it, ``We want
American ground troops to finish this war once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   From the second-floor apartment at least, the soldiers seemed an
unlikely, disorganized band.
</P>
<P>
   No two described a similar training regime, with one saying he
had four months' worth and another saying he taught himself to
shoot using his own gun. They did agree that the recruits now
coming from as far away as America to sign up are spending as
little as 15 days in the KLA training camps around Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This army is all volunteer; no one orders us there,'' said the
self-trained Shefqet Gashi, 28, who joined the KLA last May, was
injured in September when he fell during a firefight, and is
recovering from knee surgery. ``So we can fight because it comes
from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Gashi and the others wore cast-off uniforms that came
from one country or another or were sewn locally. In Tirana, they
wear donated clothes that this soldier may wear one day, that
soldier the next. They pass shoes around to find a good fit. A
soldier whose leg is in a cast must wash his foot in the bidet.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical supply room, where soldiers also sleep, several
huge boxes were filled to overflowing with bottles and packages of
drugs, almost all of them unusable. One sterile compress expired in
1992, a supply of amoxicillin in 1997. The X-ray machine was bound
together with heavy tape. The officer in charge of the facility
said he could think of no basic medical supplies _ from antibiotics
to bandages to crutches _ that the KLA had enough of, both at the
army's field hospitals and in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who asked to be identified only as Jashar, said the
KLA also needs foreign hospitals to care for its injured, since
there are no specialists or equipment in Albania to rebuild the
knees, elbows, and other joints shattered by bullets or bombs. The
other day, several were sent to Turkey. England took three and
Germany, two, Jashar said. Visas to other countries have proven
almost impossible to obtain, he added, noting that the KLA lacks
the money to transport the wounded overseas anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jashar came to the apartment six months ago to recuperate. Years
ago, he said, he was shot. Next he was hit by an anti-tank mine and
hospitalized for three months. His most recent injury was also the
most serious: blinded by a grenade, he spent six weeks wondering
whether he would ever see again. Still, he said he will gladly
fight again when he is healthy and not needed in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   None of the soldiers knew how he would be returned to the
border, and some expected they would walk. That is how Naim Tatari,
19, reached Albania after a grenade blast broke one of his ribs in
Kosovo on April 30: 12 hours alone by foot. To keep his mind off
the pain, he told himself over and over how lucky he was to be
alive. ``The first thing I thought when it happened was that I am
all in pieces,'' Tatari said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, he has been eating at cheap restaurants around town
with the other soldiers and talking up the KLA to youngsters who
approach them. Many spoke of pats on the back from strangers who
identified themselves as Kosovar refugees. Tirana, like many
Albanian cities, is crowded with them now. Every so often, one of
them picks up the soldiers' meals. That is good enough for the
soldiers, who stressed that they do not expect every able Kosovar
to join their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every one of us is in a different kind of fight for
Kosovo,'' Berisha said as the others nodded. ``Even if they are not
in the KLA, we are all fighting in our own way.''

THE TUNNEL FUDGE CAKE IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pillsbury finally did it. They've come up with a new recipe for
Tunnel of Fudge Cake.
</P>
<P>
   The original recipe, which won second prize in the 17th
Pillsbury Bake-Off for Ella Helfrich of Houston in 1966, was so
popular that sales of bundt pans skyrocketed after the contest. At
the time, only one company, Northland Aluminum Products in
Minneapolis, Minn., made bundt pans and the factory had to go on a
24-hour production schedule to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the original recipe called for a box of frosting
mix. Pillsbury phased out boxed frostings in the mid-1980s and ever
since, cooks have been clamoring for a new version of this cake. So
now, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the Pillsbury
Bake-Off, the company has re-created its most requested recipe. The
recipe is included in a booklet titled ``Best From 50 Years of
Bake-Off Contests,'' which came with the call for entries in the
next Pillsbury Bake-Off to be held Feb. 26-29 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a theme for the next Bake-Off, it's fast cooking. All
four categories specify quick recipes, usually with time limits on
preparation. The Easy Weeknight Meals category, for instance,
require the recipe be prepared and assembled in 15 minutes or less
(not including cooking time) or the recipe be prepared completely
in 30 minutes or less. Ironically, the new Tunnel of Fudge recipe
takes longer than the original version. And, as always, entered
recipes must use one or more products from a list of Pillsbury,
Hungry Jack, Green Giant, Progresso and Old El Paso products.
</P>
<P>
   The rules and entry forms are available by calling 800-306-1111
through Sept. 30 or by checking the Bake-Off Web site at
www.bakeoff.com.

CANADIAN TOWN HOPES TO PROFIT FROM POLLUTED ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia _ The most polluted place in Canada is
chasing a dream that most communities would call a nightmare:
transforming itself into a sort of living laboratory of toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The municipality on northern Cape Breton Island is seeking to
power an economic revival with the very poisons that permeate its
earth and waterways _ and that have defeated every other renewal
and cleanup scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate times call for dramatic solutions,'' said Robert
Morgan, director of research and development at University College
of Cape Breton. ``We're hoping to turn terrible disadvantage into
advantage. If we fail, our community may not survive.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk of promoting Sydney as a center for ``reverse
eco-tourism,'' where visitors can ponder the terrible contamination
and ruin that accompanied the triumphs of the industrial age.
</P>
<P>
   There are few communities in North America whose situation is
quite as desperate as that of Sydney and its municipal partners of
Sydney Mines, New Waterford, and Glace Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Backyards in some neighborhoods are saturated with alarming
levels of arsenic and lead. Then, this week, a mysterious orange
substance started oozing into basements. Residents reacted with the
combination of outrage and fatalism that has become standard for
Sydney's inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the arsenic, we have the naphthalene, we have the
lead,'' said Debbie Ouellette, a homemaker. ``The ground is poison,
the air turns your lungs raw, now there is orange goop oozing
across the cellar. Welcome to Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, this rough-and-ready district of deep
mines, big smokestacks, and blue collars has depended on steel,
coal, and commercial fishing. Now all three industries are
collapsing; umemployment here is at 30 percent and rising. Then,
earlier this year, the federal government announced it would no
longer provide the multimillion dollar subsidies that kept 1,200
coal miners on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And that devastating blow wasn't even the worst news.
</P>
<P>
   The worst lies in the deadly industrial wastes that glisten and
coil all around Sydney: mountainous slag heaps, rivers of toxic
ooze, acidic fumes that taint the sea breeze, corroded factories
collapsing upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost impossible that such blight could occur on Cape
Breton Island, fabled for its exquisite natural beauty and vibrant
Gaelic heritage. Inhabitants of the island like to boast that no
other place has been more abundantly blessed by God.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast Traveler magazine last year picked Cape Breton as the
most beautiful island in the world, where majestic headlands rise
from the Atlantic spume and seabirds soar in the great vault of
northern sky.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, however, note that few other places on the
planet have been more hideously sullied by man.
</P>
<P>
   Coal mining started in the late 1700s, and Sydney became an
important steel center early this century, attracting thousands of
immigrant workers from Europe and the Caribbean. The Sydney region
still has a multiethnic character that contrasts with the
Scots-Gaelic culture for which the island is famous.
</P>
<P>
   Although a mile-long causeway now links Cape Breton to Nova
Scotia, the island retains an identity distinct from the rest of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never really been absorbed into the mainland culture,''
said Morgan. ``We remain islanders, stubborn, and with a bit of a
chip on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet lethal rot has been festering in Cape Breton's
industrial belt for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our cruel reality, poison at the heart of paradise,''
said Carl R. Buchanan, chairman of the Joint Action Group, a
committee of government officials and local residents hoping to
turn Sydney's tide of ill-fortune. ``Cape Breton is a Nova Scotia
masterpiece, people come from everywhere to experience the wonders.
Yet in the middle of Sydney is this cocktail of waste like nowhere
else on the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We can either despair and die, or find an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many inhabitants are deeply skeptical, a few local
leaders believe that opportunity lurks in Sydney's infamous ``tar
ponds'' _ a tidal estuary in the center of the city packed with
700,000 tons of chemical waste and raw sewage _ as well as in the
hundreds of acres of former industrial sites polluted by millions
of tons of tar, ammonia, oil, benzol, and other byproducts of the
coke yards that once fueled the steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could become an international training ground and research
center for dealing with this kind of environmental challenge,''
said Morgan. ``It's not so far-fetched; we've already begun. The
world could learn from mistakes we've made in Cape Breton _ and
from the way we deal with the mess we've made on our beloved
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last September federal, provincial, and local authorities
finally signed an agreement to cooperate in cleaning up the
hazardous waste sites. ``This is going to be the most complex
environmental cleanup ever undertaken in this country, and maybe
anywhere,'' said Buchanan. ``It's never been done on this scale,
and right in the middle of a city.''
</P>
<P>
   The witch's brew is laced by thousands of tons of PCBs and other
potent chemical carcinogens, which number among the many suspects
in a local cancer rate that is 45 percent higher than the Nova
Scotia average, and by far the highest rate in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The tar ponds alone are reckoned by some to be the worst single
toxic waste site in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney makes Love Canal seem small and manageable,'' said
Elizabeth E. May, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada,
referring to the New York toxic site that became a byword for
hazardous waste in the 1980s. ``This is pollution of staggering
dimensions, and thousands of people are still dwelling right in the
belly of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   On the residential street where Juanita MacKenzie lives, for
example, the air is so rank with the odor of chemicals that the
eyes fill with tears and a metallic taste settles on the tongue. A
chain-link fence separates the backyards where children play from a
sprawling former coke yard, where for decades coal was baked in
mammoth ovens to fire the steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago health workers, equipped with face masks and
covered head-to-toe in white environmental safety suits, appeared
in Sydney to affix signs to the fence, warning, ``Human Health
Hazard.'' Local residents, who live without special protection and
who had been repeatedly assured by the government that they were in
no special danger, were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a toxic community,'' said MacKenzie. ``Our children
suffer from asthma, learning disabilities and cancer. There are
days we can hardly breathe. Something has to happen, now.''
</P>
<P>
   The clean-up will be the work of decades and billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishery is ruined, coal is down, the future of steel is in
question,'' said Germaine LeMoine, spokeswoman for the clean-up
committee. ``We have to work with what we have, and what we have is
this environmental situation. Why not make what we can with it? Why
not find a market for expertise and technology we can develop right
at home?''
</P>
<P>
   The notion is still in the conceptual phase, and to many it
seems outlandish and even diabolical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a scam, a way to keep people's eyes off the real
problem, which is disappearing jobs and a government that doesn't
give two damns about what happens to Cape Breton,'' said Steve
Drake, president of the United Mine Workers local. ``We'll be
tossed a few scraps, then forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The miners want Ottawa to continue subsidizing the coal works,
even though the $1 billion already pumped into the mines has failed
to restore the industry to its past glory, as was the goal when
public money started flowing a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays even local politicians concede that such economic
dependency does Cape Breton no lasting good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling in the community that it's time to call in
the dogs, to stop our reliance on those industries,'' the municipal
mayor, David Muise, told the Canadian Press. ``The status quo isn't
going to work here any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new idea is to transform an ecological sow's ear into an
economic silk purse, making Sydney a place to test new
environmental technologies, to research the effects of pollution,
and to train ecological technicians _ especially from former Soviet
states, Asia and other parts of the developing world, where the
21st century's eco-disasters will loom largest.
</P>
<P>
   Some even tout a proposal to make Sydney a center for ``reverse
eco-tourism,'' allowing visitors to examine firsthand some of the
horrific side effects of poorly managed progress before heading out
to revel in the natural glories that anually attract tens of
thousands of tourists to Cape Breton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can become a center of excellence for the rest of the
world,'' said LeMoine. ``In overcoming our problems, we can develop
tools, techniques, and expertise that we can provide to other
places. The world can come to us and learn.''

CALIFORNIA'S RACE WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The New Hampshire primary celebrates its
50th anniversary this year in the ominous shadow of a de facto
national primary. In 1949, a young Granite State legislator, Dick
Upton, sought to add a ``presidential preference'' line to the
primary ballot. In 1952, the primary was held in the second Tuesday
in March, a date established in 1803 for town meetings after
winter's thaw and before spring planting, a time known as ``mud
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary is now known as ``mud season'' for other reasons,
but soon it may vanish in the mother of all mudslides. Last week,
Governor Gray Davis signed a bill here that tries to solve legal
problems in counting votes after the newest, biggest primary on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will ensure that California will have a voice in the
upcoming presidential primary,'' said Davis, a Democrat. ``This
legislation solves a short-term problem with political party rules
in 2000,'' said Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican. ``For
the first time in a quarter century, California will decide who is
nominated to be our next president.''
</P>
<P>
   When its primary was held in June, California was the showdown
state, featuring battles between Barry Goldwater and Nelson
Rockefeller in 1964 and Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iowa's caucuses have become a de facto primary.
Other states have tried to snare New Hampshire's sunshine, but the
Granite State has moved its date deeper into February's sleet
season. Political scientists, along with secretaries of state, have
urged a rational, rotating system, giving each region of the
country a decisive early primary.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties have been too busy raising money to deal with
rational ideas. Clout, therefore, fills the vacuum. New Hampshire
sent fewer than 500,000 voters to the polls in 1996. California
sent more than 9.6 million voters. Size matters. California wishes
to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The myths and traditions of New Hampshire still dominate
presidential politics. Last week in Austin, Governor George W. Bush
of Texas mused to Walter R. Mears of the Associated Press: ``I
think that one of the things I'm good at is campaigning _ I like
people a lot _ I like to shake hands and I like to look people in
the eye and say I'd like for you to hear me and help me out.'' Yet
Grange Halls in Fresno and coffee shops in Coronado will go largely
unvisited by live presidential candidates in the week before March
7.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, who has run for president before, had a more
realistic assessment. ``Fourteen percent of all the people in this
country live in California,'' he said. ``So it makes California
more important and it makes Iowa and New Hampshire, which come
earlier, even more important than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Democratic bosses stole the presidential nomination in
1968 in Chicago, parties have often revised the method of choosing
presidents, efforts that foundered on the Iron Rule of Unintended
Consequences. (In 1988, ``Super Tuesday'' was supposed to nominate
a Southern Democrat. Michael Dukakis, not Dixie's darlin', won.)
</P>
<P>
   California's move is still iffy. The state's voters approved an
``open primary'' law in 1996, mostly because party leaders opposed
the idea. In 1998, by a 54-46 percent, Californians refused to
change the law for presidential primaries, even though the big
shots in Washington wanted them to.
</P>
<P>
   The law Davis signed involves a complicated vote-counting system
that no one has challenged in court so far. California is a
litigious place, so March 8 may not reveal a pair of crowned
presidential nominees but a mob of bickering lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy on a large scale is difficult. In March, both parties
may be echoing noted Californians. They can croon, along with the
Grateful Dead, ``What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been.'' They can
also echo the classic lament of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy:
``Another fine mess.''

HARVARD STUDENTS PLUGGING INTO ON-LINE CAREERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Youssef Ghazal, like many of his fellow Harvard
Business School students, thought he wanted to become a consultant.
He wanted the six-figure starting salary, the prestige that comes
from advising giant corporations, and a career on what has been one
of the hot job tracks of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But then he took a trip to Silicon Valley last summer, and
everything changed. Sitting around a beer-stained pool table in an
abandoned San Francisco honky-tonk that now serves as offices for
WebMethods, an Internet start-up company hoping to go public soon,
Ghazal, 31, experienced a revelation he calls ``the turning
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he realized that what he really wanted was a piece of
his own company. ``I realized it's not about the office you work
in, it's not about the salary. It's all about equity,'' The
Austrian native said of that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Ghazal ditched consulting and along with several other business
students is launching an on-line pharmacy in Europe. ``Those who
believe in the Internet will go far,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So many of Ghazal's classmates have arrived at the same
conclusion that few are planning to follow traditional business
paths when they graduate. In a frenzy that professors compare to
the Great Oklahoma Land Rush, graduates are turning down lucrative
offers to stake claims in the burgeoning on-line world by trying to
start Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 343 Harvard Business School graduates out of a class
of 880 say they plan either to launch high-tech start-ups or join
the venture capital firms that support them to cash in on the
Internet boom, according to a student poll. That's triple the
number four years ago. Also, the number of graduates taking
traditional consulting and Wall Street jobs has dropped by nearly
half, to 308.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be all about consulting and investment banking at
Harvard,'' says John Borchers, a Harvard business student who
recently cochaired the school's business plan competition,
dominated by proposals for new Internet companies. ``Now,
everybody's got a business plan under their arm. They're passing up
the big salaries and the security for $40,000 a year and a few
stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift has been so sudden and severe that some consulting
firms could not recruit enough business students this year and
turned to Harvard law students, says Kirstin Moss, the business
school's director of career services.
</P>
<P>
   Moss says that even Fortune 500 companies, longtime outposts for
Harvard students, are struggling to fill positions. One student's
recent comments, she says, summed up the obsession with the
Internet. ``A student said to me, `The gold rush is on, and it's
not going to last very long.' They want to get out there while the
opportunities are still available.''
</P>
<P>
   The same trend is evident at other prestigious business schools,
including MIT's Sloan School of Management, the Wharton School at
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. But at Harvard, whose august reputation and wood-paneled
corridors for so long nurtured captains of industry and fed the
nation's corporations, the change has been particularly stark.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the sudden enthusiasm for Internet enterprises are the
almost incomprehensible sums of money being pumped into new on-line
companies. A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that
venture capitalists rained $14.3 billion on start-ups last year,
almost all of them Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley alone, a record 787 Internet ventures sprouted
in 1998, the report said. Each received about $5.8 million. In New
England, which had the second-largest concentration of Internet
start-ups, 407 new companies got a record $2 billion in venture
capital funding.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money, ``no brilliant idea should go wanting
for lack of funds,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists who provide seed money to start-ups for a
piece of fledgling companies are ensuring that money is not a
problem. During recruiting season at Harvard, they invaded the
business school's Allston campus, handing out business cards to
students who one day might launch the next eBay or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some fear that business students might be taking a big
gamble in passing up solid opportunities in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about some of these kids,'' says Marco Iansiti, a
Harvard professor whose course on starting new ventures went from
an enrollment of 50 last year to 120 this year. ``There are some
who are going out there and doing very gutsy things. They're
turning down big offers and rolling the dice. It's a tougher world
out there than some of them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Harvard's hallways buzz with stories of recent
grads such as Stig Leschly, who two weeks ago sold his
seven-month-old start-up Exchange.com, an on-line seller of used
books and recordings, for a reported $200 million to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the prospect of incredible sums of money, some say
students are motivated by a sense that the Internet represents a
vast frontier with unrivaled opportunities for making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a time in contemporary history when there's
been a chance like this to leave your mark on the world,'' says
Anthony Tjan, a 1998 Harvard business graduate and cofounder of
Zefer, an Internet company specializing in business-to-business
communications. Last week, the company won $100 million in
financing from GTCR Golder Rauner LLC, a Chicago venture capital
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industrial revolution produced Fords and Sloans,'' he
says. ``That's the opportunity we see in front of us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such possibilities have inspired a near panic among student
entrepreneurs hoping to come up with the next big idea before
someone else does, students and professers say. In Harvard's annual
business plan contest, 80 student teams submitted entries for
companies they intend to launch this year, double the number in
1998. All but a few were ideas for Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to get started, many business students skipped
classes to make weekly pilgrimages to California and New York to
meet with potential investors. Some said they set up offices long
before they finished the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people getting in on this that you can work
on an idea for a year only to find somebody else is trying to do
the same thing,'' says one student who asked not to be named
because financing arrangements for his Internet start-up are at a
delicate stage. ``There's nothing worse than being a minute too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the ever-present fear that investor enthusiasm for
Internet companies, which has driven initial stock offerings to
astronomical heights, will suddenly go flat and pop the Internet
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know when the music is going to stop,''
says Mike Roberts, a senior lecturer and director of
entrepreneurial studies at Harvard. ``Very few of these companies
are making money. It's largely driven by the capital markets at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 50 Internet public offerings nationwide, only one
has fizzled. But last week, a San Diego on-line real estate firm,
Comps.com, made headlines when its initial public offering opened
at $15 a share but finished three-fourths of a point lower by the
end of the trading day. In a world where it has become common for
new Internet offerings to jump dozens of points in a single day, it
was an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   Even venture capitalists who have staked fortunes on the
Internet's ability to generate huge gains can't peer very far into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything could happen,'' says Klaus Koch, a 1997 Harvard
business graduate who works for the Los Angeles venture capital
firm Kleine, Hawkes &AMP; Co. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it goes on
for five years, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes into the
toilet in three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But student entrepreneurs at Harvard such as Jason Palmer, who
says he's close to securing financing for Mascotnetwork (``a sort
of America Online for college campuses''), are banking on the
Internet's long-term viability as a place to make their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are still endless,'' he says.

DEMOCRATS LET HOLLYWOOD OFF TOO EASY ON VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senate hearings. House hearings. White House town halls. For all
of their frenzy in the wake of Littleton, they are already a
touchy-feely farce. To start, Senate majority leader Trent Lott is
feigning openness this week by allowing some debate on gun control
in hearings on juvenile justice at the same time he is saying gun
control will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think additional gun-control measures are probably not
needed,'' Lott said. ``The press and others may want this to turn
into gun control. That's not what this is about. That may be a
small part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is so small for Lott because gun money is so large
for his Republican Party. In the 1998 election cycle, the National
Rifle Association gave 83 percent of its congressional
contributions to Republicans, $1.35 million out of $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is no news by itself. The curiosity is the Democrats. While
Republicans are slaves to guns, the Democrats are in a state of
servitude to gun culture.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's youth violence town hall, President Clinton did
connect violent TV with real violence. But he stressed that ``We
are not here to place blame, but to shoulder responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   This is blamelessness to a fault, making Clinton as reassuring
for Hollywood as Lott is for the NRA. Hollywood figures are so
reassured that they can come to these hearings and insult our
intelligence. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America, said Hollywood is not part of the problem.
He said families should ``build a strong moral shield'' at ``church
and home and school.'' He said the surgeon general should study the
``why of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the surgeon general did major surveys of data in
1972 and 1982 that concluded that violence on television
contributed to violent crime. This is proof that it is time to stop
pampering the likes of Valenti and start clamping down on his
industry with serious violence ratings, stringent restrictions on
advertising (I find a gun pointed in my face in ads as offensive as
the Marlboro Man), and new prime-time restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But who will keep Valenti honest. Clinton? The Democrats? Not if
they are as afraid of offending their donors as are the
Republicans. Of the $16 million in political contributions that
flowed from the TV, movie, and music industry in the 1998 election
cycle, $10 million, or 63 percent, went to the Democrats, according
to federal data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats did best in individual hard-money contributions to
candidates, party committees, and political action committees. Of
$7.2 million of such money, $5.3 million went to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For example, individual contributions from people associated
with Universal Studios amounted to $206,600 for Democrats, compared
with $10,200 for Republicans. Contributions from people at Time
Warner and its many affiliates came to $419,007 to Democrats and
$60,800 to Republicans. Dreamworks individuals gave $108,300 to
Democrats and $4,500 to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti's group gave $55,975 to Democrats and $15,750 to
Republicans. Republicans do better in Hollywood through corporate
PACs or individual soft money for their party. After all, the
Disneys, Time Warners, and Universals need the Republicans to keep
business regulations lax and tax loopholes big.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question who should shoulder the responsibility
when it comes to putting pressure on the industry to reel in the
guns and the gore. The top eight recipients in the Senate of
TV/movies/music contributions from 1993-98 are Democrats, led by
Barbara Boxer of Calfornia ($399,471) and immediately followed by
Ted Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts ($330,024 and $323,440,
respectively), and Dianne Feinstein of California ($300,622). The
highest Republican recipient was Conrad Burns of Montana at
$186,609.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the top five recipients of Hollywood money in the
1998 election cycle are Democrats, led by House minority leader
Richard Gephardt at $131,797. The highest Republican recipient was
Howard Coble of North Carolina at $54,611.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Kennedy have rightfully called for stronger gun
control. But they also have to stop being a doormat for Valenti. It
cannot be an accident that the toughest Democratic senator on media
violence, Connecticut's Joseph Lieberman, ranks only 33rd in
1993-98 contributions from Hollywood, at $71,800.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Kennedy said, ``We can work with the media to achieve
responsible programming for children and youth.'' Monday, Clinton
asked for a ``wholehearted participation'' by Hollywood in a
campaign to reduce youth violence. Clinton asked the makers of
violent movies, video games, and music to ``consider the
consequences'' of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti's denial shows that Hollywood is not an industry that
can be ``worked with.'' There can be no mushy expectation that it
will ``consider'' a ``wholehearted participation'' in reducing
violence when violence is currently so profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has to be confronted. Gun control remains the top
priority after Littleton. But if Democrats fight only guns and not
our violent culture, they will find that most people are too numb
from the movies to get rid of the real thing. What we do know is
that this weekend, Clinton will not be on a mission to shame
Hollywood. He will be in Beverly Hills for a $1.5 million
fund-raiser.

`TRIPPIN' FALLS FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TRIPPIN' 
Directed by: David Raynr 
Written by: Gary Hardwick 
Starring: Deon Richmond, Donald Adeosun Faison, Maia Campbell, Guy
Torry, Countess Vaughn, Stoney Jackson 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: R (sexual situations, adult language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with the current, and mostly regrettable, deluge of teen
films clogging up valuable cineplex space, it was only a matter of
time before a hip-hop version of the trend found its way onto the
big screen. Hence, we have ``Trippin' ,'' which manages to prove
only that Hollywood finds black teens as inane, thick-headed,
uninspired, and sex-mad as their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Reed (Deon Richmond) is known as ``G'' to his friends, and
that G might as well stand for goofball. A senior, he isn't as
interested in applying to college as he is in hooking up with any
number of young women. In fact, he spends most of his time
imagining himself as a babe magnet, forever wrapped in compromising
positions with lots of scantily clad women. He's a Walter Mitty-ish
boy in the 'hood, less concerned with heroics than hootchies.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he's like most of the students at Du Bois High
School where, suffice it to say, much of the student body would not
be included among those scholar W.E.B. Du Bois was considering when
he wrote of ``the Talented Tenth.'' Certainly not G's wastrel
buddies: June (Donald Adeosun Faison), a petty crook and a
self-styled ladies' man who doesn't seem to care if the ladies he's
pursuing already have a man. And Fish (Guy Torry) isn't any better.
He somehow thinks he can earn a living as a professional lover
bedding a different woman every night. Yes, this is a profession,
and it's called prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   G, when he isn't daydreaming of another menage a trois, has set
his sights on Cinny (Maia Campbell), who is, of course, the
smartest, prettiest girl in school. In real life, such a young
woman of promise wouldn't give a trifflin' no-count, wanna-be playa
like G the time of day. But since this movie is stoned on
teen-flick cliches, Cinny is falling for G faster than you can say
``She's All That.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupidly written by Gary Hardwick, flatly directed by David
Raynr, and poorly acted by all involved, the mind boggles to think
that someone somewhere thought this mess would work as a movie. And
I'm still trying to figure out the film's connection to LA Lakers
star Shaquille O'Neal, whose TWISM (which stands for ``The World Is
Mine) clothing line gets plenty of screen time. Still, its
inclusion in a film this terrible isn't likely to send sales
soaring. ``Trippin' '' is one trip to be avoided at the movies.

A REJECTION LETTER TO PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ Former Globe book editor Herb Kenny has
lured me to the North Shore to meet Jonathan Bayliss, one of the
great self-published authors of our time. Kenny has read the first
1,200 pages of Bayliss's ``Gloucesterman'' quartet and confesses:
``Frankly, I don't know what to make of it all. It is easy to say
that (``Gloucesterman'') is unreadable, with a vocabulary exceeding
Shakespeare's and sentences that outpace Edmund Burke's, and let it
go at that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kenny finds Bayliss's work hard to dismiss. Suppose the
difficult, erudite tetralogy proves to be a work of genius? I
suspect that Kenny is calling me in to offer a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, my trip is a bust, because I agree to meet
Bayliss only if I don't have to read his work. My life is difficult
enough without difficult books. I'd rather read Thomas Harris than
Thomas Pynchon, and even though I don't share Harold Ross's
confusion _ ``Was Moby Dick the man or the whale?'' _ about the
Herman Melville classic, I understand where the late New Yorker
editor was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   But I am interested in Bayliss, a soft-spoken Harvard- and
Berkeley-educated author/scholar, because he has eschewed
conventional publishing. Starting in 1992, he has printed a
thousand copies each of his three doorstops: ``Gloucesterbook,''
607 pages; ``Gloucestertide,'' 663 pages; and ``Prologos,'' 1,089
pages. Bayliss's narrator, Michael Chapman, says he is writing
``transfiction'': ``As a matter of personal integrity, in
resistance to the times, and in the interest of efficient
information, it was impossible for me to render this transfiction
in the demotic language of contemporary American literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Melville, Walt Whitman, and Vikram Seth, to name just three, all
self-published. But most writers want to be published
conventionally. On the other hand, authors understand the gossamer
dividing line between published and unpublished work. It is hardly
a secret that no end of unpublishable manuscripts find their way
into hard covers. Large corporations, like Gillette or Occidental
Petroleum, have been known to launder official histories through
reputable houses by underwriting both the author's and the
publisher's expenses. That is a form of self-publication. And when
an author's third or fourth book finds a large audience, it is
commonplace for the publisher to trumpet earlier works, in some
cases books that the publisher itself rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Internet has offered some interesting
variants on self-publication. Several authors have released novels
on their Web sites that have later been snapped up by
pulp-and-paste publishers. Now, with the appearance of programmable
electronic ``books'' like Rocket eBook and SoftBook, Seattle-based
PublishingOnline.com (also the address of its Web site) offers
digital self-publishing. For $500, an author can buy a space on
POL's ``bookshelf,'' and share in the revenues from each sale or
download, at a price ranging from $1 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bayliss has never tried to land a publisher.
``What is the point?'' he asks. ``I know the odds are a million to
one against me.'' When asked why he self-publishes, he paraphrases
George Mallory's famous explanation of why he climbed mountains:
``Because it wasn't there. My book didn't exist and I wanted it to
be out there where people could read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bayliss's friends have now read his work, and sent
favorable notices to the local newspaper. The books outline a
complicated epistemology, which he calls ``dromenology.'' I asked
Bayliss how many readers actually understood his message. ``About
three,'' he answered. Only once has he received money for his
fiction, a $3,000 Massachusetts Arts Council grant in the
mid-1970s. Novelist Russell Banks sat on that committee. ``He said
it was a work of genius,'' Bayliss recounts.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, Banks dimly recalls Bayliss's 9-inch-tall
stack of manuscript pages: ``I vaguely remember this wonderful,
wacked-out piece of writing.''
</P>
<P>

HOLLYWOOD THAT IT WERE; PBS LOWERS STANDARDS?  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took some doing, but I managed to find an article in Premiere
that didn't concern ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'': an
explanation by screenwriter Larry Gross for the dismal state of
Hollywood studio movies nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Gross is not satisfied with the usual explanations: that George
Lucas and Steven Spielberg created a mania for lucrative
special-effects movies; that movie economics force studios to focus
on action films that can be released worldwide; and that ``modern
civilization has gone brain-dead.'' (Hmm, that last one rings
true.)
</P>
<P>
   No, Gross thinks the fault lies not in our (movie) stars but in
ourselves. He argues that Hollywood executives have largely stopped
giving the green light to quality film projects because so many of
the best movies of the past 25 years either flopped or
under-performed at the box office: ``Nashville,'' ``Prince of the
City,'' ``The Right Stuff,'' ``L. A. Confidential,'' ``Empire of
the Sun,'' and ``Who'll Stop the Rain?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to agree with each film Gross cites as a
neglected masterpiece (did Woody Allen's bilious and self-pitying
``Stardust Memories'' really deserve better than it got?) to be
sobered by his argument that such flops have taught filmmakers to
be ``ever more cynical, risk-averse, and afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa, Dipsy, and Po symbols of declining
standards within the Public Broadcasting Service?
</P>
<P>
   Susan E. Linn and Alvin F. Poussaint seem to think so. In a
tough-minded piece in The American Prospect, the authors broaden
the debate over ``Teletubbies'' into an indictment of PBS's
increasing drift toward commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Linn and Poussaint argue that `` `Teletubbies' steps over an
important line'' and ``violates a fundamental tenet of PBS's
noncommercial mission'' by targeting children as young as 1 year
old with a TV show whose educational benefits are very much open to
debate. The authors suggest that PBS, tempted by the huge
merchandising possibilities of ``Teletubbies,'' has made a
programming decision ``that has the potential to negatively affect
the lives of millions of young children.'' They urge PBS to sell
its interest in the show and stem the damage to its ``previously
stellar reputation in the field of children's programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the authors say, the decision to offer
``Teletubbies'' to member stations is symptomatic of a larger
threat to PBS's very identity. They contend that PBS, shaken by a
congressional assault on its funding in 1995, has responded with a
perpetual quest for corporate funding, revenue-generating
partnerships with production companies, and ``promotional spots
that look an awful lot like commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, PBS largely remains an oasis of civility and
intelligence in prime time and of good kids' shows during the day,
``Teletubbies'' aside. But it's hard to gainsay the broad thrust of
the argument Linn and Poussaint make. Maybe their polemic will
serve as a wake-up call while it's still possible to distinguish
PBS from the rest of the networks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campaign rhetoric has familiarized us all with the phrase
``tax-and-spend.'' Next time we're glumly paying our credit card
bills, Juliet B. Schor would like us to give some thought as to how
we've gotten trapped in the ``work-and-spend'' cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Schor, a Harvard lecturer and the author of a new book titled
``The Overspent American,'' persuasively argues in an interview in
CommonWealth magazine that our quality of life has been diminished
_ too much stress, too little free time, lots of financial anxiety
_ by our obsession with what she calls ``status consumption.'' Not
that it's all our fault: ``American consumers are having more
difficulty controlling themselves'' because ``the consumer
environment is increasingly geared toward people not controlling
themselves'' and because ``the standards for middle-class life have
up-scaled much faster than people's incomes have grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Schor favors ``downshifting'' to a four-day workweek,
accompanied by a corresponding reduction in spending, with the
extra time and energy devoted to rebuilding our ``impoverished
public sector.'' One of those ideas that's too good to ever come
true? Schor insists not, contending that her surveys reveal
substantial public support for an end to the rat race.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth checking out in CommonWealth's all-labor issue is
Peter Lucas's profile of Stephen Lynch, the South Boston ironworker
turned labor lawyer turned state senator.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we all learned in the magical summer of 1998, there's a lot
to like about Mark McGwire. He and Sammy Sosa made it possible to
set aside cynicism and indulge in some old-time sentimentality
about baseball, a sport that had allowed mercenaries to set its
tone for too long.
</P>
<P>
   One of the home run king's best attributes last year was his
candor, a trait on display again in an interview with Dan Patrick
in the current ESPN magazine. McGwire on baseball's insanely
inflated salaries: ``Nobody is worth that much money. I'm not worth
the money I am making right now.'' On fans' insanely inflated
expectations: ``What happened last year might never happen again.''
On which is harder, hitting .400 or swatting 70 home runs (as he
did last year): ``.400 would be a true, true test . . . That right
there surpasses hitting 70 home runs by a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one ominous note in this generally relaxed exchange
between McGwire and Patrick. The joyful mano a mano between McGwire
and Sosa last year (along with Cal Ripken's setting the
consecutive-game record the year before) helped finally get rid of
the sour taste left by the baseball strike of 1994, but McGwire
says he anticipates ``serious labor problems'' when the basic
agreement between the players' union and the owners runs out in a
couple of years. ``If you think there aren't going to be problems
in 2001, then you're in outer space somewhere,'' he says.

ESPERANTO: 2 MILLION SPEAKERS STILL USE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
(begin itals 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People were thinking big in the late 19th century. They
utopianized, they universalized, they created Zionism, the modern
Olympics, the Socialist International.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking big back then sometimes meant thinking weird. Inundate
the planet with a dark bubbly syrup? Try Coca-Cola. Chew 80 times
before swallowing your food? Fletcherism, as the practice was
called, was once more popular than Coke. A universal language? Say
``Esperanto.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coke, Esperanto has not conquered the world. Unlike
Fletcherism, neither has it disappeared. In the late 20th century,
it remains on the tip of surprisingly many tongues.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Esperanto? It's Greek to me: Esperanto was invented by Dr.
Ludwig L. Zamenhoff, an optometrist, in 1887. A Polish Jew,
Zamenhoff grew up in Bialystok, a city where Russian, Polish,
German, and Yiddish were commonly spoken. Zamenhoff had a knack for
languages (he spoke eight, not counting Esperanto). He was also
very much a product of his era. It occurred to him that if
different peoples all spoke the same tongue, they might get along
better. He decided to invent one _ not a language to replace other
languages, but one to supplement them, so that everyone, regardless
of native tongue, might be able to communicate with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Zamenhoff began working on his project when he
</P>
<P>
   was 15 and spent 13 years perfecting it. He presented his new
language in a book called ``Dr. Esperanto's International
Language.'' ``Esperanto'' means ``one who hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Esperanto derives its vocabulary from various European
languages: Latin, Greek, and Romance and Germanic tongues. The
grammar is regular and greatly simplified. The spelling is
phonetic, and nouns have no genders. Its regularity and simplicity
make it easy to learn. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning'': ``En la komenco Dio kreis la cielon kaj
teron'' is the Esperanto translation of the first 10 words from the
King James Version of the Bible (``In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth''). &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Volapuk: Esperanto is neither the
first nor only constructed language. The idea goes back at least to
the 17th century and the philosopher Rene Descartes. It derived
further intellectual credence from the Enlightenment belief in
universal systems and the primacy of reason. However, it wasn't
until the late 19th century that the first constructed languages
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Volapuk, invented by a Catholic priest, Father J. M. Schleyer,
predates Esperanto by nearly a decade. It attracted several hundred
thousand practitioners, but once the novelty wore off, Volapuk
quickly lost out to Esperanto. Both languages eventually gave birth
to ``improved'' versions, known, respectively, as Idiom Neutral and
Ido (short for Esperandido), but neither really took hold.
</P>
<P>
   Other invented languages include Solresol, based on the musical
scale; Timerio, a numerical language; Glosa, an attempt to create
an international language using as few words as possible; and
Interlingua, which is derived from English and Romance languages.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Marani, a translator for the European Council of Ministers
in Brussels, has drawn considerable attention with his Europanto, a
playful blend of English and various European languages (see
accompanying story). &QL;

   Lights! Camera! Esperanto!: An Esperanto film canon exists,
albeit consisting of only one title, ``Incubus,'' a 1965
fantasy/sci-fi feature starring a pre-``Star Trek'' William
Shatner. The ``Incubus'' Web site (http://www.incubusthefilm.com)
makes noises about a forthcoming video release, but no dates are
given. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's so funny about peace, love, and Esperanto?: Elvis
Costello commissioned Esperanto liner notes for his album ``Blood
and Chocolate.'' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The East is Esperantist: There are an estimated 2 million
Esperantists in the world, and they live in at least 86 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the movement has been strongest in Central Europe.
As Miko Sloper, director of the Esperanto League for North America
(ELNA), points out, ``You travel a hundred miles in any direction
there and you might need to speak some other language to be
understood. It's very practical to have a common language, and for
obvious political reasons most people there certainly didn't want
it to be Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the World Esperanto Association (UEA) is headquartered in
Rotterdam, more than half the world's Esperanto speakers are now
believed to live in China. The language's popularity there stems
from a 40-part instructional series broadcast on Chinese television
in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Large pockets of Esperantists also exist in Korea and Japan. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Truth, justice, and the Esperanto way: ELNA, the leading
Esperanto organization in this country, is located in El Cerrito,
Calif. The Bay Area is the closet thing America has to an Esperanto
hotbed, thanks largely to San Francisco State University, whose
annual Summer Esperanto Workshop celebrates its 30th anniversary in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Esperanto Society of New England has about 50 members. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One hobbit, one orc, one elf, one dwarf _ one language?: J.R.R.
Tolkien, who taught philology at Oxford University when not writing
``The Hobbit'' and ``The Lord of the Rings,'' gave Esperanto his
endorsement, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to all who have the time or inclination to concern
themselves with the international language movement would be: `Back
Esperanto loyally.' '' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends in high places: At least six Nobel Prize winners have
been Esperantists. So was Yugloslavia's postwar ruler Josip Broz
Tito. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Esperanto? Ho, ho, ho: The language's image as a sort of verbal
vegetarianism has meant that Esperanto often serves as a linguistic
fall guy. Isaac Bashevis Singer once denounced modern Hebrew ``as
soulless Esperanto.'' Fran Lebowitz writes in one of her humor
pieces, ``The writer is to the real world what Esperanto is to the
language world _ funny, maybe, but not that funny.'' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can judge a language by its enemies: Hitler derided
Esperanto in ``Mein Kampf.'' Stalin labeled it ``the language of
spies.'' US Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Esperantists of being
Communists. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can judge a language by its literature: PEN, the
international writers organization, has an Esperanto chapter. Some
30,000 titles have been published in the language. ``People write
novels in Esperanto,'' says Humphrey Tonkin, professor of
humanities at the University of Hartford and past president of the
UEA. ``There's quite a lot of poetry. As with any other language,
there are good novels and bad novels, good poetry and bad poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Among authors translated into Esperanto are Dante, Tolstoy,
Goethe, Ibsen, and Sartre. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates does not speak Esperanto: Sun Microsystems originally
advertised its Java computing system as ``the Esperanto of computer
languages.'' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe he does: The number of Esperanto Web sites _
for instance, there's http://esperanto.wunderground.com, which
offers weather forecasts in Esperanto _ would suggest the language
has a disproportionately high following among the digerati. ``It
kind of makes intuitive sense,'' says Sloper, that people who use
artificial languages on-screen would be intrigued by an artificial
language in the rest of their lives (actually, Esperantists prefer
the term ``planned language'').
</P>
<P>
   David Wolff, an Acton software engineer who's the president of
ELNA, agrees. ``Programmers are used to looking for solutions to
things, looking for ways to fix problems, and looking especially
for ways that are inexpensive and effective. Esperanto is that kind
of a solution. You follow simple rules. It's easy to get into and
to learn it, and it clearly solves a specific kind of problem.'' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the fina venko: ``We're still a little club, in a
way, and there's a camaraderie to that,'' says Sloper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esperantists speak of the fina venko, or `final victory.' The
concept is that eventually every moderately educated person on the
earth will know Esperanto enough to, say, be able to order a cup of
coffee in it. Is that going to happen? I don't really care. It
would be nice if everyone knew Esperanto, but already there are
enough people who do so that we have a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are directories of Esperantists all over the world, and
when someone is traveling to a foreign country it will frequently
happen that an Esperantist will write or e-mail a fellow
Esperantist and be invited to stay in his home. Does that happen
with people who speak just English? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ANOTHER CREATED LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   (Sidebar) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Esperanto is to provide a language that can be
spoken by people the world over. Diego Marani does not see the
need. ``We already have one: English.''
</P>
<P>
   Marani, 39, is a man with a passion for languages. He makes a
living translating them for the European Council of Ministers in
Brussels. He's fluent in Italian (his native language), French,
English, German, Dutch, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, has some
knowledge of Finnish, and is learning Slovenian.
</P>
<P>
   To amuse himself, he began to put together a language he calls
``Europanto'' (pan is Greek for ``everything''), comprising 42
percent English, 38 percent French, 15 percent from other EU
languages, ``und 5 percent mixed fantasia mots out of Latin,
unlikely-old-Greek, et much rude Italian jurones'' (the quotation
is in Europanto, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Marani describes Europanto as ``a provocative way to push people
not to be afraid of languages, to show them that with languages one
can play and nevertheless be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian weekly, Le Soire Illustre, began publishing Europanto
lessons in December 1996, and Marani was off and running. He writes
a weekly column in Europanto for newspapers in Belgium and
Switzerland. He's published a novel in Europanto, ``Las adventures
des Inspector Cabillot,'' as well as two novels in Italian.
``Europanto is my way of reaching a broader public without
translation!'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Marani says he doesn't have a favorite language, though he adds
that he made a point of marrying an Italian ``because I couldn't
have a real marital quarrel in any other language.'' &QL;

PLAYING YOUNG VADER ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE HIS LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Meet Darth Vader, the 10-year-old kid and budding
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Lloyd was thrilled when he won the part of Anakin Skywalker
_ Vader as a boy _ in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' which opens May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vader's always been my favorite `Star Wars' character,'' said
an energetic and impish Jake, whose character is empowered by the
``Force'' found in creator George Lucas' universe and begins a
spiritual journey from darkness to redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vader's really a good guy,'' Jake insisted. ``He's the only
one who could destroy the emperor in the end (1983's ''Return of
the Jedi``).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the part, I started yelling,'' he said. ``Then I
took a deep breath and thought, `Oh my gosh _ I got Star Wars!'
Then I yelled some more. Then I started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends at school in Los Angeles weren't as impressed. Jake
recounted the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be in the new `Star Wars' film!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So-so.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, his schoolmates ``are OK with it. I don't think my
life will change that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he was a pro before ``The Phantom Menace.'' Jake worked
with Marisa Tomei in ``Unhook the Stars,'' had a recurring role on
``ER'' and played Arnold Schwarzenegger's son in ``Jingle All the
Way.''
</P>
<P>
   For a kid, you'd think working with Ah-nuld would be the
ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold was great,'' said Jake, a bubbly, quick-witted boy who
wore jeans and a DKNY 2000 T-shirt when meeting the press, along
with mop-top hair much like Anakin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was like, `OK, you've worked with Schwarzenegger. Are
you done now?' And I'm like, `No! I'm still up for `Star Wars!'''
</P>
<P>
   He got the part after a two-year casting search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake was this wild little Tom Sawyer kid, which was just what
I was looking for,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   A new actor will play the 16-year-old Anakin in ``Episode II,''
which is expected to be shot next year. But ``as long as it takes
them to cast these films, I just might have a chance,'' Jake said
wryly.
</P>
<P>
   He loved his ``Star Wars'' work in England and Tunisia, and
prefers any acting job to being in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only in this business because I enjoy it,'' he said,
``traveling all over, meeting such nice people.'' He paused and
said pointedly, kidding his questioners, ``No _ I'm talking about
the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about the new film? ``Leaving when the shoot
ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing? ``All of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake said he hung out with his co-stars ``just like schoolmates.
I'd tell them riddles and not give the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He stumped the press with a question: ``In which film does Luke
Skywalker's landspeeder make another cameo?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this one,'' Jake said. ``When they first get to Mos Espa
(a city on Tatooine), there's a green landspeeder _ it's a
different color _ and it's his, the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake had done interviews for ``Jingle All the Way,'' so he was
prepared for a barrage of questions, not all of them smart.
</P>
<P>
   The ``stupidest'' question this time, he said, was, ``How do you
feel about being Christ?'' (Anakin is called ``the chosen one,''
and his birth is likened to an immaculate conception.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's not a bad thing being Christ, but I'm not
Christ, OK? Personally, there's Christ, Jesus, George (Lucas) and
so on,'' he said, motioning downward with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The most hilarious question, he said, was, ``What do you look
for in women?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 10!'' Jake shouted. ``I don't look for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when not working, he rides his bike, plays with
friends, cares for his shih tzu (``You'll have to edit that part
out'') and tackles video games, especially a new ``Star Wars
Podracer'' game he received before its May 20 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only kid in the world who has it,'' he said with
mischievous glee.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas also sent him a box of ``Phantom Menace'' toys and his
Jedi costume from the film.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, Jake said, is being recognized in public or
stalked by fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People waiting outside your hotel _ that's kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   He did visit fans lined up in front of a theater in Hollywood.
``They're doing it for a good cause _ every hour they spend means
money going to charity _ so what the heck. Make it worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   At home with his parents and sister _ who's 7 and has a bit part
in ``Phantom'' _ life is more normal. Jake watches ``The Family
Guy,'' prefers ``The Lord of the Rings'' to comic books, and loves
playing with his ``Star Wars'' toys. He's an ``A and B'' student
and will begin fifth grade this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he resists doing chores, and his mom has to remind him
he's not a movie star so much as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that only comes up when we need to open both doors to put
my head through,'' Jake said, then added with a sly smile,
``Otherwise, I'm the perfect little angel.''
</P>

WORKING _ AND LOVING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 10 months Martha Finney has been traveling around the
country in search of everyday people who love their work.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Finney, and at first glance her theory _ that there are
ordinary people who are truly happy at work _ seems naive,
especially in an era of rightsizings, downsizings, and skyrocketing
executive pay.
</P>
<P>
   But 20,000 miles after Finney hit the road, the 43-year-old
Maryland woman has managed to find many people motivated by the
intrinsic value they've found in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it really presumptuous to think that happiness is not
always determined by where you are on the organizational chart or
how much you make?'' Finney asked during an interview. ``What about
ordinary people who love what they do?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years ago, journalist Studs Terkel set out to
chronicle the work lives of regular men and women. Their comments
were published in a tome whose offerings foreshadowed some of the
discontent average working Americans have today.
</P>
<P>
   Terkel's interview subjects included prostitutes and bartenders,
salesmen and housekeepers, nurses and nannies _ people whose
stories rarely made the front page of any newspaper. The result was
a gritty account, not what anyone would call joyful but remarkably
real.
</P>
<P>
   Finney, co-author of the book, ``Find Your Calling; Love Your
Life,'' has different stories to tell. In addition to the book,
Finney has posted 20 upbeat profiles of working people on a Web
site (www.heartlandatwork.com). These people don't seem to be
worrying about where to find their next meal or their next job,
though a good number of them are, as Finney says, ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   During her travels, Finney talked to a worker at an animal
shelter, a carpenter, a beekeeper, a community relations
representative, a makeup artist at a department store, a mystery
writer, an occupational therapist, two innkeepers, and many others,
each time focusing on the satisfaction they've found doing what
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studs Terkel painted the other side,'' Finney said when I
asked her about the many everyday people who labor under poor
conditions, or whose contributions go unrecognized. She noted,
however, that dissatisfaction with her own job as a human resources
management writer prompted her to quit and launch her cross-country
trek.
</P>
<P>
   While Finney might be criticized for ignoring low-wage workers
in deadend jobs, it appears that her goal was to find people doing
interesting, if not high-paying, work. But perhaps it's time for a
reality check. An animal lover who eschews higher pay to work in a
shelter because he or she loves animals has made a choice,
something a non-English-speaking maintenance worker struggling to
feed a family on $20,000 a year doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is something refreshing about these
tales. Take Lori Risner, a thirtysomething occupational therapist
in Chicago who has been plying her trade for 11 years. When she
started, the pay was low _ about $18,000 _ but the personal rewards
were high. Today, occupational therapy graduates are in such demand
they are wooed with $10,000 sign-on bonuses and $40,000 salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I applied to the (training) program, you went into the
profession because you loved working with people,'' said Risner.
``Now, schools are keeping demand high by severely limiting the
number of students. Hospitals are offering bonuses, or they are
offering to pay the last year of tuition after a student
graduates.''
</P>
<P>
   That disturbs Risner, who says working with people not only
increased her self-confidence, it made the work worthwhile. ``The
students I get now are not people people,'' she told Finney. ``They
don't think about what they are saying to patients. They just focus
on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to feel real dedication for work? Finney
believes workers must first respect the entity they work for and
its mission. Secondly, they must feel that they, too, have garnered
the respect of an employer who is interested in their growth on the
job. Thirdly, they must feel the work they do is important.
</P>
<P>
   Former carpenter Gordon ``Ike'' Brainerd, 64, of Branford,
Conn., found work that fit most of those criteria. Fifteen years
ago, he was walking in the woods with his wife when he discovered a
bee hive. Fascinated, he took it home. Brainerd had also befriended
a local beekeeper in his community who had cancer and could no
longer care for his hives. ``Doctors had told him to stay away from
the hives because they were concerned he would have an allergic
reaction if he was stung,'' recalled Brainerd. ``Six months later,
he died and left me nine hives, with about 60,000 bees.''
</P>
<P>
   When Finney visited Brainerd and his hives, he added another job
satisfaction criterium to the list. ``There always has to be a
mystery to a thing,'' he said. ``If you knew it all, there wouldn't
be a challenge anymore . . . There isn't any point in doing
anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While some low-wage workers love their jobs, it's hard not to
add decent pay and benefits to the satisfaction criteria list.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Boston preschool teacher Kamalah Fletcher, then 22,
told me about her job at a day-care center. She said she loved the
children. She also said she was leaving. ``People don't value the
work we do with young children,'' said Fletcher, who was selling
sporting goods on weekends to supplement her $9.37 per hour wage.
``They see us as baby-sitters. There is a lot more to it than that,
but you can't live on the money. It just isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's work experience had made her think more seriously
about getting a degree in early childhood education. That way, she
reasoned, she could do work she loved and get the pay and
recognition she needs to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Extract from Fletcher's experience one more thing to add to
Finney's criteria: education plus training equals opportunity, more
options and, if you're lucky, real joy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ In December 1997, when the cappuccino
machine first appeared at the headquarters of Yahoo Inc., it didn't
deliver quite the jolt that executives had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were e-mails to me and everybody saying this is
rubbish,'' recalls company president Jeff Mallett. ``Why are we
wasting money on a cappuccino machine? Let's put it back into the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when workers learned that Yahoo founders David Filo and
Jerry Yang had paid for the machine from their own pockets did
their outrage subside.
</P>
<P>
   It's plainly one of Mallett's favorite stories, part of the
Yahoo mystique. Here's one of the Internet's premier firms, a
company with a stock market value of $30 billion, and it still
revels in its scrappy image.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. Because Yahoo and other elite Internet firms can't
afford to forget that they're in the fight of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the high values the market has placed on Internet
stocks. Most of the high-flyers earn slim profits, if any. But the
stocks stay up thanks to investors who believe that some of these
hot companies will still be hot _ and profitable _ a few years down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully believe that many of the Web companies that we see
today will become mammoths of the next millennium. But many more
will cease to exist,'' says Bob Davis, chief executive of Waltham,
Mass. Web service Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Already there's a top tier of firms like Yahoo, Amazon.com and
America Online Inc., companies so well entrenched that only a drop
in the IQ of top managers could kill them. The eBay auction site
has established itself as the standard by which on-line auction
sites are judged. Other companies, like Lycos, have built huge
audiences but are still trying to lock down a position of industry
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Pay close attention, and it's clear that all of the hot Net
firms have bet on a set of basic strategies they think will assure
their survival and dominance over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Web titans seem to face a simple problem:
Anybody can do what they do. Internet access and Web technologies
are available to all. In theory, any small-timer with a good idea
could knock Yahoo or eBay off its perch virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's not that simple. Most of the leaders were among
the first in their niche _ Yahoo and Lycos in Web searching, eBay
in auctions, Amazon in retailing. In an infant industry, their head
start has helped establish them as recognized brand names. Now
they're spending millions to lock in their brands and freeze out
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's done it better than AOL. It was once dwarfed by firms
like Prodigy and CompuServe. But TV and print ads, and a tidal wave
of free AOL software disks have made the firm perhaps the
best-known name on the Internet. AOL's research claims that over
half of all Americans think of AOL when they think of the Internet,
while fewer than one-tenth think of Yahoo or Microsoft. Brags AOL
Interactive Services Group president Barry Schuler: ``America
Online, when it comes to on-line services, is the only company
that's a true national brand.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Internet companies are aiming to win superbrand status
for themselves. Amazon, for instance, is stifling a competitive
threat from rival on-line bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble.com by using
aggressive pricing and heavy advertising. Amazon's first-quarter
revenue of $293.6 million far outstripped Barnes &AMP; Noble's $32.3
million. David Risher, Amazon's vice president of marketing, says
the power of the Amazon brand deserves much of the credit. ``You
talk to a lot of people, they don't tell you they bought a book or
a CD,'' says Risher. ``They tell you they bought it at
Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Amazon regulars find it's ridiculously simple to keep on
buying. That's because the company created a system that memorizes
address and credit card data the first time a customer buys. To buy
another book tomorrow, there's no need to retype the data.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of another vital leadership strategy _ keeping it
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Early commercial Web sites were saturated with color photos and
dancing animated images _ stuff that can take forever to download
on a home computer. Yahoo was having none of it. ``Users don't want
that,'' Mallett says. ``What users want is fast, clean and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Yahoo has never strayed from its bland
blue-on-white graphics and near-total absence of graphics. And the
company still has a team of living, breathing humans at its Santa
Clara, Calif. campus who spend their days creating the Yahoo Web
index. Instead of overwhelming the searcher with millions of
``hits,'' Yahoo displays a list of categories that quickly guide
the user to the needed information. These days, practically every
search site on the Web emulates Yahoo's simple design.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity has its downside, though. If a visitor finds what
he's looking for, and immediately leaves, it's hard to make money
off of him. Successful Internet sites must get people to visit
frequently and hang around _ the better to sell them things and
flash ads on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``stickiness,'' and it's a crucial measurement of an
Internet company's success.
</P>
<P>
   In the stickiness sweepstakes, AOL's the one with the tube of
superglue. The company claims its 17 million users stay on the
service for an average of 55 minutes a day, far and away the best
performance in the industry. But remember that AOL, unlike almost
every other Net business, is more than a Web site. It's an Internet
service provider as well.
</P>
<P>
   Web companies that don't have their own on-line services need
other ways to build user loyalty. They're doing it by letting
visitors personalize the site. With special software, visitors to
Yahoo or Lycos can create their own custom Web page, with the
information and features that matter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants like Amazon build up a database of information about
everything the visitor has ever purchased. Return to the site and
you're greeted by name, and told about new products and services
you might want to buy. ``In a physical store, you can't be all
things to all people,'' says Amazon's Risher. ``In mine, you can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more notable are efforts by Web leaders to create on-line
communities, where visitors become participants in electronic
subcultures. Yahoo is spending $3.6 billion to buy the GeoCities
Web hosting site, where 3.5 million subscribers build personal Web
sites and maintain hundreds of communities appealing to a vast
range of tastes and interests. Lycos has done the same by acquiring
the Tripod and Angelfire Web hosting services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising community site is eBay. People come
to the Internet auction house in search of bargains, but thousands
stick around to chat. ``That is what eBay is based on,'' says Steve
Westly, the company's marketing chief. ``We are about changing
lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, eBay is one of the stickiest sites on the Web.
According to the research firm Media Metrix Inc., eBay's 6.5
million users in February spent an average of two hours a month on
the site. That's far behind AOL, but vastly better than most Web
properties. By comparison, Amazon holds its average visitor for a
mere 12 minutes a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is trying to find new ways to get visitors hooked. Born
as a bookstore, Amazon now sells recorded music, videos, flowers
and other gift items. In March the company launched a new auction
site to tap into eBay's market. Amazon even has a free service for
e-mailing electronic greeting cards. Risher says it's just one more
way to bring in visitors who might stay and shop.
</P>
<P>
   All the Web leaders figure that more is better, and they're
constantly adding new features. Search services like Yahoo, Lycos
and AOL's Web home page are now ``portals,'' with free e-mail and
Web page services, chat rooms, message boards _ anything that might
reel in more users.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a certain path to success. Yahoo's Mallett says
it's just too easy for Web firms to copy each others' innovations.
``We may have a 90-day advantage over some people . . . but that
would be a long time,'' he says. ``Most of the time, the next day,
AOL or Microsoft will pop up with a similar service.''
</P>
<P>
   But while flashy features may not give Web firms a lasting edge,
they do force competitors to play follow the leader. Fancy features
also screen out market newcomers. To take on a Yahoo or a AOL,
you've got to have at least as much to offer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was the daunting challenge that faced Lycos little more
than a year ago. One of the first search engines, it had become an
industry also-ran, its visitor count far behind Yahoo and AOL. Then
chief executive Davis got out his checkbook and bought several
major Web services, weaving them into a new Lycos Network.
</P>
<P>
   The push for eyeballs has paid off. Media Metrix recently found
that Lycos had edged past Yahoo in total visitors for the month of
March. ``I think what has proven to be the most challenging
issue,'' says Davis, ``is how to build and sustain a meaningful
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether an on-line company hopes to make money by selling goods
and services to consumers or advertising to businesses, the model
depends on drawing in millions of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a vast untapped Web audience in the United States,
where only about one-quarter of the population is regularly on
line. All the Web leaders are bombarding the masses with radio, TV
and print ads to tempt them to log on. But AOL is in the strongest
position to reach the unwired because it operates its own Internet
service, not just a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Mallett says that in five years, half a billion people
will be on line. Most won't be American. No surprise then that
Yahoo and every other major Web company is making aggressive moves
overseas. Yahoo has 18 foreign subsidiaries providing custom Web
content in Europe, Asia and Latin America. AOL's purchase of the
struggling on-line service CompuServe has made it a major Internet
provider in Europe. Lycos has 10 foreign sites. Amazon's biggest
on-line bookstores are in Britain and Germany and eBay is running
on-line auctions in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about locking in dominant market position. AOL, backed
by billions in subscriber revenue, has already pulled it off. It's
the standard that the other Web-based companies aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   That's why even now the Yahoo people work in an anonymous
low-rise building with cheap gray plastic chairs, preferring to
pump every spare dime into efforts to dominate one of the world's
most competitive industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a business,'' says Mallett. ``Everything
matters. Every single hire matters. Every single light bulb
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when you're already on top _ if you plan to stay there.

REGULATORS FACING A DIFFERENT KIND OF ON-LINE STOCK PROMOTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no way to start off a week like reading a piece of
electronic mail promising you the chance to make a quick buck.
</P>
<P>
   It caught our eyes Monday morning, the message promoting a stock
we never heard of called Rentech Inc. VSP Financial, another name
unfamiliar to us, said analysts predicted the stock could soar by
900 percent in the next few months and that regulators had
scheduled a May 20 meeting on a proposed Rentech stock promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Cold reality quickly set in. We were hardly the only people
receiving the message, e-mail that seemed to be spammed to half the
wired investing world. Worse, it was quickly being labeled in
Internet chat rooms as a sure P&AMP;D, short-hand for ``pump and
dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a darker side of on-line investing. Like the days of
brokerage boiler rooms, stock touts, and hard-charging brokers,
it's hard to separate the illegal from the simply shady or just
plain aggressive sales practices that are rampant on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same scams, new medium,'' said David Levine, a senior advisor
to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's director of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much new in terms of frauds you're seeing on the
Internet. It's just more cost effective to reach thousands of
people with a click of a mouse rather than incurring the cost of
running a boiler room,'' said Levine.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has twice conducted sweeps of Internet touts since last
October, rounding up people who allegedly promoted stocks on the
Web without disclosing they had been paid by those companies. Other
operators who simply try to inflate a stock by sending false claims
about a company to thousands of computer screens are another target
of enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   But a different kind of operator with just as much influence may
be beyond the grasp of regulatory action. They promote stocks via
e-mail or Web sites and disclose that they own shares or might hold
them. Those promoters presumably sell their investment at a profit
amid a sudden wave of demand from Internet day traders, the
so-called pump and dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like playing the dogs,'' said Matt Nestor,
chief of the Massachusetts Securities Division. ``If you catch it
right you might make some money. But clearly somebody at some point
is going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a suspect practice, but disclosure is everything in
the trading world. Once existing investments are disclosed,
liabilities faced by promoters may be greatly diminished. VSP
Financial, promoters of Rentech stock, told us upfront via e-mail
that it owned 20,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some regulators disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disclosing you're about to commit market manipulation is no
defense,'' said Bill McDonald, chief of enforcement at the
California Department of Corporations. ``These are not going to be
easy cases to make and we're going to need some new laws. Some of
the old laws may not fit very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: Are most of the wired buyers of an
electronically promoted stock really victims? Regulators and
securities lawyers privately concede that at least some of those
day traders aren't dupes, just gamblers who simply see a new game
beginning and believe they have the skill to get in and out quickly
enough to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   These are wired buyers and sellers who are too fast for the
day-trading moniker. They are known as minute traders and there is
a Web service that caters to them, recommending stock promotion
sites like Stock-Picks, Big-Picks, Great-Picks, and Hot-Picks,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Great-Picks site, like some others, announces days in
advance exactly when its next recommendation will be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the Internet stock hype cycle is often the
company whose stock is being talked up. But even executives at
those businesses are not unanimous in their victim status.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Rentech, the company that had been electronically
promoted to us and others. Trading volume of those shares went wild
on Monday, about 14 times higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The trading was halted at midday and company officials said they
could not agree with any wild stock-appreciation forecasts. The big
May 20 regulatory meeting wasn't about a promotion, it was
scheduled to debate the planned delisting of Rentech stock because
the shares had traded below the minimum $1 for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to make it and do the right thing and you've got
people out there tearing up the market, literally tearing it up,''
said Mark Koenig, a Rentech spokesman. ``The regulators will tell
you their hands are tied. They don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses like Rentech say they don't want to be
seen as a hyped company because there are 10 other stocks an
investor can buy in the alternative. But others say it's so hard
for a small company to gain visibility with investors that they
will take their chances with cyber promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Telident Inc., a Minneapolis high-tech company, were
among the leading small-stock gainers one day this spring when the
company was highlighted on Quiktrades, an Internet stock site, and
has since settled back to old price levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring some notice of stocks where it might not otherwise
be,'' said Telident chief executive W. Edward McConaghay. ``Are
they buying ahead and then putting words out to capitalize on it? I
have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who said he operated the Quiktrades site denied that it
was geared to minute-trading or that it had made money selling into
trading volume created by Quiktrade's own recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The man, responding by phone to our e-mail query, declined to be
identified. He said he hoped to make money on Quiktrade by
eventually charging for research but predicted that most
minute-trading sites would disappear soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest has waned tremendously,'' he said. ``On the first one
I saw, stocks would go from 1 to 9. Now if you look at the
performance of these sites they're lucky to get a quarter point off
the recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Rentech shares, which doubled from 7/16 to 7/8
Monday, slipped back to 9/16 Tuesday. The company said it has
turned the case over to regulators.

NOT ALL CONFLICT IN THE OFFICE IS BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems as if everyone gets stressed out at
work these days, and the natural reaction is to do whatever you can
to avoid conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Work is tough enough without increasing the potential for
arguments and _ God forbid _ more stress. Besides, you can't lose
an argument if you don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Can you? Of course you can. If people married never argue, it's
usually because one spouse gives in all the time. Resentment
builds, and the result is either an unhealthy marriage or a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people with healthy marriages owe part of their
success to knowing how to disagree _ and how to make up. You can
have effective conflict at work, too, if you follow these rules of
engagement:
</P>
<P>
   _ Appreciate the value of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even Einstein wasn't brilliant at everything.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a good boss, you hired smart people. They didn't
suddenly become morons once you hired them.
</P>
<P>
   If people aren't coming to you with suggestions, it's a warning
signal. Think about how you reacted to earlier ideas. Did you
reject something without really trying to understand why the person
suggested it? Did an idea threaten your fragile ego? Did you try to
shape the idea into something that would work? Did you tell the
person why you rejected it? Any decently run company should have at
least an annual survey or some forum for workers to make
constructive suggestions, even if it's nothing more than an
old-fashioned suggestion box _ assuming someone in power actually
reads the suggestions. Labor unions should, too; otherwise union
leadership can lose touch with the needs of a changing work force.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be constructive.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go to your boss with problems. Go to your boss with
suggestions for resolving problems. Period.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to criticize an employee or co-worker, try to use it
as a teaching opportunity. Explain how things would be better next
time if they were done a different way.
</P>
<P>
   And whether you're a boss or employee, make sure you have all
the facts before you criticize. Even if you think you know the
answers, ask questions first. Why did the company implement this
policy? Did the employee understand what was expected? Are ulterior
motives involved?
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick your spots.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a reputation as a whiner, bosses aren't likely to
listen. If you constantly criticize employees, people get numb to
your suggestions. Think about the people you're criticizing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Are they generally good workers who deserve the benefit of the
doubt? If you embarrass people by criticizing them in front of
others, they'll remember the embarrassment (and anger toward you) a
lot longer than they'll remember the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hand out a lot more praise than criticism? Do you let
people know that you appreciate their hard work? If your supervisor
does something that you like, do you say so? If you've shown that
you're generally supportive of people, they're more likely to
listen to criticism with an open mind instead of reacting
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   If you praise people every day for routine tasks, though, it can
backfire. You start sounding insincere. If you praise everybody for
everything, what do you have left for someone who does something
special?
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're wrong, admit it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest things to say is ``I screwed up.'' People try
to justify what they did or didn't do, which just makes the
conflict last longer. If you're a good worker and your company
fires you or disciplines you for making an honest mistake, you're
better off elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Apologies are like sushi: They're great when they're fresh, but
tend to smell funny after a few days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't dwell on conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether you have won or lost a conflict, don't keep
bringing it up unless the circumstances have changed dramatically.
You're either rubbing it in or whining, neither of which will do
you much good.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from one who obsesses on problems way too much: You're
better off if you can think about the conflict long enough to
present a good case, but then let it go and move on with your life.
If your job is 80 percent good and 20 percent bad, don't let the 20
percent dominate your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   For therapy purposes only, you might consider buying ``Voodoo
Lou's Office Voodoo Kit'' for $9.95 from www.runningpress.com. Yes,
it does include a voodoo doll.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   How you handle conflicts is often more important than the
conflicts themselves. You won't win every fight or get every
promotion, but you can always earn respect.
</P>
<P>
   Issues come and go. Reputations endure.

   LIFE AND DEATH IN IRAQ: A nation sagging under the weight of
sanctions
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, foreign editor of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
and Post-Intelligencer photographer Dan DeLong recently spent two
weeks in Iraq to report on the effect U.N. sanctions have had on
Iraq's people, most notably its children.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and DeLong traveled with a delegation called Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility. They returned with a
compelling portrait of how the fabric of family life has been torn
as children are forced to drop out of school and find work and how
thousands of malnourished children are dying every month because of
a lack of medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   And from Washington, D.C., Post-Intelligencer Washington
correspondent Michael Paulson explains how economic sanctions have
become increasing common _ and cotroversial. With innocent people
in the tareget countries and at home often bearing the brunt of
sanctions, Congress and the White House are poised to change U.S.
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer plans to move this special
package with photos and graphics for clients of the NYTimes News
Service today for immediate or for weekend use. All stories,
whether datelined Baghdad or Washington, D.C., will move in the
``i'' category. If you have any questions on the stories, please
call Veronica Villarreal at (206) 448-8342, or Bob Schenet at (206)
448-8037. Other questions, call the N.Y. Times News Service at

</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ART (Baghdad) _ At Al Mansour Pediatric Hospital,
malnourished children lay on stained mattresses. The hospital is
dark; electrical power is cut periodically each day to conserve
resources. Moving from bed to bed, Dr. Tarig Al-Shujairi lists the
illnesses: typhoid fever, pneumonia, leukemia, tuberculosis,
cholera. A nurse runs by carrying a small bottle of oxygen. Nemya,
a blond 2-year-old with meningitis is unable to breathe through the
fluid clogging her bronchial tubes. Her father and mother stand at
the side of her bed while the nurse covers Nemya's face with the
small oxygen mask. It is too late. Nemya's chest heaves, her body
shakes, and she dies. Her mother pulls her scarf close about her
face and cries silently. Her father looks at a visitor and touches
his chest over his heart. A fifty-cent tube could have saved her
life, but the hospital has none. Impossible to obtain under the
sanctions, Al-Shujairi says. Such is life _ and death _ in Iraq
under the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War.

</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-VIGNETTES-ART-2 TAKES (Undated) _ Walid, 14, and his
brother Ramy, 15, have been working the streets of Baghdad for
eight years, the same length of time sanctions have been in place.
They live in a dark two-room apartment with three younger
stepbrothers and their mother and father... At a school not far
from the Palestine Hotel last month, dozens of smiling students
welcomed American visitors warmly, then sang songs about Saddam
Hussein and about killing American invaders. Nothing personal was
intended; it was just the morning ritual...Star-dash anecdotes on
daily life in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   By Larry Johnson. Photos by Dan DeLong.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-FIXES (Washington) _ In Congress, the critics of sanctions
are pushing several pieces of legislation that would exempt food
and medicine from sanctions, or that would require congressional
approval and impose sunsets. From politicians to grass roots
activists, there are more and more calls to get rid of a program
that critics say does more harm to innocent people than achieves
its stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SANCTIONS (Washington) _ Since the end of the Cold War, the
U.S. and the U.N. have increasingly resorted to embargoes and trade
restrictions as a way of attempting to force change in countries
whose policies they don't like. The breadth of sanctions is
staggering: 42 percent of the world's population now lives in
sanctioned countries. Now, sanctions are coming under assault by
the business community and from those who argue sanctions hurt
civilians, not political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Paulson. (Story will move in the ``i'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Gerri Haynes a nurse from Woodinville,
Wash., and executive board member of Washington Physicians for
Social Responsibility, said she saw the delegation's trip to
Baghdad ``as an awakening more than an act of civil disobedience.
We can go back to the United States and say to people that the
economic sanctions on Iraq are having a horrible effect.'' Capsules
on the 22-member delegation to Baghdad, which included doctors, a
veteran, a peace activist, a writer, an artist and a medical
student, and why they made the trip.

   BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME OF THE ACCOMPANYING PHOTOS:
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old boy battling what doctors think is typhoid fever is
held in the arms of his weeping aunt in a Baghdad hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the same hospital, a fly crawls on the face of a 19-month-old
Ahiam Fazel, one of the many malnourished youngsters at Al Mansour
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The father of 2-year-old Nemya grips her death certificate while
talking to a doctor moments after she died from meningitis in a
quarantined room at the hospital. A 50-cent tube could have saved
the youngster's life, one doctor says. But the hospital has none.
Impossible to obtain under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the floor of a classroom, second-graders listen to a
lesson at Am Jad Al-Qadeseh, a primary school in Saddam City, the
poorest section of Baghdad. Many classrooms in Baghdad are
overcrowded, with two or three students sharing one desk and others
forced to sit on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A tattered piece of corrugated cardboard serves as a book cover

 &UR; FUTURAMA
</P>
<P>
   BY PO BRONSON
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turn of the Century,'' Kurt Andersen jacks you into the
nerve center of the media society and pins your eyelids open until
you go nearly blind with overload. He achieves this with just
old-fashioned black lettering on consecutive white pages -- no
shocking glossy photographs, no soundtrack, no hand-held video
clips and no Web site. He wins back terrain for the novel that has
been ceded to new media, demonstrating that the novel is as alive
and as nimble as its high-tech competitors.
</P>
<P>
   This big, sprawling book targets the great infotainment economy,
principally Manhattan -- in midtown and Silicon Alley -- Hollywood
and Las Vegas. The novel is set one year into a slightly satirical
future, when clothing catalogues are headed by prestigious magazine
editors, BarbieWorld has opened in Vegas and there's a 24-hour
cable channel devoted entirely to raw footage of celebrity parties.
Prostitutes not only have to pretend to enjoy sex, they have to
pretend to be impressed by beer connoisseurship. Somewhere in the
background, Al Gore is running against George W. Bush and the
Chiapas rebellion has evolved into a war.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan power couple George Mactier and Elizabeth
Zimbalist are the book's central characters. George is a television
producer for the emerging network MBC, the Mose Broadcasting
Corporation. His specialty is blurring fact and fiction, weaving
live video of drug busts into his serial episodes of a narcotics
squad -- but the show's ratings are dwindling. Elizabeth is a
Silicon Alley C.E.O. with a secret sense that work is a ``big
make-believe game, dress-up Monopoly.'' She's met her revenue
expectations with a Y2K software solution and now has to keep the
numbers from falling off in the post-millennium. The pressure would
be greatly relieved if she just sold out to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   George and Lizzie are decision makers, never having to actually
do anything; but their hollowness is masked by working in creative
fields. They survive the stress by defusing everything with verbal
wit. Their harried lives have the feel of jump cuts or channel
surfing; one second Lizzie is screaming at the bait-and-switch
tactics of Microsoft's negotiation team, the next second she is
babbling on the phone with her daughter, ``Hello, my baby-duck!''
George and Lizzie spend a great deal of time debating whether they
might be incrementally happier if they moved to Redmond or Los
Angeles. They live with an instant feedback loop, where their
adventures are hinted at in New York Post gossip columns and they
must fend off Time magazine reporters begging for exclusives. Their
overly precocious children make documentary videos, act in plays,
sneak in overtime programming for porn sites and make insider
trades in mock-investment clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble starts when it turns out that Microsoft is
interested in Lizzie's company only because she's got an inside
track on a brilliant scientist's patents. When she finally meets
with him and thinks he's just another obnoxious nerd, Microsoft
hangs Lizzie out to dry. Meanwhile, George has come up with a new
show that is too much of a hybrid between a fictional news show
like ``Murphy Brown'' and the evening news to avoid the
condemnation of every news purist in town. When the head of
George's network, Harold Mose, discovers that acquiring Internet
companies does wonders for his lagging stock price, it's only a few
months before he makes a generous offer to Lizzie. George ends up
far below her in the Microsoft hierarchy, and their marriage
becomes riddled with distrust. When his show gets yanked from the
air, he suspects Lizzie has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The satire is sharpest when Andersen takes us onto the sound
stage of George's show, right into story editing meetings and
negotiations between stars over their lines. Similarly, the
portrait of Lizzie managing her company at the point it must choose
between an I.P.O. or acquisition exit strategies is dead on. Option
traders and computer hackers alike are drawn in vivid, accurate
detail. Andersen, a columnist at The New Yorker and former editor
of Spy and New York magazines, layers his writing as if he's on the
record, off the record and on deep background all at the same time.
And into this realistic scenario he throws outrageous gags -- the
first pig-to-human liver transplant, live broadcasts of Charles
Manson parole hearings, cat-telepathy experimentation, cemetery
tombstones with built-in video screens. All of it is played
straight, with the laughs swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence'' is the driving force behind the future Andersen
portrays. While other writers might see our world as splintering,
to him it's a melting pot in which even the pot is melted. Fact is
converged with fiction, people behind the scenes are part of the
scene, the Net is like television, and today is a lot like the
future. The characters have such nomadic backgrounds that they
obliterate categorical stereotypes. Lizzie is a ``yoga-practicing
Jew married to a lapsed Unitarian, whose children attend a
nonreligious Episcopal school.'' Oh, and George has a handicap --
he lost a hand in Nicaragua covering the contras as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In this future, careers become the new ethnicities. Andersen
gets a kick out of tuning in to the different languages spoken by
programmers, executive assistants, arbitragers, M.B.A.'s and
Hollywood producers. These languages overshadow differences due to
race or religion. So Lizzie's programmers from India, Germany and
Minnesota all understand when one of them says, ``The transition
vector is totally in the application heap!'' but they most likely
wouldn't understand the question, ``How are your direct reports
incented?,'' as Lizzie does, and certainly none would understand
what George means when he says that a rival show ``only got a six,
nine.''
</P>
<P>
   The limitation of a Zeitgeist novel is that an accurate portrait
of today can quickly feel dated and lose all its kick by the time
it's out in paperback. Andersen has managed to hoodwink this
trade-off. He's got a book chock-full of references to today that
stick out like neon Post-It tags -- Dharma Minus Greg'' on
television, Morcheeba on the CD player, George Stephanopoulos at
parties -- yet he's infused it with so much inventive imagination
that it transcends all that. This book's vision of next year will
last a good five to seven years. It's a book that should be put in
a Manhattan time capsule with the note: ``This is how we lived at
the turn of the century. And yes, we really talked like that.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point I didn't want the novel ever to end -- but I was
only on page 200, with nearly 500 more to go. A couple hundred
pages later I was wishing I was there already. Andersen doesn't
employ literary devices to condense time or abbreviate plot, so
every chapter is laden with his exhaustive deconstruction of the
moment. The high ratio of pause-button analysis often keeps us from
getting caught up in the characters and the story. ``Turn of the
Century'' starts to feel like a party where all the guests are
trying to prove how smart they are. A recurring theme is how cell
phones and E-mail accounts can't save us from old-fashioned
misunderstandings, and in fact aggravate them. The one extended
drama comes when George, unable to talk openly with Lizzie about
his suspicions, uses every bit of technology he can to spy on her.
Here, we feel the author's hand (or perhaps his virtual robohand).
Author ex machina.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem with the novel's length is that people may buy
the book but then only pretend to have read it. That would be too
bad, because in the last 100 pages a suspenseful plot breaks out.
Computer hackers who work for Lizzie hatch an elaborate prank on
Bill Gates, and the pages fly. No technology is beyond Andersen's
amusing powers of observation. He reveals how every newfangled
communication device requires its own little ritualistic suspension
of disbelief -- from how we answer cell phones to how we log on to
computers to how we get sucked in to television shows by teasers.
We live constantly interrupted by this technology, and he's managed
to write a book portraying our fragmented lives that is not itself
fragmented. In other words, he's shown that the novel is flexible
enough to encompass the chattering of its electronic cousins and,
in the end, to hush them.

 NO SHAME IN MY GAME

   The Working Poor in the Inner City.
</P>
<P>
   By Katherine S. Newman.

 &UR; FLIPPING BURGERS
</P>
<P>
   BY JASON DEPARLE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Katherine S. Newman got the inspiration for this book in a
Harlem traffic jam. Crawling crosstown in the back of a cab, she
stared out at one of the country's most famous pockets of poverty
and saw throngs of people heading to work, just as in blue-collar
neighborhoods. As it happened, Newman, an anthropologist now at
Harvard, was on her way to a conference on the poor -- the jobless,
welfare-dependent poor who dominate public discussion. ``What do we
know about the others, the hard-working people of communities like
Harlem struggling to get to work?'' she wondered. ``Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``No Shame in My Game,'' a study of Harlem fast-food workers,
Newman champions poor workers and seeks to reorient the poverty
debate. She wants to de-emphasize self-defeating behaviors like
teen-age pregnancy, and to stress what she sees as the larger
issues: the injustice of low wages and the apathy of more
prosperous citizens. These low-income workers ``are not people
whose values need re-engineering,'' she writes. ``They work hard at
jobs the rest of us would not want because they believe in the
dignity of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's effort to recast the inner-city poor as neglected,
working-class heroes fails on two counts. Even her highly
sympathetic portraits make many of them seem less striving and more
party to their troubled circumstances than she realizes. And the
world is not as unaware of their economic woes as she believes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is right to recognize that most poor people do work,
at least sporadically. The problem is that work alone often fails
to transform their lives. With tougher welfare laws sweeping the
country, this is a crucial point -- even programs that get people
into jobs may fail to uplift the ghettos. Newman argues that the
problem is mainly economics: low wages and scarce jobs. But her
findings suggest a more complicated set of issues. Newman and her
graduate students interviewed 300 workers and job applicants at a
fast-food franchise she calls ``Burger Barn.'' The students spent
four months working behind the counters, and the research team
followed 12 workers over a longer period. While Newman heralds the
``rich, detailed data that poured in,'' this is not a book of rich,
detailed portraits. The workers are known only by first names --
Jamal, Kyesha, Tiffany, Latoya -- and they blur together. There is
no narrative or human drama; the organization is topical.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Newman asks interesting questions, and some new
insights emerge. Examining the demeaned ``McJob,'' she finds it
more intellectually challenging and socially rewarding than most
outsiders would guess. Yes, abuse flows in from disgruntled
customers, including mocking peers. But the workers bond among
themselves to ``build a moral defense of their work.'' Yes, wages
are low and the work is hard. But the Burger Barn managers mix
profit motives with ``a missionary impulse'' toward rescuing
inner-city youth. ``The fast-food industry is actually very good
about internal promotion,'' Newman writes.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery of a management track is an interesting bit of
news, since these are supposed to be dead-end jobs. But like many
of Newman's findings, it is at odds with her larger view of a
class-bound society where opportunity is ``distressingly limited.''
She does not resolve -- often she does not even acknowledge -- such
contradictions. Newman argues that her Burger Barn workers are
filled with mainstream aspirations about school, work and family.
And she relays some uplifting stories of tenacity against the odds.
A particularly affecting tale involves William, a fat, bullied
teen-ager who takes refuge in his work despite the derision of
others his age.
</P>
<P>
   But Newman sees everyone she meets in a similarly flattering
light, as if she is afraid to make any judgments. ``Latoya does not
lack the desire to go to school, just the life circumstances that
would make more education feasible,'' Newman writes. What ``life
circumstances''? As a ``heavy partygoer,'' Latoya dropped out of
school at 16 and had a baby. Her mother said keep studying but,
Latoya said, ``I was like, 'Yeah, whatever.' ``She winds up with
three children by two or three men (the number of fathers is
unclear). Latoya is not even poor. While she earns about $15,000,
Jason, the father of her third child, is a union carpenter who
earns $15 an hour, or about $30,000 a year. Newman vigorously
defends the ``irregular social structures'' of the inner-city
family. But if Jason and Latoya would marry, their family income
would top $45,000. Finally they do marry -- and they escape
poverty. Jason's earnings are unusually high, but Latoya could
leave poverty even if Jason earned half as much. ``Irregular social
structures'' -- the lack of stable marriages -- are clearly part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Newman is particularly puzzling when she says American society
assigns low-wage workers ``the untouchable status of the Indian low
castes.'' In fact, support for low-wage workers has been growing at
a noteworthy pace. Two years ago, a Republican balanced-budget bill
found $24 billion over five years to subsidize health care for
low-income families. And that pales next to the $30 billion the
country now offers the working poor in annual wage supplements. The
program, called the earned income tax credit, provides annual cash
bonuses of more than $3,700 per family. This may or may not be
enough, but it is scarcely apathy or scorn. Newman races past the
program -- the centerpiece of policy toward low-wage workers -- in
two paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the workers she meets, Jamal steals her heart. She is
impressed by the ``doting love he has for his young wife,'' Kathy,
and finds him ``something of a hero'' for boarding a bus to a
minimum-wage job each morning at 5. But as Newman goes on to
explain, Kathy is not his young wife -- she is his girlfriend. She
ran away from home to join him at 16, and soon they had a child.
The infant was put in foster care after Jamal apparently struck
her. His temper ``has its explosive side,'' and he has had problems
with cocaine. Newman sees Jamal as a striving worker blocked at
every turn. He has a less romantic view, describing himself as
``going from here to here to here, and doing this and that.'' It is
little wonder that he is adrift and depressed -- his mother is a
longtime crack addict, and he has never known his father.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Jamal has appealing qualities and untapped gifts; many
needy people do. No doubt better jobs would help. But as Newman
inadvertently shows, his problems stretch far past Burger Barn.

 &UR; OUT OF DARKNESS
</P>
<P>
   BY ELLEN FELDMAN
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As man has progressed from the wheel to steam to silicon chips,
each generation has believed its technological revolution would
change the world and perfect it. History chronicles the changes;
perfection has proved more elusive. Human nature tends to be
techno-resistant, even in forward-looking, turn-of-the-last-century
Buffalo, the setting of ``City of Light,'' an ingenious first novel
by Lauren Belfer.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa Barrett, headmistress of the exclusive Macaulay School
for Girls, is a ``wise virgin,'' unmarried, dedicated to her work
and not above feigning a Boston marriage with an old college friend
to facilitate her movement among the powerful men of the city
without arousing the jealousy of their wives. Louisa is dedicated
to subverting the injustices of society by opening the minds and
inciting the ambitions of her young charges. But her real passion,
and therefore vulnerability, is her goddaughter, the 9-year-old
Grace Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's mother has recently died, and Grace's father, Tom, who
has risen from an impoverished childhood in Ireland ``by his wits,
the gossips said -- and the way they said it was not entirely
complimentary,'' has buried his grief in his work as director of
the hydroelectric power project at Niagara Falls. Tom is a dreamer
as well as an entrepreneur. Once he has banished darkness by
bringing electric light to the masses, he explains to Louisa,
``people won't be afraid anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa overhears an argument between Tom and one of the
``engineer heroes,'' as the newspapers have branded the breed, and
the engineer's body turns up beneath the ice of the Delaware Park
lake. She begins to suspect Tom is not the altruistic visionary he
seems. And when a visiting newspaperman turned art photographer,
who is connected to the city's elite but manages to look ``like a
tousled, world-weary Lord Byron,'' asks for her aid in following
``a trail of money, power and avarice,'' Louisa is torn between
exposing evil and protecting her goddaughter and herself, between
trusting a man to whom she is intimately connected and one she has
just met.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere Louisa turns, conflicting claims cloud her once-clear
vision. The Niagara Preservation Society asserts that God is on its
side in the battle against capitalist greed, but a young man, who
may or may not be a union agitator, asks Louisa, ``Isn't it God's
work we're doing here, by making light?'' White laborers on strike
for better conditions assault blacks who move in as scabs, the only
work they can get. And a high-strung young art teacher paints the
hydroelectric stations as ``cathedrals of power,'' what Louisa
terms ``symbols of the holiness of man's endeavors,'' but the
teacher bursts into tears at the thought of what Louisa calls ``a
future that turns the sublimity of Niagara into grinding wheels.''
Even electricity, she tells us, ``seemed like magic, but . . . was
science. Magic had become science, science had become magic,
anything was possible, and the future was ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit of optimism, the city gears up for the Pan
American Exposition, a monumental and ruinously expensive
celebration of technological advance and human progress. But as
President William McKinley arrives to throw the switch that will
put Powerhouse 3 on line, the kidnapping of one of Louisa's
students, a granddaughter of the leader of the local black
community, and a young Polish-American anarchist intent on
assassination threaten to turn the long-awaited exhibition into a
national embarrassment. With the future of the power station and
the prosperity of Buffalo hanging in the balance, the city fathers
close ranks to protect their investment and prerogatives. It is
not, Louisa learns, the first time they have taken the public good,
and her welfare, into their tainted hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Light'' rests on prodigious research. The novel teems
with arcane information and is alive with historical figures who
mingle seamlessly with the fictional characters. At its heart is a
brilliantly realized set piece starring Grover Cleveland that comes
as a complete surprise, yet has been carefully foreshadowed. It is
a small gem, almost a separate short story, that is wickedly
relevant to the headlines of that era, as well as to this one.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the machinery of the power station roars through the
pages of the book, so the mechanisms of the novel occasionally
clank noisily. Belfer seems to be moving the characters around to
accommodate a mystery plot that is more convoluted than involving.
Louisa keeps chanting her fears of deception and disaster in a
running monologue of Gothic foreboding. Moreover, the two men who
vie, albeit with halfhearted interest and at surprisingly
infrequent intervals, for Louisa's affections represent competing
worldviews; they are not convincing characters who might actually
be interested in snaring a feisty feminist schoolmarm. Perhaps
Belfer intended the triangle as a sendup of the romantic fiction of
that period (and this), but the love story lacks the ironic
undercurrent that would give bite to such a satire.
</P>
<P>
   Belfer's heart is clearly in the right place, on the side of the
oppressed immigrants, workers, and women of a century ago, but her
sensibilities occasionally slip into the wrong era. Louisa's
musings on what happens to lively little girls when they approach
puberty sound as if she had got her hands on an early draft of the
study by the American Association of University Women, and an aging
feminist's railings against her young counterparts, who take their
advantages for granted, are a slap at current postfeminist
sentiment. Occasional references to ``wheedling and dealing,'' a
child's need for help ``with her mourning,'' an ``upwardly mobile
life'' and ``disposable income'' are jarring anachronisms in a book
that evokes the clothing people wore, the buildings they inhabited
and the streets they walked in such rich and authentic detail.
</P>
<P>
   Though historical fiction, like the writing of history itself,
tells as much about the time in which it is written as the period
about which it writes, there are two approaches to the genre. One
plunges the reader into the past without conscious concession to
the present. The other draws obvious, if unexpressed, parallels
between the two periods. ``City of Light'' is an appealing and
authoritative example of the second school. A huge, sprawling
portrait of the United States at the turn of the last century,
illuminated by a dazzling image of light and progress, and
harboring a sly dark secret, the novel is didactic in the very best
sense of the word.

 &UR; A DEATH IN THE EXTENDED FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   BY SYLVIA BROWNRIGG
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The idea that friends are taking the place of family in people's
emotional lives has become widespread, as a wealth of literary and
cinematic productions attests. (See the sitcom ``Friends'' for
further reference.)
</P>
<P>
   Meg Wolitzer's previous novel, ``Friends for Life,'' traced the
relations among three women who'd been close since girlhood. Her
new novel departs from that scenario to ask: What happens to
friends for life if one of those lives abruptly ends?
</P>
<P>
   Wolitzer opens ``Surrender, Dorothy'' with an affectionate
portrait of the ``lofty and sacred'' relationship of 30-year-old
Sara Swerdlow and her best friend, a gay playwright named Adam
Langer. But by the end of the first chapter, Sara is killed in a
car accident on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sara and Adam (who emerges from the crash with only a few
bruises) had been out buying ice cream to bring back to the friends
with whom they've rented a ramshackle summer house, as they do
every year. When the landlady refuses to refund their rent, the
survivors decide to stay on for a monthlong wake of drinking,
grieving and reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so ``Big Chill.'' Wolitzer's cast includes Sara's friend
Maddy; Maddy's husband, Peter, and their baby, Duncan; as well as
Adam and his handsome new boyfriend, Shawn. To break up the
couples' tidy symmetry, Wolitzer introduces Sara's mother into the
mix. Natalie, a feisty travel agent, was particularly close to her
only child. Mother and daughter had been almost inseparable since
Natalie's divorce, when Sara was small. Now Natalie hopes to find
solace in the place where her daughter spent so many carefree days.
</P>
<P>
   Wolitzer's strategy is to stage the strange, fierce jealousies
over the newly dead as an intergenerational conflict. She describes
``a heated, furious competition, and the theme of it was: Who owned
this broken girl now, her mother or her closest friends?'' Yet
she's so eager to explore this tension that she coasts past Sara's
actual death, thereby cheating the reader of a central emotional
episode. Natalie is allowed just a few brief sentences as she views
her dead daughter. Then, after a sketchy funeral, she's prompted to
seek out the ``kids'' her daughter knew.
</P>
<P>
   The easygoing 30-year-olds obligingly include Natalie in their
parties, clubbing, drug taking and even some late-night romantic
fumblings, all the while persisting, with oddly adolescent
propriety, in calling her Mrs. Swerdlow.
</P>
<P>
   After some uneven scene setting, the ensemble piece begins, and
here Wolitzer finds her pace. Adam has been called ``the gay Neil
Simon,'' and Wolitzer shares her character's knack for wry comedy.
Her comfort with gay-straight friendships brings to mind the
affable novels of Stephen McCauley. She is easy and astute in her
cultural observations, whether on the strains of creative life (the
Broadway success that inhibits Adam and inspires envy in Shawn),
the neuroses of new mothers (Maddy is tormented by a guilt-inducing
book called ``The Upbeat Baby'') or a friendship between Natalie
and a rediscovered girlhood friend, now rich. ``If you ever want to
talk,'' she tells Natalie helpfully, ``or if you want a helicopter
ride, or a facial or anything at all, I am here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolitzer's amiability proves something of a liability, however,
given the novel's somber theme. Even her lines on grief have a
punchy quality, as when she remarks, ``Grieving parents never found
their footing, never found their feet, never even found their
shoes, but simply stayed in bed forever.'' Wolitzer is adept at
banter, but she stumbles into awkward, implausible dialogue at
moments of crucial revelations or during heart-to-heart talks.
</P>
<P>
   And Sara remains blurry. This, of course, is partly the point:
to examine how each of these characters needed and in some sense
created her. We know that Sara was beautiful and sexy and smart (a
graduate student in Japanese history), but only because we are told
she was. The occasional flashbacks don't bring these qualities to
life.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Sara's mysterious melancholy seemed to be her
near-oppressive closeness to her mother _ their secret salute,
``Surrender, Dorothy,'' resembling the coded song of the women in
``Friends for Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried within this affecting novel is the troubling question of
whether close friendships and close family ties can keep a person
from finding romantic intimacy. Wolitzer's Sara didn't live long
enough to explore that possibility. Perhaps her survivors will be
luckier.

 THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE

 &UR; ONE DOLLAR, ONE VOTE
</P>
<P>
   BY JOSEF JOFFE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   What is globalization? Here is one of the best answers. It is
the ``constant revolutionizing of production'' and the ``endless
disturbance of all social conditions.'' It is ``everlasting
uncertainty.'' Everything ``fixed and frozen'' is ``swept away,''
and ``all that is solid melts into air.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you have read this before. It is from the Communist
Manifesto, by Messrs. Marx and Engels. One hundred and fifty years
ago, they marveled at a ``constantly expanding market,'' the
``daily destruction of old established industries,'' the emergence
of ever ``new wants,'' the ``universal interdependence of nations''
and ``intercourse in every direction.'' Substitute 21st-century
English for the Marx-speak, and the Manifesto would read as if
written by Andy Grove, Bill Gates or John (``Megatrends'')
Naisbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, go back 500 years for the real birth of globalization.
After a millennium of slow change or none, the explosion of science
and technology during the Renaissance, as well as the invention of
modern banking, cranked up the Western wealth machine, which is
still accelerating. The great discoveries beginning in the 15th
century brought the Americas and the far side of Asia into the
not-so-global market that was Europe plus the Mediterranean. So
what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   First, a few things have changed since Vasco da Gama and Karl
Marx. It is now a few industrial revolutions later, and with the
exception of Africa, the Islamic Middle East and central Asia, the
market has become truly global. For the first time in history, it
operates like one big domestic market. In the past, trade was
complementary and compartmentalized. It was Sheffield steel for
Indian silks, and the two worlds never really met. Today, trade is
competitive while ``center'' and ``periphery'' are one. Bombay and
Seattle produce the same high-value-added software that they sell
to each other and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, things have revved up. Communication is now virtually in
real time, but the more interesting event is the implosion of
costs. Already in Marx's day, telegrams crossed oceans and
continents, if at prohibitive prices. Real relief came only in the
last part of this century. Indeed, the Internet, another word for
communication at zero-marginal cost, is still in its toddler age.
But the message is plain. If anybody can communicate, anybody can
leapfrog time and space.
</P>
<P>
   These dimensions have shrunk in yet another way. The cost of
modern transportation, with jets setting the pace, has dropped
precipitously, especially relative to the value of traded goods.
Back then, it was grain for pig iron, heavy stuff that was
expensive to lug around. Today, it is pricey chips that take
pennies to ship -- or bytes moving around at no cost whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, finance. Indeed, when we ponder globalization,
especially since the Asian crash of 1997, we think mainly about
that legendary trillion dollars said to circle the planet each day
-- docking here, escaping there. The reason is the progressive
liberalization of capital markets since 1945, taking us back to the
borderless world before 1914 -- with a twist: there is a lot more
gelt glutting the globe, and instead of traveling as letters of
credit on ships, the money zooms through glass fiber nets.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it all mean? For the general reader, Thomas L.
Friedman, in ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' delivers the best
(and most enjoyable) answer yet. A seasoned journalist and a
columnist for The New York Times, Friedman knows how to cut through
the arcana of high tech and high finance with vivid images and
compelling analogies. But his mind is too analytical to churn out
the ``globaloney'' that clutters so much reporting today. His
approach, perhaps inspired by his friend and theology teacher Rabbi
Tzvi Marx, is a Talmudic one. It is homily plus dialectics. It is a
torrent of stories, vignettes and anecdotes, but each with a larger
conceptual point attached. And the dialectical habit injects just
the right dose of caution. Friedman does not take the obvious for
an answer, nor does he hype a historical triumph where there is
only a tiny trend; relentlessly inquisitive, he will always sniff
out and bring in the countertrend. This adds a fine intellectual
edge to a delightfully readable book.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite stories (with a powerful moral) concerns the
Prime Minister of Thailand, to whom Friedman confesses: ``I helped
oust your predecessor -- and I didn't even know his name. You see,
I was sitting home . . . watching the Thai baht sink (and watching
your predecessor completely mismanage your economy). So I called my
broker and told him to get me out of East Asian emerging markets. I
could have sold you out myself, via the Internet, but I decided to
get my broker's advice instead. It's one dollar, one vote, Mr.
Prime Minister. How does it feel to have Tom Friedman as a
constituent?''
</P>
<P>
   Once you join the global economy, it is the ``equivalent of
turning your country into a public company,'' the author notes, and
whereas in centuries past, the ``public'' was a few dozen banks,
now anybody can play, provided he has a computer and some spare
cash. Which leads directly to my other favorite morality tale, this
one about the Malaysian autocrat Mahathir Mohamad, a most voluble
enemy of the open global system.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman recounts how Mahathir, at the height of the 1997 Asian
crisis, kept accusing the Jews and George Soros of deliberately
debasing the Malaysian currency. So his advisers finally went to
him with a warning that probably sounded something like this:
``Look, you said this about Soros on Monday, and the Malaysian
ringgit fell to here. You said this about the Jews on Tuesday, and
the ringgit fell to here. . . . SHUT UP!'' The moral? The market
rules.
</P>
<P>
   This point is not totally new either. Marx and Engels
confidently predicted the ``withering away of the state'' as
ultimate victim of an almighty economic ``substructure.'' Friedman
overstates, too, when he claims that ``all world leaders'' have to
think like American state governors now, meaning that their ``main
job'' is keeping investors happy while ``constantly living in dread
that they will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Has globocracy really emasculated presidents and prime
ministers? The Talmud cautions, '' 'For example' is not proof.''
Take the seemingly tell-it-all example of Mahathir. Sure, he was
punished by the ``electronic herd,'' as Friedman calls the fickle
nomadic horde of global investors. But then Malaysia struck back.
When it largely unlinked from the global financial system it reaped
not devastation but a rising ringgit and stock market. Nor has
Mahathir's grip on the country weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Another countertrend is the European Union, now dominated by
leftist parties that have hardly capitulated to capitalism. One
ambition behind the euro is that the common currency will soften
globocracy's knout while tax harmonization within the E.U. will
discipline those companies that would wiggle out from under the
grasping hand of government by escaping to low-tax member states.
Watch also for attempts to slap punitive exit taxes on capital.
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't quite true that globalization is like the daily
dawn, about which ``there isn't much I could do,'' as Friedman
asserts. Nor is it quite true that ``your politics shrinks'' as
``your economy grows.'' Though globocapitalism severely constrains
some political choices, the state is not withering away. Indeed, it
is flourishing nicely, taking an ever bigger bite out of gross
domestic product. In Europe, the state now grabs a bit more than
one-half, up from less than one-quarter 50 years ago. If the state
is dwindling, how come it spends and regulates so much?
</P>
<P>
   But Friedman is far too perceptive to fall for such fallacies.
So elsewhere in the book he calls the state bashers ``dead wrong.''
In fact, because of ``globalization and the increasing openness of
borders, the quality of your state matters more, not less.'' Failed
states like Russia screw up hopelessly in the global market because
there is no oversight, no bankruptcy law, no legitimate power that
enforces contracts and protects investors. Crony-capitalist
countries in East Asia have learned a similar lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization has been around for 500 years, but right now we
are surely witnessing the most tumultuous part of an ancient drama
because what we call globalization is driven above all by
technology. That force, especially information technology, is
transforming itself and the world with extraordinary speed. So
Friedman may be right when he predicts, ``You ain't seen nothin'
yet.'' In the meantime, he has written a brilliant guide for the
here and now.

 STASI
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police.

 &UR; A NATION OF SPIES
</P>
<P>
   By Belinda Cooper
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Following the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, East German
dissidents fought for and won a broad right of access to the
material left behind by the East German secret police, the Stasi.
Since 1992, hundreds of thousands of people have viewed the files
of that enormous bureaucracy of espionage and internal repression.
The result has been an outpouring of books and articles in Germany,
and some in the United States and England, on numerous aspects of
the Stasi. Thus anyone announcing possession of ``the untold
story'' of the Stasi is making a large claim. Unfortunately, John
O. Koehler's ``Stasi'' fails to live up to its ambitious subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information Koehler offers on Stasi espionage and
support for terrorism is already known. His chapter on internal
repression, the most disturbing aspect of the Stasi, covers only a
few spectacular and oft-reported stories, barely touching on the
agency's more Orwellian activities, like its use of tens of
thousands of domestic informants (though his estimate of as many as
two million informers -- one in ``any party of 10 or 12 dinner
guests'' -- is greatly exaggerated, according to the agency that
catalogues the Stasi files). While the details gleaned from Stasi
files and interviews with former officers are occasionally
illuminating, the author's readiness to take even self-serving
statements at face value detracts from his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dearth of English-language literature on the Stasi,
these weaknesses might be forgiven. But more problematic are the
book's blatantly ideological underpinnings. Koehler, a former
correspondent for The Associated Press in Germany and a director of
communications under President Ronald Reagan, surrounds his
narrative with the frequently inaccurate generalizations and
cliches of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Koehler informs us that the Stasi was ``worse than the
Gestapo,'' quoting the Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal in support.
East German leaders were ``on a par with Hitler's gang,'' and Stasi
crimes were ``as brutal as those perpetrated by their Nazi
predecessors.'' In the book's melodramatic last lines, the
autobiography of the spymaster Markus Wolf ``has become a best
seller in Germany. So was Hitler's 'Mein Kampf.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which one can legitimately compare the Nazi and
Communist systems has generated extensive scholarly and popular
controversy. The secret services of dictatorships undoubtedly share
many features. But simply equating the Stasi's behavior --
intrusive and brutal as it was -- with the unrestrained torture and
murder and ultimately with the genocide perpetrated by Hitler's
security forces is patently wrong and does little to further
understanding of either.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler needs a Stasi that matches the evil of the Nazis in
order to maintain his us-against-them view of the world. If the
Stasi chief Erich Mielke can be likened to Heinrich Himmler, there
is no need to delve into the moral ambiguities of, for example, the
Allies' postwar recycling of Hitler's espionage service (which he
mentions) or the return to positions of influence of former Nazis
in postwar West Germany (which he does not). In fact, gray areas
never trouble Koehler's narrative: the African National Congress in
South Africa is ``Communist-controlled'' and ``terrorist''
(incredibly, the word ``apartheid'' never appears); it is suggested
that an American scholar who maintains personal contacts with East
German professors is a ``nave, muddle-headed, liberal academic.''
</P>
<P>
   Such simplistic language is inexcusable, regardless of one's
political convictions. The Stasi certainly deserves condemnation.
But Koehler's failure to examine, even in passing, any of the
historical, social and political contexts in which the East German
secret service flourished does a disservice to the writing of
history. It also leads to a book that avoids addressing any of the
fascinating questions the Stasi raises about the workings of
dictatorship, the reasons for collaboration, the motivations for
dissent and the factors that contributed to the Stasi's demise as
well as to that of the system it served.

 VERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov).
</P>
<P>
   By Stacy Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Random House. $27.95.

 &UR; NABOKOV'S PERFECT READER
</P>
<P>
   BY LYNDALL GORDON
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Vladimir Nabokov thought of writing a novel about the love
life of Siamese twins, his wife, Vera, put a stop to it. When ``Tom
Sawyer'' was proposed as reading for the Nabokovs' 12-year-old son,
she refused it on the ground that Tom takes to girls at too young
an age. Why then did Vera do her utmost to back ``Lolita,'' her
husband's 1955 novel about the lechery of middle-age Humbert
Humbert with his 12-year-old stepdaughter?
</P>
<P>
   This admirable biography of Vera offers answers -- most
obviously, her worship of what she perceived to be her husband's
superior art -- but, rightly, Stacy Schiff does not attempt to
explain away the enigma that Vera presents.
</P>
<P>
   In her earliest manifestation, a Jewish girl wearing a mask
recites Nabokov by heart when, in 1923, she makes her dramatic
approach to the aristocratic, Cambridge-educated writer, a
beautiful man pursued by cuter women and already a figure among
Russian expatriates in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Vera's performance as the voice of his art, her
``understanding,'' proved magical to Nabokov, who was at that time
mourning a broken engagement to the desirable and popular Svetlana
Siewert (whose photo, printed here, teases the viewer with the
naughty glamour of a grown-up nymphet in socks and braids tied with
bows).
</P>
<P>
   In her place Nabokov found himself confronted by a faceless
``fairy tale'' of a girl who had the power to transform herself
into the artist's dream of the perfect reader. Vera offered to
ground this higher dream in practicality: Nabokov needed comforts,
he told her, ``for the sake of not thinking about them.'' So Vera
took over wage earning in the troubled Berlin of the late 1920's
and early 30's, as well as other distractions: ``From the list of
things Nabokov bragged about never having learned to do -- type,
drive, speak German, retrieve a lost object, fold an umbrella,
answer the phone, cut a book's pages, give the time of day to a
philistine -- it is easy to deduce what Vera was to spend her life
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her management recalls Jewish tradition, in which a wife honors
a luftmensch by freeing him of worldly burdens. This is a
high-minded dream, and Nabokov continued to pursue nubile young
women.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage in 1925 was unannounced, and in 1934 Vera managed
to conceal her pregnancy until her son was born. A later disguise
was as a silent Polish princess acting as ``assistant'' to Nabokov
when he lectured at Cornell in the late 1940's and early 50's,
switching on lights and ready with quotations, but really (as
Schiff astutely suggests) she provided attentive reflection of
Nabokov's stature in a way that spurred him on.
</P>
<P>
   She fell in love with his work, and it remained the passion of
her life. This makes an absorbing story, illumined by Schiff's
flair for the succinct insight: Vera, unlike her husband, was
``less interested in costumes than disguises.'' Yet ``Vera'' will
not reveal the substance of her passion to people who haven't read
the novels. Instead it details the trivia that surround
publication. With the appearance of the scandalous ``Lolita,'' the
biography slows to the pace of a train stopping at many stations;
many passengers -- interviewers, sycophants of celebrity -- crowd
on board, while Vera's final, more banal appearances are recorded
at length: the sophisticate in mink and the widow orchestrating a
posthumous legend through denials of truth.
</P>
<P>
   No one, according to Schiff, ``is so much a character in someone
else's drama as the new immigrant.'' Vera remakes herself
repeatedly as the couple move from Berlin to Paris to America and
finally back to Europe. In America she is a vocal faculty wife --
disconcerting the guests at Cornell dinners with her McCarthyism
and preference for J. D. Salinger over Jane Austen. Her performance
made it ``difficult to determine who was starring in whose fiction:
America in the Nabokovs', or the Nabokovs in America's. Neither had
a vaguely accurate idea of the real life of the other.'' Their
exile from Russia had followed on earlier marginal positions:
Nabokov's because his father had been a liberal aristocrat,
sympathetic to Jews; and Vera's as a Jew whose father, Evsei
Slonim, had studied at the University of St. Petersburg, shifting
from the shtetl to an urban merchant class -- fastidiously dressed,
with a neatly trimmed beard, educating his daughters at the
Princess Obolensky Academy, yet still unforgettably apart in
Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, then, by birth and training, the Nabokovs became
natives of their exclusive union. The view that Vera was ``just a
wife'' starts this biography with an ironic taunt, for no platitude
of wifely concern fits a human creature convinced that she has
joined with a god. Her self-effacement masked nothing less.
Poverty, debts and hideously furnished rooms in Cambridge, Mass.
(as they bided their time on the outskirts of Harvard), were
peripheral to their acts of transformation. For wherever they
stood, part of them wasn't there. They had something in reserve.
Call it art, pride, or their guardianship of the Russian
imagination (Pushkin, mainly, and Lermontov; excluding Dostoyevsky
and, emphatically, Pasternak, an archrival in the fame stakes of
the time), which they arrogated to themselves alone, savaging
others' translations. Their invincibility flashed its warnings in
Vera's flinty directness and Nabokov's impudent humor -- a double
act, conspiratorial, defiantly inexplicable, which empowered them
till he died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff persuasively pursues the expatriate phenomenon of ``rapid
acculturation and abiding separateness.'' This portrait of a
52-year marriage to a woman who was the writer's prime reader opens
up Nabokov's private life, complementing the two-volume biography
by Brian Boyd. But the triumph of ``Vera'' is not just in providing
entree to her famous husband. She fascinates in her own right as
the ``emigre'' of Berlin and Paris who appears in America a mere
``refugee,'' a white-haired wraith hunting butterflies in her odd
black dress. Here, she crossed a ``semantic divide'' that posed the
ultimate challenge of metamorphosis in the shadow of a dazzling
man. The lives of the obscure can be as intriguing as the lives of
the famous. ``The question now inevitably asks itself, whether the
lives of great men only should be recorded,'' remarked Virginia
Woolf, who, as always, anticipates us with her darting subversion.
``And what is greatness? And what is smallness?''

 &UR; CRANK CASES
</P>
<P>
   BY M. G. LORD
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Weschler, a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1981,
has the credentials of a literary insider. What makes his work
striking, however, is that he writes from the perspective of an
outsider. The subjects of Weschler's untraditional essays are
quixotic misfits, visionary flakes and a few freshly anointed
geniuses whom he managed to discover back when the world dismissed
them as cranks. The eight pieces in his absorbing new collection,
``A Wanderer in the Perfect City,'' are unpredictable in the way
that only the best nonfiction can be.
</P>
<P>
   No fiction editor concerned with plausibility would tolerate
Weschler's characters: an Indian schoolteacher who rescues a broke
Manhattan painter from obscurity; a rocket scientist who trains to
be a circus clown; a Russian music prodigy who passes his 10th
decade as a musical lexicographer in West Los Angeles. Weschler's
essays are also exquisitely written -- so perfectly and
unobtrusively organized that one can't imagine telling them a
better way. Weschler describes these essays as ``passion pieces''
about ``people and places that were just moseying down the street
one day, minding their own business, when suddenly and almost
spontaneously they caught fire . . . ending up, by day's end,
somewhere altogether different from where they'd imagined they were
setting out that morning.'' But they are united by another common
theme -- the triumph of the excluded and offbeat over the entitled
and entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shapinsky's Karma,'' which opens the collection, is a landmark
of anticelebrity journalism. It details the rise of Harold
Shapinsky, a dirt-poor second-generation Abstract Expressionist,
through the efforts of Akumal Ramachander, an English teacher from
Bangalore, India -- a story, as Salman Rushdie has put it, of
``European revenge'' against the hidebound New York art world.
Although Manhattan art dealers had dug in their heels against
Shapinsky -- if he were any good, how could they have overlooked
him? -- Ramachander orchestrated a breakthrough in England,
enlisting James Mayor, a London gallery owner, who gave Shapinsky a
show; Ronald Alley, a curator at the Tate Gallery, who sent
Ramachander to Mayor; even Rushdie, who persuaded Britain's Channel
4 television to profile Shapinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Weschler has a sense of humor about his subjects -- Shapinsky's
Karma'' opens with a series of phone calls from Ramachander, which
appear to arrive at either midnight or dawn -- but he never derides
them. He does suggest, though, that Ramachander's motives may not
be as pure as Ramachander contends. The Indian's quest for
attention outside his homeland may well be a response to its caste
system, in which, despite his drive and talent, he can never be
more than a provincial English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Weschler's best work is set in California or deals with
aspects of California culture -- for which Weschler, a native
Californian, seemingly retains affection. ``Gary's Trajectory''
exposes the inner workings of TRW, a West Coast aerospace
contractor, with which Gary Isaacs, an M.I.T.-educated rocket
engineer, grows disenchanted. Whether Isaacs is testing already
built spacecraft before launching or rescuing a satellite that
failed to deploy properly, Weschler makes his activities vivid and
comprehensible -- no mean feat with highly technical subject
matter. He does the same with the subsequent stops on Isaacs's
unlikely career path: Wall Street and the Ringling Brothers and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Clown College in Venice, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slonimsky's Failure'' brings together another odd bunch of
Southern Californians. After his wife's death in 1964, Nicolas
Slonimsky, a Russian-born composer, conductor, pianist,
lexicographer and Slavic language professor, accepted a position at
U.C.L.A. He forged a close if improbable friendship with his
Hollywood neighbor, the rock legend Frank Zappa, performing with
him at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1981. He also came to
rely heavily on his assistants, or ``odalisques,'' a bevy of
archetypal California coeds.
</P>
<P>
   Weschler's gentle treatment of his subjects could have been
inspired by Slonimsky. Instead of accusing Leopold Stokowski of
lying, for example, Slonimsky delicately notes that the acclaimed
conductor was ``born in London in 1882 but preferred to have
entered the world in Cracow five years later.'' Weschler also
plunges into the technical aspects of music, as he did with those
of rocket engineering. He argues convincingly that to Slonimsky,
music is a ``mathematical passion,'' not a sensual one. If, as
Leibniz has conjectured, music ``is a hidden arithmetical activity
of a mind that does not know it is counting,'' Slonimsky actually
``hears the counting.''
</P>
<P>
   Weschler's most affecting portrait may be of Art Spiegelman, the
creator of ``Maus,'' before he became a certified genius. Not that
long ago, he was a mere underground cartoonist, struggling to make
sense of his upbringing as the child of Holocaust survivors.
Spiegelman's conversations with his father about his experiences,
which became the core of ``Maus,'' were not merely a part of their
relationship; they were the entire relationship. Other
communication invariably left the two ``at loggerheads.''
</P>
<P>
   While reading ``A Wanderer in the Perfect City,'' I found myself
thinking of the Bhagavad-Gita -- not that strange an association,
since Ramachander often paraphrased its tenets. What struck me was
the idea of nonattachment: when it comes to work, the joy should be
in the doing, not in the gathering of rewards. One cannot force
one's work to be successful. Fruition requires an element of
``grace,'' in its original sense of ``gratis, for free,'' Weschler
writes. ``One works and works and works at something, which then
happens of its own accord: it would not have happened without all
the prior work, true, but its happening cannot be said to have
resulted from all that work, the way effects are said to result
from a series of causes.'' Rather, grace descends and, in ways that
can be as funny as they are extraordinary, what Weschler terms
``the humdrum'' takes flight.

<P>
   THE ORPHANS
</P>
<P>
   BY EMILY ARNOLD MCCULLY
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The powerful story of a resilient girl's moral awakening in the
context of family and community, ``Unbroken'' is set in 1910 in the
Vermont towns and hill farms that Jessie Haas knows to her marrow,
but it reverberates with universal meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Haas tackles themes of family responsibility, independence,
mastery, work and courage on the same small canvas in all her
books. Even her earliest chapter books for beginning readers, about
Lily and her mare Beware, are trenchant and entertaining, with
winning characters, strong plots and a wealth of expert horse lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbroken'' -- inspired, like Haas's earlier novel
``Westminster West,'' by a real-life Vermont story -- eloquently
links the fates of 13-year-old Harriet (called Harry) and her colt,
orphaned together in 1910. After delivering Harry to school in a
buggy, her mother forces the terrified mare, Belle, to pass an
approaching car. The horse shies and they are killed. Her ailing,
widowed mother had protected Harry from knowing that there are
debts and the house must be sold. Her mother planned for Harry to
be raised on a back-country hill farm by Aunt Sarah, who Harry is
convinced hates her. Why did Harry's charming, stylish, educated
mother consign her only daughter to a deeply rural life she herself
had fled, if only to a small town?
</P>
<P>
   In Haas's ``Uncle Daney's Way,'' the title character arrives in
a wheelchair, dependent on family charity, but he's a free spirit.
A character remarks: ``That's what used to make your grandfather so
mad. He worked hard all his life at a job he hated, and Daney did
what he felt like doing and was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Unbroken'' we meet Aunt Sarah, who scrubs her house with
cider vinegar and despises the values Harry has learned to espouse.
Like the grandfather who resented Uncle Daney, Aunt Sarah thinks
Harry should ``take up the life the Lord's given you.''
</P>
<P>
   The mean injustice of Sarah's ideas and her power over the girl
provoke a fury of righteous rage in Harry. Aunt Sarah dismisses the
notion of further education and taunts Harry with her own bitter
belief that Harry's mother had snagged her father in a shotgun
wedding. Harry is desperate to disprove the idea. It seems to call
into question everything she has taken as true. Furthermore, Harry
knows that without an education she is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Her only legacy is the unbroken colt, Belle's son. If she can
train and sell him, she can pay for school. But despite all her
efforts, the colt shies, even at hens. Will she repeat her mother's
mistake and be hurt or killed?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harry's Vermont world is not as limited as it seems.
The doctor, her friend's parents, even the driver of the car will
help her get the education she was meant to have. The challenge is
not to defy or even to overcome, but to comprehend. She realizes
that her mother, an impoverished widow, had decided to be happy
with her lot. She learns the truth about Sarah, who was also
orphaned at Harry's age and courageously raised four siblings, who
died of consumption. The knowledge brings shame and finally
reconciliation for them both.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle Harry doesn't have to overcome is self-pity. Her
self-consciousness is a necessary means of addressing the world and
finding her place in it. She is linked by common knowledge and
common trials to her forebears. Harry experiences terrible loss and
failure before she can move on. Willful rebellion matures to
compassion. Faithful to life's struggles and richly peopled with
flinty characters, ``Unbroken'' is a wise and satisfying novel.

<P>
   STRANGER IN HER OWN LAND
</P>
<P>
   BY MARGARET MOORMAN
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Masako is very clear about it. ``I'd rather have a turtle than a
husband!'' says the heroine of Allen Say's new picture book, ``Tea
With Milk.'' In spite of her protests, this independent young woman
is introduced to a banker chosen for her by a matchmaker. In Japan
around 60 years ago, when this story takes place, good families
proceeded with the business of love and marriage in this
time-honored way. Unfortunately, Masako has recently come to Japan
from America, where she was brought up. There she drove a car and
dreamed of college and a career in the gleaming city of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After the failed encounter, Masako announces with vehement
indignation, ``I won't marry a moneylender!'' The next morning the
otherwise obedient daughter boards a bus for another gleaming city,
Osaka, where she talks her way into a job at a department store.
Shocking! Young ladies in Japan did not work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, we've met this complicated individual before. In
Say's beautiful ``Grandfather's Journey,'' which won the 1993
Caldecott Medal, she was simply the grandfather's child, who in a
page or two grew up, married and produced a son -- now our highly
accomplished author and illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tea With Milk,'' Say elaborates on his mother's story,
pursuing the sort of character he clearly understands well: a
person whose heart is divided between one home and another. ``I'll
never get used to this place,'' Masako thinks as a teen-ager, when
her parents move back to Japan, their homeland, after decades in
California -- the place they presumably never got used to. Fellow
students in Masako's Japanese school are cruel in the expected
ways, calling her a gaijin (foreigner) and refusing to befriend
her. She misses her American neighbors, who called her May and fed
her pancakes, fried chicken and spaghetti. As she learns to speak
Japanese, handle a calligraphy brush, wear a kimono, bow politely
and pour plain tea, she remembers life in America and misses tea
with milk and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Milk'' turns out to be a spirited but very proper
love story. In Osaka, on her job, May meets another uprooted soul
like herself, a Japanese gentleman raised by English foster
parents. Like her, he takes his tea with milk and sugar. May's
rebellion, while tame by Western standards, has paid off --
handsomely, in fact, judging from her suitor's graceful features
and elegant bearing, as compared with the round face and large ears
of the matchmaker's spurned offering.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of Say's books have been praised more for their
limpid watercolor illustrations than for the writing, he is
actually a gifted storyteller. In a nicely ironic twist, Mr. Right
also happens to be a banker, so May marries a moneylender after
all. And the author creates a satisfying frame by beginning the
story in California, where Japanese is spoken in May's home and
English is the language of the wider world, and ending the book in
Yokohama, where May and her husband speak to each other in their
shared personal language -- English -- while committing themselves
to life in Japan. The restrained narrative is carried along on an
undercurrent of alienation, determination and romance.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with the illustrations in many of Say's other books,
the pictures in ``Tea With Milk'' are surprisingly wan and for the
most part dull. They are not stylistically different, but they lack
warmth. A few of them clearly had their genesis in snapshots from a
family album, and the sepia tones of nostalgia creep in from page
to page. Too many of the compositions are washed in browns and
grays, and too many are wide-angle shots -- the tan facade of the
department store, with dark windows, on a street where the plain
black cars of the era dominate the traffic, or three blank-faced
elevator operators in black uniforms, standing at attention in a
setting that is, again, mostly ocher, sienna and black.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Grandfather's Journey,'' the illustrations were the point,
and the story, while equally complex, was winnowed down to just a
line or two of prose on each page, employed like captions. But even
if ``Tea With Milk'' is visually only a shadow of Say's most
sumptuous books, including ``Grandfather's Journey'' and ``The Lost
Lake,'' it probably won't disappoint his fans, who will enjoy the
elaboration of a story they almost know and accept the
illustrations as mere accompaniments.
</P>
<P>
   As recent picture books about immigration go, there are cheerier
ones, like Arthur Dorros's ``Abuela'' and ``Isla,'' with their
throbbing, jampacked pictures by Elisa Kleven. And there are others
that seem more wrenchingly contemporary, like Michele Maria Surat's
``Angel Child, Dragon Child.'' But Allen Say's family history as
told in his two companion books somehow makes for intensely
memorable reading, as he records the individual longings, losses,
compromises and triumphs of lives lived between the poles of
adventure and tradition.

 &UR; AVOIDING A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   By Floyd Norris
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, just when Mexico seemed on the verge of entering
the economic big leagues, its currency suddenly collapsed and the
country entered a deep recession that would have been much worse
had not Washington put together a $50 billion rescue plan. The
blame was laid at the feet of Mexican authorities. They had allowed
Mexico to borrow too much and let the peso become overvalued. Then
they mishandled monetary policy and devalued the currency in a way
that proved they were inept.
</P>
<P>
   Having persuaded themselves that the so-called ``tequila
crisis'' was all about Mexico and not about the rest of us,
investors could go back to business as usual in the rest of the
world. And they could be stunned -- shocked, really -- when some
very similar problems devastated Asian countries in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, recalls in his excellent new book, ``The Return of
Depression Economics,'' that Guillermo Calvo, a prominent economist
then at the World Bank, kept telling people after the Mexican
crisis that while Mexico had made mistakes, the important question
was, ``Why was so large a punishment imposed for so small a
crime?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is neither simple nor certain. Part of it surely lies
in the way the world's financial system has evolved in recent
decades, with big flows of capital moving into countries that are
popular with investors and then moving back out again very rapidly.
As Krugman notes, countries with controls on capital movements have
tended to do better in the crisis environment than those without.
That is a long way from conventional economic wisdom, and is one
reason that reading Krugman as he glances over the economic history
of the past several decades is both enjoyable and
thought-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   The title may be a bit misleading. Krugman does not think the
world is about to descend into a 1930's-style depression. In fact,
he argues that such a fate can be avoided if we instead remember
the economic theories born of the Depression, most notably the work
of Lord Keynes. Depression economics, Krugman says, ``is the study
of situations where there is a free lunch, if we can only figure
out how to get our hands on it, because there are unemployed
resources that could be put to work.'' He thinks that in some
places, most notably Japan, it is time for government to actively
seek inflation. I think he is too severe on Japanese policy makers,
who finally are pulling out all the stops to get their economy
moving, but Japan would be in better shape now if Krugman's advice
had been heeded earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman argues that now, as in the 1930's, there is too much
emphasis on economic orthodoxy and on somehow restoring the
confidence of investors. To be sure, confidence is of immense
importance at certain times, and a major reason that country after
country suffered currency collapses was that investors took flight.
But countries facing crises now are not going to be any more
successful than Herbert Hoover was at winning confidence by
slashing public works spending while their economies stagnate.
</P>
<P>
   What appalls Krugman now is not the problems the world faces but
the reluctance to learn from them. ``Those who worried about
balanced budgets back when uncontrollable deficits were the problem
suddenly insist that raising taxes and cutting spending will
actually prevent a recession, because it will improve confidence,''
he says. ``Those who wanted stable prices back when inflation was
the risk now claim that 'managed inflation' will somehow
backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality to Krugman is that there are few, if any, economic
policies that are always right for all countries. What you should
do depends on where you are and on an ability to think clearly
about how you got there. There are times when capital controls can
work, and when they would be disastrous. There are times when fixed
exchange rates can work wonders, and times when they can blow up.
That is not the easy answer, but it is the right one.

 A PRAYER FOR THE DYING
<TEXT>
<P>

 &UR; A GOOD MAN MAD
</P>
<P>
   BY PATRICK MCGRATH
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Stewart O'Nan is a writer who likes to dig deep into the
quotidian soil where evil germinates, and who designs his
narratives so as to bring that evil to a full and ghastly
flowering. In other words, he earns his horror. He painstakingly
establishes the conditions in which ordinary individuals are tested
beyond their strength and then, trapped in webs of circumstance and
wrong thinking, turn their rage upon those they imagine to be the
authors of their misery -- or upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This design is most apparent in O'Nan's first novel, the solid,
measured ``Snow Angels,'' in which an inadequate and shaky man,
having embraced religion for the spiritual ballast he so
desperately needs, veers into madness after the death of his
daughter. In ``The Names of the Dead,'' O'Nan's impressive Vietnam
novel, it is the trauma of war that plants the destructive seed as
the author intercuts the vividly realized experiences of a young
medic in Vietnam with the same man's later attempts, back home in
upstate New York, to live with memories that threaten to overwhelm
him.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of O'Nan's fifth novel, ``A Prayer for the Dying,''
is similarly haunted, this time by memories of the Civil War. His
name is Jacob Hansen, and he functions as sheriff, preacher and
undertaker in the small Wisconsin town of Friendship. Jacob is a
man who worries constantly at the terrible knowledge of his past,
of the desperate things he had to do to survive that most grisly of
conflicts. As the novel opens, he must also contend with what seem
to be the punitive gestures of an angry God: the twin evils of
plague (in the form of a diphtheria outbreak) and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: The brush fires that threaten Friendship in
its long hot summer arouse in its residents the natural desire to
flee. Yet the quarantine imposed by Jacob to halt the spread of the
disease constrains them to stay right where they are. Jacob's
situation is an impossible one. Despite his deep religious beliefs
and his quiet grasp of the logistics of the crisis, he is not equal
to the stresses that are imposed on him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan has employed a surprising but ultimately successful
narrative technique for Jacob's story: it is told throughout in the
second-person singular and the present tense. Thus Jacob's
references to himself as ``you'' have a self-distancing effect; it
is as if he doesn't fully occupy his own being and observes himself
from some other place. He is both in his own experience and outside
of it. This is a fine perspective for a narrator who will be forced
to move from the orderly, predictable contentment of his life in a
placid 19th-century farm town to confront the appalling prospect of
chaos and destruction as the people around him sicken and die and
the brush fires advance ever closer.
</P>
<P>
   The character of this strange man -- loving father and husband,
conscientious sheriff and pastor, indefatigable builder of expertly
made coffins -- is established by means of oblique strokes. Jacob
communicates much by what he leaves unsaid, frequently brooding
about his idea of duty and his relationship with God and only
seldom letting us glimpse the darker images that skulk about in the
shadows of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan is a writer who in his past work has sometimes told us too
much about his characters, so the brevity and allusiveness that he
employs in the creation of Jacob Hansen come as a bracing
development. Jacob is skewed at a deep level, and our understanding
of just how skewed he is emerges so gradually, and so elliptically,
that the full impact is felt not in the direct telling but in our
sudden lurching grasp of just what this man has done -- and what he
is capable of doing -- as his world turns upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The horror, then, flares to life in the reader's mind rather
than on the page, just as it does in the work of a writer like M.
R. James, whose Edwardian ghost stories create hugely creepy
effects from the most minute phenomena. In all his books, O'Nan has
displayed an interest in the horrific, but he indulged it with the
most zest in a fast, dark novel called ``The Speed Queen.'' That
book was fashioned as the death-row memoir of a young woman whose
involvement in a botched robbery spiraled into an
amphetamine-fueled killing spree. The narrator of ``The Speed
Queen'' has sold her story to Stephen King, and she talks to him by
means of a tape recorder while awaiting the verdict on her final
appeal for a stay of execution. It is not the most elegant of
framing devices, nor is the spectacle of drug-driven bloody mayhem
especially edifying. Of more interest is the tone of the narrator,
her blandness, her moral vacuity, her lately acquired religiosity,
all the cheery banality of her stunted consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of a mind out of sync with the moral implications of
its own experience similarly permeates ``A Prayer for the Dying,''
but with a nuanced complexity that is altogether absent from ``The
Speed Queen.'' As the crisis faced by the township ratchets to ever
higher degrees of peril, so Jacob, somehow spared the sickness that
is rapidly carrying off his friends and neighbors, finds himself
thrust into the center of events.
</P>
<P>
   As he wrestles with not one but two destructive forces of
nature, the novel seems at times to expand to grand allegorical
dimensions, and the reader glimpses in poor Jacob an Everyman
confronted by powers he cannot control, powers that will surely
destroy him. He is also an Everyman in his attempts, in the midst
of so much unwarranted suffering, to fall back on a few flimsy
precepts about the nature of God and his own guilt-riddled soul as
he tries to determine the meaning of the disaster. It is hardly
surprising, then, that Jacob should lose his sanity, for Everyman
cannot really cope with sheer, blind, random meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   The manifestations of its narrator's madness are what lend this
short novel its Gothic originality and power. Jacob is a
God-fearing preacher, a good family man and an upholder of the law,
but by the end of the book there seems to be no moral taboo he has
not violated. He has not, however, committed his transgressions
with some great Nietzschean howl of defiance or even with the dumb
amorality of the death-row narrator of ``The Speed Queen.'' Rather,
he has sinned with the worried, puzzled, impotent earnestness of a
good man to whom bad things are happening on an appallingly large
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that Jacob is good? Because he loves his wife
and daughter and would do anything to protect them -- and, indeed,
all the townspeople -- from the encroaching evil. Once the
swiftness and deadliness of the diphtheria epidemic have been
established, it is enough for us to hear a woman cough to know that
she is doomed. When that woman is Jacob's beloved wife, Marta, and
their child is already mortally ill, we can almost hear the struts
of Jacob's being bend and crack. Although he himself does not
comment on that cough, we recognize his silence as the mark of his
denial. He will sustain that denial almost to the end, refusing to
believe that his wife has died and maintaining their domestic
routines as if she were still alive. It is in such situations, as
Edgar Allan Poe well knew, when the distinction between a living
woman and a dead one breaks down, that great sins may be committed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jacob goes about his work as conscientiously as he
knows how. He buries the dead and burns their houses. He preaches
to the survivors and maintains the quarantine. The flames of his
guilt about what he did in the war are fanned by what he can only
regard as biblical punishments imposed on the town by an irascible
Deity. At some level, he believes that the calamity is all his
fault.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a moment of grotesque surreality when a traveling
circus, complete with an elephant, attempts to pass through the
area and Jacob turns it back at the town line. At another point,
when the fires have almost reached Friendship, a flock of swallows
drops from the sky. ``They come down around you, their soft bodies
pelting your back. They cover the road, dead yet perfect. When you
bend to touch one, its feathers are hot, its eye boiled white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the Dying'' is that rare thing, a horror story
that achieves its effects by taking a narrowly circumscribed area
of human experience and expanding it to probe much larger
questions. By splicing together the themes of individual guilt,
belief in a merciful God and the destructive power of an apparently
malignant Nature, Stewart O'Nan has produced a fine, terse novel
about the circumstantial nature of evil and the terrible fragility
of man.

   BY VINCE PASSARO
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   One of the signal experiences of working at a literary magazine
in the 1980's was being on the receiving end of the serial
submissions of Stephen Dixon, who ranks up there in terms of
productivity with the giants of the trade, Joyce
</P>
<P>
   Carol Oates and John Updike, but who, in those days at least,
spent vastly more on postage.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, you might check the magazines credited with prior
publication on the copyright pages of Dixon's novel ``Frog''
(1991), which was nominated for a National Book Award. The journals
noted there include (starting from the top) Agni Review, Ambit,
American Letters &AMP; Commentary, Another Chicago Magazine, Asylum,
Beloit Fiction Journal, Boston Review, Boulevard, Caprice,
Confrontation and so on. Note, we have 23 letters of the alphabet
still to go here. All told, 35 literary magazines appear on this
list, and running your eyes past their names is like a brief ride
down the National Endowment of the Arts' memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   To a fiction reader working at one of these magazines, Dixon's
stories seemed to come in at a fantastic rate. They arrived in worn
envelopes, hastily addressed. The stories themselves were neatly
typed but often photocopied at odd angles, and clipped to them were
small, torn pieces of paper on which Dixon's quick and nearly
illegible scrawl appeared: ``Here's my latest -- Stephen.'' If you
didn't know who he was, you would have thought of him as an inmate
with typewriter privileges, a desperate voice from behind prison or
asylum walls, so driven and copious was the prose. Instead, Dixon
was at that time the second in command, under John Barth, at the
Johns Hopkins University writing seminars, among the most
prestigious graduate writing programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's newest books are ``30,'' which is subtitled ``Pieces of
a Novel,'' and ``Sleep,'' a collection of stories that span some 25
years of the author's career but have not heretofore been
collected. Much of ``Sleep'' feels as old as it must be; on the
bright side, a few of the stories remind you that Dixon in earlier
years resorted more to fantasy and a Middle American magic realism
than he does in his recent work, often with strong results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other Way,'' for example, is a story about a man searching the
roadside for a body in the bushes that he thinks he may have seen
earlier, a good Samaritan effort that turns into a dizzying
phantasmagoria of shadows, strange men and uncertainty. The best
piece in the collection is the title story, in which a husband goes
to sleep the day he buries his wife and feels as if, with them both
past suffering, he is about to rejoin her.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``30,'' which the reader takes to be all recent
work, nothing about the title, on investigation, proves to be true.
The numeral refers to the number of ``stories'' in what is supposed
to be a larger structure, though according to Dixon's
have-it-both-ways subtitle, something less than a novel. Adding to
the confusion is a tricky count. There are, actually, 29 stories,
each with a title, and then another 15 stories, also with titles
but gathered together as a subcategory under a single title,
``Ends.'' Thus, quite artificially, do we get ``30.'' None of this
genre-diddling has any effect. Dixon could as easily have called
the book ``44 Stories'' with no change in the reader's perception,
except that of having been saved the effort of trying to figure out
why the author called the book ``30: Pieces of a Novel,'' or what
feature distinguished the last 15 stories to make them substories,
or why, once so distinguished, they're collectively called
``Ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Frog, the eponymous hero of Dixon's earlier ``novel,'' was a man
with a wife and children and a career as a writer and teacher.
Nowadays, Dixon's character is named Gould. His full name is Gould
Bookbinder, a rather broad-fisted metaphor, and he is not only the
hero of ``30'' but of Dixon's last book, ``Gould.'' He also is a
man with a wife and children and a career that bounces from
journalism to writing to academia. The pieces in the book span the
years from his childhood to his mid-60's, and they are adamantly
not arranged by any chronology.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frog, Gould is mildly selfish, clumsy, ill tempered and
manic. He also thinks himself a wit, but Dixon puts us in the
awkward position of wondering whether the author finds him funny or
only portrays him as self-deluded on this score; Gould's gibes and
attempts at sarcasm are blunt and slightly off in the timing, like
the embarrassing dinner jests of a drunken uncle. Even the
characters around him don't seem to find him amusing.
</P>
<P>
   If the stories in ``Gould'' and now ``30,'' and also the pieces
in ``Frog,'' are not autobiographically based, they are strongly
autobiographical in flavor. Dixon's strengths as a writer -- the
quick revelations of a rushing, exhibitionist prose -- add to the
impression. Dixon's problem is that over a long career he has
relied on these strengths too heavily and repeated them too often;
he has turned them into mere affect. The run-on sentences, the
rapid-fire but mundane stream of consciousness, the apparently
frank but merely amphetamined dialogue that goes back and forth and
back and forth within page after page of unbroken paragraphs that
stretch as far as the eye can see: these devices are no longer
energized by an author who has anything fresh to say.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a taste from a segment of ``30'' called ``The First
Woman,'' when Gould, now 64, gets involved with a 23-year-old woman
after his wife has left him: '' 'I'm sorry, I don't always mean to
direct us, but the conversation's gotten too morbid, so can we
change the subject again?' 'Do you like movies?' and he said,
'Sure, some, who doesn't? though I prefer the older foreign ones in
black and white -- late 50's, early 60's, long before you were born
-- but I bet you like the new ones a lot,' and she said, 'Only if
they're good.' Has he seen . . .? and he said no, but does she
think it's worth going to? If she does he'll make a point of it,
and she said if he's serious about that she'll go with him, since
she wouldn't mind seeing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pieces, most of them, go on like this for pages. One long
story Gould tells his wife from his childhood is really a debate
about whether he's told her the story before, and about what she
remembers from the earlier telling. It ends with Gould addressing a
detail she doesn't think he's related, and offering his most
representative statement: He is sure he did mention the detail,
``because otherwise there wouldn't have been any point in telling
the story.'' You read this on page 62 of a 672-page book, and your
heart sinks. Exchanges like the ones above, and there are many, are
too easily achieved -- too easily typed, even -- and they're not
challenging to the reader or to Dixon himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the thread connecting these vignettes is sex. In the
first piece in ``30,'' a young Gould walks back to a girlfriend's
house and stops to watch a teen-age couple going at it in a car.
Hot and bothered, he tries to seduce the girlfriend when she comes
back from shopping, but only manages to annoy her and gets thrown
out. Other stories have him chasing a belly dancer on a cruise ship
and linking up, inexplicably given the conversation quoted above,
with that 23-year-old, who is the daughter of an academic
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   He watches women on the street, he thinks about them constantly
and drops many hints about a life of frequent masturbation. Gould's
lascivious nature is supposed to propel these stories and give them
what little power to shock that they have. But the sexuality is
bland and unsurprising; the cleaning up, one senses, takes longer
than the act.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is a second-tier member of what one might call the Horny
Old Men School of American literature. It's a group that dates back
to the 50's, when writers like Philip Roth, John Updike and Harold
Brodkey emerged, all of whom were horny old men even in their
youth. Especially in lesser hands, the world of the horny old man
gets reduced to two basic stories: that of wanting to bed a woman,
failing and being miserable, or of succeeding and being miserable.
The latter should make superior reading to the former, but Dixon,
even when he gives his old goat Gould a break, wearies his readers
before getting there. He drowns us in a flood of mind-numbingly
dull preparatory moments and never lets Gould, or us, enjoy the
ride.

   NEW KID ON THE BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   BY MOLLY E. RAUCH
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The gap between ideal and real behavior can be so acute that it
bends the mind. Carrie Schmidt, the protagonist of Lois Metzger's
rich and moving third novel, ``Missing Girls,'' has a strategy to
handle the pressure. ``Not on the map, not American, not foreign,
not home on the earth,'' Carrie keeps the world at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   While alienation is not unusual for a 13-year-old girl, Carrie
has more than adolescence to blame. She is the new girl at a new
school in Queens, where she has just moved in with Mutti, her
grandmother, who, to Carrie's embarrassment, ``practically wore a
sign around her neck -- IMMIGRANT.'' Her father, ``lost in a dark
cloud of silence'' since Carrie's mother died four years ago, works
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1967, ``Missing Girls'' is the story of how Carrie
manages to build a sturdy bridge spanning ``the pit inside her,
where her insides should be, the pit that had opened up when her
mother died.'' Metzger's admiration of young women, evident in her
previous novels, ``Barry's Sister'' and ``Ellen's Case,'' is taken
to new heights in the character of Carrie Schmidt. Carrie is a
genuine eighth grader: self-effacing, sometimes dishonest, generous
with her friends, dramatically moody, irresistibly sympathetic.
Tempted to divide the world into neat categories of good and bad,
she is often paralyzed by her inability to be the ``miraculously
pleasant'' girl of her imagination. In Metzger's nuanced prose,
Carrie's transformation from paralysis to vitality is so true to
the halting cadence of adolescence that her self-doubt and
confusion along the way are palpable.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Missing Girls'' opens, Carrie pays little mind to her
family's history; she has been ignoring it ever since her mother
died. But soon Carrie is forced to face the past. Her Viennese
mother was 12 -- younger than Carrie is now -- when Hitler invaded
Austria. She was sent to Scotland for safety, where she lived with
a beekeeper and his family. Now the beekeeper, Angus Fraser, has
decided to visit, instilling in Carrie a desperate and unspeakable
dread: ``I only know I don't want to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Angus's visit approaches, Carrie spends more and more time at
her new friend Mona's house. She wants to be a part of Mona's
family. She especially wants to have Mona's pretty, all-American
mother, Mrs. Brockner, for her own. Mrs. Brockner is ``the real
McCoy -- sturdy, bouncy, comfortable inside her own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie becomes so committed to being Mrs. Brockner's good girl
that she forgets the anniversary of her real mother's death. But
even as Carrie pushes her feelings away, she becomes fascinated by
the subconscious landscape of her own dreams, which she studies
obsessively.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger builds ``Missing Girls'' on the skeleton of dialogue.
Her conversations pump the story rich with oxygenated warmth.
Mutti, who was imprisoned and starved in nine concentration camps
during the war, tells stunning, immediate stories of the daily
horrors of the Holocaust. Mona, less than enchanted by her mother's
sleek exterior, talks frankly with Carrie about daughterhood. Even
Angus Fraser gets the chance, finally, to talk with Carrie about
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   It is through these connections with Metzger's fully realized
characters that Carrie learns to reconcile herself to her
imperfections. ``You're not a happy ending or a sad ending,'' Angus
tells her. ``You're a story-in-the-middle. That's what it is to be
young.''

 &UR; SOUTH SEAS GULAG
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Rosen
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When I tell people that the most exciting work of fiction I've
read in a long time is a tetralogy of novels about the emergence of
modern Indonesia, they tend to look at me with pitying stares. But
Pramoedya Ananta Toer's Buru Quartet, beginning with ``This Earth
of Mankind'' and running through ``House of Glass,'' is one of
those sprawling literary mansions, built of exotic materials, that
display the mysteries of a foreign culture while magically
containing rooms that seem designed with you in mind. Set at the
turn of the 20th century, the dawn of Indonesian national
consciousness, the novels tell the story of Minke, the only native
Javanese in an elite Dutch academy. An aspiring writer, Minke uses
his Western education to separate himself from the feudal Javanese
past, and his Javanese identity to rebel against the Dutch
colonialists, forging a complex identity -- personal, political and
literary -- that is something new under the sun. Before our eyes,
he becomes a modern man, the citizen of a country not yet born.
</P>
<P>
   Making these novels even more remarkable are the conditions
under which Pramoedya wrote them. Arrested in 1965 -- a year of
political turmoil that saw hundreds of thousands of Indonesians
murdered -- the 41-year-old Pramoedya, though never charged or
tried, spent the next 14 years in prison, 11 of them on Buru
Island, a penal camp in the Moluccas some 850 miles east of Java.
Denied paper or pen for the first few years of his incarceration,
Pramoedya, who was already one of Indonesia's best-known writers,
told his fellow prisoners the story of Minke each morning before
roll-call as a way to shape and remember the tale. The lines that
appear at the end of the first two volumes tell their own haunting
story:
</P>
<P>
   Buru Island Prison Camp, spoken, 1973
</P>
<P>
   written 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow tale of the author's suffering and survival is
fleshed out in ``The Mute's Soliloquy,'' a volume of memoirs
covering Pramoedya's years on Buru Island. Originally published in
a Dutch translation in 1988 and in Indonesian in 1995, the memoirs
have been translated now for the first time into English. (It is
worth noting that Pramoedya's books remain officially banned in
Indonesia, where Pramoedya himself -- in keeping with the
irresolution of his country's political present -- seems to be
regarded as a literary lion, a national treasure and an enemy of
the state.)
</P>
<P>
   Arranged roughly to follow the progress of his arrest,
imprisonment and release, the fragments bundled into ``The Mute's
Soliloquy'' are much more than a memoir of prison life. There are
autobiographical confessions, meditations on death and fate and
writing, harsh descriptions of prison life and sudden, dreamy
passages of intense lyrical beauty. These can just as quickly give
way to pages where Pramoedya (who even in his fiction can write
like someone who got his education from the encyclopedia) seems to
be accumulating an undifferentiated mass of information, like a man
keeping himself sane by constantly tallying the store of his mind.
But, as in his fiction, where a flood of information is often the
hard-won food of an awakening mind, these fact-packed passages have
a mysteriously touching quality, the product of a mind that even in
exile and isolation is determined to learn and record everything he
can. And Pramoedya seems so consumed with his idea of what an
Indonesian ought to be -- which in turn seems inseparable from his
notion of what being human is -- that everything he describes has a
kind of emblematic quality. He is, as a writer, remarkable for his
ability to give brutal realism a mythic dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya, as he is known in Indonesia (Javanese do not often
use family names), was born in the village of Blora in 1925, the
eldest of seven siblings (his name, he writes, is derived from a
phrase that means ``first on the battlefield''). His father was a
fierce Indonesian nationalist and educator, as well as a gambler
ultimately unable to support his family. Pramoedya, who writes with
outrage about the treatment of women in traditional Javanese
society, was much closer to his long-suffering mother, who died of
tuberculosis at 34. It was not until after her death, when he
visited her grave, that he learned her name -- such,'' he writes,
``was the fate of a woman of that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most moving in ``The Mute's Soliloquy'' are the letters
Pramoedya wrote to his children but never sent, convinced they
would not arrive. He dispenses fatherly advice (in one he gives a
daughter a social science lesson using his own imprisonment as a
model), explains his understanding of Indonesian history, reveals
snippets of his own past and gives glimpses of life on Buru. To
another daughter he writes of the ship that took him into exile on
Buru and of the lines of a Negro spiritual that haunted him and
gave him comfort during the journey. Changing keys abruptly, he
shares with her his diet of ``gutter rats, the moldy outgrowth on
papaya trees and banana plants, and leeches, skewered on palm-leaf
ribs prior to eating.'' He describes how one of the most educated
prisoners went about eating a lizard, breaking off the toe pads and
swallowing it whole, adding, admiringly, ``That man's will to
defend himself against hunger was a victory in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   There are far starker accounts of life on Buru, where the
prisoners labored to clear forests, pave roads, create and farm
rice paddies and build their own barracks, all the while suffering
severe malnutrition, repeated beatings and torture, as well as
periodic assaults from the native population, who in several
instances murder prisoners with spears and machetes. The book's
final section is a starkly eloquent list enumerating those who died
while on Buru.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pramoedya received permission to write, in 1973, his fellow
political prisoners built him a private room inside the barracks
and took on his chores so that he was free to spend his days
writing. It is one of the ironies of Pramoedya's irony-filled life
that imprisonment may have been, like Homer's blindness, a
mysterious precondition for the epic quality of his work, an oddly
liberating influence, though one for which he paid a terrible
price. His very career seems born of this paradox: he wrote his
first published novel, ``The Fugitive,'' in 1948, while imprisoned
by the Dutch for revolutionary activity and has, since his release
from Buru in 1979, apparently suffered bouts of writer's block.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``The Mute's Soliloquy'' was composed during Pramoedya's
imprisonment, not after his liberation, with the author constantly
afraid that his words would be confiscated and used against him.
(At the time of his arrest, Pramoedya's library was carted off and
destroyed, his manuscripts and papers burned.) In a sense this book
has been triply edited -- first, by the conditions Pramoedya wrote
under; second, by the authorities, who, at the time of Pramoedya's
release, confiscated and destroyed numerous manuscripts, including
several novels, part of an encyclopedia and hundreds of scattered
notes and papers; and, finally, by the translator of the work,
Willem Samuels. Samuels explains in an afterword that he eliminated
hundreds of pages that appeared in the Indonesian original of ``The
Mute's Soliloquy'' because they seemed too detailed for a general,
non-Indonesian audience.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book from which to gain a clear picture of modern
Indonesian history or of Pramoedya's place in it -- there is too
little context, too many gaps, including gaps about Pramoedya's own
fiercely political role in the cultural politics of the country
before his arrest. The book has a scattered, dreamlike quality. Its
tone and focus, though it seems churlish to say so given the
conditions of its creation, can vary wildly. What holds it together
is Pramoedya's remarkable voice, a peculiar mixture of modesty and
outrage, world-weariness and almost mystical innocence, historical
exhaustion and unkillable optimism. Doubly distanced from Western
readers by birth and exile, Pramoedya nevertheless speaks in a
voice of startling immediacy and has managed to produce a haunting
record of a great writer's attempt to keep his imagination and his
humanity alive under terrible conditions.

 &UR; SPRING CHILDREN'S BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   THOSE WEREN'T THE DAYS
</P>
<P>
   By Christine Stansell
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is a book of debunking. Norman H. Finkelstein believes that
kids need to be disabused of the view, pushed on them by
baby-boomer parents, that the 1950's and 60's were a golden time.
His goal is to assure children that the reverse is true; that like
a Florida condo village, the America of the 1990's offers a
splendid five-star way of life against which the postwar decades
look like a shabby tract-house development.
</P>
<P>
   In topical chapters, Finkelstein provides a counterhistory to
idealizations about how much better life used to be in the areas of
health, crime, diet and family life. Yet where, exactly, the myths
about the good old days came from and who, exactly, believes them
is never clear. Does anyone seriously tell children that ``people
were healthier'' in the 1950's, as the title of the book's first
chapter has it? Surely not the parents of the sophisticated
middle-class youngsters at whom the book is pitched. Those adults
are more likely to convey ambivalence about a period that mixed
strong doses of misery and repression with undeniable childhood
pleasures. Many, if not most, young adolescents today barely have
any fix at all on the postwar past; and what they do understand is
an amalgam of ``Grease,'' trinket-laden hippies and the angst of
the civil rights movement, more likely to provoke historical
judgments of ``weird'' than ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this widespread ignorance that makes the idea of
``The Way Things Never Were'' appealing. And there are moments when
Finkelstein succeeds, especially when he focuses on some
little-known piece of the past from a child's perspective. The
chapter on health begins promisingly enough with a description of
the polio epidemic of the early 50's. Finkelstein recalls the
worried parental admonitions that encoded fear deep in the mental
circuitry of early-50's childhood: ``Stay away from crowds!''
``Don't go swimming!'' He injects his own shot of horror -- always
a useful device in history for young people -- with descriptions of
polio victims entombed in iron lungs. Anecdotes of the
duck-and-cover exercises in the atomic bomb drills and the vogue
for ``dog tags'' strung around kids' necks (name, date of birth and
address could identify the charred body after a nuclear attack)
give a sense of how the big history of the cold war filtered into
the little histories of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way Things Never Were'' also introduces more general
perspectives -- on the dreadful eating habits of the 50's, for
instance, and the ubiquity of cigarette smoking. Finkelstein, a
school librarian in Massachusetts, is good on environmental issues,
re-creating something of the happy abandon with which America
strip-mined vast reaches of the upper South and Midwest, poured
noxious gases into the air and flung poisonous chemicals into
rivers. This material is useful for inquiring young researchers
looking for odd angles and, ideally, might even provoke talk
between young readers and parents who have their own, inevitably
more mixed, memories to recount.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the book amasses information that lends itself
to school reports rather than cover-to-cover reading or interested
questions. Many chapters repeat well-worn stories, already
available from better sources: the Montgomery bus boycott and the
civil rights movement, the advent of rock-and-roll, the events of
the cold war, the prevalence of neo-Victorian sex roles.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief problem is the monotony of Finkelstein's
relentless, invidious distinctions between the benighted past and
our unsurpassable present. In his eagerness to undercut one
mythology, he substitutes another, underwritten by a remarkably
smug belief in progress without pain. A paradigmatic example is the
tale he tells about travel in America.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane highways of the 50's appear in this book as
``crowded, narrow roads lined with dirty gas stations, 'greasy
spoon' restaurants and primitive cabins,'' to be pushed aside
providentially by the freeways. Thus into the trash bin of history
he tosses the fabled Route 66 as well as the myriad concrete
tracks, some of them plain and workaday, some of them enchanting,
that webbed the country. Wonderful books have been written about
the visual delights, curiosities and lingering joy of these
journeys -- as well as the carsickness, itchy boredom and racial
harassment people experienced on the road. But ``The Way Things
Never Were'' sets the travel Zeitgeist moving ever upward,
presumably to reach its zenith on Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the simplicity of the idea of ineluctable progress, it
is not the best hook for teaching history to children. History
books that provoke and enthrall young readers succeed by showing
that in some way they missed out on something. Good history, for
kids as well as adults, reveals the unalterable pastness of the
past -- the past as a foreign country, with its own logic, laws,
pleasures and sorrows, woven together in an intricate pattern of
human achievement and defeat, creativity and banality. Its lesson
is that change involves shifting quotients of loss and gain.
</P>
<P>
   The history is there to be taken on its own terms, initially,
and then to be weighed and balanced: reflected upon, marveled at or
deplored. ``The Way Things Never Were,'' despite its promising
subject matter, looks at the past only as a wan and pitiful
precursor to the splendiferous present.

 ANOTHER WORLD

 &UR; HAUNTED HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   By Barry Unsworth
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Another World,'' Pat Barker follows a principle more often
favored by playwrights than novelists: that the curtain should open
on an extreme situation, that from the first words, the first
motions, we should be involved in the tensions already twisting
about on stage. This novel does not seek to inveigle us or woo us;
we are pitched straight into it.
</P>
<P>
   There can't be many fictional families that have started off in
such a state of harassment and distress. Grandfather Geordie, age
101, is dying of cancer, beset by nightmares of World War I that
have resurfaced, after 80 years, to plague him again. Geordie's
grandson, Nick, and his second wife, Fran, have just moved into a
large house in a Newcastle suburb. They are not settled in yet;
everything is in chaos. He is a daily witness to his grandfather's
painful death. She, heavily pregnant, has their 2-year-old son to
look after and is more or less permanently exhausted and resentful.
Their respective children by former marriages, Miranda and Gareth,
loathe each other and take no trouble to conceal it. Gareth is
seriously disturbed anyway; Miranda's mother has just been admitted
to a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The weather doesn't help either, being hot and sticky. And when,
in one of the novel's many powerfully realized scenes, the parents
and the two older children make an attempt at cooperation and start
stripping down the old wallpaper in the living room, they slowly
uncover an obscene, hate-filled painting of another family, the
Fanshawes, done 100 years earlier and bearing a frightening
resemblance to themselves. In fact, they recognize themselves all
too clearly in these terrible faces.
</P>
<P>
   The impulses of hatred and violence that continue to divide us,
symbolized by the horrors of a war remote in time but still present
in its consequences: these are the central concerns of the book. In
exploring them, ``Another World'' demonstrates the extraordinary
immediacy and vigor of expression we have come to expect from
Barker -- brilliant touches of observation, an unfailing ear for
dialogue, a talent for imagery that is darting and brief but
wonderfully apt. In the opening scene, skinheads clamber and
cluster threateningly around a car, then move away ``like a blanket
of flies.'' A bit later, Nick tries to get his grandfather to talk
about the past, ``poking him between the bars of his inertia, as
you'd try to rouse a moribund animal.'' Again and again, Barker
achieves that most difficult of combinations: effects that contain
the shock of the unexpected but are at once recognized to be
exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in a terse and vivid present tense, which
works well for moments of accelerated action or sensation, not
always so well for reflection or introspection or when some greater
fullness of response is needed. There are times when the characters
in ``Another World'' seem caged in these short sentences, in this
changeless present. Here, for example, is Nick watching the
pregnant Fran, noting her swollen body and drained face: ``The
truth is he's repelled by her, but the truth frightens him and he
sheers away from it.'' Repulsion, knowledge, fear, avoidance --
it's a lot to try to get across in one short sentence. If what is
being unfolded is Nick's awareness of his own reactions from moment
to moment, we need considerably more. If, on the other hand, the
intention is simply to provide information of a general sort, it
seems clumsy and somehow lacking in authority.
</P>
<P>
   In maintaining the tension, the sense of some impending act of
violence that will echo the violence of the past -- themes on which
the novel depends -- Barker also puts an occasional strain on our
willingness to believe. Gareth, Fran's 11-year-old son, is an
unattractive lad, as children with severe problems often are. He
has a history of sadistic bullying of smaller children; he has
undergone psychiatric treatment; he throws terrifying tantrums in
public places. In short, he is more than just difficult. And he is
due in a few weeks to go to a new school, a huge comprehensive
where he has no friends but a number of dreaded enemies. He is
living in fear, a fact well known to his mother. In these
circumstances, wouldn't the parents, both university graduates,
both belonging to a section of society familiar with its rights and
highly articulate in claiming them, inquire into alternatives for
Gareth? Or is it that, for the novel's larger purposes, he needs to
be kept frightened and vicious? Any suspicion that probability is
being sacrificed to plot is bound to put something of a crack in
the intensity of the illusion. The author always deals the cards
and they are always stacked; but we shouldn't be made too aware of
this or the cheat will fail.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of these reservations, it doesn't. The novel exerts its
grip early and, as the strands of its plot come together, past and
present show their similarly poisonous fangs. The narrative pace is
superbly maintained -- this is a novel that doesn't allow you to
miss a sentence. The beleaguered, rancorous, struggling family of
the present; the dark story of the Fanshawes; the legacy of the
1914-18 war relived in the nightmares of the dying Geordie: these
elements fuse together to form an urgent meditation on the
cruelties of experience, the mutual distortions of past and
present. To reinforce these effects, Barker takes risks, the bolder
for her being in general so naturalistic a writer. Ghosts move
through this story, some merely emblematic, like the ghost pain of
Geordie's old bayonet wound, some true phantoms, the faces and
forms of the dead. It says much for the skill and tact of Barker's
writing that these wraiths are made, without strain or contrivance,
to form part of the pattern of hauntings of which the novel is
composed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of compassion in Barker's book, but not a
lot of hope. Indeed, at times there is what seems almost a perverse
insistence on the desolation of things. Snipping away with
secateurs at the bushes around his house, lacerating his hands and
arms, Nick pulls out a nest of obscenely dead fledglings. Even the
roses in his garden have dead flies all over them, ``like caps of
gray scurf.'' We are spared none of the blood and vomit and
excrement attendant on Geordie's last days, nor the searing
humiliation of his weakness. You can be sure that when he tries to
stand up, his dressing gown will fall away to reveal a ruinous
scrotum. No reconciliation is offered and there is no real
resignation, in spite of the elegiac note sounded in the last
section, when Geordie, in his single person both victim and
murderer, is laid to rest in the churchyard with ``the innocent and
the guilty . . . side by side, under the obliterating grass.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the novel, Nick reflects that the past never
threatens anything as simple or avoidable as repetition. Of course,
our deeper fear is not that the horrors of the past will be
repeated but that they have never gone away. While ``Another
World'' does little to reassure us on this score, it is a powerful
and moving and deeply humane study of the tyranny of the past and
the quandaries of the present. The virtues it extols are those of
stoicism, endurance, dignity -- the classic virtues in the face of
a hostile universe.

INTERVIEW WITH PAT BARKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; OLD WAR WOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   BY ALIDA BECKER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The most striking character in Pat Barker's new novel is a
centenarian war veteran named Geordie, who in his dying days
manages to frighten, frustrate and charm everyone who comes near
him. Geordie returned from the Great War with a bayonet wound in
his stomach and a head full of guilty memories -- memories that
readers of Barker's Regeneration trilogy will instantly recognize.
Those novels, like ``Another World,'' owe at least part of their
inspiration to Barker's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1943, in the thick of World War II, in the industrial
northeast of England, Barker never knew her father. She was told
that he was in the R.A.F., that he had died. She and her mother
lived with her grandparents until, seven years after Barker's
birth, her mother moved out to start a new family. Barker remained
with her grandparents -- and so her grandfather's war, which had
left him with scars from a bayonet wound, became part of her own
stock of memories. So too did the memory of what it was like to
care for an invalid: after getting her university degree, Barker
returned to nurse her dying grandmother, who had herself tended her
husband for many years.
</P>
<P>
   How much of Geordie derives from this slice of Barker's personal
past? In a telephone interview from her home in Durham, not far
from Thornaby-on-Tees, the town where she was born, Barker
reflected on ``all the tributaries'' that flow into a character.
The main similarity between Geordie and her grandfather, she
decided, was that Geordie, who has cancer, is convinced that the
bayonet wound is responsible for his increasingly unbearable pain
-- a diagnosis her grandfather had earlier made for himself. ``I
was fascinated,'' she explained, ``by the idea that in each case
the man needs to believe that the war is what's killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Geordie's steely flirtatiousness? As a widower in
his late 70's, Geordie acquired a new girlfriend with an ``opulent
bosom'' and a penchant for leopard-print blouses. Over 20 years
later, as ``Another World'' draws to a close, he somehow summons
the energy to rise from his deathbed and spruce himself up for one
final meeting with an attractive university professor who has
interviewed him for a book -- a woman closer to his grandson's age,
who is definitely not immune to his charms. Barker laughed. ``No,
that's not my grandfather,'' she said. ``My grandfather wasn't
flirtatious.'' That part of Geordie put her more in mind of an
elderly Billy Prior, the character who as a young man gradually
comes to dominate the Regeneration novels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the physical aspects of Geordie's character were derived
from yet another source, a World War I veteran Barker met on the
battlefields of France while filming a documentary for the BBC.
``He was 103,'' she recalled, ``and had perfect hearing, perfect
memory. He stood upright; he had no arthritis. He seemed physically
indestructible.'' But when she put her arms around him, she was
surprised by how fragile he was. ``You felt he could crumble away
before you, in your fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   That eye for the delicate, often puzzling balance of human
strength and weakness, both physical and mental, has been at the
core of Barker's work from the beginning. Her first two novels,
``Union Street'' and ``Blow Your House Down'' (originally published
in the early 1980's and recently brought back into print in a
one-volume paperback), were generally praised -- and generally
pigeonholed as ``regional'' and ``feminist'' -- for their gritty,
unsentimental depictions of the lives of working-class women in the
north of England. Although her next two novels, ``The Century's
Daughter'' and ``The Man Who Wasn't There'' (which Barker said
would also be combined in a forthcoming paperback), moved her
closer to the critics' idea of the literary mainstream, it wasn't
until 1991, with the publication in Britain of ``Regeneration,'' a
historical novel about mentally ill World War I soldiers, including
real-life figures like the poet Siegfried Sassoon and his doctor,
William Rivers, that her place there was staked out. With the
succeeding volumes of the trilogy, ``The Eye in the Door'' and
``The Ghost Road'' (which won the Booker Prize in 1995), that place
was firmly established. Barker appears to have found the whole
process both frustrating and satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early criticism -- that I wrote mainly for and about women
-- is an artificial one in some ways,'' she remarked. ``My early
books were published by a feminist publishing house, so naturally
they were perceived in a particular way; they got that artificial
perspective.'' When ``Regeneration'' appeared, ``I did seem to be
setting off at right angles, which wasn't actually true. The themes
in 'Regeneration' are also the themes of books like 'Union Street'
-- they're about trauma, whether it's experienced by working-class
people or aristocrats. Women were also central to the Regeneration
books, even though they didn't figure as largely in them. They are,
together with Rivers, a sort of moral center.''
</P>
<P>
   Does ``Another World,'' which takes place in the present day and
is set in the north of England, in a Newcastle still partly
blighted by industrial decline, represent a more obvious melding of
her early work with the Regeneration trilogy? ``I do think I'm
trying to knit the two strands together,'' Barker agreed. Nick, the
middle-aged schoolteacher whose point of view dominates much of the
action, is a kind of clearinghouse for a good deal of the novel's
speculation about memory and identity, but at the same time ``a lot
of the force of the book is deflected from him onto the two
generations on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Nick figures in a pair of pivotal scenes: a late-night
tussle in a garbage-strewn back alley with Geordie, who has escaped
from his bedroom and is hallucinating a return to the trenches, and
a frantic search for Nick's 11-year-old stepson, Gareth, who has
run away from home and wound up in a nocturnal wasteland of
derelict factory buildings sectioned off by barbed-wire fences.
Clearly, Barker wants us to think about how the combat of (and
with) the past is mirrored in the domestic skirmishes of the
present -- to consider, as a passage early in ``Another World'' has
it, ``the power of old wounds to leak into the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader is also meant, Barker said, ``to be comparing
Geordie's fantastic memory, his belief in remembering the past and
using the past as a guide to the present, with Gareth's total
ability to reinvent the past, even down to what happened the
previous day.'' Gareth, like many boys his age, is obsessed with
violent computer games. Unlike many boys his age, he shows signs of
erupting into real violence. ``The point with Gareth is that you
don't know how dangerous he is,'' Barker remarked. ``He could turn
out to be a fine, upstanding computer analyst or he could turn into
someone you read about in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   At school, Gareth has been reprimanded for bullying and
threatening younger children. During a family outing, Barker
positions him on a cliff, hurling rocks down onto a sandy beach.
Below, unobserved by their parents, is his 2-year-old stepbrother,
Jasper. The temptation is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that beach scene,'' Barker recalled, ``I tried to make much
of the fact that Gareth sees the child from above. From up there on
the cliff, what he sees has some of the impersonality of video
games. From there, his brother looks like a piglet, not a child.
It's easy to dehumanize someone at that point.'' Writing that
scene, she was also thinking of grown-up video games, of modern
technological warfare, with its ``precision siting, puffs of smoke
behind which actual human beings are blown to pieces. The reader is
not meant to get off too lightly. I also meant the reader to be
thinking of a disturbed society.''
</P>
<P>
   What will she want readers to be thinking of next time around?
She's reluctant to talk about the novel she's working on now,
beyond saying that she has completed a first draft. ``By the end of
the first draft, it's full of wrong turnings,'' she explained. ``By
then I've seen the book I ought to have written instead of the book
I have written.'' Might it resemble the novel she talked about in
an interview in late 1995, just after ``The Ghost Road'' won the
Booker Prize? Set in a rundown housing project, the book was going
to focus on young joy riders who steal cars and then burn them to
destroy the evidence. No, Barker said, with a laugh, that one isn't
likely to make it into print. ``I had problems understanding their
feelings about cars. I just couldn't get it.''

 &UR; HER NAME IS MUD
</P>
<P>
   BY SARAH BOXER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Write a novel about a herd of female elephants and you're in
virgin territory. Who's to say what's right when it comes to
elephant thoughts, elephant speech, elephant names?
</P>
<P>
   The very first chapter of Barbara Gowdy's new novel, ``The White
Bone,'' contains a crucial and trivial event. Mud, a young female
elephant, is renamed. Why? Because a male mounts her and ``digs her
calf tunnel.'' The rule is that male elephants get to keep their
names for life ``because bulls are calves forever,'' but female
elephants, once mounted, are transformed. They are hollowed, or
hallowed, depending on which elephant you ask. And in place of
their pert noun-names they get hyphenated verb-names. Mud is
renamed She-Spurns to go with the nonvirginal names of her family,
the She-S's: She-Swaggers, She-Sees, She-Snorts, She-Soothes,
She-Screams.
</P>
<P>
   You might not think a name really matters. But try slogging
across the parched veld with a herd of verb-names and keeping them
straight while also tracking the pachyderms' memories,
hallucinations, visions, superstitions and plain old perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Gowdy has kindly supplied, in the manner of 19th-century
novelists, the family trees of five elephant families: the She-S's,
the She-D's, the She-M's, the She-B's-and-B's (a subgroup of the
She-B's) and the We-F's (who are very self-centered). She has also
provided a glossary of elephant words. The ``She-eye'' is the sun,
a ``She-he'' is a spotted hyena, the ``She-ones'' are elephants and
``the She'' is the mother of all elephants, a k a God. And she has
consulted elephant experts to insure that the migrations, sex
lives, family bonds, mourning habits and secretions are realistic.
But it doesn't always help.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, or, as the elephants would say, thank the She, that
some of the elephants are male. Tall Time, Torrent and Swamp are
memorable because their names are nouns. And praise be the females
who manage to hold on to their maiden names. She-Spurns, true to
her name, spurns her name as well as her ardent suitor. Her name is
Mud through most of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's narrow-minded to balk at verb-names. But Gowdy, the
author of ``Mister Sandman'' and ``We So Seldom Look on Love,'' is
the creator, ``the She,'' of these fictional creatures. She gives
the elephants their names and imagines their beliefs. She even
allows her elephants a mating cheer: ``Ready and ripe? Yes! Yes! /
Streaming rank smell? Yes! Yes! / Go then and bore the tunnel
wherein / A newborn will dwell! Yes! Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   So why does she choose a nomenclature that makes so many
sentences into ``She sells seashells''? (A simple sample will
suffice: ``As she passes She-Sees, She-Scares nudges her to come
along, and like a submissive calf She-Sees obeys.'') And why do
these elephants, who are in most respects bawdy and vile, use
phrases like ``by my troth'' and sing hymns of thanksgiving
(``Come, Thou Fount of every blessing! Fill my trunk to blare Thy
grace'')? They sound like a herd of Puritans.
</P>
<P>
   A partial answer is that they are Puritans. ``The White Bone''
is a big religious put-on, an elephantine ``Pilgrim's Progress.''
The white elephant bone at the center of the book is a relic that
everyone believes will point to the ``Safe Place.'' The elephants,
fearful that uttering the name of the bone will weaken it, call it
``the that-way bone'' (sounds like ``the Jahweh bone''). The
elephants' trek is a test of their faith in the face of drought and
bounty hunters. When Date Bed, a Christ figure, picks up a rearview
mirror in the desert, it is a lesson in vanity. And those monstrous
female names are not so different from Prudence, Piety, Chastity
and Discretion.
</P>
<P>
   You can see that the novel is plenty funny and plenty odd, but
it would have been far funnier without the verb-names. They keep
the reader from reveling in Gowdy's great gift for parody and her
even greater gift for sensual, gross-out description.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example: ``The nurse cow eats the dung of the other
grazers, 'drought fruit,' she calls it, and exhorts the rest of
them to do likewise, and when anybody craves salt she revives her
urine-drinking campaign. . . . Roaring, 'Watch She-Soothes!' she
curves her trunk under Bent to drink his, and the little calf
wobbles on his delicate legs and shows the whites of his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sickening, sure. But in an arid land of She-ones, the reader
gulps down those salty sentences like springwater.

   A True Story of Birth, Rebirth, and Everyday Magic.

 &UR; WHAT VISIONS HAVE I SEEN!
</P>
<P>
   BY SUSAN CHEEVER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Memoir is a woman's game. A disproportionate number of memoirs
are written by women. The most controversial memoirs -- the ones
that provoke heated public argument and contemptuous reviews -- are
almost all written by women. No wonder. Women are publishing
stories that have only been told privately, in whispered
conversations and intimate diaries, for centuries. These stories
are the text of our domestic life, with all its fits and starts,
kitchen dramas and bedroom tragedies. They are stories about loving
famous men, stories of incest, stories about secret happenings in
the lives of women; most of all they are stories of marriage and
children. Childbirth, after all, is also a woman's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expecting Adam'' is a glorious example. Martha Beck is smart,
willing to confide in the reader, good at concise description and
very funny, particularly about the most serious possible subjects
-- childbirth, angels and surviving at Harvard. Parts of this story
are hard
</P>
<P>
   to believe -- psychic experiences, glimpses of metaphysical
beings -- but Beck's voice is so sympathetic and most of her
details so accurate that they frequently carry all before them. It
is hardly important that this is a story about bearing and raising
an exceptional child -- a son with Down syndrome -- in exceptional
circumstances (Beck and her husband, John, have six Harvard degrees
between them). Beck is telling it for all women who have raised
exceptional children and ended up feeling privileged, and for all
mothers who have found communities that put a high value on
material accomplishments simply unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of two driven Harvard academics who found
out in mid- pregnancy that their unborn son would be retarded,''
Beck explains. ``To their own surprise and the horrified dismay of
the university community, the couple ignored the abundant means,
motive and opportunity to obtain a therapeutic abortion. They
decided to allow their baby to be born. What they did not realize
is that they themselves were the ones who would be 'born,' infants
in a new world where magic is commonplace, Harvard professors are
the slow learners and retarded babies are the master teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck is also a pretty good teacher. Her chatty descriptions of
life at Harvard, combined with her humorous detailing of the rigors
of bad pregnancies and caring for her toddler daughter, Katie, are
sharp. When she begins having paranormal experiences -- she can see
her husband, who is in Japan; she is visited by ministering angels
-- she is more skeptical than anyone. ``How many times a day does
some poor hapless human really need a good supernatural protector
and fail to get one?'' she asks after she experiences being carried
-- with Katie -- out of a deadly fire in her apartment building by
strong, invisible hands. ``People are tortured and killed and raped
and pillaged on a daily basis, and if there are angels in the
vicinity, they apparently just sit around watching -- wringing
their ectoplasmic little hands, perhaps, but letting nature take
its course.''
</P>
<P>
   As Beck's life spins out of control -- when she finds out that
she is carrying a Down syndrome child, not one doctor connected
with Harvard approves of her decision to keep it -- the angels'
visits become more frequent and more visible. If this is hard to
believe, no one has a harder time with it than Beck herself.
Finally, she figures out a way to accept what is happening to her.
``Until that point, I had followed the good old Baconian logic of
refusing to believe anything until it was proven true,'' she
writes. ``Now I decided that I was willing to believe anything,
absolutely anything I heard, saw or felt, until it was proven
false. If this doesn't sound like a major life transition to you,
it's because you've never done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story trembles on the verge of tragedy again and again, but
it has a happy ending after all. Adam is born, and Martha and John
with their young family leave Harvard and move to the Southwest,
where life is informal and a graduate school career is not
considered more important than a child. Beck, a career counselor
and columnist for Mademoiselle, is the author of ``Breaking Point:
Why Women Fall Apart and How They Can Re-Create Their Lives''; her
husband is a partner at Anderson Consulting and a professor of
international management at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once spoke to an entering class of Harvard Medical School
students about my pregnancy and my decision,'' Beck recalls. ``Adam
was asleep on my lap at the time, wearing a bow tie and a dreamy
expression. After the speech, I was approached by an elderly
professor whose name I forget. He had just become the grandfather
of a little girl with Down's. As he talked to me, he stroked Adam's
soft blond hair and wept. He loved his granddaughter with
inexplicable openness, and the experience had changed his whole
life. Now there's a doctor with some real information to offer the
parents of a retarded baby. Whoever said that love is blind was
dead wrong. Love is the only thing on this earth that lets us see
each other with the remotest accuracy.''

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the enormous talents of the folk artist Edward Hicks
(1780-1849) are often celebrated, it was his mission as a religious
servant that inspired his illustrious allegorical series of
paintings, ``The Peaceable Kingdom.'' In THE KINGDOMS OF EDWARD
HICKS (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center/Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation/Abrams, $39.95), Carolyn J. Weekley,
director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, deftly chronicles
Hicks's early training as a decorative painter, his journey into
the Quaker world and his lifelong struggle to reconcile his
spiritual beliefs with his material needs. Hicks's mother died when
he was a toddler. Unable to support the child, his father sent him
to live with family friends who raised him as a Quaker. As a
teen-ager Hicks was apprenticed to a local stagecoach shop to learn
decorative painting. He became a Quaker minister in 1811. He
received no pay for this position and supported his family with his
decorative painting, a practice that stood in direct contradiction
to the utilitarian views of the Quakers. Increasingly Hicks's views
diverged from those of the Quakers, and under the guidance of his
cousin Elias Hicks, a Hicksite faction was formed. There was much
animosity between the Hicksites and the orthodox Quakers, which had
an irrevocable effect on Hicks. His many versions of the
``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings symbolically reflect the urgency of
that discord as well as his desire for peace between the two
divisions. Using Isaiah's prophecy ``The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb . . .'' as a blueprint, Hicks's paintings, in varying
degrees, mirror his personal agony about religious tension. Weekley
has compiled a scholarly history of Hicks as both minister and
painter, and of the turmoil these conflicting vocations wrought on
his own kingdom. _ Amy Todd

   THE PIG FARMER'S DAUGHTER AND OTHER TALES OF AMERICAN JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of Racism and Sexism in the Courts From 1865 to the
Present.
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Frances Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rape cases disclose unambiguously that the prevailing
narrative used in the courts is of white male privilege,'' Mary
Frances Berry writes. ``Rape also enhances our understanding that
patriarchy is the subtext underlying race, class and gender.'' With
claims like these, Berry regrettably drowns long hours of research
in a corrosive blend of rancor, rage and cheap Foucault. Berry,
chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the
Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought at the
University of Pennsylvania, maintains that American justice
systematically favors white heterosexual men over minorities, women
and homosexuals. Her argument draws heavily on cases from the Jim
Crow South, a period when most judges were Confederate veterans.
What such men thought about race equality and women's rights is
hardly surprising -- less surprising than Berry's effort to read
each and every case as a study in oppression. If courts let black
children inherit from white fathers, if they helped poor women, if
uncommon judges guarded black people's rights, all this -- Berry
scoffs -- reflects only paternalism, the ``Southern gentlemanly
tradition.'' In her focal case, from Texas in 1886, a black man,
Albert Johnson, was charged with raping a German farm girl. She
said her assailant was cleanshaven, and identified Johnson seven
weeks after the crime. Convicted and sentenced, Johnson finally
went free, thanks to six witnesses (black and white, including a
sheriff and two judges) who testified that he had always worn a
mustache. Berry attacks all parties: jurors for racism, ``elite
appellate judges'' for crediting six witnesses' testimony more than
a shaky identification -- even Johnson, for being the ``boy'' of
his ``well-to-do white patrons.'' Were Atticus Finch to stray into
these pages, he would be unmasked as David Duke. _ Allen D. Boyer

<P>
   A GOOD ENOUGH DAUGHTER
</P>
<P>
   A Memoir.
</P>
<P>
   By Alix Kates Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Schocken, $23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would suffocate if I didn't leave,'' Alix Kates
Shulman writes about suburban Cleveland in the early 1950's and the
stifling embrace of her family. At the age of 20, she left for New
York to become a writer, but she returned more than four decades
later to care for her aging parents, who died in 1996. In ``A Good
Enough Daughter,'' Shulman, the author of the novel ``Memoirs of an
Ex-Prom Queen,'' now 66 years old, honors connections she once felt
compelled to negate. Her portrayal is refreshingly upbeat, infused
with insight, affection and respect. Her father's congestive heart
failure and her mother's progressive dementia do not erase their
vigorous personalities. ``Trawling for secrets'' in her parents'
past, Shulman was surprised to discover herself. Her mother had an
exciting job with the Works Progress Administration and a bohemian
group of female colleagues. File cabinets stuffed with short
stories, essays and articles reflect the ``furious energy'' of her
mother's later attempt at a literary career. ``Once I launched my
own life, I somehow forgot,'' Shulman says. Nor did she associate
her mother's political activism, ``which dotted my childhood with
moments of vicarious glory,'' with her own feminism. Excerpts from
a brief autobiography, written by her father when he was 88,
display the love of language he and his daughter had always shared.
Her own occasional letters home, however, are painful; seeing them,
all carefully preserved, she writes, ``I regretted having saved so
few of hers, and worse, having often cringed to read them.'' This
memoir benefits from Shulman's unflinching honesty. ``I asserted my
difference,'' she says, ``until my past was obliterated.'' With her
independence established, Shulman is free finally to recognize her
parents' ``extravagant love'' as the source of her own strength.
``Now that their power is spent,'' she writes, ``I taste their
sweetness.'' _ Leslie Chess Feller

   ONE MORE TIME
</P>
<P>
   The Best of Mike Royko.
</P>
<P>
   Commentaries by Lois Wille.
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago, $22.
</P>
<P>
   How do you boil down the nearly 8,000 newspaper columns that
Mike Royko wrote from 1963 until his death in 1997 into a ``best
of'' collection? His friend and colleague Lois Wille skillfully
provides the introductions to the pieces, but, of course, the joy
of ``One More Time'' is Royko in his own words -- for example, on
the unveiling of Chicago's Picasso sculpture in 1967. The statue's
eyes ``are pitiless, cold, mean . . . like the eyes of every slum
owner who made a buck off the small and weak. And of every building
inspector who took a wad from a slum owner to make it all
possible.'' The collection shows Royko's command of a range of
emotions, as in his eulogy for his wife: ``We met when she was 6
and I was 9. Same neighborhood street. Same grammar school. So if
you ever have a 9-year-old son who says he is in love, don't laugh
at him. It can happen.'' _ Mary Eileen O'Connell

   FAULKNER, MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   By Edouard Glissant.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard Glissant's ``Faulkner, Mississippi'' is a short,
ambitious and, at times, rambunctious expedition into Yoknapatawpha
County. Well translated from the French by Barbara Lewis and Thomas
C. Spear, it plunges you into the peculiar miasma of the place,
with its questions about the legitimacy of the South's foundation,
bloodlines and descendants and the role and place of blacks,
Indians, women and children. Glissant, a poet, essayist and
playwright, calls Faulkner's characteristic situation ``the
inextricable,'' and writes that Faulkner's technique for conveying
it consists of a ``gradation in disclosure'' that ``dissociates
cause and effect, delays revelation, diffracts the perception of
the real.'' He describes the progression of Faulkner's work as ``an
accumulating mystery and a whirling vertigo -- gathering momentum
rather than being resolved.'' This last characterization applies to
the way in which Glissant himself proceeds: there are no
demonstrations in his book, only observations that are slowly
accumulated, insights gradually or suddenly revealed and questions
raised -- all of which transforms an academic project (undertaken
when Glissant was teaching literature at Southern University in
Baton Rouge) into a piece of writing that is often poetic. _

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struck by love, Norris Lamb, a middle-aged postmaster in a small
English village, embodies Eudora Welty's observation that ``a
sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring
starts from within.'' In Carrie Brown's unconventional and eloquent
novel LAMB IN LOVE (Algonquin, $21.95), Norris -- who ``knows he is
a victim of a delicious assault, a caress from a lion's paw'' --
sets out to win Vida Stephen after he comes upon her ``dancing in
the moonlight in a ruined garden'' on the night of the Apollo 11
moon landing. Vida, who is 41 and plain, is dedicated to caring for
Manford Perry, a 20-year-old retarded man who is unable to speak,
in the mansion owned by his peripatetic father. Norris is too shy
to declare himself directly, so he engages in an unusual courtship
whose resolution hangs suspensefully in the balance until the very
end. Along the way, he is surprised by his growing affection for
Manford, whom he begins to see as Vida sees him: not damaged, but
uniquely engaged with his world. ``Lamb in Love'' is, in fact, a
book about seeing. Carrie Brown reveals her characters not as
others perceive them but as they are able to see one another, and
as they come to understand themselves. Norris and Vida are full of
depth and longing, passion and poetry, that continually startle and
delight. ``You have to have imagination to love anybody,'' Vita
concludes, as you do to write a novel as magical and satisfying as
Brown's. _ Linda Barrett Osborne

   THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Trisha McFarland is hopelessly lost in the woods.
Out for a morning hike with her bickering mother and brother, she
runs off to relieve herself and discovers she can't find her way
back to the path. Over the following 224 pages (a veritable
chapbook for the indefatigable Stephen King), Trisha wanders for a
week in the mosquito-infested forest with nothing but her wits, her
Walkman and the pitching prowess of her hero, the dreamy Red Sox
reliever Tom Gordon, to guide her. As Trisha fights to stay alive,
King demonstrates his empathy for the inner lives of children and
an outdoorsman's knowledge of the edible wild flora of Maine
(Trisha survives on checkerberries, beechnuts and fiddlehead
ferns). Later, when it becomes clear that something strange in the
woods is stalking Trisha and decapitating deer -- It wasn't a joke
and it wasn't a dream. It was death and madness standing or
crouching or perhaps perching'' -- King delivers his trademark dose
of horror. Hungry, hunted and just a little bit ``nutzoid,'' Trisha
relies on Gordon's grace under pressure -- and his imaginary
interventions -- to overcome her fear and end her ordeal. Though
the idea of a 9-year-old girl obsessed with a relief pitcher rather
than, say, the Spice Girls is a bit of a stretch, the idea of
``closing'' as a metaphor for conquering demons is a deft addition
to King's crowded field. _ Andrew Essex

   COAST TO COAST
</P>
<P>
   By Frederic Raphael.
</P>
<P>
   Catbird Press, $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know Frederic Raphael's work even if you've never
heard of him. He wrote screenplays for the films ``Two for the
Road,'' ``Far From the Madding Crowd'' and Stanley Kubrick's
forthcoming ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' His television mini-series,
``Glittering Prizes,'' starring Tom Conti, was broadcast on PBS
some years ago, and he later turned it into a novel. Raphael's
newest novel, ``Coast to Coast,'' will likely be more successful as
the movie it's asking to be than the brittle verbal candy it is
here. ``Coast to Coast'' is related almost entirely in dialogue,
with a few authorial cues about body language when the characters
fall silent. Barnaby Pierce, a retired sitcom writer, and his wife,
Marion, are driving from the East Coast to L.A. to attend their son
Benjamin's wedding. Along the way they visit Barnaby's old writing
partner in Chicago; he performs a pratfall, and dies, in the middle
of his Eddie Cantor impersonation. Then there's a visit with their
daughter Stacey in Minneapolis, and with the newspaper editor in
Seattle with whom Marion once had an affair. Along the way Barnaby
and Marion have at each other with the stagy language of witty
cruelty. She's asked for a divorce, only in part because of their
respective infidelities. Their son Christopher died in a car crash
seven years ago, and it's the one thing they can't hash out. They
don't have the language for it. What they have is clever repartee.
``You know the trouble with us now,'' Barnaby says. ``Truces are
only threats in their best clothes.'' The artfulness of the
conversation delivers sly grown-up pleasure. It's Raphael's groping
for deeper human notes that messes things up; the cynical dialogue
can't accommodate it. The last chapter, featuring a lunatic
daughter named Zara who trashes the wedding, seems to have
blundered in from an ``X-Files'' sound stage. _ Brigitte Frase

   DATING MISS UNIVERSE
</P>
<P>
   Nine Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By Steven Polansky.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State University, $26.
</P>
<P>
   The main character in this collection's title story, a
cabdriver, doesn't actually date Miss Universe. He trails a mere
finalist, Miss Thailand, and calls out to her at Rockefeller
Center's ice-skating rink. After the pageant's bouncers rough him
up, he becomes contemplative. ``The things in this world you love,
be they beauty or whatever, your wife, your kids if you have got
them, the place you live, they can knock you around for.'' Steven
Polansky makes that point often in this inventive and sometimes
moving book. Most of his characters are men who are past their
prime. They're realizing that they haven't called the winners right
and that the things they've loved have rendered them irreparably
vulnerable. In ``Leg,'' a father takes passive aggression to new
heights, neglecting a badly infected wound in order to attract his
son's attention and concern. The two brothers in ``Alarm,'' one of
whom is fleeing his marriage, brace themselves for the worst when
visiting their elderly mother. Several of the stories in ``Dating
Miss Universe'' have appeared in publications like The New Yorker
and Harper's Magazine, but the best of them, ``Beard,'' has not
been previously published. It's about a writer in his 40's who
accepts the limitations of his gift, and of giftedness itself,
during a workshop with a younger, more successful author. Their
encounter, deftly drawn, is sobering yet hilarious. Glimpses of
scaffolding remain in this book's final two stories -- the rest
seem effortlessly built -- but by then you're already turning back
to reread the others. _ Beth Wolfensberger Singer

LIFE AND DEATH IN IRAQ: A NATION SAGS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF
SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ This is life _ and death _ in Iraq after eight
years of sanctions imposed by the United Nations following the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At Al Mansour Pediatric Hospital in Baghdad, malnourished
children, covered with flies, lie on stained mattresses. Mothers
and fathers sit on the beds, methodically swatting at the flies.
Medicine is in short supply. The hospital is dark; electrical power
is shut off periodically each day to conserve resources. The usual
antiseptic odor of medical facilities has been replaced with the
stench of urine, feces and decay.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from bed to bed, Dr. Tarig Al-Shujairi lists the
illnesses afflicting the children: typhoid fever, pneumonia,
leukemia, tuberculosis, cholera. Even polio and measles are making
a comeback, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse runs by carrying a small bottle of oxygen. Nemya, a
2-year-old girl with hair the color of sand, has meningitis and is
unable to breathe because of the fluid clogging her bronchial
tubes. Her father and mother are frozen at the side of her bed
while the nurse covers Nemya's face with the small oxygen mask.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late. Nemya's chest heaves, her body shakes, and she
dies. Her mother pulls her scarf close about her face and cries
silently. Her father looks at a visitor and touches his chest over
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-cent tube could have saved her life, another doctor says.
But the hospital has none. Impossible to obtain under the
sanctions, Al-Shujairi says.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. plans to keep the sanctions in place until it is
convinced that Iraq's long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons have been dismantled or destroyed, which Iraq
had agreed to do at the end of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions range from a ban on commercial flights to and from
Iraq to an oil embargo, eased somewhat three years ago when the
United Nations allowed Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, despite the hopes of many Western leaders, have
had little apparent effect on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. He
remains firmly in control, and efforts to find and destroy his
weapons are in limbo. But they have had a devastating effect on
Iraq's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from U.N. diplomats, church leaders and officials of
humanitarian organizations point out how the economic and military
sanctions have left many people scrambling for survival. Baghdad's
unemployment rate is more than 50 percent; in the second-largest
city, Basra, unemployment hovers around 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-work engineers drive taxis, and doctors take second jobs
to supplement a salary that, because of inflation, now averages
only about $3 to $5 per month.
</P>
<P>
   And each month thousands of infants are dying of
malnutrition-related illnesses that many believe would not be a
problem except for the sanctions restricting or bogging down the
shipment of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, malnutrition was almost non-existent,'' said
Anupama Rao Singh, the United Nations Children's Fund
representative in Baghdad. From 1991 to 1998, children under 5 were
dying from malnutrition-related diseases in numbers ranging from a
conservative 2,690 per month to a more realistic 5,357 per month,
according to Singh's figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malnutrition in Iraq is not just epidemic, it is endemic,''
Hans von Sponeck, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for
Iraq, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctions are turning the social structure upside down _
the middle-class is every day more impoverished.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Watkins, head of the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Iraq, calls the situation ``a
natural disaster not caused by the forces of nature, but by the
forces of man.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright strongly defends the
sanctions. When asked on ``Meet the Press'' last December if the
United States bears any responsibility for the deaths of Iraqi
children because of a lack of food and medicine, Albright said:
``No, Saddam Hussein bears full responsibility for that. It is
actually the United States that was the author of the oil-for-food
program which permits Saddam to sell oil for food. If we had not
done that, and if the sanctions weren't in place, then he would be
selling oil for tanks. So it is the United States and our allies
that have made sure that the people of Iraq have food.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Peter Burleigh, deputy U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, in a speech to the Security Council, expressed
concern that the embargo has caused immense suffering in Iraq, but
stressed that Saddam's regime was mostly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether the human cost of sanctions is worth what they
may accomplish in curbing or changing the Iraqi regime is being
hotly debated by business groups, humanitarians and politicians at
the United Nations and in many world capitals. Russia, France and
China, together with several Arab countries, have called for new
approaches that could lead to the sanctions being lifted or eased.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions alone are not solely responsible for Iraq's
misery. The country's economy was weakened by Iraq's war with Iran
and then again by the Gulf War touched off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. But the sanctions have seemed to speed up an
ever-increasing spiral of poverty and death.
</P>
<P>
   On a windswept landfill on the outskirts of Baghdad, Rahem
provides an example. Here, he cuts apart salvaged tires and sews
the good sections together to form one usable spare. Rahem lives in
Saddam City, the poorest section of an increasingly impoverished
city. The sun will soon bake the soft soil like clay, making
digging for trash heap treasures all but impossible, but for now,
amid the swirling sand and hordes of flies, there is a little money
to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Rahem presses the tire against his legs and with a razor-sharp
knife trims off the sides with the precision of a surgeon. Then he
finds a tire with the best tread and methodically sews the parts
together.
</P>
<P>
   For each tire, involving several hours work, he earns up to
3,000 dinars _ about $1.50. Around him hundreds of other Iraqis,
mostly school-age boys, scramble through the refuse for something
of value, just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Such poverty was rare not all that long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, the Red Cross and Red Crescent leader in Iraq and a
Canadian, described Iraq before the Gulf War and before sanctions
as an oil-rich country with a sophisticated infrastructure.
Well-designed highways linked its cities to the surrounding
countries, hospitals were state-of-the-art, education was free
through the college level and malnutrition was almost non-existent.
But Iraq was forced to import most of its food and medicine. Also,
the nation relied heavily on some 2 million people brought in from
other countries to work in the service industries.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, most of those 2 million people went home, leaving
Iraqis on their own, with little experience in running the basic
sectors of their economy. The oil industry, water treatment plants
and electrical generating plants were nearly destroyed. And U.N.
sanctions limited their ability to repair those facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government is caught in a kind of Catch-22. It needs
money to rebuild and once again import enough food and medicine for
its people. But sanctions on equipment limit the government's
ability to pump oil to get that money.
</P>
<P>
   Both Watkins and U.N humanitarian coordinator von Sponeck
pointed to the Iraqis' lack of experience for the delays in
distributing food and medical supplies _ delays that some sources
in the West have said were the Iraqi government's attempts to
create worse conditions in Iraq in an effort to gain international
support for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that there is a willingness (on the part of
the Iraqis) to get the supplies to the people,'' von Sponeck said.
``Every day I am amazed at how they manage with so little.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there is ``absolutely no evidence'' that shipments
under the U.N.-administered oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq
to sell up to $5.2 billion dollars of oil every six months in
exchange for an equal amount of food and medicine, is being
diverted to the government or to the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck also said that Iraq, because of a lack of
oil-industry-related parts, has never been able to pump enough oil
to meet the $5.2 billion mark allowed under the oil-for-food
program. The most Iraq has sold was $3 billion, of which 35 percent
was taken by the U.N. to run the program and for war reparations.
The remainder of the money is deposited in a U.N.-controlled
account to pay for food and medicine contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the immediate horror of thousands of children
dying from malnutrion-related causes, von Sponeck said, there is a
more long-term tragedy among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most serious situation in Iraq,'' he said, ``is the plight
of the young people _ we are grooming a generation that is deprived
of the ability to prepare for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, educational items are embargoed'' under the
sanctions, von Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
   At a school in the heart of Baghdad, the principal, Sister
Suzanne de Immaculate, said shortages include the basics:
textbooks, paper, pencils. The students come from the neighborhood,
for the most part, but many parents from other parts of the city
enroll their children at her school because of its excellent
reputation. The school had been a private Catholic school until it
was nationalized in 1974. The students, who attend classes from
Monday to Thursday and on Saturday, study English and French
beginning in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students appeared healthy and well-dressed in school
uniforms, but there were notable exceptions of poor-looking
students without uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF's Singh said economic sanctions have caused a breakdown
of the family structure, with many children now forced to help
supplement the family income. They are dropping out of the
educational system much earlier than usual, she said. And while the
quality of education has deteriorated, Singh said, chronic
malnutrition is damaging children's capacity for learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are too important to become a pawn of politics,''
Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   At another primary school in Saddam City, 48 students were
packed into a narrow, dark, concrete-block room, made darker by the
lack of electricity. Two and three students shared desks designed
for one, and several students had to sprawl on the concrete floor
as the teacher wrote their English lesson on the blackboard. Paper
and pencil were their only instruments of learning. All the
classrooms were the same: crowded, cheerless with bare, unpainted
walls.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Baghdad's medical school, students seemed
upbeat. For the most part, they appeared eager to talk to
foreigners. They dressed more upscale than most Iraqis and fewer
students wore traditional Arabic and Muslim attire than did the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   But their future appears bleak: taking low-paying positions in
hospitals overwhelmed with sanctions-related illnesses or joining
the growing numbers of professionals who are fleeing the country.
Sponeck described the brain-drain phenomena as ``immigration
without noise'' because so many people are quietly leaving their
lives behind.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, the University of Baghdad had drawn students
from throughout the Middle East and had the reputation of being the
best medical school in the region. Now, the students there work
with 10-year-old equipment, and only a trickle of current medical
journals and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it (the sanctions) to stop,'' said Inas Adnan, a
third-year medical student who lived with her family in Salt Lake
City for five years while her father went to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years is enough,'' she said. ``We want our lives to
return to the way they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Adnan said the medical school was damaged and forced to close
for two weeks in December when a U.S. missile hit nearby,
shattering all the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very frightening to try to sleep at night when the bombs
are falling,'' Adnan said.

   EVERYBODY WAS SO YOUNG:
</P>
<P>
   Gerald and Sara Murphy. A Lost Generation Love Story
</P>
<P>
   By Amanda Vaill. Broadway, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The Murphys were a dazzling, rich American couple who knew and
entertained just about everybody who was anybody in Paris and on
the French Riviera in the 1920's, from Fitzgerald to Picasso. In
1998 our reviewer, Brooke Allen, called this ``a marvelously
readable biography'' by ``a skillful and compassionate writer.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT A BOY
</P>
<P>
   By Nick Hornby. Riverhead, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Will Freeman is a smug but aimless London bachelor in his 30's
who devises a dating scheme to tap the market in sexy divorced
women by pretending to be a single dad and joining a support group
full of single mothers. Before long, though, he runs into a
troubled 12-year-old boy who sees right through him, and the two
become unlikely soul mates. ``Hornby . . . combines a skilled,
intuitive appreciation for the rigors of comic structure with
highly original insights about the way the enchantments of popular
culture insinuate themselves into middle-class notions of
romance,'' Hal Espen wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A WALK IN THE WOODS:
</P>
<P>
   Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Bryson. Broadway, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author chronicles in breezy, good-humored fashion his
five-month struggle to hike the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail from
Georgia to Maine. Bryson is ``a satirist of the first rank, one who
writes (and walks) with Chaucerian brio,'' Dwight Garner wrote here
last year. Searching for Yellowstone: Ecology and Wonder in the
Last Wilderness, by Paul Schullery (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14),
is an environmental and human history of Yellowstone National Park
by a longtime park ranger and administrator. ``Schullery . . . has
given us a refreshingly unhyperbolic look at the place he loves,''
Michael Parfit wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOMLAND
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Price. Island/Dell, $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   This novel tracks the racial turmoil that erupts after a white
woman turns up in a New Jersey city and claims her 4-year-old son
was abducted by a black carjacker. '' 'Freedomland' is infinitely
more than a detective story,'' Francine Prose said here last year.
``It aspires to the heft and weight of a 19th-century Russian
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   WORMHOLES: Essays and Occasional Writings
</P>
<P>
   By John Fowles. Owl/Holt, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This grab bag of musings by the 73-year-old English novelist
covers a lot of territory -- from autobiographical pieces to
cantankerous forays into politics and culture. ``The book is as
various, quirkily learned, beguiling, opinionated and, in parts, as
sumptuously written as Fowles's fiction,'' Roger Kimball wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE IRON TRACKS
</P>
<P>
   By Aharon Appelfeld. Schocken, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This Israeli novel is about a concentration camp survivor who
wanders through Austria buying sacred books and other remnants of
the Jewish culture that once flourished there while searching for
the Nazi officer who murdered his parents. ``Appelfeld's controlled
fiction compresses large themes into small spaces,'' Jonathan Rosen
said here in 1998. Bronstein's Children, by Jurek Becker
(University of Chicago, $15), is another novel about the psychic
aftershocks of the Holocaust, in which an 18-year-old German Jew in
1973 stumbles onto his father and two other camp survivors as they
torture a former Nazi guard. ``Becker, writing simply and clearly
in an unstrained narrative, speaks with the voice of knowledge,''
Eva Figes said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   THE COLLECTED POEMS OF AMY CLAMPITT
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Clampitt's poetry is full of restless motion and energy as she
evokes places like the Quaker village in Iowa where she was born
and Greenwich Village, where she cultivated a resolute bohemianism.
In 1997 in the Book Review, Christopher Benfey called this
posthumously published collection a testament to an ``extraordinary
life's work.''
</P>
<P>
   A BEAUTIFUL MIND
</P>
<P>
   By Sylvia Nasar. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This biography of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning developer
of game theory, follows him from his early career through his
crippling bouts of schizophrenia to his recovery years later. The
author, who writes about economics for The New York Times, ``offers
a remarkable look into the arcane world of mathematics and the
tragedy of madness,'' Simon Singh wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN FIRES:
</P>
<P>
   Assault on Eden. A Novel of the Ecuadorian Rainforest
</P>
<P>
   By Marnie Mueller. Curbstone, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   A former Peace Corps volunteer revisits the jungles of coastal
Ecuador on her honeymoon in 1969 and becomes involved in a battle
between the native people and American oil companies. ``The
characters are well drawn, and the novel has adventure, intrigue
and romance as well as politics,'' one critic said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   HAVANA DREAMS: A STORY OF A CUBAN FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   By Wendy Gimbel. Vintage, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of three unhappy women -- a wealthy bourgeoise, her
daughter and the daughter's child by Fidel Castro -- provide a
striking perspective on Cuba and its odd destiny. ``The result is a
shimmering book,'' Alma Guillermoprieto said here last year. Scott

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On the same day as the White House conference on children and
violence, the Christian Coalition ran radio spots ascribing blame
for the Littleton, Colo., school massacre.
 &HT;    What caused Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to kill their
classmates? A government that has outlawed God. If children could
pray, they would not shoot one another.
 &HT;    Many Americans find this analysis compelling. Since the early
1960s when the Supreme Court ruled against school-sponsored prayer,
conservative Christians have made it their cause-celebre to put God
back in the classroom.
 &HT;    Nearly every social ill -- teen pregnancy, drug abuse and low
SAT scores -- can be blamed on God's banishment. Teen murder has
been added to the list.
 &HT;    God is mad for being exiled and is getting even by allowing evil
to run amok.
 &HT;    This is wrong on several counts. First, the courts only forbade
school-sponsored religious activities. Teachers and principles
could not pray or read the Bible. Even after the decisions,
students could still pray, read their Bibles, and hold religious
meetings on campus.
 &HT;    The line between school-sanctioned and personal religious
activity was sometimes difficult for local school boards to
discern. In the confusion, some wrongly disallowed constitutional
religious freedom.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration has tried to correct these abuses and
``ensure that religious freedom does not end at the schoolroom
door.'' The president's commitment to religious freedom has allowed
for an increase of student-led religious activities on campuses
across the country.
 &HT;    Harris and Klebold did not murder in a religious vacuum. Since
most of their victims proclaimed Christian faith, I suspect
Columbine High School allowed a full range of legal religious
activities -- such as Young Life and Meet You at the Pole -- for
its students.
 &HT;    Second, scholars have demonstrated that the Supreme Court
decisions were applied unevenly. In the South and West, many
schools continued to sponsor religious activities. For many
Americans, school prayer never ended. Local custom -- ``don't ask;
don't tell'' prayer policies -- prevailed.
 &HT;    Such was the case at my Arizona high school in the 1970s. At
least one teacher conducted Bible studies under the guise of a
``Bible as Literature'' course. We prayed at school events and
student council meetings. Mormon, evangelical Christian, Roman
Catholic and Jewish groups maintained a strong campus presence with
official sanction.
 &HT;    The Christian Coalition may not have noticed, but the recent
school shootings have occurred in the places where the Supreme
Court rulings were rarely enforced. Jonesboro, Arkansas. Paducah,
Kentucky. Pearl, Mississippi. Littleton, Colorado. Except for the
episodes in Oregon and Pennsylvania, these attacks happened in
America's Bible Belt. These kids did not grow up liberal, secular
humanists.
 &HT;    The problem is not God. The problem is guns, access to guns, and
conservative Christian resistance to gun control.
 &HT;    Throughout American history, Christians have vacillated in their
attitudes toward guns. For colonists and pioneers, guns were
essential for hunting and protection. But neighbors often settled
disputes with firearms. If someone offended you, shoot them.
 &HT;    As the country became more urbanized in the 18th century,
vigilante gun violence disturbed many Christians. The church,
particularly the refined Church of England, allowed for controlled
revenge -- dueling. Thus, among pious Christians, gentlemanly rules
replaced killing sprees.
 &HT;    When Aaron Burr killed the saintly Alexander Hamilton in a duel,
Christians were shocked. Their outrage fueled the most successful
gun-control movement in American history -- the anti-dueling
crusade.
 &HT;    Convinced that God frowned upon gun vengeance, the churches
campaigned to end dueling. Although it took several decades,
religious groups changed national attitudes toward dueling and the
crusade succeeded.
 &HT;    But Christian outrage at gun violence is often short-lived. Now,
conservative Christians blame killing on government for outlawing
God.
 &HT;    They should blame themselves for refusing to outlaw guns. Why is
the Christian Coalition in bed with the National Rifle Association
and other radical gun lobbies? Because deep cultural and political
prejudices keep them from seeing the truth: people using guns kill
people.
 &HT;    In the wake of Littleton, it is time for outrage again. American
religious groups need to stand up against the NRA. Denominations
should sponsor protests and boycotts -- and perhaps censure members
who support radical pro-gun groups.
 &HT;    Gun lobbies are wrong. Religious freedom is not wed to the
freedom to own assault weapons. People of faith need to see through
their facile arguments. The framers of the Constitution never
envisioned their words protecting the kind of guns wielded by the
boys at Columbine.
 &HT;    It could take decades before people of faith can change American
attitudes toward gun control. Meanwhile, a modest proposal:
American schoolchildren should start each day with prayer, ``Good
Lord, protect and deliver us from the NRA.''

state legislative session when the governor is a front-runner in
the next presidential election. Everything is refracted through the
national prism, which may be why a hate crimes bill named in honor
of the black man who was dragged to death by whites in East Texas
has unexpectedly emerged as one of the most emotional, political
flashpoints of the current session. Democrats are charging that
Republicans loyal to Gov. George W. Bush are attempting to bottle
up the James Byrd Act, to kill it in committee so it would never
land on Bush's desk and force him to make a decision to either
support it, and alienate right-wing Republicans who object to the
inclusion of protections for homosexuals, or veto it and offer
Democrats a juicy issue to batter him with in the 2000 presidential

Microsoft will now hold big stakes in all three of Britain's major

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lawyer for the venerable Grateful Dead has
announced that concerts recorded by fans will be distributed at no
charge on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings will be posted in the MP3 file format, which lets
users easily exchange near-CD quality songs over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead ceased performing in 1995 when its leader, Jerry
Garcia, died.
</P>
<P>
   While performing, the Dead had a longtime policy of allowing
fans to record the band's concerts. The caveat was that these
recordings could not be commercially distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes the Dead's 30-year tradition and propels it into
the brave new world of the Internet,'' said Eric Doney, the lawyer
for the band. ``The members of the Grateful Dead feel this decision
is important for them and their fans to continue the spirit of that
policy of free concert recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Doney said that sites posting the home-grown recordings cannot
profit from the Dead files. They are prohibited from charging fans
to download the files, posting ads on sites containing the files,
and selling data about users who visit the sites to download the
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the strict noncommercial aspects of
these recorded concerts are preserved,'' Doney said. ``The
remaining members of the band were adamant about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doney emphasized that the sanctions apply only to the
fan-recorded songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go after any Web site operators that violate these
guidelines,'' he said. ``We'll consider that copyright infringement
and will proceed accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement makes the Grateful Dead one of the first major
bands to embrace the MP3 format, joining the likes of Perry Farrell
of Jane's Addiction, rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy and singer
Alanis Morissette in support of the digital movement.
</P>
<P>
   Record labels and recording industry trade groups have launched
a number of lawsuits against MP3 Web sites and makers of MP3
listening devices, fearing the technology will lead to widespread
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the format continues to grow. Last week,
Seattle-based RealNetworks Inc., which makes industry standard
Internet audio software, debuted its RealJukebox Web music player,
which processes MP3-encoded music files.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin Wednesday tried hard to persuade the
world that the reason he fired his prime minister and the cabinet
was because they failed to do enough for Russia's emaciated
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But his true motives for plunging the country into fresh
political chaos, and picking a perilous fight with parliament, have
more to do with pique, personal rivalry and the erratic whims of an
autocratic and unwell president.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers who steal Boris Yeltsin's thunder rarely last long, at
least during the periods in which he is fit enough to turn up for
work. Yevgeny Primakov, his third prime minister in just over a
year, proved no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions surfaced soon after Primakov, the former foreign
minister, took office last year when he tried to cobble together a
political truce between the Kremlin and a hostile,
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was asked to forgo some powers, including suspending his
right to sack the government. Typically, he balked.
</P>
<P>
   Catapulted into office as the president's second-choice premier
after last August's financial meltdown (the Duma rejected the first
candidate, Viktor Chernomyrdin), Primakov arrived amid predictions
of civil unrest and total economic collapse. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he established a measure of stability in which the
ruble _ though a quarter of its 1997 value against the dollar _ was
holding its own. The economy was stagnant, but tiny glimmers of
hope had just begun to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, a crucial source of Russian revenues, were at last
rallying. A tentative $4.5 billion deal was last month cobbled
together with the International Monetary Fund, albeit one that
stood a strong chance of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The small Russian stock market this week reached its highest
point for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-suffering 146 million population was impressed and
relieved. Primakov's experience and apparatchik's manner reassured
many among the impoverished millions who blame corrupted
pro-western reformers for Russia's demise.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most trusted politician in the country. Although
elderly, (he is 69) unhealthy and _ he insists _ unwilling, he was
soon seen as favorite for the presidency. Polls invariably placed
him as the second-round winner of an election.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin evidently hated it. While he was sidelined by illness,
Primakov's stature and authority grew, enhanced by his
coalition-building skills based on strong ties with parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Back at work, Yeltsin sought to reassert his power, and began to
publicly humiliate his premier. Kremlin staff made no secret that
Primakov was dispensable; whispers ran around Moscow that he would
soon be axed.
</P>
<P>
   Another murkier issue may also be tangled up with this affair.
Primakov had sworn to clean up corruption. During his term,
investigators began to pursue the business magnate Boris
Berezovsky, an adviser of the first family and a friend of the
president's younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   They set their sights on several firms with which the mogul has
links, including the giant airline Aeroflot, run by the president's
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was uneasy. Its inner circle found themselves in the
cross-hairs as prosecutors probed claims that some of the
president's senior staff farmed out lucrative building contracts in
return for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, still incomplete, formally come under the
auspices of the hapless prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, whom the
Kremlin tried in vain to persuade parliament to oust by brandishing
a secretly recorded video showing the lawman having sex with
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the moving force was thought to come from within the
Primakov administration, and its parliamentary allies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons, Yeltsin has _ yet again _ dropped a
bombshell
</P>
<P>
   With a war in Europe and economic gloom at home, Russia is
without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF deal will almost certainly founder, and Russia will
drift for weeks as the parliament and the Kremlin haggle over a new
premier.
</P>
<P>
   A confrontation with parliament, and a possible constitutional
crisis, is taking shape as the Duma seems certain to refuse to
confirm Yeltsin's nominated candidate for premier, Sergei
Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   If it does so three times, then the president must dissolve it,
forcing early elections. But the chamber is set to begin
impeachment proceedings this week _ a move which may also have
prompted Yeltsin's decision to fire the popular premier.
</P>
<P>
   If it votes in favor _ as now seems likely _ then it cannot be
disbanded. What then happens is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday there was widespread condemnation of Primakov's
sacking. Only pro-market liberals applauded. Most of the rest of
the political spectrum _ including the head of the pro-government
``Our Home is Russia'' _ saw it as a serious misjudgment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The West will also have serious doubts. Primakov was never much
loved in Washington, which recoiled at the presence of senior
Communists in his government _ notably, first deputy prime minister
Yuri Maslyukov (who Wednesday announced that he would have no part
in the next government.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his hardball, pro-Russian foreign policy _ honed in his
years as foreign minister _ win him many western fans.
</P>
<P>
   His mission to Belgrade at the start of the Yugoslav war _ in
which he was accompanied by his hawkish defense minister, Marshal
Igor Sergeyev, and was seen joking with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic _ went down particularly badly abroad. Soon afterwards
Yeltsin handed the Kosovo mediating job to Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, Yevgeny Primakov was respected. He was a tough
but pragmatic deal-maker, a safe pair of hands in an unstable and
heavily armed nation. The same cannot be said of the man who fired
him. &QL;

WELFARE OVERHAUL HURTS IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ In our boom economy that defies the
doomsayers, discussions about welfare have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians _ from President Clinton to congressional leaders to
heralded Republican governors _ chortle with great satisfaction
that the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 has greatly reduced the public
dependency of our neediest countrymates, who are beginning to work
for a living. Before we all become too smug about lifting millions
of people out of poverty and into productive work, listen to Doris
Ng.
</P>
<P>
   She is a staff attorney with Equal Rights Advocates, a San
Francisco public-interest law center for women and the author of a
recent report, ``From War on Poverty to War on Welfare: The Impact
of Welfare Reform on the Lives of Immigrant Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the perception promoted by political pooh-bahs that
welfare recipients are getting off the dole and onto someone's
payroll, Ng's study tells a more sobering tale. Equal Rights
Advocates interviewed 75 Mexican-American women and 75
Vietnamese-American women in Santa Clara County, the heart of
prosperous Silicon Valley. The survey showed that California's new
welfare-to-work program, called CalWorks, is having little success
in moving these women off welfare and into jobs where they could
become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant women aren't the only people on public assistance who
are targeted to be on their own in two years under welfare reform.
But because California has a disproportionate number of legal
immigrants, the study's findings add a bracing dash of realism to
politicians' self-satisfied positive spin about reform's benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of welfare reform, the outlook for poor
immigrant women has worsened,'' the study said. ``Indeed ...
welfare reform is being implemented in ways that largely ignore
immigrant women's barriers to self-sufficiency. Consequently, even
after participating in CalWorks, many immigrant women on welfare
will reach their time limits but not be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier is a huge impediment to securing poor
welfare-dependent immigrant women a self-sufficient future, Ng
said. About half of the Mexican-American women and an astounding 86
percent of the Vietnamese-American women surveyed had poor or no
understanding of English.
</P>
<P>
   When they look for jobs, most of which require English
proficiency, ``they are unable to secure work or (they) wind up in
temporary or low-paying jobs that offer no promise of long-term
stability,'' Ng said. Other immigrant advocates tell similar tales
of welfare reform's hidden consequences. Indeed, legal immigrants
were targeted for disproportionate welfare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While some public benefits have been restored, the attorneys who
represent immigrants say fear and confusion continue among many
legal immigrants about whether they remain eligible for welfare,
food stamps, Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Park, senior staff attorney for the National Asian Pacific
American Legal Consortium in Washington, D.C., said, ``Because some
benefits like SSI have been restored for some immigrants, there is
a danger of falling into a level of complacency about the
continuing needs of some in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress hasn't undone certain harsh provisions, such as the
ineligibility of immigrants who came legally to the United States
after Aug. 22, 1996, when the Welfare Reform Act became law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfair of our government to turn its back on these new
immigrants when they fall into a financial crisis,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, a staff attorney with the Asian Law Caucus of San
Francisco, said, ``Nobody understands welfare reform _ not
government workers, and not elderly immigrants who need

benefits aren't applying, while ignorant government workers have
turned down applications of people who qualify for assistance.

   MOSCOW _ I was lounging in the corridor, waiting to go into the
steam bath, when a fat lobster-colored figure in a towel lumbered
past, cursing: ``That ye B.N. Ye:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ye'' are the first letters of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's
surname. Ye is also the ``f'' word in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The bather could find only expletives to express his disgust at
the news that the Kremlin leader had again dismissed his
government, plunging Russia into new political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered around the television set in the anteroom, where
bathers of both sexes drink beer or tea between bouts of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old man Yeltsin, he's got a brain like baby food,'' said
a woman as we heard how the president had thanked and dismissed
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the man who managed to bring
stability to Russia after the acute crisis of last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, good thing I did not get undressed,'' I said. ``I'd
better be heading back to my office.'' At which point Borya, the
genial bath attendant whom I have know for years, turned to me and
said: ``You're English, aren't you? If I could only get my hands on
those (expletive) in NATO. It's only because of Yeltsin that we're
not helping the Serbs. You think you can squeeze the Slavs and go
on squeezing. Well, you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   I packed up my things and left, together with a friend. This
little scene at the banya spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the strength of feeling among ordinary Russians
against their president, who now has only a two percent approval
rating in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes to a confrontation between the Kremlin and the
Communists and nationalists in the State Duma, there is no doubt
that the crowds that once cheered Yeltsin will follow the red flag.
</P>
<P>
   And it illustrates how seriously the West has alienated Russians
by bombing Yugoslavia, a policy that arguably has contributed to
destabilizing Russia as well as the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad,'' said my Russian friend quietly when we were
outside the banya. ``Politicians in both the East and West take
decisions to further their ambitions and none of them cares about
the consequences for all the little people in the world.'' &QL;

<P>
   There is a game that you can play in bars across America now,
after a few beers, and it takes a few beers for it to make much
sense. The game goes like this: who was the best, John Elway,
Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
   It is not a very smart game, and the conclusion usually depends
(unsurprisingly) on whether you are an American football,
basketball or hockey fan.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty obvious, actually, but we'll let that pass
for the moment. The point is that a nation has just lost three of
its sporting heroes, all of them preeminent in ways that few
individuals could ever dream of in their chosen careers, within the
space of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where heroes get built up very big, the sports
media have chewed over little else.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to go was John Elway, 38, the quarterback for the
Denver Broncos and one of the greatest players of the decade. Elway
won more games than any other quarterback in history, and his
clean-cut looks made him a favorite for those who didn't follow the
Broncos, or even football.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way Wayne Gretzky, late of the New York Rangers, was
an icon for the game, the best possible advertisement. And Michael
Jordan made the Chicago Bulls not just the leading team in the NBA
but one of the greatest sporting formations of any kind, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of these three greats has, of course, spurred
interest in the next faces on the scene: not just in the sports
bars of middle America, but in the boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For these are the figures who will keep sport booming, keep the
value of franchises accelerating by 20 percent a year and make sure
there are names to sell everything from phone cards to chewing
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it takes decades to build the kind of skills, loyalty
and character that these three could summon, it is in some ways
pernicious to pick names early, but that hasn't stopped anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to start speculating is football. Following in
Elway's footsteps, probably the greatest quarterback in the game
today is Troy Aikman, 33, of the Dallas Cowboys. But amongst the
younger generation, the brightest star is 29-year old Brett Favre
of the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first player in NFL history to win three consecutive
Most Valuable Player awards and his 110 touchdowns over the last
three years leads all NFL quarterbacks. He may be a little cocky,
but he's good and he has years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three sports, the one that most badly needs to build up
new stars is basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's retirement broke up the Bulls, that was bad
enough; and few have shone for the last year in a game that is
slightly tarnished in the fans' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The player's strike helped rip a lot of the guts out of the
season, and it is hard to pick any single individual as the obvious
heir to ``the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the media has tried to push Grant Hill of the
Detroit Pistons, but it doesn't quite work. Kobe Bryant of the Los
Angeles Lakers has a big following, but has had a run of weak
games. Tim Duncan, 23, of the San Antonio Spurs is worth keeping an
eye on.
</P>
<P>
   But none is Jordan, which is hardly surprising: they are
younger, less experienced and far, far less rich.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL decided (apparently collectively) that Gretzky's torch
has been passed on to Jaromir Jagr, the Pittsburgh Penguins'
27-year-old right wing from the Czech Republic, against whom
Gretzky played his last game.
</P>
<P>
   He is a perfect skater with the most intricately developed sense
of gravity and balance, his long hair flying out from under his
helmet. He was the NHL's leading scorer in 1998, though a
persistent groin injury has laid him low again this season.
</P>
<P>
   But is he a Wayne Gretzky? Because in the end, he has to be the
greatest of the three retirees in purely sporting terms.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was a remarkable player, one of the greatest but not the
greatest by a long chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, Joe Montana of the San
Francisco 49ers or Joe Namath of the New York Jets all get higher
billing from the critics. Indeed, Elway was once best known for his
inability to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has a very plausible case to make for his place in
sporting history with his six NBA championships, 10 scoring titles
and five MVP awards. But still there are plenty of others to claim
the title of the best hoops player ever _ take your pick from Wilt
Chamberlain, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He will be hard to follow, but there will be another Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be another Gretzky _ ever. He loomed over his
sport in a way that neither of the others can claim. He is the
NHL's all-time leader with 2,857 points, 894 goals and 1,963
assists with four teams. When he scored his 1,072nd goal in March,
he beat Gordie Howe's record to become the all-time leading
goal-scorer.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his trade from Edmonton to Los Angeles in 1988 that
helped open up hockey for audiences who had previously preferred to
spend their winter evenings elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that anyone will emerge who is close to Gretzky:
alone of the three, he was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He
gained (as was his due) instant access to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the three is the likeliest to still be remembered in a
decade's time outside their own sport?
</P>
<P>
   Not Gretzky, whatever his achievements. Jordan is still racking
up millions in endorsements and ad campaigns, part of a
mini-economy that is worth billions. And it might be worth
remembering that one of the American presidential candidates this
year, Bill Bradley, started out life with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has dropped $1,000 Bradley's way as a campaign donation,
a sign that his ambitions may stretch a little further than his own
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jordan sounds fine; President Jordan might just sound
even better. &QL;

<P>
   There is a game that you can play in bars across America now,
after a few beers, and it takes a few beers for it to make much
sense. The game goes like this: who was the best, John Elway,
Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
   It is not a very smart game, and the conclusion usually depends
(unsurprisingly) on whether you are an American football,
basketball or hockey fan.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty obvious, actually, but we'll let that pass
for the moment. The point is that a nation has just lost three of
its sporting heroes, all of them preeminent in ways that few
individuals could ever dream of in their chosen careers, within the
space of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where heroes get built up very big, the sports
media have chewed over little else.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to go was John Elway, 38, the quarterback for the
Denver Broncos and one of the greatest players of the decade. Elway
won more games than any other quarterback in history, and his
clean-cut looks made him a favorite for those who didn't follow the
Broncos, or even football.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way Wayne Gretzky, late of the New York Rangers, was
an icon for the game, the best possible advertisement. And Michael
Jordan made the Chicago Bulls not just the leading team in the NBA
but one of the greatest sporting formations of any kind, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of these three greats has, of course, spurred
interest in the next faces on the scene: not just in the sports
bars of middle America, but in the boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For these are the figures who will keep sport booming, keep the
value of franchises accelerating by 20 percent a year and make sure
there are names to sell everything from phone cards to chewing
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it takes decades to build the kind of skills, loyalty
and character that these three could summon, it is in some ways
pernicious to pick names early, but that hasn't stopped anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to start speculating is football. Following in
Elway's footsteps, probably the greatest quarterback in the game
today is Troy Aikman, 33, of the Dallas Cowboys. But amongst the
younger generation, the brightest star is 29-year old Brett Favre
of the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first player in NFL history to win three consecutive
Most Valuable Player awards and his 110 touchdowns over the last
three years leads all NFL quarterbacks. He may be a little cocky,
but he's good and he has years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three sports, the one that most badly needs to build up
new stars is basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's retirement broke up the Bulls, that was bad
enough; and few have shone for the last year in a game that is
slightly tarnished in the fans' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The player's strike helped rip a lot of the guts out of the
season, and it is hard to pick any single individual as the obvious
heir to ``the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the media has tried to push Grant Hill of the
Detroit Pistons, but it doesn't quite work. Kobe Bryant of the Los
Angeles Lakers has a big following, but has had a run of weak
games. Tim Duncan, 23, of the San Antonio Spurs is worth keeping an
eye on.
</P>
<P>
   But none is Jordan, which is hardly surprising: they are
younger, less experienced and far, far less rich.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL decided (apparently collectively) that Gretzky's torch
has been passed on to Jaromir Jagr, the Pittsburgh Penguins'
27-year-old right wing from the Czech Republic, against whom
Gretzky played his last game.
</P>
<P>
   He is a perfect skater with the most intricately developed sense
of gravity and balance, his long hair flying out from under his
helmet. He was the NHL's leading scorer in 1998, though a
persistent groin injury has laid him low again this season.
</P>
<P>
   But is he a Wayne Gretzky? Because in the end, he has to be the
greatest of the three retirees in purely sporting terms.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was a remarkable player, one of the greatest but not the
greatest by a long chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, Joe Montana of the San
Francisco 49ers or Joe Namath of the New York Jets all get higher
billing from the critics. Indeed, Elway was once best known for his
inability to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has a very plausible case to make for his place in
sporting history with his six NBA championships, 10 scoring titles
and five MVP awards. But still there are plenty of others to claim
the title of the best hoops player ever _ take your pick from Wilt
Chamberlain, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He will be hard to follow, but there will be another Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be another Gretzky _ ever. He loomed over his
sport in a way that neither of the others can claim. He is the
NHL's all-time leader with 2,857 points, 894 goals and 1,963
assists with four teams. When he scored his 1,072nd goal in March,
he beat Gordie Howe's record to become the all-time leading
goal-scorer.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his trade from Edmonton to Los Angeles in 1988 that
helped open up hockey for audiences who had previously preferred to
spend their winter evenings elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that anyone will emerge who is close to Gretzky:
alone of the three, he was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He
gained (as was his due) instant access to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the three is the likeliest to still be remembered in a
decade's time outside their own sport?
</P>
<P>
   Not Gretzky, whatever his achievements. Jordan is still racking
up millions in endorsements and ad campaigns, part of a
mini-economy that is worth billions. And it might be worth
remembering that one of the American presidential candidates this
year, Bill Bradley, started out life with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has dropped $1,000 Bradley's way as a campaign donation,
a sign that his ambitions may stretch a little further than his own
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jordan sounds fine; President Jordan might just sound
even better. &QL;

DAVIS CALLS FOR SPENDING CHUNK OF SURPLUS ON SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis will propose tapping an
anticipated budget surplus to expand after-school and preschool
programs, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is expected to announce Friday that California's booming
economy has created an unexpected surplus of $4 billion, giving the
governor another chance to influence the state's $78 billion
spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Davis, who is a Democrat, would
ask the Legislature to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise spending for after-school programs at elementary and
middle schools from $50 million per year to $85 million. The extra
money would start an additional 383 recreational and homework
programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expand state-funded preschool programs from 66,000 to 100,000
children, ages 3 and 4, who are from low-income families. The first
six months of the expansion is expected to cost $23 million, and
would increase to $69 million in the next budget year. The current
$180 million program is mostly paid for with federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Davis doesn't want to spend any more money than is required
under Proposition 98, which mandates that at least half of all new
state revenues be spent for education. More announcements are
expected from the governor on his plans for the rest of the $4
billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The mass killings at a Littleton, Colo., high school have
renewed interest in after-school programs, which Attorney General
Bill Lockyer made a centerpiece of his campaign last year. Studies
show that most crimes committed by juveniles occur between 3 and 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One bill before the Legislature would provide $75 million for
after-school programs in kindergarten through grade eight. Davis'
proposal would add $10 million to the K-8 programs, which one
senator said is still short of what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have almost double the interest and need in
California,'' said state Sen. Deborah Ortiz, D-Sacramento, author
of the measure. ``The governor is still $15 million below the need,
and that's going to continue to grow. This is just the tip of the
iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gordon, assistant director of the California School Boards
Association, said after-school programs offering a variety of
academic and recreational opportunities are essential to student
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those resources will be put to good use by school districts
that will need them,'' he said of the governor's proposal.

RELIGIOUS PURPOSE IS THE ANSWER TO THE HIGH SCHOOL MASSACRE

   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The funerals have been held for the 13 victims of the shooting
rampage at Columbine High School, and the question remains. How did
this happen?
</P>
<P>
   There are many different answers given by psychologists -- so
many theories that it is difficult to form an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the problem is guns. I agree that guns are a big
problem in our society. I do not allow a gun in my home.
</P>
<P>
   However, remember that this is America, where we have the right
to bear arms. And in earlier days on the frontier, children did not
pick up guns and shoot their parents, their teachers or their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not the availability of guns, it's that guns fall into
the hands of the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   NRA President Charlton Heston claims that schools need armed
guards to insure the safety of the students. I wonder, does he want
our schools to turn into armed camps? Visiting a classroom will
become like visiting the state penitentiary. You would be frisked
and then go through metal detectors as you enter the cafeteria or
the school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, even armed guards can't prevent a shooting
rampage. Columbine High School had an armed guard. Arming the staff
is no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who claim that the reason this took place
was because there is no mention of God in school. Well, whose God
are they talking about? Conflicts are taking place all over the
world in the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   So no, God cannot be the only answer to this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some would blame the poor. But remember, most of the school
murders have taken place in middle- to upper-middle-class white
class communities. It is not the inner-city schools and the poor
who produce violent youth -- it is our society.
</P>
<P>
   Some say, let's blame the parents. They should know and do
something about it!
</P>
<P>
   Well, that doesn't always work. Parents can't always know what
is happening. Even when they do, they may not be able to change
anything.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 15-year-old Kipland P. Kinkel was charged with
murdering his parents and other students while wounding 18 people.
He came from a model home and supportive parents.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Susan Klebold, the mother of Dylan
Bennett Klebold, one of the two boys who went on the Littleton
murder spree, said, ``There is no way I could have known this would
happen.'' She claims she had no idea of what was wrong with her
son.
</P>
<P>
   I feel there may be something wrong with the Klebolds. Any
parent with Jewish family ties knows that a child who yells out
``Heil Hitler'' while bowling a strike has a deep and obvious
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying with the worst world enemy of the Jewish people,
Adolf Hitler, is a sure sign of a major disorder.
</P>
<P>
   True, the parents supported Dylan Bennett with a sharp-looking
BMW, a $500,000 home and the latest computers. But that doesn't buy
peace or meaning in life.
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, cover up a major disorder for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Something that has been overlooked in recent years is our lack
of a religion that teaches the universal religious purpose of life.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's time to find a common denominator in all religions
based on the Noachide laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish world Chassidic leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi
Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902-1994), stated early in the 1970s
that in order for the American school system to succeed it must
allow a moment of silence for religious and moral contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   He asked that the Noachide laws be distributed. Students would
have a moment for prayer or contemplation to think about a higher
purpose and meaning for life. This could be achieved through the
seven divine laws that preceded the three world religions, Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The Almighty God gave us, the children of Noah, seven divine
laws by which to live. These are the prohibition against adultery,
idolatry, blasphemy, theft, murder, sexual ambiguity, acts of
cruelty and last, but not least, the obligation of courts and
justice for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that by observing the Noachide Laws we would have
fewer differences between people. We would not shoot one another,
because it trespasses a Noachide Law. We would not commit cruelty
to animals and to our fellow human beings, because God said not to.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful if we were truly one family? We would
be compassionate, caring about the world as family members.
</P>
<P>
   We would look for similarities among people and not differences,
and work together in securing a healthy present, and be more
optimistic about our future.
</P>
<P>
   We would recognize the athlete for what he is, a gifted person
with athletic qualities. We would give respect to those who are
inclined to the world of technology and computers. Those musically
inclined would have their place in society. Jocks, nerds and spacey
music people would have acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A reason why Eric David Harris and Dylan Bennett Klebold killed
so many people on the day of Hitler's birthday stemmed from the
fact that they did not feel themselves to be important members in a
world of law and order. They took matters into their own hands and
destroyed the real world around them in the name of others who had
done the same, like Hitler. There is no God, they claimed.

<P>
   As a school administrator I am told to give the children space.
When we are dealing with a troublesome teen-ager, the sage advice
is, ``Let them do what they want in their rooms and garages. At
least you know where they are. If you ask too much they will run
away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   If that be the case, then how will we ever know our kids?
</P>
<P>
   Educators are instructed to keep prayer and the mention of God
out of the school system. It is interesting to note that during the
killings almost all the kids prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that tell us that we may have it all wrong?
Seventy-thousand people attending the funerals is a sign that we
must change the way we are doing things.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent and educator, I believe we must be interested in
everything our children do. We should allow a moment of prayer or
silence in our school system. We should not wait for a crisis to
allow the students pray.

parade inspired by the popular marching bands of New Orleans.
Another innovation will be cruises aboard the riverboat
Nouvelle-Orleans June 30 through July 10. Two cruises will be
offered, the first includes a Louisiana-style feast and music, the
second is at midnight and features Cajun and zydeco music. Among
performers this year will be Cassandra Wilson and the Dave Brubeck
Quartet. Programming for the festival will be announced May 11, and
the free outdoor concerts will be announced on June 17. Tickets for

   Each May, 3 million tulips blossom for the Canadian Tulip
Festival in Canada's scenic National Capital Region. The festival
celebrates friendship, and this year the May 14 through 24 festival
will mark the unique friendship between the United States and
Canada. The festival, now the world's largest tulip event, began in
1945 with the gift of 100,000 tulips from Princess Juliana of the
Netherlands as a token of gratitude for sheltering the Dutch royal
family during World War II. Among the spectacular floral sculptures
planned are one based on Van Gogh's ``Iris,'' and another
representing a floral map of the two countries with bouquets that
highlight the official flowers of the 63 states, provinces, and
territories.

RELIGIOUS PURPOSE IS THE ANSWER TO THE HIGH SCHOOL MASSACRE

   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The funerals have been held for the 13 victims of the shooting
rampage at Columbine High School, and the question remains. How did
this happen?
</P>
<P>
   There are many different answers given by psychologists -- so
many theories that it is difficult to form an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the problem is guns. I agree that guns are a big
problem in our society. I do not allow a gun in my home.
</P>
<P>
   However, remember that this is America, where we have the right
to bear arms. And in earlier days on the frontier, children did not
pick up guns and shoot their parents, their teachers or their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not the availability of guns, it's that guns fall into
the hands of the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   NRA President Charlton Heston claims that schools need armed
guards to insure the safety of the students. I wonder, does he want
our schools to turn into armed camps? Visiting a classroom will
become like visiting the state penitentiary. You would be frisked
and then go through metal detectors as you enter the cafeteria or
the school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, even armed guards can't prevent a shooting
rampage. Columbine High School had an armed guard. Arming the staff
is no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who claim that the reason this took place
was because there is no mention of God in school. Well, whose God
are they talking about? Conflicts are taking place all over the
world in the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   So no, God cannot be the only answer to this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some would blame the poor. But remember, most of the school
murders have taken place in middle- to upper-middle-class white
class communities. It is not the inner-city schools and the poor
who produce violent youth -- it is our society.
</P>
<P>
   Some say, let's blame the parents. They should know and do
something about it!
</P>
<P>
   Well, that doesn't always work. Parents can't always know what
is happening. Even when they do, they may not be able to change
anything.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 15-year-old Kipland P. Kinkel was charged with
murdering his parents and other students while wounding 18 people.
He came from a model home and supportive parents.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Susan Klebold, the mother of Dylan
Bennett Klebold, one of the two boys who went on the Littleton
murder spree, said, ``There is no way I could have known this would
happen.'' She claims she had no idea of what was wrong with her
son.
</P>
<P>
   I feel there may be something wrong with the Klebolds. Any
parent with Jewish family ties knows that a child who yells out
``Heil Hitler'' while bowling a strike has a deep and obvious
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying with the worst world enemy of the Jewish people,
Adolf Hitler, is a sure sign of a major disorder.
</P>
<P>
   True, the parents supported Dylan Bennett with a sharp-looking
BMW, a $500,000 home and the latest computers. But that doesn't buy
peace or meaning in life.
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, cover up a major disorder for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Something that has been overlooked in recent years is our lack
of a religion that teaches the universal religious purpose of life.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's time to find a common denominator in all religions
based on the Noachide laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish world Chassidic leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi
Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902-1994), stated early in the 1970s
that in order for the American school system to succeed it must
allow a moment of silence for religious and moral contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   He asked that the Noachide laws be distributed. Students would
have a moment for prayer or contemplation to think about a higher
purpose and meaning for life. This could be achieved through the
seven divine laws that preceded the three world religions, Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The Almighty God gave us, the children of Noah, seven divine
laws by which to live. These are the prohibition against adultery,
idolatry, blasphemy, theft, murder, sexual ambiguity, acts of
cruelty and last, but not least, the obligation of courts and
justice for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that by observing the Noachide Laws we would have
fewer differences between people. We would not shoot one another,
because it trespasses a Noachide Law. We would not commit cruelty
to animals and to our fellow human beings, because God said not to.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful if we were truly one family? We would
be compassionate, caring about the world as family members.
</P>
<P>
   We would look for similarities among people and not differences,
and work together in securing a healthy present, and be more
optimistic about our future.
</P>
<P>
   We would recognize the athlete for what he is, a gifted person
with athletic qualities. We would give respect to those who are
inclined to the world of technology and computers. Those musically
inclined would have their place in society. Jocks, nerds and spacey
music people would have acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A reason why Eric David Harris and Dylan Bennett Klebold killed

KOWTOWING TO CHINESE IS EGREGIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's lucky for the American people that John McCain and Pat
Buchanan are running for president. If they weren't, there might be
no U.S. political leader with the gumption to stand up to China.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some other politicians or officials have stepped up to the
plate in reaction to China's outrageous temper tantrum over the
accidental bombing of its embassy in Belgrade _ but if they have, I
haven't heard or read their remarks.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the folks who ought to be telling China to
pipe down and back off have instead been licking the commie thugs'
boots. The list of bootlickers begins with _ big surprise _
President Clinton. As of Tuesday afternoon Central Daylight Time,
Clinton had apologized at least three times for NATO's mistake in
dropping bombs on the Chinese Embassy instead of the intended
Yugoslav military target.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple apologies go to a country, it must be noted, that
has yet to apologize for stealing U.S. nuclear secrets, for handing
over nuclear technology to Pakistan and Iran, for trying to
influence U.S. elections, or even for slaughtering its own citizens
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Clinton could take a brief respite from banking his
Chinese campaign contributions and begging China's forgiveness for
a purely unintentional intelligence error and explain to his own
constituents why the greatest nation on the planet should be
kowtowing to one of the most consistently lawless governments in
the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   We made a mistake. We apologized. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it should be the end of the story. But mere apologies
won't satisfy the arrogant criminals who run the show in China.
They want abject remorse. They want the United States to beg for
absolution.
</P>
<P>
   And we've all but done it, thanks to a commander in chief who
would generate a lot more respect among his countrymen if he would
stand up to China the way he has stood up to this two-bit dictator
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   So. Thank goodness for McCain and Buchanan, both of whom
criticized China in no uncertain terms for encouraging violent
demonstrations against the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and for its
continuing insistence on further apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what McCain said, as reported by The Associated Press:
``I would call up the premier of China and say: `Stop it, and stop
it right now. We have apologized, it's tragic, now it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, according to the AP, ripped China as ``an antagonistic
and hostile regime spoiling for a quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be terrific if the president could be so resolute?
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, at the very least, that Clinton could tell the
Chinese that if they don't shape up, he's going to cut off their
spies' unfettered access to U.S. nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfectly obvious why the Chinese are making such a big
deal out of this accident, of course: They see it as an opportunity
to distract the world from their endless list of misdeeds. A CNN
reporter who works the State Department suggested that some
officials are speculating that the devious dictators in China are
throwing a fit over the bombing in order to put U.S. officials on
the defensive and thus extract concessions in future negotiations
on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Which reminds me: Do you suppose Bob Dole would be
groveling at the feet of the Chinese tyrants if he were president
of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Not on your life.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't be in this mess, needless to say, if Clinton hadn't
committed the grievous misjudgment of involving the United States
in a European civil war that is none of America's business. Never
mind that the CIA can't separate the legitimate targets from the
innocent bystanders; we shouldn't be bombing Yugoslavia in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe something good will come of it, though. Maybe the
unfortunate bombing of that embassy will cool American enthusiasm
for getting chummy with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   After this mess, even Clinton should be able to figure out that
China is no friend of the United States.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ During one of our first meetings with
humanitarian workers in Iraq, we were told that economic sanctions
have not only caused the deaths of thousands of children each
month, but have created a breakdown of the family structure, with
many children now forced to help with the family income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are too important to become a pawn of politics,''
Anupama Rao Singh, the United Nations Children's Fund
representative in Iraq, told us.

   We had seen children dying in the hospitals of the city.
Elsewhere we saw the effects of the family breakdown.

explained their situation, which she blamed on poor economic
conditions as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who was a butcher, lost his shop shortly after the
Persian Gulf War and hasn't worked since. The mother had an
untreated thyroid condition and couldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The father sent the younger boys to school, but Walid and Ramy
are his stepchildren and didn't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the older boys shined shoes on the streets around the
Palestine and Sheraton hotels to support the family. Walid and Ramy
both were quick to make friends among the members of the Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Walid had a wide smile and he could sing _ in English _ ``My
Heart Will Go On,'' the theme song from the movie ``Titanic.'' Ramy
was slower to smile, but, with his freckles, he conjured up an
image of Huck Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Not a day went by that the boys couldn't be found shining some
delegate's shoes at 50 cents a pop, making them, for a while
anyway, among the highest paid workers in Baghdad. The delegates
often got two shoeshines a day. Baghdad is a dusty city.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage in downtown Baghdad was clean and bright and the
children, who ranged from week-old infants to 5-year-olds, wore
identical colorful pajamas. There were almost as many women
volunteers as children on view.
</P>
<P>
   The number of orphanages in Iraq is growing along with the
divorce and suicide rates, and as more families abandon children,
according to humanitarian workers in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, appropriately called Government House Orphanage,
had government showcase written all over it. Its director, Bayon
Hasui Ali, a woman with six years of experience working at
orphanages, said the volunteers were all women because this kind of
work required a woman. She said many Iraq and foreign officials had
visited her orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage was supported by the government and by wealthy
donors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ali, whose job it is to escort members of the news media
wherever they want to go during their stay in Baghdad, translated
while the orphans sang songs of welcome to the visiting
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a teacher,'' the
children chanted in unison, with one little boy stepping out and
shaking his fist emphatically to the last words of the verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a farmer,'' the
children chanted, and another little boy stepped out from the group
and shook his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a soldier,'' the
children chanted. This time an older girl stepped out from the
group and said, ``And we will kill the American invaders.'' The
children smiled and clapped their hands.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Not long after we arrived in Baghdad, Hans von Sponeck, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, told us that the
sanctions ``are turning the social structure upside down.'' We
didn't have to go far to see what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   On the street along the Tigris River, not far from the Palestine
Hotel, a nervous-looking man approached me, thinking I was a member
of the WPSR delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask your help,'' he said, speaking softly in perfect
English. ``I'm a doctor, and I'm fed up with working in this
country. I want to leave. I'm thinking about leaving my
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned he was talking to a reporter, he said I must
never use his name or where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would kill me and my entire family if they found out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't live here watching people die, with his
family suffering as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the father of a baby boy,'' he said, ``but I'm not happy
because I can't imagine his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor blamed the sanctions, but his No. 1 concern, at the
moment, was whether I would help him if he and his family got out
of the country. I said I didn't know what I could do, but I gave
him my business card, and he said I would hear from him very soon.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter probably lasted less time than it took to write
about it.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   At a school not far from the Palestine Hotel last month, dozens
of smiling students welcomed American visitors warmly, then sang
songs about Saddam Hussein and about killing American invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a picture of Saddam Hussein,'' a bright-eyed cherub
chanted. ``I like it very much, very much.'' Nothing personal was
intended; it was just the morning ritual.
</P>
<P>
   In an art class, several student paintings showed boys and girls
firing guns at warplanes bearing U.S. ensignias. One picture showed
tombstones with a caption written in Arabic that said, ``Martyrs
are better than us all.''
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet residential district, a single-story building built
around a large courtyard served as a military training school for
members of the Baath Party, Iraq's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, for two hours a day, for one month, every member of
the party, male and female, is required to learn how to fire an
AK-47 assault rifle, administer emergency first aid, and march in
formation. The training session we observed, at least the women's
class, seemed to require a lot of marching in formation.
</P>
<P>
   The women, all looking quite healthy and prosperous in
fashionable dresses, high-heels and makeup, watched carefully while
male soldiers showed them how to aim the rifles. Then each woman
practiced pulling back the bolt and aiming at an imaginary enemy
across the courtyard. In this class, the target was often the
Post-Intelligencer photographer or reporter. We assumed the rifles
weren't loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the soldiers said more than 1 million members
of the Baath Party went through this militia training last year.
The party wants everyone to be prepared, he said, in case Iraq is
invaded.
</P>
<P>
   As the women did a modified goose-step around the courtyard,
they sang a verse or two from a song that roughly translated as,
``Saddam Hussein will always remain in power no matter what the
Americans do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the troop of women marched by, one rather tall, heavily made
up, husky-looking woman in a masculine-looking suit-dress winked at
me, and her dark red lips broke into a wide grin. I laughed, but I
was flattered. And I knew then it was time to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers gathered them together for one last group photo,
with the carefully coiffed women holding their AK-47s high in the
air, and we said goodbye. My new friend broke formation long enough
for a little wave.

   BAGHDAD,IRAQ: for a little wave.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   In an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Baghdad, a woman said
she was trying to persuade her brother, a well-known surgeon, to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can only survive here because my mother gives him money,''
she said as her eyes filled with tears. ``All of our inheritance is
being used up; we will have nothing for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose 10-year-old Toyota was one of the few cars I'd
seen in Iraq that didn't have crumpled fenders and a cracked
windshield, said her two young children would have the opportunity
to get advanced degrees here if they wanted to, but they would have
nothing to look forward to after they graduated.
</P>
<P>
   A painting on the wall of her clean, modern house traced her
husband's family tree back to the prophet Mohammed. The woman was a
college graduate and her family came from a long line of
intellectuals _ her father obtained an advanced degree in the
United States. Her husband, who ran a business, came from a family
of soldiers and merchants. He had spent four years on the front
lines during the war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   She wore modern dresses, but covered her head with a scarf, a
nod to tradition that kept her from getting a decent job in
business, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (modern businessmen) want younger women who dress in
short skirts,'' she said. Even her daughter, she said, refuses to
wear a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she had heard so much about the new diseases
making a comeback under the sanctions that she worried about her
children's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, if my brother goes abroad, he can make money and
help us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   We had come to Iraq expecting that suspicious government
officials would watch our every move. We feared people would hate
us because we came from the country whose warplanes were bombing
some part of their country almost daily. But we found that most
people were warm and friendly. The first thing people wanted to
know was where we were from. After hearing we were from the United
States, the next thing they said was ``welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   And we found that amid the death and destruction, the squalor
and deterioration of Baghdad, that life _ and love _ go on.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   The Palestine Hotel, the Baghdad home for the Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility delegation, was the host to 51
wedding parties on a Thursday night. Friday is the only day off for
most Iraqis (Christians also get Sundays off) so Thursday has
become the day of choice for getting married. The one-day honeymoon
beats no honeymoon at all.
</P>
<P>
   Marriages in Iraq are almost always arranged by families. The
couple is accompanied to the hotel, and often right up to the room,
by a crowd of relatives and other well-wishers and by musicians
playing horns and drums. Most of the couples wore Western-style
wedding clothes _ the women's outfits were especially elaborate
with large hoop skirts and long veils.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was repeated across the road at the Sheraton, and
according to the Palestine Hotel manager, similar celebrations were
going on at several other of the nicer hotels around Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   One wedding party took over the Palestine Hotel ballroom for the
night, and filled it with about 400 wedding guests.
</P>
<P>
   Several young men standing at the door of the ballroom waved us
in and showed us to the center of the room where the bride and
groom were seated on a stage while relatives and friends crowded
around them for photo opportunities. The groom even invited his new
guests up on stage to pose for wedding pictures with himself and
the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men formed a line and danced for us. Their
wild gyrations and laughter suggested that the Muslim prohibition
of alcohol might have been temporarily suspended for this occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is sold openly by stores in Baghdad, but it can be
consumed only in private.
</P>
<P>
   The groom's brother, Amar Karim Kitan (we spoke in Spanish) said
the couple could afford the lavish celebration _ a dinner for all
the guests and a live band _ because Hadi, the new husband, was a
car dealer. His brother was a very modern man and would take only
one wife, although four wives are allowed, Amar said.
</P>
<P>
   The party lasted all night. The Post-Intelligencer's reporter
and photographer didn't.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Abu Ali, the journalists were allowed into two large
mosques in Baghdad. After checking our shoes at the entrance of the
first mosque, Abu Ali made a path through the worshipers to the
front of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi TV crew had already set up its camera and microphone.
It was Friday, the Muslim holy day, and we were shown to an area of
the mosque that was packed with men. The women and children,
according to custom, worship separately.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard outside the mosque, we were warmly welcomed by
the clerics but inside, at the front of the room, the atmosphere
was less welcoming. The religious leader's sermon was animated and
the word America seemed to pop up frequently, and when it did, many
eyes shifted our way.
</P>
<P>
   It felt good to get outside, in the courtyard, again. But on the
way out, the man who gave the sermon, broad-shouldered and more
than 6 feet tall, suddenly appeared with an entourage of disciples
and asked where we were from and who we were. After learning we
were journalists from the United States, he said, ``You are
welcome.'' Then he instructed us to send him a copy of whatever we
do. He wasn't the kind of man who would take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the second, more historic Golden Mosque, we decided to
wander through the immense courtyard surrounding the inner-prayer
hall. Pilgrims were sprawled along the outer walls. Entire
families, some with sickly looking infants, appeared to have taken
up residence there.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ali said many families were waiting for their relatives to
return from the annual Hadj pilgrimage to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, a
trip every Muslim is required to make at least once in their lives
if it is economically possible.
</P>
<P>
   There were many soldiers visiting the Golden Mosque, and we were
challenged several times, but each time, Abu Ali flashed his ID and
we were free to continue our visit.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Nestled on the banks of the Tigris River across from the
Palestine Hotel, the tea house became a late-night ritual for many
members of the WPSR delegtion. For a few cents, you could sit among
crowds of Iraqis _ men on the inside, women and men outside _ and
drink heavily sugared hot tea and smoke flavored tobacco from a
large water pipe.
</P>
<P>
   For a few cents more, the waiter would bring dominoes, which
seemed to be widely popular. The low murmur of conversations was
frequently interrupted by the click, click, click sound of the
wooden domino rectangles as they slapped against the tables to
cries of victory or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Tea was served in small, clear glasses nearly one-third filled
with roughly-granulated sugar. The water pipe, with a choice of
peach-, apple- or berry-flavored mild tobacco, was more than 3 feet
tall, and was usually placed to one side of the table, with only
the hose passed among the smokers. The combination of sweet tea and
flavored tobacco was such a relaxing treat that even non-smokers
often shared the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Street children often hovered in the background, eager to run
errands or shine shoes, and often some of the children would join
us at the table for a treat _ a Pepsi or the big splurge, a Coke.
Pepsi was produced in Iraq; Coke was imported.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, a couple of women from the WPSR delegation
broke the taboo on having women inside the tea house, but the men
there seemed non-plussed. The waiters served them and eventually
the boredom of it all drove them back outside with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   With the stars overhead and good company at hand, we talked of
mundane things throughout the night. Malnutrition, dying children
and the sanctions that fully occupied our days were rarely
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Sabehna Jasim smiled and straightened her black robe and warmly
welcomed us into her home.
</P>
<P>
   We had come looking for a better vantage point to photograph the
farmers' market that ran along the street on one side of her
building. Her second-story apartment overlooking the intersection
of two streets was perfect. Abu Ali, whose job is to assist foreign
journalists, conveyed our request and translated during our visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim took us out onto the balcony for a better view. After
reluctantly acquiescing to our requests to pose for photos, she
insisted on making us tea.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other members of the family lived there in three small
rooms. In the hallway, a retarded woman sat on the floor and helped
one of Jasim's granddaughters shell peas. She smiled and murmured
softly each time we passed her in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   In a place of honor, dominating the living room wall, was a
photo of a young officer in uniform. It was Jasim's first-born son.
He had been killed by U.S. forces during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's widow smiled shyly at the guests and helped serve
tea.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, the UNICEF representative, in Baghdad, said economic
sanctions have caused a breakdown of the family structure, with
many children now forced to help support their families and
dropping out of the educational system.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen some evidence of these problems _ street children
begging for handouts, shoeshine boys working late into the night,
children sitting on the floors of underfunded classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jasim's home, the family remains strong. The children go
to school. A son and a daughter have jobs. And it was clear that
the strong-willed 70-year-old Jasim was the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an hour taking photos and talking. Times are hard,
Jasim said. The U.N. food rations always run out at least a week
before the end of the month. There is work, but little pay. The
sanctions are no good, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hated President Bush, and when reminded that he was
no longer president, she said President Clinton was just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim said she had no hard feelings for Americans. She said she
blamed the government of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are the same everywhere,'' she said. ``Only governments
are different.''
</P>
<P>
   When we left, Jasim told us we were always welcome in her home.
So, just before leaving Baghdad, we went back, taking the family a
present in gratitude for their help and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim excitedly ushered us into her apartment, and informed us
with great satisfaction that we had, by our last visit, made her
the toast of her little part of the town.
</P>
<P>
   And, once again, despite our pleas, she insisted on serving us
tea, cheese and bread that a grandson fetched fresh from a nearby
bakery.

GO GREEK: FUSION FOOD FIT FOR THE GODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The food of Greece may be the world's first fusion cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Until around 3500 B.C., Greeks ate what their Mediterranean
neighbors ate _ a simple diet of grilled meats, fish, and found
greens and fruit. But as the Minoan civilization developed on the
Crete and Santorini islands of the Aegean, a wider variety of food
became available.
</P>
<P>
   Trade with North Africa brought dates and onions, and clearing
of forests lead to olive groves and planted wheat. By the time the
Greeks were holding forth from their civilized world, the
preparation of good food was considered an important part of life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, following the ascension of Rome, occupation by the
Ottoman Empire and the introduction of New World ingredients, that
early Greek diet of olives, wheat, figs, grapes, wild greens, fish
and some meat has been brightened by non-native ingredients such as
lemons, potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes, spinach and okra. This hot,
rocky country serves up a treasure of culinary ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables still play an important role in the diet,
as do olives and olive oil. Yogurt and cheese are the primary dairy
sources and lamb is the predominant meat. And all of this is bathed
in the sun of Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   So sit on your deck, pour a little ouzo, dally with some olives
and cheese triangles, and transport yourself to the warmth of a
white and blue village.
</P>
<P>
   LETTUCE DOLMAS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 heads lettuce
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds ground lamb
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped dill
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup raw rice
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 to 2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Select lettuce with leaves suitable for stuffing. Clean
carefully and separate leaves. Bring pot of water to boil, add
leaves, a few at a time, cook just until they wilt. Remove
immediately and spread on platter. If they are too large, cut in
half before stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Place meat, onions, parsley, dill, rice, egg whites, 2
tablespoons butter, salt and pepper in bowl. Knead well to mix.
Place about 1 teaspoon of mixture on a leaf and bring up sides
toward center, then roll up like a cigar. Place stuffed leaves,
open side down, in layers in pot. Add a little salt and pepper and
rest of butter and enough water to half cover. Lay a plate on the
dolmas; cover pot. Simmer slowly and when they have absorbed almost
all the water, add milk. Allow to cook a few minutes longer until
approximately 1 cup liquid remains. Beat egg yolks, add lemon juice
to them, then blend in liquid from pot. Return sauce to pot. Shake
over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot.

<P>
   Serves 6-8 as entree, 20 as appetizers
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk, scalded
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound feta cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped dill
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound (approximately) phyllo
</P>
<P>
   Oil, melted butter or other shortening for brushing phyllo
</P>
<P>
   Melt 3 tablespoons butter, add flour and stir well to blend.
Slowly add hot milk, stirring constantly to make a thick, creamy
sauce. Remove from heat. Add salt and pepper and continue to stir
until sauce is just cool. Crumble cheese into small pieces and add
them to sauce. Add eggs, stir well, then add dill and mix until
well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each of the sheets of phyllo lengthwise into 3 strips. Take
1 strip at a time (keep others covered to prevent their drying
out). Holding strip horizontally, brush with melted shortening. Put
a teaspoonful of filling in the lower-left corner, then fold corner
over to make a triangle along the strips. Fold upper-left corner
over to close triangle. Continue to fold phyllo over and over until
strip has become a small (about 3-inch) triangle of pastry. Brush
top with butter. Continue to prepare all of the ``pittas'' like
this. Place triangles on lightly buttered baking sheet and bake in
preheated 300-degree oven for 15-20 minutes.

<P>
   Glossary:
</P>
<P>
   Baklava: A classic dessert of sheets of very thin pastry
(phyllo) layered with honey syrup and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Dolmas: Generally, grape leaves stuffed with meat and rice and
rolled into cylinders. You can make these yourself, or purchase
them ready-made in cans. Drain, pat dry and serve with lemon
wedges. Popular on meze plates.
</P>
<P>
   Feta cheese: This crumbly, salty white cheese can be made with
cow, sheep or goat milk, with the first being the mildest. Store
the cheese for long-term use in brine in the refrigerator. (If no
brine comes with the cheese, make your own by dissolving 3
tablespoons of salt in 4 cups water.)
</P>
<P>
   Gyros: The national street food of Greece, these sandwiches are
a substantial, plate-size piece of flat bread topped with shaved,
roasted lamb topped with onions and a cucumber sauce. (In America,
these meat is shaved from a cone of compressed beef and lamb.)
</P>
<P>
   Meze: A grand selection of little bites that can be served as an
appetizer or a whole meal. This tradition is popular throughout the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Olives: In Greece, olives are a regional specialty, with each
area preparing its own variety in time-honored fashion. Kalamatas,
large black briny olives, are the most well-known in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Ouzo: Anise-flavored liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllo: Thin ``leaves'' of pastry dough that is sold in 1-pound
packages in the frozen-food section of nearly all supermarkets.
Allow dough to thaw in refrigerator, then bring to room
temperature. Take care not to let dough dry out while working with
it by laying a damp cloth or towel over the stack of dough not
being used at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Retsina: The process for making this Greek wine is more than
3,000 years old and involves treating the wine with pine-tree
resin. The wine has a strong smell and flavor that takes some
getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   Souvlaki: Marinated lamb.

 &HT;    TEACHERS AS ACADEMICALLY SKILLED AS OTHER GRADS, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    310&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New teachers score about as well as other college
graduates on standardized tests of academic ability, says a
groundbreaking study released Thursday by the Educational Testing
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can finally shatter the myth and the slogan, 'Those who
can, do, and those who can't, teach,' `` commented Anne Bryant of
the National School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   The college admission scores of applicants who pass
teacher-licensing tests
</P>
<P>
   average roughly 95 percent of the level reached by all
graduates, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 34-state study also uncovered a big gap between
high scores for new teachers with academic specialities and low
scores for other new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively poor standing of elementary, special education
and physical education teachers supports the argument by some
reformers ``that all teachers ought to have a firm grounding in at
least one academic content area,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cameron, executive director of the National Education
Association, said, ``The real problem is that, when you get
elementary teachers majoring in mathematics and science, they're
scooped up by private industry, which pays a hell of a lot more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   To measure academic ability, the researchers compared all
college graduates' scores on the ACT and SAT college admission
tests with the scores of all graduates who passed teaching-license
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported finding:
</P>
<P>
   _ Above-average scores in math ability among those who passed
licensing tests for science or math.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above-average scores in verbal ability among those who passed
licensing tests for English, science, foreign languages and social
studies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Below-average scores in math and verbal ability among those
who passed licensing tests for elementary education, art and music,
special education and physical education.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unquestionably more facets to 'academic ability,'
than SAT/ACT scores,'' the researchers conceded. ``Nevertheless, we
know of no other widely available data that enable trustworthy
comparisons of individuals' academic qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by Drew H. Gitomer and Andrew Latham of
the Educational Testing Service and Robert Ziomek of ACT, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also concluded that efforts to match tomorrow's
teaching force to the growing diversity of the nation's student
population are falling short. Of the nearly 240,000 applicants who
passed Praxis II teacher-licensing tests between 1994 and 1997, 76
percent were women and 88 percent were non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that the best way to increase
the number of ``qualified candidates of color'' would be to improve
the education of minority children in the public schools.

   That first recorded use of economic sanctions didn't work, and
instead helped precipitate the Peloponnesian War, a horrific and
lengthy conflict that brought an end to the fledgling Greek
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,500 years later the use of economic sanctions has
become increasingly common _ and controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Athenians, the United States uses sanctions in an
effort to dissuade nations from taking undesirable actions _
supporting terrorism, proliferating weapons of mass destruction,
violating human rights, trafficking in drugs or despoiling the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Megarians, many of the targets of U.S. sanctions _
countries such as Iraq, Iran and Cuba _ do not change their
behavior in the face of sanctions, according to numerous studies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the United States' use of economic sanctions _ generally
defined as restrictions on foreign commerce for purposes of foreign
policy or national security _ is under fire. Lawmakers in Congress
have introduced proposals that would make it harder to impose
economic sanctions, and President Clinton has taken steps to exempt
food and medicine from sanctions. His administration has pledged to
support broader reform of sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to change sanctions policy has come largely from
business interests, including The Boeing Co. and Washington state's
agricultural industry, who complain that they are losing export
markets all over the world because Congress and the president are
too quick to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But the business community has found an unlikely ally in human
rights activists, who argue that economic sanctions often hurt
innocent civilians, most notably in Iraq. The activists have struck
a chord in Seattle, leading to anti-sanctions protests and vigils.
Activists have led groups of physicians and others to Iraq with
medicine, equipment and medical texts, which is not allowed without
State Department approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions have become a cheap way of doing foreign policy,
except the costs are often really quite terrible,'' says John
Mueller, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, who
argues that sanctions should be narrowly focused on technologies
usable by the military, and should not include food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like blowing up a building, where you can count
corpses, but it's much worse,'' said Mueller, referring to
estimates that tens of thousands of Iraqi children have died from
malnutrition-related diseases because of a lack of food and
medicine. ``Numerically, the deaths in Iraq are worse than
Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Institute for International Economics found
that since 1970, unilateral U.S. sanctions had achieved foreign
policy goals only 13 percent of the time. The study also concluded
that sanctions are costing the United States $15 billion to $19
billion annually in potential exports.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have not led to democratic changes in Cuba, Iraq or
Iran, and the unambiguous threat of sanctions did not deter India
and Pakistan from testing nuclear weapons last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been successes. Most recently, Libyan
strongman Moammar Gadhafi agreed to turn over for trial two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pam Am Flight 103, which killed
270. The United Nations in return suspended sanctions against
Libya, which included crippling bans on international air travel
and sales of weapons and oil industry equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, diplomacy and sanctions have produced the result we
wanted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions also played a role in helping to force the apartheid
government of South Africa to allow democratic elections, and State
Department officials claim economic sanctions helped force Serbia
to the negotiating table over the war in Bosnia and limited Iraq's
ability to rebuild its military after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies cited three other successes: blocking the Russian transfer
of sophisticated cryogenic rocket engines to India after trade
sanctions were threatened in July 1993; halting South African arms
shipments to Syria after a U.S. threat to withhold aid in January
1997, and imposing targeted sanctions against China to cease
exports of sensitive military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the breadth of economic sanctions vary widely. The
National Association of Manufacturers claims that 42 percent of the
world's population lives in countries sanctioned by the United
States. According to the Congressional Research Service, by the end
of 1997 there were 191 different sanctions being imposed by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions are imposed or threatened against 75 countries,
ranging from Angola to Zaire, for behaviors ranging from support
for terrorism to failure to adequately protect sea turtles,
according to a study by Clinton's Export Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got now is a situation where if the executive
branch were to implement everything in sanctions laws, there's
hardly a country on Earth we wouldn't have trouble with,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., a sanctions critic.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department agrees that the use of sanctions has
multiplied in the 1990s. That agency says the United States has
applied sanctions for foreign policy purposes 115 times since World
War I, including 61 times since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``However you do the arithmetic, there certainly have been quite
a number of sanctions initiatives coming out of the Congress
recently, and some of them have been relatively high profile,''
said Assistant Secretary of State Alan Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sanctions are quite extensive. The United States
maintains broad unilateral sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea and the Sudan, although there are now some
exemptions for food and medicine. Together with the United Nations,
the United States also supports broad multilateral sanctions
against Angola, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a raft of countries subjected to more specific
sanctions, responding to a particular behavior, and barring a
particular import or a certain type of government assistance. For
instance, Gambia and Burundi have been denied money from the
Overseas Private Investment Corp. because of military coups there.
</P>
<P>
   European governments have been increasingly reluctant to impose
sanctions _ preferring the same strategy of engagement that the
United States espouses when it comes to China _ and so,
increasingly, sanctions are being imposed unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argues that although multilateral
sanctions are preferable because they are more effective,
unilateral sanctions are often the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are unsuccessful in building a multilateral regime, and
important national interests or core values are at issue, we must
be prepared to act unilaterally,'' said Undersecretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat. ``We cannot permit other countries to veto our
use of sanctions by their failure to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars and members of Congress call economic sanctions a
kind of foreign policy on the cheap, because sanctions are
generally less expensive and less controversial than military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a phenomenon of the last five years, and it has
come about because members of Congress, and sometimes the
administration, want to show displeasure to various countries who
have adopted human rights policies with which we disagree, or have
curtailed freedom of religion, or have threatened their
neighbors,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the leading
congressional critic of U.S. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting a sanction on a country always seems to be an
inexpensive way to address the problem. ... Unfortunately, almost
none of these sanctions have brought about change ... and I think
they have led to a sizable loss of foreign trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, sanctions for years have been a favorite foreign
policy tool of the White House, Congress and, increasingly, state
and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted on sanctions against South Africa during the
Reagan administration, and during the Clinton years, Republicans
have been pushing for sanctions against countries that persecute
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions have become a very quick way for people to say to
their constituents, `By God, we did something,''' says George
Lopez, professor of government at Notre Dame University.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments, too, are eager to use sanctions as an
expression of their concern about the policies of foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 25 cities around the country have adopted sanctions,
most aimed at Myanmar (also known as Burma), but a few targeting
Nigeria, Tibet, Indonesia and Cuba, according to a study by the
Organization for International Investment. Seattle's City Council,
under heavy pressure from the business community, rejected pleas
from human rights activists to bar purchases from companies doing
business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   State governments have little success imposing sanctions. In a
closely watched case, a federal district court last fall struck
down a Massachusetts law restricting state transactions with
companies doing business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   But sanction advocates claim that the fact that New York state
debated sanctions against foreign financial institutions _ as well
as a measure passed by the city of Los Angeles _ helped prod Swiss
banks into settling Holocaust-era claims.

DELEGATION'S TRIP TO BAGHDAD WAS `AN AWAKENING,' SAYS ONE WHO
WENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 22 members in the delegation of medical workers and others
interested in the effects of economic sanctions against Iraq
returned from a trip to Baghdad last month with their misgivings
about sanctions reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   In defying the sanctions by traveling to Iraq, and for bringing
in medicine, equipment and textbooks without U.S. and United
Nations approval, each delegation member risks up to 12 years in
prison and penalties up to $1 million plus an administrative fine
up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Local members of the delegation are already planning another
trip to Iraq in October. They also are trying to bring ailing
children from Baghdad to Seattle for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here are members of the delegation who made the trip, endorsed
by Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility (WPSR) and
sponsored by International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear
War:
</P>
<P>
   Gerri Haynes, trip organizer, a nurse from Woodinville, Wash.,
and executive board member of WPSR. ``I see this as an awakening
more than an act of civil disobedience. We can go back to the
United States and say to people that the economic sanctions on Iraq
are having a horrible effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is to bring doctors together to transcend politics _
for physicians to witness his human tragedy _ and to speak out
against the medical catastrophe which has been created by the
sanctions on the people of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Haynes, husband of Gerri Haynes, a cardiologist and member
of the clinical faculty of the University of Washington. ``I feel
more comfortable now (after visiting Iraq) that I can speak more
knowledgeably and forcefully about not only the conditions of the
sanctions in general, but about the specific problems of the
sanctions in preventing our medical colleagues in Iraq from doing
their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Kanter, a psychiatrist from Seattle and vice president of
WPSR. ``The message is to end sanctions, that's what we need to do.
We need to explain to people that the sanctions are a weapon of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Kluge, a retired clinical cardiologist from Seattle.
``I have always been very unhappy with the Gulf War and with all
the things we've done to the Iraqis since then. Walking through the
hospitals and just walking down the street, there is no doubt that
the sanctions have affected the country very severely. The American
public needs to be informed that these sanctions mainly have an
effect on the children, on the sick, on the poor, and that just
cannot be the intention, and therefore it absolutely has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramzy Baroud, a Palestinian writer from Seattle. ``I went to
Iraq because I wanted to support those who are defenseless. I
wanted to declare my appreciation for the civilization and their
history and for their ability to stand up to this monster that is
called sanctions. Seeing a dying child is completely different from
listing that child as a statistic. The sanctions are not affecting
the political leadership at all. The poor, the children, the
innocent are paying the price of the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Deryk Houston, an artist from Victoria, B.C. ``Noam Chomsky said
`Silence is complicity' and this is my way of not being silent. And
now I can sleep at night, knowing I wasn't silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Skeet, coordinator of End the Arms Race, the largest
peace organization in Western Canada and a founding member of the
Campaign to End Sanctions Against the People of Iraq, from
Vancouver, B.C. ``The sanctions are an invisible occupation force.
I took a message to the Iraqi people, that my group will work to
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Wareham, a family practice doctor and the national president
of the Medical Association for Prevention of War and regional vice
president of the International Physicians against the Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons, from Melbourne, Australia. ``Coming from a
country with good health care facilities, which Iraq had 10 years
ago, I was appalled at the state of the hospitals in Baghdad. In
addition, the denial of clean water and adequate food to the people
of Iraq violates all medical, ethical and humanitarian principles.
If people in Australia could see the result of the sanctions policy
which our government supports, they would be ashamed and outraged
that this suffering is wrought in our name and without our
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawsar Talaat, a pediatric resident from Milwaukee. ``I needed
to see it (the suffering) with my own eyes. And I think once you've
seen it, you become a much more effective advocate. Governments
aren't supposed to target civilian populations, and I think that's
what we're doing in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Luna, a student of naturopathic medicine from Portland,
Ore. ``An embargo that continues to prevent people from getting
adequate food and medicine is outrageous and needs to end
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pence, a retired social worker from Melbourne, Australia.
``I am appalled at the damage the sanctions inflict on the people
of Iraq, and as a former chair of the Justice and Peace unit of the
Anglican Diocese of New Westminster, I want to report what is
happening in Iraq to the local churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Connolly, a psychiatric physician from Vancouver, B.C.
``Prior to the sanctions, psychiatric patients were cared for
according to the highest standards in the Arab world. Now, because
of sanctions, psychiatric patients must be treated with medication
only episodically available. No professionally trained nursing
personnel are available. Facilities are woefully inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   David Morgan, national president of Veterans against Nuclear
Arms from Vancouver, B.C. ``I grew up in Britain during World War
II, so the bombing of cities in modern war is a reality for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Morgan, a peace activist from Vancouver, B.C. ``As a
member of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and
the president of the British Columbia branch, I have been doing
every thing in my power to get Canadian people to speak out against
the war and sanctions on Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Magdalena Szuszkiewicz, a third-year medical student at the
University of Maryland from Baltimore . ``I wanted to go on this
mission, because it is absolutely the right thing to do. If I did
not dare to stand up against injustice now, I would never have
enough courage to do anything meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Aboukhater, a member of the Australian Arabic Council
from Melbourne, Australia. ``I believe we are severing a society by
depriving the children, children who will grow up with a
justifiable hatred of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Bre Reiber, an executive assistant with Physicians for Social
Responsibility of New York City, originally from Puyallup, but now
from New Jersey. ``We're all a part of creation. I want to spread
the story of the horrible effects of the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene Macinnes, a retired social worker from Vancouver, B.C. ``I
feel very sad about the suffering of the Iraqi people. The
sanctions are not solving any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar Wadi, a psychiatrist from Gaza. Wadi was turned back at
the Iraq border because he had an Israeli stamp on his passport.
This is a common practice for Iraq, just as it is a common practice
for Israel to reject people with passports stamped in certain
Arabic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Busso Lemme, a retired landscape architect and businessman from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Moore, a doctor of family medicine from Ottawa, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Zoughbi Zoughbi, director of the Bethlehem Center for
Reconciliation in Bethlehem.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am remodeling my kitchen and will be installing a new sink
in the counter top. I had planned on a self-rimming type of sink
that overlaps or mounts on top of the counter. However, my wife
prefers the type that mounts under the countertop and has no rim or
molding of any kind sitting on top of the counter. She feels this
will make it easier to wipe off the countertop by simply pushing
crumbs, etc. into the sink. How is an under-the-top sink installed,
and is this type more difficult to install?
</P>
<P>
   A: Called an undermount sink, this type is more difficult and
more time-consuming to install (probably several hours as compared
to less than one hour for most self-rimming sinks). The
self-rimming sink merely sits on top of the counter with a layer of
putty under the rim (except for some stainless models that require
a rim). The undermount sink is held in place with a special
clamping ring that is screwed to the underside of the counter as
shown here. However, there is another problem to consider: an
undermount sink is only possible when installed on solid countertop
material (granite, Corian or similar material) because the edge of
the counter material will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have to repair some wooden chairs that have rungs which fit
into holes in the side of each leg. These rungs have worked loose
in a couple of places and I want to re-glue these loose joints.
What is the best way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A. The job can only be done properly by literally taking the
chair apart and pulling the end of each rung out of the hole. You
can then scrape all old glue off the end of the rung and from
inside the hole. Coat the rung end with fresh glue, then reassemble
each joint and clamp by wrapping a long strap or rope around the
chair legs. If taking the chair apart is impractical or too
difficult, you can try pulling the end of each rung out as far as
it will go, then use a small knife to scrape glue off the end of
that rung. Spread carpenter's glue on the rung and inside the hole,
then force the joint closed and apply pressure by wrapping as
described above.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house has windows with double-pane glass and there are
metal or plastic strips inside _ between the two panes of glass _
that divide the large panes to make them look like smaller ones.
Unfortunately, these strips seem to be falling apart. Can we fix
these windows without having to replace them?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible that the glass panes can be taken apart and the
strips replaced, but this will depend on how the window was made or
assembled. In any case, this is usually not a job for the
do-it-yourselfer. It calls for the services of a professional
glazier. I suggest you contact the manufacturer of that window, or
check with several local glass dealers in your community to see if
any are equipped to handle this kind of job.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have fiberglass shingles on our roof that are still in
pretty good condition. However, I have never been happy with the
color. Is there any way to change the color without having to
replace the shingles?
</P>
<P>
   A. The only way to change the color of the shingles is to paint
them. There are special paints sold for this purpose, but they come
in only a limited number of colors and not all dealers carry them.
You can also paint the shingles with a good quality latex house
paint, but like any paint, this will have to be renewed every few
years, depending on the weather and the exposure.

FLEXIBILITY IS KEY TO REACHING PEACE WITH MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 16)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S.-led NATO plan is quite clear in its goal
of ending the airstrikes against Yugoslavia and leaving that
tortured land once Kosovo has been made safe for the return of a
million or more ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic understands the basic principles of the plan
and has had it in his power to end the conflict since before the
air assault began March 24. But he has chosen to play the stubborn
martyr, knowing full well that his treatment of the Kosovar
Albanians has been barbarous.
</P>
<P>
   Once the furor over NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade subsides and peace negotiations resume in
earnest, flexibility will be the key word as NATO officials spar
with Milosevic over the intricacies of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way peace accords usually are achieved. It has been
rare for the United States, with all its vast power, to get all it
wants at the peace table.
</P>
<P>
   We settled the Korean conflict in 1953 by agreeing to an
armistice that has remained in effect ever since, maintaining a
tenuous and often unstable peace between the communist north and
the democratic south.
</P>
<P>
   After years of devastation in Vietnam, America's Henry Kissinger
and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho concluded a peace settlement in 1973
and were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize that year.
</P>
<P>
   But the accord was short-lived. By 1975 North Vietnamese armed
forces had overrun South Vietnam. One of the bleak memories of that
decade is of American diplomats and Vietnamese nationals scrambling
to board helicopters that would transport them to safety away from
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies emerged triumphant from the
Persian Gulf War of 1991. Iraqi troops were forced to retreat from
Kuwait to Baghdad. But when it was all over, Saddam Hussein
remained in power in Iraq and continued to be a threat to security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   World War II was a mighty exception to the rule that the West
does not totally prevail at the end of a long and bloody armed
conflict. In 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt decreed that he and his
allies would settle for nothing less than ``unconditional
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what they got, although in accepting Japan's surrender,
they did agree to let Emperor Hirohito remain on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But that unconditional surrender had its critics, who claimed
that the war in Europe was prolonged because Nazi Germany knew it
could not soften peace arrangements. There was no chance that Adolf
Hitler would get the treatment accorded Kaiser Wilhelm at the end
of World War I when he fled to the Netherlands for nearly a quarter
century of peaceful exile.
</P>
<P>
   One such critic was the late Edward Folliard, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporter who covered the White House for the
Washington Post from the days of Roosevelt to those of Richard
Nixon. Folliard contended that Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
commanded the allied forces that conquered Germany, shared his
view.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after the war had ended but before Eisenhower became
president, he got an opportunity to ask the general his view on
``unconditional surrender.'' Ike said he opposed it because German
propagandists had used it to strengthen German morale and spur Nazi
military forces to fight to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that Ike had ambivalent feelings on the
subject. In a letter to his wife Mamie in August 1944, he said,
``The end of the war will come only with complete destruction of
the Hun forces.'' A month later, he wrote: ``There is still a lot
of suffering to go through. God, I hate the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, having witnessed the destruction of his evil empire and
knowing that the allies would put him to death, took his own life
just before Germany's surrender in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ike said the demand for ``unconditional surrender'' had
lengthened the war, it was because of action he took in 1942 that
Roosevelt felt compelled to declare such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   When Eisenhower took command of U.S.-English efforts that year
to drive the Germans from North Africa, he began searching for a
French military leader who could persuade French forces to break
with Germany and support the allies.
</P>
<P>
   After considering several French generals, he sought the
cooperation of Adm. Jean Darlan, commander-in-chief of the Vichy
French armed forces fighting on Germany's side.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ike's biographer, Stephen Ambrose, ``The admiral's
record was odious. He was a fascist, an eager collaborator with the
Nazis, author of Vichy's anti-Semitic decrees, and violently
anti-British.''
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that Eisenhower had signed an agreement with
Darlan, according to Ambrose, a ``tremendous storm of criticism''
crashed around Eisenhower and almost cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt supported him, but to quiet his critics in England and
the Soviet Union as well as at home he announced his
``unconditional surrender'' policy. That announcement assured his
allies, including Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin, that ``we
will have no truck with fascism in any way, shape or manner.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be great if Clinton and his NATO colleagues could apply
the same rule to Milosevic's brutal ethnic cleansing. But they may
have to agree to less stringent terms in the name of peace.

WITH MUCH AT STAKE, U.S. BUSINESSES PUSH FOR SANCTIONS REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The turning point in the debate over economic
sanctions came last fall, when India and Pakistan tested nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The tests triggered automatic U.S. sanctions against the two
countries, mandated by a nuclear non-proliferation law
overwhelmingly passed by Congress just a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctions caused an uproar when it became clear that a
primary victim would be Northwest wheat farmers, for whom Pakistan
represents the largest export market.
</P>
<P>
   So Congress acted to grant President Clinton permission to waive
the sanctions, at least for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress, and the White House, are poised to take broader
action to change U.S. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering several pieces of legislation that would
bar sanctions on food and medicine, require cost-benefit analyses
before new sanctions could be imposed, and require the president to
periodically report to Congress on new sanctions. Any new
unilateral economic sanction must expire after two years unless
Congress or the president acts to reauthorize them.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure, sponsored by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., has
attracted 31 co-sponsors, including Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
and Patty Murray, D-Wash. The House measure, sponsored by Rep.
Philip Crane, R-Ill., has 68 co-sponsors, including Republicans
Jennifer Dunn, Doc Hastings and George Nethercutt and Democrats
Brian Baird and Adam Smith, all of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though one could probably justify individually almost all
of the sanctions bills that have been passed, when you look at the
impact of them all combined, it's overwhelmingly negative on our
economy, and it does not seem to have any measurable foreign policy
plus,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently acted to make it possible for some
food and medicine to be exported to Iran, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's point man on sanctions, Undersecretary of
State Stuart Eizenstat, said the administration wants to go
further: ``We would like to have comprehensive sanctions reform,''
Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   USA Engage, the coalition of 674 business groups pushing for
sanctions reform, is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more support than we did last year at this time,
and the mood is very strong,'' said Frank Kittredge, vice chairman
of the coalition. ``On the other hand, it looks as if China is
going to be a large part of the (congressional) agenda, and that's
going to require a big role by the business community, and we know
the administration is very heavily focused on Kosovo. But certainly
our congressional sponsors show no signs of being discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   But change is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mobilization of business groups will block a lot of new
mandatory sanctions, but I don't know that they will reverse those
sanctions already on the book,'' said Ken Rodman, chairman of the
government department at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.
Members of Congress ``don't want to look like they're supporting
Castro or the mullahs in Iran, and it's very difficult to separate
those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., recently wrote a stinging rebuke of the
business community, saying that ``what they really stand for is not
engagement but mercantilism _ an amoral foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the journal Foreign Affairs, Helms called claims of a
sanctions frenzy ``sheer nonsense'' and blasted ``the distortions
spread by this small cabal of lobbyists in the name of American
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the lobbyists, the United States should be
hamstrung when a government proliferates weapons of mass
destruction, commits genocide or supports terrorists,'' Helms
wrote. ``But if that same government floods the American market
with cheap television sets, America should throw the book at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is not normally a Helms ally, but on this issue the
labor union has some sympathy for his position. An official of the
AFL-CIO urged a congressional panel studying sanctions to ensure
that the United States continue to ``stand for values other than
short-term cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seldom hear an outcry from the business community that the
U.S. trade representative should refrain from imposing retaliatory
tariffs or withdrawing trade preferences when one of our trading
partners has engaged in illegal dumping or has violated
intellectual property rights agreements,'' said Thea Lee, the
AFL-CIO's assistant director for international economics. ``In the
end, objections to unilateral economic sanctions in general are not
to the efficacy of the policy tool, but rather to the unworthiness
of the cause when there is no direct economic interest of U.S.
businesses at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office issued a report
minimizing the concerns of sanctions critics, suggesting that the
loss of income to businesses pales in comparison with the
gargantuan size of the U.S. economy. The Congressional Budget
Office also pointed out that most sanctions are against countries
with relatively underdeveloped economies, lessening the effect on
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House has reservations about placing too many
limits on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take the view that a disciplined approach needs to be
imposed on sanctions, to show some reasonable balance on costs and
gains,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Alan Larson. ``But there
are clearly times when the greater good, the national interest,
calls for sanctions. Those sanctions are going to impose costs on
American companies, American citizens, and that's part of the price
we pay for protecting our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana's Lugar, the leading congressional critic of
sanctions, said even without a bill, the policy is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it doesn't matter whether we pass the bill,
because effectively unilateral sanctions have become very
dubious,'' Lugar said. ``Instead of the enthusiasm with which these
(sanctions proposals) used to be greeted, now they're met with
skepticism.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, 1990, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution
661, imposing economic sanctions on Iraq. It includes a full trade
embargo on Iraq, except for medical supplies, food and other items
of humanitarian need, as determined by the Security Council
sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, amended several times since 1990, remain in
force. The United States has maintained its own sanctions against
Iraq since Aug. 2, 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, leading
to the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, the Post-Intelligencer's foreign desk editor, and
Post-Intelligencer photographer Dan DeLong spent two weeks last
month in Baghdad, Iraq. They accompanied a 22-member delegation of
medical workers and others, sponsored by the Washington Physicians
for Social Responsibility, who attempted to gauge the effect of
sanctions on Iraqi citizens, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   The medical group, in part to call attention to the effects of
the sanctions, intentionally defied them. Visiting Iraq is in
itself a violation of the sanctions. The group also brought
medicine, equipment and medical textbooks without obtaining the
required U.N. approval. They also did not obtain a required U.S.
government permit to travel to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer's Johnson and DeLong, as journalists,
were exempt from State Department regulations prohibiting travel to
Iraq by Americans.

EFFECTS OF THE SANCTIONS, AT A GLANCE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   _The six-week Persian Gulf War in 1991 resulted in the
large-scale destruction of military and civilian infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
   _The sanctions imposed on Iraq _ to force Saddam Hussein to
allow the United Nations to dismantle or destroy Iraq's long-range
missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons _ and related
circumstances have prevented the country from repairing all its
damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and whenever attempts have
been made, those have been incomplete. That applies to
electricity-generating and water-purification plants,
sewage-treatment facilities and communication and transportation
networks. That has affected the quality of life of countless
Iraqis, especially those belonging to the middle and lower economic
levels who do not have alternatives or options to overcome the
effects of the war and the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   _Iraq is an oil-rich country, which before the 1991 war was
almost totally dependent on the import of food and medicine.
Financial constraints as a result of the sanctions have prevented
the necessary import of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _The vast majority of Iraq's people has been on a
semi-starvation diet for years.
</P>
<P>
   _The reduction in the import of medicines, owing to a lack of
financial resources, as well as a lack of minimum health care
facilities, insecticides, pharmaceutical and other related
equipment have crippled the health care services, which in prewar
years were of a high quality.
</P>
<P>
   _The effect of this situation on Iraq's infant and child
population is especially severe. From 1991 to 1998, children under
5died from malnutrition-related diseases in numbers ranging from a
conservative 2,690 a month to a more realistic 5,357 per month.
</P>
<P>
   _The U.N. Oil-for-Food Program has kept the numbers of deaths
and cases of malnutrition from rising still higher, but it was
never intended as a remedy for the situation.

WHAT U.N. OIL-FOR-FOOD RESOLUTION AUTHORIZES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Security Council Resolution 986
</P>
<P>
   _The resolution authorizes the sale of $5.2 billion (U.S.) worth
of Iraq oil for each six-month period. Every oil contract must be
approved by the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   _All proceeds from the sale of oil go directly into a
U.N.-controlled escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   _Thirty percent of the proceeds is transferred to a war
reparations compensation fund. Costs for other U.N. operations in
Iraq are also deducted from the escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   _All contracts for humanitarian supplies for Iraq are paid from
the escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   _The export of oil is monitored by independent inspection agents
at two exit points: the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline (to Turkey) and
the Mina al-Bakr terminal (in the Persian Gulf). These inspectors
directly inform the sanctions committee about the export of all
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   _The aim of the resolution is to enable Iraq to import
humanitarian supplies and to guarantee their equitable distribution
throughout its territory.
</P>
<P>
   _The United Nations has said the $5.26 billion limit, from which
about a third is deducted for U.N. expenses and war reparations, is
the minimum amount required to prevent a deterioration in the
health of the population because of U.N. sanctions.

<P>
   Most windows allow cold to pass through the glass in the winter,
and heat in the summer. This can make the home uncomfortable and
drive energy bills up. In an effort to make windows more efficient,
manufacturers have introduced gas- filled tinted-glass windows.
These windows are very efficient, but they are also expensive.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is another way to make windows more
energy-efficient without spending a lot of money. You can apply a
tinted film to the glass. These window films can cut down the
amount of ultraviolet rays that penetrate into the house, and
protect furniture, carpets and drapes from fading.
</P>
<P>
   They can also keep your house cooler in the summer by blocking
the sun's visible rays, thus preventing heat gain. In the winter,
some films can help keep the home warmer by trapping interior heat.
Films can also increase visibility inside and lessen eyestrain by
reducing the harsh glare that comes from strong sunlight.
Transparent films allow more light to enter than either drapes or
shades, so the interior never becomes dark or dreary.
</P>
<P>
   Before installing window film, it is important to understand the
types available so you can select the right one for your needs.
Window films fall into three categories: reflective, nonreflective
and low emission.
</P>
<P>
   Reflective films are the least expensive, at approximately 45
cents a square foot. They are very effective in blocking out the
sun's ultraviolet and hot- visible rays. This can help keep the
house cool in the summer, but in the winter this same barrier will
keep the sun from warming the house. Reflective films can also
restrict outside visibility and give the windows a shiny,
mirrorlike look that many homeowners consider an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   Nonreflective films cost around 55 cents a square foot. They are
not as effective for reflecting heat rays as the less expensive
reflective films, but they are as efficient in blocking ultraviolet
rays and in reducing glare. They offer greater outside visibility
than reflective films.
</P>
<P>
   Low-emission films are superior to either the reflective or
nonreflective films for controlling heat loss in the winter and for
reducing heat gain in the summer. The low-emission films are also
effective for blocking ultraviolet rays, and they offer excellent
outside visibility. But this film is expensive, sometimes costing
as much as a dollar a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Before you purchase film, figure how many windows you want to
cover -- you need film only only the large windows that face the
sun -- then calculate how many square feet of film you will need.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the film is not particularly difficult, but you must
handle it carefully to prevent wrinkles and creases; once the film
wrinkles it becomes unusable. The only tools you will need are a
squeegee, a spray bottle, a steel tape measure, a metal straight
edge, a few lint-free cloths and a utility knife with a generous
supply of sharp blades. The film will quickly dull even the
sharpest blade, and dull blades will tear, not cut the film.
</P>
<P>
   Start by thoroughly washing your windows then drying them with a
lint-free cloth. Remove all dirt and dust, because even minute
specks can keep the film from adhering properly. Next use the knife
and straight edge to cut the film approximately one inch wider than
the window pane. You can trim the film to the exact size when it is
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Spray the window with the wetting solution, which some kits
include as part of the package. With other films you may have to
prepare your own by mixing a half ounce of clear liquid dishwashing
soap in a quart of clean water. Next, separate the film from the
backing paper. Be careful not to wrinkle or crease the film as you
do this. Discard any pieces that wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the film over and spray the adhesive side with the wetting
solution, then lift it into position on the window. Then, spray the
surface of the film with the wetting solution. Use the squeegee to
smooth it and remove any bubbles. Start with a horizontal pass
across the top, then follow with a series of overlapping vertical
passes from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally trim the film to fit within the window frame. Leave a
gap of an eighth to a sixteenth of an inch between the edge of the
film and the window frame. The gap will allow any heat that
collects between the film and the glass to escape. The film may
look cloudy at first, but in a few weeks it will cure and become
clear.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before she flew to Paris this spring, Mary Shane looked for
travel help on the Internet. There, she was told (1) not to pack
such French fashion no-nos as sneakers or blue jeans, (2) that the
budget hotel she was considering was clean and conveniently located
and (3) that the best price available for a round-trip airplane
ticket was $600.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three turned out to be true. ``In Paris, all the
women were wearing black and my hotel was, well, it was clean
enough,'' she said. But Ms. Shane, who is 53 and lives near
Olympia, Wash., found a cheaper fare off line, paying $525 for a
round-trip ticket offered by a Montgomery Ward travel service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shane's experience typifies both the best and the worst
aspects of online travel sites. If you are willing to wade through
dozens of travel sites _ general sites for airline, hotel and car
rental reservations; travel chat rooms, and sites with tourist
information _ you may stumble upon useful information that could
save you time, money and the embarrassment of showing up at the
Eiffel Tower in Nikes. You can even be your own travel agent and
book airline tickets, hotel rooms or rental cars. There is no
guarantee that you will find a better deal on line than you find if
you walked through the door of your local travel agency, but the
simpler your travel needs, the better the chances of finding the
best prices on the Web. If your tastes run to cooking or museum
tours or high-end travel, you are more likely to need a travel
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people who visit online airline sites do so
for research. Only about 30 percent of those people end up buying
at those sites, according to a new study from NPD Online Research,
a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I've always found a cheaper price off line,'' said Ms.
Shane, a retired analyst for the county health department. ``But
since I live in a little town of 3,000 people _ it really is the
sticks _ I couldn't live without the information I get from the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, more and more travelers have been booking
trips on line. Several of the sites with the most traffic reported
record sales in 1999. Over all, online sales last year accounted
for about $3 billion, about 1 percent, of the $300 billion
Americans spent on travel. But that figure is expected to climb by
the end of 2002 to nearly $12.6 billion, about 7.9 percent of what
is expected to be total travel sales then, said Fiona Swerdlow, a
digital commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to potential savings, the Internet also offers a
powerful psychological benefit. At a time when travelers are so
often forced to endure the indignities of canceled flights or lost
luggage or have suspicions that the passenger in the next seat paid
$400 less for the same ticket, the Internet puts part of the
process firmly back under their control. That's perfect for the
information hound who likes to compare a number of permutations of
an air route just to save $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving your own car instead of being in the
passenger's seat,'' said Richard Gritta, a professor of business at
the University of Portland in Oregon who studies the airline
industry. ``The Internet makes you an active participant.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the larger travel sites, like Microsoft Expedia Travel
 &UR; (expedia.msn.com)  &LR; and Travelocity  &UR; (www.travelocity.com) &LR; , work
like this: customers submit itinerary information, like dates and
times of travel and departure and arrival cities. (Many sites,
however, will not give you price information if you have multiple
destinations and want to fly into and out of different cities.)
Then the site spits out a list of airplane itineraries and prices,
or hotel or car information and prices. To buy, customers type in
credit card information, and the purchase is confirmed by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are most likely to see the largest price swings _ and
largest potential savings _ for airline tickets. Most major
carriers encourage online sales because the airlines generally pay
lower commissions to online agents than to off-line travel
agencies. And many online sites have struck deals with specific
carriers to offer special deals.
</P>
<P>
   You can also find big price differences among the various travel
sites because they do not all check flights for the same set of
airlines, even though many sites seem to share databases. For
example, a recent search for a fare for three people to fly from
New York to Rome in midsummer turned up a fare of $3,084 from
Travelocity, $2,802 from Expedia and $2,814 from Skytours
 &UR; (service.skytours.de) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines also offer online reservations for their own
flights at their own Web sites, which can be good places to look
for specials. And travelers concerned about frequent-flier miles
may want to go straight to the Web sites of particular airlines.
But if you go to the general sites, you can get information from
many airlines at once. Air-fare prices can fluctuate from day to
day, largely because airlines use sophisticated yield-management
techniques to track sales and adjust prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger travel sites have added improvements in
recent months that make them easier to navigate. Last month,
Travelocity added a Best Fare Finder feature that allows travelers
to see the cheapest ticket for any given air route. Expedia
recently introduced Mileage Miner, which will keep track of
customers' frequent-travel account balances and point them toward
new mileage offers. And Preview Travel  &UR; (www.previewtravel.com) &LR; 
beefed up its Destination Guides last month, enabling travelers to
read restaurant and hotel reviews for 202 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sheppard, of Nahunta, Ga., was recently able to find a
New York hotel room through Expedia, which strikes deals with
specific hoteliers and also has access to the Pegasus reservations
system, a database that contains the most up-to-date rates for
thousands of hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the hotel I wanted,'' Sheppard said, ``saw the price
was $160 a night, which was much less expensive than the price that
a local travel agency gave me for the same hotel, and booked it.
They sent e-mail to confirm the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   While some sites have streamlined the purchasing process, do not
expect from travel sites the kind of one-click shopping that makes
it so easy to buy, say, books on Amazon.com. ``With travel, one
click is too quick,'' said Suzi Levine, a product manager for
Expedia. ``This is often an expensive purchase, and we want to make
it very clear to customers that here is what they are buying. You
don't want customers to have remorse. We want them to feel like
they're in control.''
</P>
<P>
   But booking on line works best for travelers who want to make
relatively simple arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the technology is ideally suited to someone who
needs a round-trip ticket on a well-traveled air route, who can
say, `I know what I want and what I'm willing to pay,''' said Gadi
Maier, chief executive of the Internet Travel Network
 &UR; (www.itn.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   For travelers like Lisa Myers, a mother of two who has booked
several family trips on Travelocity in the past two years, the
Internet can seem an ideal solution. ``We travel a lot to see our
family, and I'm looking for a good air fare,'' said Ms. Myers, who
lives in Houston. ``I usually have some flexibility on dates, so I
look to see when we can fly the cheapest and then I book it. I
usually do it at night, after the children are asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But planning something more complicated, like a cruise, can
require an expert's advice. You're not very likely to find out how
old the ship is or how nice the staff is just by surfing travel
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about travel today, there are two general
categories,'' said Ms. Swerdlow, the analyst. ``There's complex
travel, which involves lots of questions to be answered, and then
there's fairly simple travel, which might require nothing more than
a point-to-point airline ticket. In the future, you'll see online
sites becoming easier to navigate, but today, the straightforward
type of arrangement is what most people would feel comfortable with
doing on line.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One Chance At a Low Price &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who care only about price and don't mind compromising
on departure times can check Priceline.com, a hybrid travel site
that lets you place a bid. But for each itinerary, a traveler gets
only one chance to bid _ if the first bid is too low, there is no
chance to enter a higher bid and try again.
</P>
<P>
   For a discount air fare, a customer types in bare-bones
itinerary information _ departure and arrival dates and cities _
then enters the price the customer is willing to pay for an airline
ticket or hotel room. A company spokesman said that customers had a
35 percent chance of getting a ticket if they made what he called a
reasonable offer _ an offer that is within 30 percent of a 21-day
advance-purchase price for a particular air route.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com  &UR; (www.priceline.com) &LR;  can offer those discounts
because it negotiates deals with major carriers in advance. ``If
Delta has lots of excess inventory on a given flight, of course,
they want to fill those seats,'' said Fiona Swerdlow, a digital
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``If you know the going
price for a fare, and you would be willing to pay a little less,
maybe your fare will be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part is that the customer must agree to buy the
ticket _ and type in credit card information _ before finding out
whether the flight is available at that price. Also, the customer
must agree ahead of time to fly on any major airline that is
willing to sell a seat and to fly on any flight departing between 6
a.m. and 10 p.m. It's a service aimed at bargain hunters willing to
make a few compromises for price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have told us they are willing to entertain these
low offers as long as they are serious, no-fooling-around offers,
which is why customers have to agree up front to buy the ticket,''
said Brian Ek, a Priceline.com spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline's popularity has grown consistently in the
year since its debut _ in April, the site sold an average of 20,000
airline tickets a week _ the rules can be confusing to
inexperienced travelers. Charles Sheppard, a Pepsi warehouse
manager who lives in Nahunta, Ga., learned that lesson a few months
ago when he was planning a trip to New York with his wife, Julia,
to celebrate their 12th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline got me a $125 round-trip ticket from Jacksonville,
Fla., to New York City, but then when I looked at the details, the
times were terrible,'' Sheppard said. ``We would have to be flying
through the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Sheppard, when he phoned Priceline.com's customer
service department to explain the situation, ``they were very
cooperative and said, `Yes, sir, we'll cancel the order.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they told me not to do it again,'' he added.
</P>
<P>

 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sony unleashed a robotic dog on Tuesday. It has a metallic coat,
flashing green eyes, wobbly knees and a propensity to wag its tail
when you pat its head. Its name is Aibo, which means companion in
Japanese. And for $2,500, it could be yours.
</P>
<P>
   Aibo (pronounced eye-BO) is Sony's answer to the 20th-century
quest for a relatively intelligent robot that gets around on its
own. (Its name is also a quasi-acronym that stands for Artificial
Intelligence Robot.) Over the years some companies have actually
tried to sell what they call robots, like the remote-controlled
Omnibot sold by the Tomy toy manufacturer in the late 1980s. But
none have succeeded in producing a usable robot or capturing the
consumer's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is betting that Aibo will break that cycle, and a few other
companies are taking the same gamble this year. Eureka has been
showcasing a new robot vacuum cleaner at housewares shows. A few
companies are promising to unveil robotic lawn mowers within
months. And a wheeled robot called Cye is starting to generate
interest among robot enthusiasts after appearing last fall in a
Web-based catalog called the Mondo-tronics Robot Store.
</P>
<P>
   Aibo is a different breed from the personal assistants and maid
droids that most science fiction fans envision. It is designed
primarily to be entertaining, and cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost takes on a personality where you think it's real,''
said Tod Freeman, a spokesman for Sony, at a demonstration a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing three and a half pounds, Aibo is a little smaller than
a Yorkshire terrier. It kneels on a recharging cradle when it is
resting. When it is set on a flat surface, its tail perks up. Then
the robopup raises its head, pulls itself upright, stretches and
yawns widely.
</P>
<P>
   Its first steps are intentionally unsteady, like a young puppy
learning to walk. But after a few minutes, Aibo can paw around at
about six yards a minute. It can also recognize the color pink and
slowly chase after a pink plastic ball that comes with an Aibo
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's developers have programmed Aibo to walk around on its own
and express a few emotions, through the wag of its tail or the
flashing of eyes, in response to spoken commands and pats on the
head. Using a remote control, an Aibo owner can command the pup to
move in specific directions.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Sony plans to upgrade Aibo to make it something like
a consumer's best friend. The future Aibo may be trained to respond
to its owner's voice. But even so, Aibo will always have its
limits. It can bark if you download sound files into its body, but
it can't fetch a newspaper. (On the other hand, it doesn't shed,
and you don't have to housebreak it.)
</P>
<P>
   But Aibo isn't really meant to be a pet. It is intended to be
the newest entertainment gadget to consume our downtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like with the Sony Playstation, we want to establish a new
culture, a new environment,'' said Takeshi Yazawa, general manager
for Sony's ``business incubation'' unit in Japan. With Aibo's
motion software, which is sold separately for $450, owners can
teach their dogs new tricks. The programs are transferred to Aibo
using an eight-megabyte Sony memory stick.
</P>
<P>
   (Aibo can be ordered only on line, starting June 1, at
www.world.sony.com/robot. The memory stick, remote control and two
lithium-ion batteries are included.)
</P>
<P>
   Yazawa hopes that gadgeteers with large amounts of disposable
income will jump at the chance to experiment. They could program
their robodogs to walk into their rooms in the morning and start
barking at a scheduled time. Or they could train the little guys to
play soccer, kicking pink balls into color-coded goals.

   To brave the ground floor of any department store is to
experience a confusing duality of inner yearning (for that tub of
sumptuously colored goo or that architecturally masterful perfume
bottle) and a take-no-prisoners defense against a sales force
looking to spray, color test or exfoliate you within an inch of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   But with its Cyber Beauty Advisor, a California-based makeup
company called English Ideas has toned down the hard-charging
counter clerk, infused her with information and put her inside an
interactive touch-screen kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by a high-speed Pentium computer running a CD-ROM, the
English Ideas makeup kiosk was installed at Bloomingdale's in
Manhattan this week, as well as in English Ideas counters at six
Macy's stores on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When you come upon the English Ideas counter in a cramped aisle,
the tall white terminal blares New Age techno music and shows
footage of elegant, made-up faces, inviting you to ``touch to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows are video snippets of Rebecca Pflueger, the English
Ideas president and co-founder, dispensing advice on the causes of
common beauty problems in four different categories _ lips, face,
brows and eyes. In a British-accented tone, Ms. Pflueger then
explains how each problem, like chapped lips or too-thin eyelashes,
can be solved by an English Ideas product.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Cyber Beauty Advisor came to Ms. Pflueger in
January when she and her husband, Russell Pflueger, were looking
for ways to promote their products without having to travel (they
have two small children). ``This was a way to educate people
without having to wander too far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Video kiosks in department stores are nothing new.
Bloomingdale's, for example, is dotted with displays of models
slinking down catwalks.
</P>
<P>
   One nice thing about the Cyber Beauty Advisor, which resembles a
sort of touch screen Web site in its design, is that you can
control her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the segments no longer than 30 seconds to accommodate
people's attention spans, but you can also stop the segment at any
time and go to another one,'' Ms. Pflueger said.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of hearing about why your foundation can get patchy? Just
touch the talking face and Ms. Pflueger freezes in midsentence,
replaced by the previous menu. (Ms. Pflueger added that her husband
enjoys putting his hand across her on-screen mouth to quiet her
down.)
</P>
<P>
   Although it is sometimes hard to hear what the Cyber Beauty
Advisor is saying against the surrounding din, Ms. Pflueger said it
was designed to complement the two sales clerks behind the English
Ideas counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you're not intimidated about going up to a counter,
sometimes the salespeople are helping other customers,'' she said.
``This way, hopefully, you can get the same information and won't
have to wait.'' Better still, the Cyber Beauty Advisor won't spray
you with perfume.

<P>
   Q: I am remodeling my kitchen and will be installing a new sink
in the counter top. I had planned on a self-rimming type of sink
that overlaps or mounts on top of the counter. However, my wife
prefers the type that mounts under the countertop and has no rim or
molding of any kind sitting on top of the counter. She feels this
will make it easier to wipe off the countertop by simply pushing
crumbs, etc. into the sink. How is an under-the-top sink installed,
and is this type more difficult to install?
</P>
<P>
   A: Called an undermount sink, this type is more difficult and
more time-consuming to install (probably several hours as compared
to less than one hour for most self-rimming sinks). The
self-rimming sink merely sits on top of the counter with a layer of
putty under the rim (except for some stainless models that require
a rim). The undermount sink is held in place with a special
clamping ring that is screwed to the underside of the counter as
shown here. However, there is another problem to consider: an
undermount sink is only possible when installed on solid countertop
material (granite, Corian or similar material) because the edge of
the counter material will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have to repair some wooden chairs that have rungs which fit
into holes in the side of each leg. These rungs have worked loose
in a couple of places and I want to re-glue these loose joints.
What is the best way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A. The job can only be done properly by literally taking the
chair apart and pulling the end of each rung out of the hole. You
can then scrape all old glue off the end of the rung and from
inside the hole. Coat the rung end with fresh glue, then reassemble
each joint and clamp by wrapping a long strap or rope around the
chair legs. If taking the chair apart is impractical or too
difficult, you can try pulling the end of each rung out as far as
it will go, then use a small knife to scrape glue off the end of
that rung. Spread carpenter's glue on the rung and inside the hole,
then force the joint closed and apply pressure by wrapping as
described above.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house has windows with double-pane glass and there are
metal or plastic strips inside _ between the two panes of glass _
that divide the large panes to make them look like smaller ones.
Unfortunately, these strips seem to be falling apart. Can we fix
these windows without having to replace them?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible that the glass panes can be taken apart and the
strips replaced, but this will depend on how the window was made or
assembled. In any case, this is usually not a job for the
do-it-yourselfer. It calls for the services of a professional
glazier. I suggest you contact the manufacturer of that window, or
check with several local glass dealers in your community to see if
any are equipped to handle this kind of job.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have fiberglass shingles on our roof that are still in
pretty good condition. However, I have never been happy with the
color. Is there any way to change the color without having to
replace the shingles?
</P>
<P>
   A. The only way to change the color of the shingles is to paint
them. There are special paints sold for this purpose, but they come
in only a limited number of colors and not all dealers carry them.
You can also paint the shingles with a good quality latex house
paint, but like any paint, this will have to be renewed every few
years, depending on the weather and the exposure.

YMCA IS HOME FOR 32 YEARS  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM LOWE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Frank Mazza remembers the day he moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorial Day, 1967,'' he said. ``I came down Van Buren, turned
north and walked past the YMCA. Then I turned around, went inside
the Y and got a room. Cost me a couple of bucks a day, 10 bucks a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   So he stayed.
</P>
<P>
   And stayed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's still there.
</P>
<P>
   The rates have gone up more than 800 percent and his room number
has changed at least five times, but the YMCA in downtown Phoenix
has been his mailing address for almost 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sleeping room,'' he said, then volunteered to
conduct a guided tour. ``Small, but it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley of the Sun YMCA has 139 rental units in the
seven-story facility. Four floors are reserved for men, one floor
for women. They're usually filled. It's one of the few Ys still in
the lodging business. Nationwide, according to a spokesperson in
Chicago, only about 120 Ys are available for sleepovers, a drastic
reduction from a half-century ago when YMCA rooms were primary
targets for tourists and men in transition who needed low-cost
rooms. There are more than 3,000 YMCAs in the United States, the
spokesperson said, and new facilities are going up every year. But
none of them focuses on rooms for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the others, Mazza's room is small. Very small. Mazza
estimates it's maybe 12 feet by 18 feet. It looks smaller but it's
too crowded to pace it off. There's barely enough space for a bed,
easy chair, desk, chest of drawers and Frank Mazza. One door leads
to a tiny closet, the other door opens into the hallway. The
bathroom's down the hall to the right. His 17-inch color television
sits on the dresser and his radio and electric razor perch on a
window sill.
</P>
<P>
   Because his is a corner room, he has two windows. One looks
north at the Westward Ho, which was a pretty fancy hotel when Mazza
got here. Now it's a retirement community. Looking east from the
other window, he can see much of downtown Phoenix. Most of the
buildings in his line of vision weren't there when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Mazza was born near Pittsburgh in 1917 and spent most of his
life in the area, working as a spectograph operator in metal and
chemical plants. He served in the armed forces during World War II
and spent time in the South Pacific with a hospital unit on the
front lines. After moving to the Valley of the Sun, he worked for
Goodyear Aerospace until retiring in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't do anything,'' he said with a chuckle. ``That's
what I'm supposed to do. I'm retired.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days reading and watching television, mostly news,
weather and sports. He follows the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball
team ``because it's a local team and the only one I can watch. But
I'm still a Pirates fan.''
</P>
<P>
   And his eyes sparkled when he remembered ``that home run.''
Mazza was in the stands at Forbes Field on Oct. 13, 1960, when Bill
Mazeroski's ninth-inning home run gave the Pirates a 10-9 victory
over the New York Yankees in the seventh game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never let anything get me real excited,'' he remembered,
``but that got me as excited as I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been to a Diamondbacks game yet, even though Bank One
Ballpark is less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to get to a game this year,'' he said. ``When they
play the Pirates.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to spend a lot of time walking around downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was more alert, I'd walk every day,'' he said.
``But now, it doesn't interest me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Phoenix was a nice place when he got here, Mazza
reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crowded. There were lots of shops and a restaurant on
every block, but they all moved out. Now it's mostly big office
buildings. And it's all modernized.''
</P>
<P>
   When the urge to move about strikes him now, Mazza drives there
in his 1996 Chevrolet Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the golf course,'' he said. ``Used to play quite a bit
but the old back went out. Played pretty well, sometimes in the
70s. Shot 72 once. But now I just putt.''
</P>
<P>
   His room is too small to allow formal dining or pizza parties,
so Mazza dines regularly in the Y's cafeteria. He also spends a lot
of time in the lounge, socializing and watching television on a set
with a larger screen. But although he's never at a loss for
companionship, he still gets lonely. Once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, sometimes I wish I'd got married,'' he said. ``I had
a girl back home. A couple of them. But I didn't have money or
anything to offer them, and I didn't want to start empty.''
</P>
<P>
   His only relatives are a cousin in Phoenix and a niece in the
Pittsburgh area. But he has the Y for company.
</P>
<P>
   Most YMCA tenants stay for only two or three weeks, on an
average. Frank Mazza exceeded that figure in June 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no plans to move. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - NATO forces are waging what looks a lot like war in
the Balkans. Yet a lot of people _ even nations _ still act
surprised at the consequences of unloading 15,000 bombs and
missiles on Yugoslavia. The erroneous bombing over the weekend of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was tragic, but nobody should be
shocked that such errors occur _ and will continue to occur.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton apologized to Chinese President Jiang Zemin
for the mistake, which killed three and wounded 20. But China is
having none of it. It used the mistake to fan anti-NATO protests in
Beijing and suggest that the bombing was premeditated.
Nationalistic cries of ``American imperialism'' rang again in the
streets of Beijing. China took advantage of the bombing to divert
attention from the upcoming 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
massacre and growing restiveness in the United States over the
Chinese theft of U.S. military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing also has had consequences for the United States and
NATO. It has set back efforts to involve Russia and China in
diplomatic efforts to end this crisis. China accused NATO of
pursuing ``absolute gunboat policy'' and has warned that, as long
as the bombings continue, there can be no U.N. solution to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   China is worried that, after the Balkans, NATO and the United
States will seek to intervene in any other countries where human
rights abuses are an issue. Today, Kosovo. Tomorrow, China? Hardly.
Given the lack of success NATO is having in the Balkans, it's
doubtful that next time around NATO could muster the will to mount
a naval blockade in a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese Embassy is being blamed on faulty
information from the CIA. Such information is supposed to be
checked and rechecked to avoid possible risks to civilians. The
Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency
nearby (which was the intended target) were of a similar size and
shape.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese Embassy is regrettable. But, whether
anyone wants to use the word or not, this is war. Buildings get
blown up, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. Sometimes the
wrong buildings get blown up intentionally, as was the case with
the Chinese Embassy. The United States can certainly do a better
job of targeting, but even the world's most technologically
advanced nation can't be expected to wage a war so efficient and
sanitized that only the bad guys get killed and everyone else
escapes collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces have little choice but to continue the bombing while
stepping up efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this mess. The
embassy bombing has set back U.S. relations with China, but the
United States has rightly sought to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, China should tone down the rhetoric and
acknowledge what was clearly an error. China needs the United
States as a trade partner. Cynics might suggest that it's also in
China's military interest to maintain ties with the United States.
After all, there are still a few more U.S. military secrets left
for China to steal. &QL;

LEXUS' DUELING PERSONALITIES  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, MAY 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Lexus LS 400 and GS 400:
</P>
<P>
   Both are built by the same luxury-car division of Toyota Motors.
Both are expensive, have four doors and are powered by nearly
identical V-8 engines. Yet they are as different as Abbott and
Costello.
</P>
<P>
   The LS 400 is Lexus' bread-and-butter luxury sedan, its flagship
and traditional standard bearer. Comfortable, prestigious, laden
with features, the LS is a boulevard cruiser designed for the best
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The LS 400 is where Lexus first made its mark, showing the world
that a Japanese automaker could compete head-on with the high-end
luxury marques of Europe and the United States. It's a big,
competent sedan that does everything with poise and precision, but
which often is faulted for lacking spirit, flair or personality.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the GS 400 comes in. The GS is agile, athletic and
as fast as a '60s muscle car. The GS is firm where the LS is soft.
The GS is hyper where the LS is sedate. The GS' handling is taut
and its steering is responsive, where the LS rolls with the punches
and steers with the lightest touch.
</P>
<P>
   The LS gently coddles its passengers, riding like a cloud over
the bumps and heaves, isolating driver and passengers from the
rough edges of the outside world. The GS is firm, allowing some
jostling of the human cargo but still keeping harshness at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the LS is the kind of car that makes me yawn. Its
styling and behavior shout ``I'm lush and expensive,'' but not much
else. Sure, I can appreciate the easy-chair comfort and the
fabulous stereo, but I don't relish the limousine ride.
</P>
<P>
   The GS, on the other hand, has the kind of performance edge that
keeps me interested. I never could own a car like this, though.
It's just too quick, too easy to roar past the speed limit without
a glance back, at least until you see those blinking red lights
coming up in the rear view.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a GS 300, powered by a 225-horsepower V-6, which
should perform most tasks as enjoyably as the V-8 model, only
without the strong acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The GS 400 works well as a performance sedan, along the lines of
BMW 540i, Mercedes-Benz C43 or even Cadillac Seville STS. It's a
car built to inspire, especially on winding desert blacktop where
one can sample the precise suspension and balance of this
rear-wheel-drive car, and enjoy the opportunity to make the engine
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Just be careful not to overdo it. The acceleration is
intoxicating, smooth as silk and so easy to push to the limit. The
engine roar is heavily muffled, the urgent sound audible from the
driver's seat, but not howling for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a toy for grown-ups, not kids.
</P>
<P>
   Still, part of the complaint about the LS carries over to the
GS. The feeling of strength, precision and excellent engineering is
evident throughout the car. But somehow it fails to impart much of
a visceral impression. It's a great machine, but it failed to touch
me on an emotional level.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's pretty subjective stuff, and maybe the problem is
mine and not the automobile's. It's just that some cars make you
feel like a partner, even a pal, sharing their abilities and making
them your own.
</P>
<P>
   The GS always seems to be trying to impress, which it does.
Matter of fact, this felt like one of the quickest cars I've ever
driven, whatever the numbers say. What they do say is the
300-horsepower V-8 and five-speed automatic will pull the trim
sedan from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds. That's pretty fast in
anyone's book.
</P>
<P>
   The LS is no slouch in the acceleration department, sprinting to
60 in about 6.6 seconds, Lexus says, the slightly greater weight
and slightly lesser horsepower slowing things up just a bit,
compared with GS. Indeed, the Lexus literature touts the
performance abilities of the LS, noting that it is a car of ``dual
personalities,'' luxurious and sporting.
</P>
<P>
   I found it heavily weighted on the luxury side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The test-car GS came with buttons on the steering wheel for
manual shifting, if desired, which I found useful when downshifting
into and powering out of a curve. The Lexus system also is more
helpful and easier to use than the push-button shifting systems
offered on other sporting cars. Still, it's kind of a gimmick, and
most drivers rarely would use the feature, if ever, once the
novelty wears off.
</P>
<P>
   The LS 400 was equipped with a GPS positioning system, with a
video display showing maps and directions. It worked well, but as
part of a $5,400 package of GPS, CD disc changer and power
moonroof, it seems overly expensive. In the GS, a CD changer and
moonroof were just over $2,000 extra.
</P>
<P>
   The GS styling looks trim and muscular, tucked in around the
edges to make the midsize sedan look smaller than it really is. The
2-year-old body style is distinctive and instantly recognizable,
though in some ways it looks almost like a variation on the current
Mercedes E-class. The LS obviously takes some of its overall
styling cues from the Benz design book.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the GS is fairly spacious, with lots of room behind the
wheel for tall drivers and enough room in the back seat for tall
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The LS feels even more roomy and accommodating, designed with
lots of wood and leather. The dashboard looks European, rather like
an Audi's or even a Jaguar's, with controls and gauges that are
well-designed and logically arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the GS, though its interior seems more distinctive and
less derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, both of these pricey sedans come equipped with a full
boatload of accessories, convenience equipment and safety features.
A standard Vehicle Control System makes use of the anti-lock
braking and traction control to help you keep things under control.
</P>
<P>
   Though the GS is just 2 years old, I'm confident that it will
enjoy the same sort of dependability of all Lexus products. That's
part of the draw for these high-end cars, whichever side of the
coin you choose, the indisputable fact that they are well-made and
extremely reliable. &QL;

<P>
   Computer and consumer electronics manufacturers invest
considerable time and money exploring design ideas, trying to hit
on the next Palm Pilot, IBM Thinkpad or Motorola Startac cellular
phone.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of years, a corps of engineers and
industrial designers at the International Business Machines Corp.,
known for its blue-sky designs, has been sketching out the concept
cars of the computer world: a tiny personal computer with a
full-screen display, a versatile household computer that adapts to
any environment, the cyberphone and a dress watch that doubles as
an electronic organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Research into futuristic projects is happening in other places
as well, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media
Laboratory and Microsoft, but IBM is particularly well positioned
for such projects. Its eight research centers, scattered around the
world, delve into many things, like advanced circuit design and
projection display technology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John P. Karidis organized the designers into ``virtual
teams.'' Although the Personal Systems Group, where Karidis is a
Distinguished Engineer, is overseeing the projects, Karidis has
drawn on engineering talent from a variety of IBM groups in
Raleigh, N.C.; Tokyo; Almaden, Calif., and Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile product idea to emerge so far is the
so-called wearable PC, a Walkman-style device designed by an IBM
team in Japan. Also referred to internally as the visionpad, the
device is a fully functioning PC, with a headpiece that contains a
virtual display as well as a speaker and a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't want to give up any of the applications
they've got on their PC today,'' said Phil Hester, chief technology
officer of the Personal Systems Group at IBM. ``PDAs and
subnotebooks all require you to give something up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a notebook, what really determines its size
is display and keyboard. So we said, `Let's assume we can fix the
display and keyboard problem. How small and how mobile can you make
a PC without giving up any functionality?'''
</P>
<P>
   The visionpad has all the functions of an IBM Thinkpad 560E
laptop, including a chip that runs at 233 megahertz. The
translucent device, which clips onto a belt, is roughly as thick as
a deck of playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most radical departure from the computing norm is
the device's head-mounted display: a flexible headband with a
rectangular display that sits an inch or two in front of the user's
eye _ somewhat similar to the way a mirror is mounted on a bicycle
helmet. Innovative optical technology makes a 26-inch display
appear to be about six feet away. ``The image appears to float in
front of your face,'' Karidis explained, adding that the distance
is adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   For input, the visionpad depends largely on voice recognition
through a headset; in addition, a small pointing device is wired to
the belt pack. A regular keyboard can also be attached to the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Another device, but one early in development, is the cyberphone,
IBM's answer to the latest rage in mobile devices. The cyberphone,
designed by engineers in Yorktown Heights, looks much like an
ordinary cellular phone, but a tiny high-resolution image of a Web
page can be bounced off a mirror, found inside the phone's flip
cover, to generate a virtual screen image in front of the user.
</P>
<P>
   Like the visionpad, the phone uses a reflective surface to
create an image that appears to the eye to be a full-size display
at a normal reading distance. That is possible because of the
special shape of the mirror. The pointing device for the screen is
a thumb-operated track point on the side of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the cyberphone, Hester said, is to combine
regular phone functions with simultaneous access to information.
``It goes back to a human factors discussion,'' he said. ``How does
someone hold a cell phone? What is natural for you to do? To glance
down. The whole premise is that you want to be able to deliver
visual information at the same time that you're talking on the
phone in a way that's very natural.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A third project, which IBM has nicknamed the chameleon, crosses
a notebook computer with a desktop computer. The distinguishing
features of the device, which will be slightly larger and weigh
slightly more than a notebook computer, are its A-frame structure,
a touch screen and a wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Hester says the chameleon will transform itself into something
different depending on where it is in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the name. On a kitchen counter, for example, the screen
slides forward to hide the keyboard so it looks less like a
computer and more like an appliance, or television. When the
keyboard is needed, it can be pulled out like a drawer.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in her 30s, a frequent computer user who was a market
research subject for the chameleon, said she wanted to keep a
computer on her dining-room table but put it away when she had
dinner guests. The Chameleon is ``for people who need their
computer to be portable sometimes, but they don't need a
notebook,'' Karidis said. The chameleon, he said, will cost more
than a desktop computer but less than a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Another project, which Karidis discussed in a recent speech, is
the development of a dress watch with a very high-resolution
display that doubles as a personal organizer. ``It turns out that
if you have very high contrast and brightness, most people don't
have trouble reading very small type,'' Karidis said. The goal, he
said, is to avoid the nerdy appearance of most digital watches.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four devices, the visionpad is closest to becoming an
actual product. The company plans to build 150 of them later this
year and test them with a handful of customers who have a need for
hands-free computing, like aircraft maintenance workers or law
enforcement officers. Depending on how the field tests go, the
product could be on the market in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The chameleon is still in the early prototype phase, and the
cyberphone and the watch are at the concept and design stage. The
watch and the cyberphone ``both depend on the display technologies
and ultra-low-power processing, which are just starting to become
available,'' Karidis said.
</P>
<P>
   Hester agreed, especially when it came to the watch. ``Display
technology is headed there in three years,'' he said. ``But it's
beyond the state of the art in terms of producing working models.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether there's a market for these devices is another matter.
``We're trying to push the envelope of what technology and design
can offer,'' Karidis said. ``But when you're exploring the edges of
what's possible, naturally we'll come up with lots of ideas which
the market may not be ready for. Just because you can build it
doesn't mean people want it or will buy it. When you ask people
what they want, they don't always know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shipley, publisher of Demoletter, an industry newsletter,
has seen the IBM designs and agrees that market acceptance is
difficult to gauge. ``I don't know how comfortable people will be
flipping up a monitor in front of their face,'' she said, referring
to the visionpad.
</P>
<P>
   Hester said IBM did not plan to manufacture all the devices
itself, especially the phone and the watch. The company will seek
suitable partners that specialize in such products, he said. Ms.
Shipley agreed that such a strategy made sense. ``I'm not sure IBM
is ready to design jewelry,'' she said.

YMCA IS HOME FOR 32 YEARS  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM LOWE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Frank Mazza remembers the day he moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorial Day, 1967,'' he said. ``I came down Van Buren, turned
north and walked past the YMCA. Then I turned around, went inside
the Y and got a room. Cost me a couple of bucks a day, 10 bucks a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   So he stayed.
</P>
<P>
   And stayed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's still there.
</P>
<P>
   The rates have gone up more than 800 percent and his room number
has changed at least five times, but the YMCA in downtown Phoenix
has been his mailing address for almost 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sleeping room,'' he said, then volunteered to
conduct a guided tour. ``Small, but it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley of the Sun YMCA has 139 rental units in the
seven-story facility. Four floors are reserved for men, one floor
for women. They're usually filled. It's one of the few Ys still in
the lodging business. Nationwide, according to a spokesperson in
Chicago, only about 120 Ys are available for sleepovers, a drastic
reduction from a half-century ago when YMCA rooms were primary
targets for tourists and men in transition who needed low-cost
rooms. There are more than 3,000 YMCAs in the United States, the
spokesperson said, and new facilities are going up every year. But
none of them focuses on rooms for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the others, Mazza's room is small. Very small. Mazza
estimates it's maybe 12 feet by 18 feet. It looks smaller but it's
too crowded to pace it off. There's barely enough space for a bed,
easy chair, desk, chest of drawers and Frank Mazza. One door leads
to a tiny closet, the other door opens into the hallway. The
bathroom's down the hall to the right. His 17-inch color television
sits on the dresser and his radio and electric razor perch on a
window sill.
</P>
<P>
   Because his is a corner room, he has two windows. One looks
north at the Westward Ho, which was a pretty fancy hotel when Mazza
got here. Now it's a retirement community. Looking east from the
other window, he can see much of downtown Phoenix. Most of the
buildings in his line of vision weren't there when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Mazza was born near Pittsburgh in 1917 and spent most of his
life in the area, working as a spectograph operator in metal and
chemical plants. He served in the armed forces during World War II
and spent time in the South Pacific with a hospital unit on the
front lines. After moving to the Valley of the Sun, he worked for
Goodyear Aerospace until retiring in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't do anything,'' he said with a chuckle. ``That's
what I'm supposed to do. I'm retired.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days reading and watching television, mostly news,
weather and sports. He follows the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball
team ``because it's a local team and the only one I can watch. But
I'm still a Pirates fan.''
</P>
<P>
   And his eyes sparkled when he remembered ``that home run.''
Mazza was in the stands at Forbes Field on Oct. 13, 1960, when Bill
Mazeroski's ninth-inning home run gave the Pirates a 10-9 victory
over the New York Yankees in the seventh game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never let anything get me real excited,'' he remembered,
``but that got me as excited as I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been to a Diamondbacks game yet, even though Bank One
Ballpark is less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to get to a game this year,'' he said. ``When they
play the Pirates.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to spend a lot of time walking around downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was more alert, I'd walk every day,'' he said.
``But now, it doesn't interest me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Phoenix was a nice place when he got here, Mazza
reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crowded. There were lots of shops and a restaurant on
every block, but they all moved out. Now it's mostly big office
buildings. And it's all modernized.''
</P>
<P>
   When the urge to move about strikes him now, Mazza drives there
in his 1996 Chevrolet Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the golf course,'' he said. ``Used to play quite a bit
but the oldback went out. Played pretty well, sometimes in the
70s. Shot 72 once. But now I just putt.''
</P>
<P>
   His room is too small to allow formal dining or pizza parties,
so Mazza dines regularly in the Y's cafeteria. He also spends a lot
of time in the lounge, socializing and watching television on a set
with a larger screen. But although he's never at a loss for
companionship, he still gets lonely. Once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, sometimes I wish I'd got married,'' he said. ``I had
a girl back home. A couple of them. But I didn't have money or
anything to offer them, and I didn't want to start empty.''
</P>
<P>
   His only relatives are a cousin in Phoenix and a niece in the
Pittsburgh area. But he has the Y for company.
</P>
<P>
   Most YMCA tenants stay for only two or three weeks, on an
average. Frank Mazza exceeded that figure in June 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no plans to move. &QL;

   PHOENIX - I loved that sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   It's ridiculous to say, but I did. Sometimes, when I was
watering my yard, I'd look at the concrete square that was stamped
``Pacific Construction, 1930'' and envision the people who built my
house as they pushed a baby stroller over that spot, as their kids
rode a bike, or as someone stood there and cheered when World War
II ended.
</P>
<P>
   So you can understand how upset I was when I heard a jackhammer
in my front yard and saw the sidewalk buckle and split as if the
Earth was having one big, frenetic seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!'' I yelled as I marched out into the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``NO HABLO INGLES!'' (end ital) the jackhammer guy
yelled as panic raced over his face.
</P>
<P>
   When I took a step closer, he dropped the jackhammer and ran
across the street to his foreman, who was real busy looking at his
nostrils in the rearview mirror from the front seat of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a problem, lady?'' the foreman said as he walked
toward me, in a stride so brazen I briefly thought that either John
Gotti or Sammy the Bull had become a working stiff in the federal
witness-protection program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're chopping up my antique sidewalk,'' I said, being as
brave as I could without being drunk. ``It was made in 1930. Says
so right here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no. This is not your sidewalk. Your yard is yours,''
he said with one hand on his hip and the other waving in my face.
``But the sidewalk is the property of the city of Phoenix, and they
contracted us to make improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvements?'' I said, suddenly remembering that all
Liquored-Up Laurie's courage usually got me was a photo of myself
with my eyes half-closed posted next to the doorway of the bar with
the words, ``Trouble: Drunk, Mean, Angry Writer'' under it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' I continued. ``Are you going to cover it in
stucco, paint it pink and slap a tile roof on it? That's how the
city of Phoenix `improves' things!''
</P>
<P>
   I was dealing with an evil entity here that the Pope couldn't
handle, even with a cameo appearance by the Holy Ghost, or even
Selena.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it's only a sidewalk, but it's always easier for the
city of Phoenix to knock something down than it is to fix it. This
is the place where progress includes demolishing hundreds of
historic homes and building a freeway or a 70,000-seat hot dog
concession stand instead. So why would I think that the city of
Phoenix would have mercy on my little sidewalk?
</P>
<P>
   There was no mercy to be had, evidenced in the chunks of a
concrete puzzle now lying where the sidewalk used to be, in the
street and in my front yard.
</P>
<P>
   In my front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor was staring at me, waiting for me to shut up and
go back into my little old house.
</P>
<P>
   But you know me better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' I said, walking over to the pile of concrete in my yard.
``If this is my yard, and my yard is my property, then I guess this
concrete (begin tial in my yard (end ital) is my property, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The contractor just kept staring at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that makes this mine,'' I said as I picked up the chunk
stamped ``Pacific Construction, 1930'' from the street and threw it
onto my grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this mine,'' as I threw another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And THIS mine,'' as I threw another one and felt the herniated
disk in my back pop so far out of alignment that it nearly broke
the skin and sliced me in half with a big lightening bolt of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' the contractor said, still staring at me, ``it's just
a sidewalk!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah?'' I said as I hobbled back into my yard. ``For 70 years,
people have been pushing strollers on this sidewalk. Kids learned
to ride their bikes on this sidewalk. Little girls played hopscotch
on this sidewalk, writing the numbers with chalk in their tiny
little 1930s hands! Do you know how small hands were in the 1930s?
Very small.''
</P>
<P>
   I hobbled a foot closer to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how do you know,'' I said, my voice rising almost to a
yell, ``that when World War II ended, someone didn't stand right
here and understand the real meaning of what it meant to be free?
Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or that someone was on this sidewalk when they heard President
Kennedy was shot and tears of anguish and sorrow ran down their
face and splashed on the concrete!
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know that when Neil Armstrong took his first step
on the moon, a father didn't bring his son out here to point up at
the sky and say, `That's our country up there, Jimmy, THOSE ARE OUR
BOYS!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The contractor was silent for a moment, and looked over to the
pile of cement chunks that now belonged to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in drama, lady?'' he said. ``Or am I on `Candid
Camera' ?''
</P>
<P>
   I ignored him as I traveled, apelike, into my little old house.
I had bigger problems to solve, like explaining to my husband why
it looked like NATO had dropped a bomb in my front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like something BIG is building a nest out there!'' I
thought about saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey! A meteor almost hit the house!'' I contemplated crying.
``But it's OK because I lived! I'm alive!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't believe it,'' I decided to say, ``but I was watering
the front yard when, all of a sudden, this midget version of
Stonehenge unearthed itself! Do you think it's possible that we
live on Druid sacred ground?''
</P>
<P>
   But when he opened the front door, my husband just held up his
hand when I began to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kravitz,'' he said, taking a deep breath, ``the next time
you see . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the hose . . .'' I started to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . any kind of workmen, guys in uniform, people with tools,
anyone in a backhoe . . .'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . the ground shook, the sky got dark . . .'' I tried to
describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . repaving the street, fixing a street sign and,
especially _ and I mean ESPECIALLY _ messing with the sewer . . .''
he went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I heard chanting . . .'' I wanted to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE, OR TO GIVE THE WORLD WAR II
SPEECH TO ANY OF THEM!'' he concluded. ``Now, how bad does your
back hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know,'' I answered, pointing to the butterfly
bandage that was keeping my spine in one piece, ``it was just a
sidewalk. &QL;

Federal Communications Commission is expected to take action
Thursday with its effort to make cable boxes more widely available
to consumers. In 1996, the Telecommunications Act required that

EVERLYS IN HARMONY AGAIN, AT LEAST ON CONCERT STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There are harmony groups. Then, there are the Everly
Brothers, who basically exist on a celestial plane above everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The shimmering blend of voices between Don Everly and his
younger brother Phil created some of the most lasting songs in
rock-and-roll history. That's one reason why the Beatles, the Beach
Boys and Simon &AMP; Garfunkel all cited the duo as an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Few records have captured the essence of teenage yearning better
than ``All I Have to Do Is Dream.'' There was the forceful ``When
Will I Be Loved,'' the compelling ``Cathy's Clown'' and the
emotionally raw ``Bye Bye Love.'' These weren't just hit records;
they were 2{-minute mini-masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something seems a trifle odd imagining 62-year-old Don
and 60-year-old Phil singing about the ache of first love. But the
eldest Everly says that the captivating combination of voices is
still there when the two perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're singing as good as ever _ maybe better,'' Don
says, driving around his adopted hometown of Nashville. ``Believe
me, before we go onstage I wonder why we're doing this. Then, when
we're out there, I'm like, `Yeah, this is what it's about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the duo reunited in 1983 for a pair of London concerts
after a 10-year separation, the voices sounded intact. The mammoth
success of those shows led to a series of international tours and a
recording deal with PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   Three albums were issued between 1984 and 1989, each attracting
critical raves but less-than-spectacular sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I would love to be back in the studio, but I
don't see any recording for us in the future,'' Don admits. ``Phil
has his life out in Los Angeles, I'm here _ I just don't see it
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo's classic sound in the '50s and '60s combined elements
of rock and roll, rich Kentucky harmonies and a pure hillbilly
twang. The Everlys regularly crossed over to the country and R&AMP;B
charts in their heyday. The duo's '80s output even produced some
country hits (``On the Wings of a Nightingale,'' ``Born
Yesterday''), but Don doesn't think that the format now would
welcome the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a mix of rock and roll and country,'' he says.
``But honestly, I don't know whether there's a market for us in
country music. There's no point in doing it if no one is going to
buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they spend a few months on the road each year. And with
their amazing legacy, they can sit back and let the rewards roll
in. Box sets and greatest-hits collections are constantly
appearing. They were among the first inductees when the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame was formed in 1986. In '97, they received a
long-overdue Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. A musical based on
the pair's life premiered in Nashville last year.
</P>
<P>
   And although the two patched up the personal differences that
sparked the initial breakup, they don't sound particularly chummy
today. Don says they don't see each other when they're not touring.
They even travel in separate buses. It's hard to imagine that two
men who sing so closely and so beautifully live such separate
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's good now,'' Don says. ``I think we sing closer
than we ever did, but now we have our own lives. Really, it's just
easier this way.'' &QL;

PRESERVING MOTHER GOOSE ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When some parents and teachers bewail a loss of cultural
heritage, they're not talking about knowing when the Civil War was
or being able to pick Andrew Jackson out of a line-up.
</P>
<P>
   It's the undercurrent of sadness _ or panic _ that sets in when
children ask, ``Jack and Jill Who?'' or ``Was Georgie Porgie a rock
star?''
</P>
<P>
   A selection of posted Internet comments about the fading of
Mother Goose blamed such culprits as illiteracy, fewer grandparents
at home, the decline of storytelling, too much television and
extreme political correctness. (Hey, would you like someone to cut
off  &UR; your &LR;  tail with a carving knife?)
</P>
<P>
   That page is one of the links from the year-old Web site of the
Mother Goose Society
 &UR; (www.gbalc.org/MotherGooseSociety/index.html) &LR; , which celebrates
rhymes that never needed any extra help in previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created by a Pennsylvania author, Gloria T.
Delamar, with help from a California Web page designer, Stephanie
Stokes. Mrs. Delamar, a former kindergarten teacher, said in a
telephone interview that she created the society, and then the
page, to promote sales of her book ``Mother Goose: From Nursery to
Literature'' (McFarland &AMP; Co., 1987). Along the way, she said, she
declared May 1 as Mother Goose Day (``It's my birthday,'' she
explained) and got it listed in some published calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Her book went out of print last summer. But the Web site lives
on, with the Greater Bay Area Library Council as its host. ``We
just keep adding to it,'' Mrs. Delamar said.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes a good deal of how-to information: recipes,
finger puppets, counting-out games and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Delamar debunks a few well-known tales of nursery-rhyme
origins. The so-called original Mother Goose who is buried in
Boston is fanciful, she says. Correcting another common belief, she
writes that ``Ring Around the Rosy'' was not an allusion to the
plague. ``Little Miss Muffet'' may refer to the daughter of Dr.
John Muffet, an Elizabethan entomologist. But even that is shaky,
since the first known printed version of the rhyme, using a
different name, did not appear until 1805.
</P>
<P>
   A short but very interesting Mother Goose site on the Web
originates in Japan. The English-language site, called the ``Mother
Goose Library''
( &UR; www.sun-inet.or.jp/syasui/MotherGooseLibrary.html &LR; , introduces
the rhymes to Japanese students, explains the author's interest and
invites viewers to e-mail an application to join the host club, the
Mother Goose Society in Japan. Unlike Mrs. Delamar's Mother Goose
Society, which exists only on the Web, the 10-year-old Japanese
club issues a monthly newsletter, holds study groups and has a
national convention every other year.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created by Yasui Sadao, a high-school English
teacher for 20 years, who grew curious about odd expressions that
popped up frequently in English stories and that seemed to make no
sense when he literally translated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I got to know about Mother Goose, the better I felt I
was able to understand English,'' wrote Yasui. ``When I introduced
some of the famous rhymes, like `Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall' or
`Jack and Jill went up a hill,' to my students, they showed keen
interest in the poems, in the illustrations, in the melodies and
the stories in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Yasui has collected more then 500 Mother Goose
books, mainly from English and American publishers. Mother Goose
rhymes, he wrote by e-mail, were first translated into Japanese in
1921 by a poet, Hakushu Kitahara. Later translations have been a
big hit, and a scholar, Keiichi Hirano, has written several books
on Mother Goose.
</P>
<P>
   Society members exchange information about research on Mother
Goose or ideas about how to teach Mother Goose to children and
students.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of children's culture is a problem in Japan, too. ``We
used to have traditional Japanese nursery rhymes but they are
`endangered species' these days,'' Yasui wrote. ``Children rarely
sing or play with them. They do TV games or computer games now!
Poor things!''

AFFLUENT AREA VOTES TO ALLOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT REYES STATION, Calif. _ In a jaw-dropping display of
citizen interest in an issue that has roiled the community for
almost a year, the residents of this upscale area north of the San
Francisco approved a plan to build lower-priced homes and
apartments for working people.
</P>
<P>
   Residents joined workers who commute to western Marin County in
recommending, by a vote of 773 to 310, that a San Rafael developer
press ahead with its plan to build 44 units of affordable housing
in a 19.6-acre horse pasture in the northeast corner of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participatory democracy at its finest,'' said Lee Giammona, a
long-time Point Reyes Station resident. ``This shows that people
will turn out to vote on an issue that really affects them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest turnout I've ever seen for a local
election,'' said Karol Raynor, a leader of the Marin County League
of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   There are 362 residences in picturesque Point Reyes Station,
population 900. It's a small town and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly newspaper, the Point Reyes Light, has won a Pulitzer
Prize. And its main street is home to some of the best bars (The
Western) and restaurants (Tomales Bay Foods, Station House) in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the special election was whether the need for
housing for the people who work in the area trump the community's
strong environmental values that discourage development.
</P>
<P>
   Rentals here are hard to find, and home prices range from
$270,000 to more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the people who work here can't live here, because
they can't find housing or afford it for what we pay here,'' said
Nancy Dambrowski, an administrator for the Coastal Health Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is the only thing that I have to hang my hope on
for living my life here,'' said Charlie Morgan, a carpenter and
handyman from Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible to vote were men and women, 18 and over, who live or
work in Point Reyes Station, Inverness, Inverness Park, Marshall
and Olema. Election and citizenship laws did not apply to the
special election. The five Northern California communities have
about 4,000 residents among them, with Point Reyes Station being
the area's commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed development has been subjected to a uniquely
fine-grained and painstaking community discussion process,
involving dozens of community meetings that produced multiple
versions of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The developer is EAH, the second largest nonprofit housing
builder in the San Francisco Bay area. EAH plans to build 26 units
that will rent from $500 to $800 a month; 10 cottages that will
cost $200,000 to $280,000; and eight live-work units contained in
two barn-like structures. Five lots will be sold at market rate.
</P>
<P>
   The segments of the project will be grouped into four
neighborhoods around 9 acres of open space.
</P>
<P>
   The rentals will be federally subsidized, and EAH will seek
subsidies for the other housing _ including the $100,000 or so per
lot that the market rate housing should fetch.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the project, who contended the new housing for
Point Reyes Station was too big a bite to swallow at a single gulp,
chose not to speak at a community meeting Tuesday night.

lines, nearly 2,000 visual-effects shots and a universe of
painstakingly detailed characters, sets and costumes whiz past.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, an Oscar nominee for Schindler's List, said he needed to
see the film a few more times ``to just digest it.'' The Phantom
Menace opens next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $120-million movie was screened over the weekend in New York
City for members of the foreign, television, print and radio media.
Attending the Saturday night screening were film stars Samuel L.
Jackson (Mace Windu), Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala), Jake Lloyd
(Anakin Skywalker), Pernilla August (Shmi Skywalker) and Ahmed Best
(Jar Jar Binks), as well as celebrity shock jock Howard Stern
(Jerk).
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were offered as much as $200 for an extra ticket by
fans and paparazzi staking out the Union Square movie theater and
Midtown Manhattan hotel, where interviews were conducted. The
individually numbered screening passes were scanned with
ultraviolet light at one of five security checkpoints for an
invisible watermark to verify authenticity. Under no circumstances
were they to be sold. Anyone secretly videotaping the film was to
be reported to management. ``We wouldn't want to see this film on
the Internet,'' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As the lights went down, the audience cheered the Fox and
Lucasfilm logos, as well as the title card, opening crawl and first
appearances by familiar characters such as R2-D2. The actors loudly
cheered their fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really good,'' Jackson said later. ``It worked. The whole
thing worked.'' The Oscar nominee for Pulp Fiction wasn't aware of
Episode 1's full story until he saw the film for the first time on
Saturday. ``I really hadn't had time to go on the Internet and read
the script,'' he said, laughing. ``So I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas only completed The Phantom Menace six days earlier, on May
1, with the final effects shot of horn-headed villain Darth Maul
(Ray Park) testing an electronic barrier with his double-bladed
lightsaber.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the second screening for Lloyd, a 10-year-old actor
who plays the future Darth Vader as an innocent slave boy who is
strong with the Force. ``You get to catch more of the story (the
second time), because the first time you're just looking at
yourself, seeing how you did,'' said Lloyd, who previously played
Arnold Schwarzenegger's son in Jingle All the Way. ``The second
time you try to get the story and the third time you get the
story.'' Lloyd loved the film.
</P>
<P>
   Critical reaction was less enthusiastic and widely mixed. While
many jaded critics cheered the exciting Podrace and battle
sequences and applauded the end of the film, others found the
biggest movie event of the decade to be a big disappointment. More
than a few naysayers felt that the film lacked romance and was
geared too much to younger children. They also had problems with
the performance of one of the film's digitally rendered characters.
``It took me out of the movie,'' said Rene Rodriguez, film critic
for the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Star Wars films have gotten generally bad reviews,
Lucas said. ``They have mostly been trashed one way or another,
especially in the major media. So I certainly expect not to do well
critically. I never have.'' He expects to do better with The
Phantom Menace than with some of the other films he has directed or
produced, such as Howard the Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the director's chair for the first time since the
original Star Wars 22 years ago, Lucas is pleased with the result _
largely because film technology has finally caught up with his
vision. ``This is the one time I was able to sit down and basically
let my imagination run wild and not be hampered by, `Oh, I can't to
this, I can't do that, I can't go to Coruscant, I'll never be able
to do the buildings, I can't do a Podrace because that's
impossible.' I could sort of dream up whatever I wanted and I was,
for the most part, able to pull it all off.'' Lucas plans to direct
Episodes 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Best, a former Stomp performer who created the movements and
provided the voice for the amphibious Jar Jar, said he was so
jazzed watching the film for the first time earlier last week that
it all went by too fast. ``Also, the first night I was sitting next
to Harrison Ford _ that flipped me out _ and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The original trilogy's Han Solo was on the edge of his seat,
according to Best, who divided his attention between Ford and the
screen. ``So I know I missed something, but that was like, I'm
watching Star Wars: Episode 1 and Han Solo is right there!''
</P>
<P>
   Best thoroughly enjoyed the film and said the same went for
Ford. ``It's like everything Star Wars is supposed to be: Great
action, great story, great effects.'' Echoing his co-stars, Jar
Jar's alter-ego said The Phantom Menace is also extremely
fast-paced. ``As soon as you sit down, it's like, `Take this,' and
everything just sets off.'' Lucasfilm certainly hopes that fans
will go back for second and third helpings of those fries.

   NEW YORK _ Question: How long does it take to put together a
three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the heart of Greenwich
Village, with three working fireplaces and a terrace, overlooking
an Italianate inner garden, and all for a total of $234,000?
Answer: 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who created the space, Diane Shea, 45, is notable not
merely for her perseverance. She also represents a classic New York
tale, in a certain time and place: a personal journey from 1970s
art student to a collaboration with a 1980s art star to a genteel,
familial bohemianism that is typically 1990s. It is equally a story
of homesteading, Manhattan-style, and how, as one woman grew with
the city, she adapted to changing times _ within her neighborhood,
the real-estate market, her apartment and her life.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1974, when Ms. Shea was an art major at the
Parsons School of Design, crashing with three aspiring musicians in
an artist-in-residence loft on West Broadway and Prince streets,
then a quiet, semi-industrial zone. Each paid $85 a month for the
privilege of living in a space in which you took the elevator by
leaping into the shaft and grabbing a rope, Tarzan-style, then
scrambling out again before the car came down and crushed you.
</P>
<P>
   Tiring of the communal life, Ms. Shea decided to get a place of
her own. She found a 250-square-foot studio in a crazy-quilt
structure created from four tenements erected in the 1850s and
combined in the 1920s. The buildings had been joined but not
unified, and the results of this polygamous shotgun marriage were
evident everywhere: hallways and window lines abruptly changed
levels; closet doors opened onto unresolved bits of stairway.
Indeed, there were still two entrances and two addresses, one on
Bleecker Street, the other on West 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Her studio was a box, with a half-kitchen, and front and
bathroom doors that opened directly into the living space. The
wiring ran through the original gas lines, and the entire space
functioned at the whim of a single 15-ampere fuse. Its sole
distinguishing feature was an orange-veined, gray marble fireplace
_ more a necessity than a luxury, as the boiler was often out.
</P>
<P>
   But the studio's three windows looked onto a lush garden and
former stable, which had been converted to a loggia adorned with
found furniture. It formed a remarkable urban oasis. The
neighborhood still felt very much like the storied bastion of
bohemianism, in which free thinkers drank gin at Chumley's while
debating the evils of capital and the glories of art. And, at $175
a month, the price was right, though, Ms. Shea noted dryly, no
bargain. It was an ideal life for a 20-year-old student, enjoying
her first New York adventure.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, when the building went co-op in that decade's
real-estate boom, Ms. Shea's life had changed. A relatively unknown
artist, Robert Longo, had engaged her to collaborate on his work,
and along the way he had become one of the brightest of the New
York art scene's supernovas. Ms. Shea had, in her own way, arrived.
Her priorities became those of a woman whose knockabout youth had
given way, at 31, to a desire for more mature satisfactions.
</P>
<P>
   With little in savings, Ms. Shea secured 100 percent bank
financing and bought her piece of the Manhattan rock for $48,000.
She also bought her next door neighbor's apartment, a
325-square-foot studio, for $68,000, also 100 percent financed,
without knowing whether she could legally or structurally combine
the two. Neither was anyone's ideal of hearth and home, but it was
an opportunity, and she wasn't going to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Ms. Shea married Doug Sloan, a multimedia
producer-director and old school chum of Longo's. She sublet her
two studios and moved into Sloan's apartment in a cookie-cutter,
white-brick building on East 46th Street. Still, she pined for
Greenwich Village, though as a career woman and soon-to-be mother,
for different reasons. The bohemian fantasyland of her youth was
giving way to higher rents, fancier restaurants and tonier shops,
but it was still home to Public School 3, one of the city's best.
And with the Bleecker Street playground just outside the door, the
Village remained one of the most civil places in Manhattan to raise
a family. So Ms. Shea cast her eye on a third studio, this one a
whopping 500 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   There were two problems. The apartment was still occupied, by an
elderly woman who paid a two-figure, stabilized rent. The second
problem was more troublesome: the third space didn't adjoin the
others. The only direct access was through a wooden fire door and
across a tar-paper roof to another fire door.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Shea urged her husband to buy the apartment
from the owner of the building, knowing that he would take much
less than if the place were vacant. They were near to closing a
deal when the tenant suddenly died _ and the price more than
doubled. Swallowing hard, Sloan ponied up $48,000. The couple now
owned three studios, for a total of $160,000, and were still living
in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   There ensued two long years, in which Ms. Shea had a second
child; worked with Robert Evans, a New York architect, to
reconfigure the 1,000-plus square feet into a space that would
afford comfort and privacy to a family of four; dealt with New
York's protracted permit procedures and the Landmarks Commission,
and through her architect hired an expediter to, as she put it,
find loopholes in the law and hang around City Hall, making sure
the paperwork got moved to the tops of the right piles.
</P>
<P>
   The expediter, John Peachy, earned his keep. He found an
obscure, Lindsay-era law stating that the total number of
apartments in tenement buildings could be decreased without need of
a new certificate of occupancy, which saved Ms. Shea an expense.
And Evans determined that a lot-line window belonging to another
building, which sat squarely in the middle of the planned hallway
that would connect apartments two and three, could be legally
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shea also joined the co-op board, which helped insure that
her renovation plan would be approved. Once the permits and
permissions were in place, she hired all the craftsmen and shopped
for bargain appliances and fixtures. When money ran short, she
shrewdly used her resources, bartering most of her cache of signed,
original Longos at the height of their value to reduce her cash
outlay to roughly $70,000 from an estimate of $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1995, just in time for her elder child to begin
first grade at Public School 3, Ms. Shea and her family took up
residence. The resulting space remains a model of painstaking
planning, highlighting the architecture's best qualities, while
catering to individual and collective needs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is most evident in Ms. Shea's original studio, which has
been transformed into a two-bedroom children's suite and has a
ship's snug economy. Her old entrance is now a niche, containing an
antique storage cabinet used for linens. Beside it, the tiny
Pullman kitchen has been replaced by louvered closets. These are
opposite the doors to the new bedrooms; together, they form a
corridor, at the end of which is the entrance to the enlarged
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Off the corridor, the children's two bedrooms form the most
amusing and effective of the residence's spatial economies. The
original studio had three windows. Each bedroom would, of course,
receive one, but which child would get the third?
</P>
<P>
   The solution was sublimely Solomonic: the new rooms interlock
like Lego blocks before the center window, resulting in ``bunk
beds'' in which each bunk is actually in a separate room. Mica, 8,
has the lower berth in hers, while, 31 inches above, Max, 11,
sleeps in the upper in the room next door. An identical-size
portion of the original window (sealed with Plexiglas) remains at
the foot of each bed. Both spaces, which display a riot of
childhood clutter, provide roughly 50 square feet of floor space _
about the size of a dorm room, Ms. Shea noted.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment two, which is a step up from the children's suite and
in another building, serves as the couple's living
room-kitchen-dining room. The narrow kitchen, which incorporates
the old bathroom, is finished with an antique sink, which Ms. Shea
found on the Bowery, and cherry-wood-and-glass cabinets. It is open
at both ends, affording both separation and easy access from the
front door and the dining area.
</P>
<P>
   The living-dining area, though small, has three generous
windows, which overlook the garden and flood the space with
afternoon light. The area also reflects the family's priorities: no
sofa, but a substantial dining table, designed by Ms. Shea, at
which she and her children work on projects.
</P>
<P>
   For the 14-by-20-foot tar-paper roof between apartments two and
three, Evans designed a hallway that connects the spaces via their
old fire exits. It is enclosed in what Ms. Shea describes as a
little hut, raffishly clad in fire-resistant copper shingles. From
the hallway, sliding glass doors open onto a new west-facing
terrace, delightfully private and serene.
</P>
<P>
   The third apartment serves as the master suite and departs from
the others in atmosphere and architecture. With leaded-glass
windows, wide plank floors and beamed ceiling, all original, the
space sustains a literal and psychological separateness for parents
who need their privacy. Here, the kitchen was removed, and a
curved, partial wall installed to form an open walk-in
closet-dressing room. This space contains another of Ms. Shea's
droll designs for living: a pedestal sink, which taps the former
kitchen's water line. While Ms. Shea is occupied in the slightly
undersize bathroom, Sloan can shave in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Shea, who still works with Longo, estimates that her
apartment is worth roughly three times its $234,000 total cost. But
the family has no plans to move on. For one thing, the feat could
not be duplicated, at least in the Village. For another, the couple
has built a post-and-beam house on 10 acres near Rhinebeck, N.Y.,
where the children can roam unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Ms. Shea expects that as she and her family evolve,
the apartment, in one configuration or another, will always play a
part in their lives. In a tradition more usually associated with
the heartland, but no less applicable to New York, she will remain
in her first home forever.

COLOR PRINTERS IN COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the advantages of ugly, boring computers is that they
look relatively good when attached to ugly, boring peripherals,
like printers. So when Apple Computer introduced its boldly
fruit-colored line of iMac and G3 computers last year, it
brightened millions of desktops but also called attention to the
homeliness of most other peripherals in its general vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Epson to the rescue. The company has just introduced a
fruit-colored ink-jet printer, the Color Stylus 740i, which becomes
the first _ and so far the only _ printer designed to match the
iMac and Power Macintosh G3 color schemes. The printer costs $279,
but has a $30 mail-in rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the 740i is the same printer as the award-winning
740 printer that Epson introduced last year. The only changes are
cosmetic. The boring beige plastic of the 740 has been replaced by
a translucent blue and white case that matches Apple's most popular
iMac color scheme, blueberry and ice.
</P>
<P>
   For those who favor one of the iMac's current alternative colors
_ grape, strawberry, tangerine and lime _ Epson sells
color-coordinated replacement printer lids for the 740i at $15
each.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement lids will also fit on the original Epson 740
model, adding a splash of color atop the beige base. This is a nice
bonus for iMac owners who bought one of the beige 740's when it was
one of the few printer models to offer built-in support for the
iMac's Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection scheme. Now, by
flipping the lid, they can bring their 740s out of hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson 740i is not only a printer of color but also a very
good color printer with a number of features that set it apart from
other ink-jet printers in its price class.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Epson printers, the 740i has a maximum print
resolution of 1,440 by 720 dots per inch, which far exceeds that of
the competition. The higher resolution makes it a good choice for
people who need a versatile printer capable of producing
plain-paper documents ranging from business letters to color
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   If printing color photos is the highest priority, however, a
better printer choice is the new Epson 750 ($299), which uses a
six-color print cartridge instead of the four-color cartridge used
by the 740 and 740i. But the 750 is slower than the 740 and is not
well suited for printing black-and-white letters or other mundane
office documents.
</P>
<P>
   If color printing is not important, the user would be better off
getting a personal laser printer, which invariably produces better
and crisper text than an ink-jet and typically prints faster, too.
</P>
<P>
   Epson achieves its high resolution in part through a technology
called micro piezo, which deposits exceptionally small droplets of
ink on the paper. The smaller the dots, the more detail can be
shown, and Epson's dots, at six picoliters each, are the smallest
in the ink-jet world.
</P>
<P>
   When it detects large areas of solid color in a photograph or
other color design that does not require sharp resolution, the
printer automatically increases the droplet size to cover the space
more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature of the 740i is its choice of connections,
including, besides USB, traditional parallel and Macintosh serial
ports. The printer can sense which port is connected and can switch
automatically among them, which makes it particularly useful for
people who have both Windows and Mac machines in the house, or
perhaps both an older Mac and a newer iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Although most newer computers have been equipped with USB ports
for the last year, the acceptance of USB peripherals has risen
among consumers and manufacturers only recently. Apple has been
among the industry leaders in trying to establish USB as a simple
``plug and play'' replacement standard for older parallel and
serial ports.
</P>
<P>
   Apple went so far as to make USB the only connection option for
the iMac, which forced people to either buy USB-ready printers,
like the Epson, or to buy USB-to-serial adapters for older
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   USB has a number of advantages over older serial and parallel
port technologies. It has a maximum data transfer rate of 12
megabits per second, or 1.5 megabytes per second, which is more
than 10 times the speed of parallel and serial ports but slower
than other buses like SCSI (``scuzzy'') or IEEE 1394, which Apple
calls Firewire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, USB is best suited for relatively low-speed devices
like printers, mice, keyboards, speakers, microphones and scanners,
not only because they do not need to move as much data but also
because Firewire is more expensive to build into computers and
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Firewire, which transfers data at speeds of 100 megabits per
second and upward, is best suited for so-called high-bandwidth
devices like digital video cameras and DVD players, which depend on
moving large amounts of data quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The practical results of USB are a reduction in chaos and
cabling on the rear end of the computer, relief from the old
problem of limited expansion slots and the ability to plug and
unplug peripherals without having to shut down the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, as many as 127 different USB peripherals can be
connected to a computer's USB port, but in practice only someone
with a severe USB peripheral fetish would want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The Epson 740i is a nearly perfect match for the
iMac, not only in its color scheme but also in its balance of
price, performance and ease of use.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The new Apple Powerbook G3s introduced this week are faster and
a couple of pounds lighter than the older, slower and fatter
Powerbook G3s they replace.
</P>
<P>
   The new Powerbook G3s were designed for business customers.
Prices will start at $2,499 for a 333-megahertz G3 model and $3,499
for one based on a 400-MHz chip. Both are expected in stores by May
20.
</P>
<P>
   Besides keeping their names (why can't Apple think up new names
when it significantly changes the product line?), the new Powerbook
G3s retain the sensuous curves and black skin that made previous
Powerbooks so distinctive, and the 400-MHz G3 chip is more powerful
than anything on the Windows side of the universe, desktop or
portable.
</P>
<P>
   The new models weigh six pounds with the battery and CD-ROM
drive installed, as against eight pounds for the earlier models,
and they are sleeker. Even so, they still have an impressive
14.1-inch display screen _ great for a desk, but too big for a
coach seat on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been promising a lower-priced, lighter-weight portable
Mac for consumers and students, but it now looks like we'll have to
wait until July's Macworld trade show for more details.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Apple sorely lacks a lightweight portable that can
compete with the three- to four-pound Windows-based models that are
popular with business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said the battery life of the new models was five hours,
which would be a remarkable improvement over earlier Powerbooks.
Equipped with two lithium-ion batteries, a Powerbook in theory
could run for 10 hours. Such claims are often extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   The hard disk drives are a surprisingly puny four gigabytes on
the cheaper model and six gigabytes on the expensive one. Also,
while Apple added a second USB port to the new Powerbooks, it did
not include a standard Firewire port, which is curious because it
is Apple's own technology. Sony offers Firewire on its superthin
Vaio 505TX notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also released a modestly improved version of its operating
system, Mac OS 8.6. Besides bug fixes, among the incremental
advances are a better search engine for finding local hard disk or
Internet files, improved support for DVD-RAM drives and integrated
support for USB and Firewire devices. Apple asserts that OS 8.6
will also improve the battery life of Powerbook portables.
</P>
<P>
   Current users of Mac OS 8.5 can download the 35-megabyte upgrade
without charge from www.apple.com/macos, or order it on CD-ROM for
$19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Apple announced that Sears, Roebuck will start selling
iMacs and iMac peripherals in more than 800 stores nationwide at
the end of the month. There is absolutely no truth to the rumor
that Sears will sell iMacs under the Kenmore brand.

   &UR; Fragrance Saving &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I grew four-o'clocks from seed last year. They had no
fragrance. Has this been caused by ``improvement'' in seed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Modern flowers are infamous for having lost fragrance on the
way to greater gaudiness, but that's probably not the case with
four-o'clocks. In fact, you could say it's the lack of
``improvement'' that's causing the problem. Though catalogs and
garden guides describe the common four-o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa)
as very fragrant, individual strains are highly variable in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders and seed savers have done some selecting for color, but
no one seems to have done much about stabilizing the perfume, even
though four-o'clocks have been around a long time. They came to
European gardens from South America in the 16th century, and were
known as marvel-of-Peru. The marvel is the way the brightly
colored, trumpet-shaped blooms open and put out fragrance as
evening falls.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel-of-Peru is also a name for the sweet four-o'clock, M.
longiflora, a fragrant cousin of the common four-o'clock that is
much less widely grown. The common kind is famous for its riotous
colors: magenta, orange-yellow, and candy pink, sometimes with
multicolored stripes, spots and blotches. M. longiflora comes in a
more limited palette, heaviest on whites and pale pastels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as compensation, the flowers of sweet four-o'clocks are
larger and reliably fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the bright colors of jalapa and some perfume, it's
best to try different strains _ Don Pedro gets good marks. Like
dahlias, four-o'clocks make tubers that can be dug up and stored
frost-free over the winter for spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest selection of four-o'clocks is in the yearbook of the
Flower and Herb Exchange, 3076 North Winn Road, Decorah, Iowa
52101; (319) 382-5990. Membership fee, $10. For M. Longiflora seed:
the Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants at Monticello, P.O.
Box 316, Charlottesville, Va. 22902; (804) 984-9816. Don Pedro seed
is at Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, P.O. Box 170, Earlysville,
Va. 22936; (804) 973-4703. Both catalogs are $2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Inspecting New Plants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every spring and summer, I buy petunias, jasmine and other
annuals for my apartment windows. I look them over carefully before
buying. But last summer, one plant turned out to have tiny flying
bugs (I don't think they were white flies). Do you have any tips
for what to look for when buying so as not to infest a whole
apartment?  &QL; 
A. There are two strategies, one to employ when shopping, the other
to protect your older plants after the purchase. Start by checking
the prospective adoptee for general health as well as for insects
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Are there signs that a lot of leaves were removed? That may be
because they were damaged by bugs. Are the leaves that are there
unusually curly? Curled leaves can signal that there were aphids or
red spider mites around while the seedlings were growing. Though
the grower may have got rid of adult insects by spraying the plants
with pesticide or with a blast of water, just one escaped aphid is
enough to start a whole new infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Strategy 2: the quarantine. Before letting a new plant join
your old friends, keep it by itself for 10 to 12 days, so you can
monitor developments. Your apartment's best growing locations
probably already have plants in them, but the newcomer will be all
right cooling its heels in a less-favored place, as long as its
sojourn there is comparatively short.

<P>
   Q. How does the PGP encryption software work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, is a freeware program that runs
on most platforms and lets you encrypt, or secretly encode,
computer files. It is one of the most popular methods for
encrypting messages moving across the Internet to deter snoopers.
Readers need the proper key, or decryption tool, to decipher the
text.
</P>
<P>
   PGP works with what is called public key cryptography. Each PGP
user has a public key, which is made available without any attempt
at hiding it. Someone who wants to send you an encrypted message
uses your public key to put the message into code, and that puts
the message into a form that can be deciphered only by someone with
a second key _ your private key, which you do not share with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   To send a reply, you use the recipient's public key to put the
message into code, and the recipient's private key is used to
decode it.
</P>
<P>
   A good beginner's guide to the program (along with links to
download sites for PGP) is at www.arc.unm.edu/drosoff/pgp/pgp.html.
</P>
<P>
   PGP, which was invented by Philip R. Zimmermann, proved to be so
effective an encryption method that the federal government filed a
lawsuit (which it later dropped) against the program's creator
because the freely available technology could be used to code
messages sent by enemies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by

<TEXT>
<P>
   Home furnishing design is having a senior moment.
</P>
<P>
   Knitted afghan throws, crocheted pillows, chenille spreads and
tufted pom-pom quilts are appearing like silver hairs in youthful
catalogs like Garnet Hill, stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and
Barrel and collections like Ralph Lauren Home and Nautica. There
are also rag rugs, rocking chairs, ginghams and gussied floral
prints that are blooming on everything from bedding to china.
</P>
<P>
   To grandmother's house we go _ which is being stripped faster
than a sample sale by home retailers looking for the next fresh
thing. The next fresh thing was very recently musty _ the attic
outcasts and flea market-foraged handiwork of several generations
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The less-is-more of modern design may be making itself
disappear, as consumers realize that it can be as unsympathetic to
live with as it is stunning and spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that we're at the peak of that look,'' said Warren
Shoulberg, editor of Home Textiles Today, of the esthetic
exemplified by the Calvin Klein home collections. (Maybe Klein's
grandmother was a rock gardener.) ``Craftsy is hot property right
now _ more color, more surface interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Your grandmother may never have threaded a needle, but the
associations with her generation are sewing up the market for a
kinder, comforting version of contemporary design. The look is as
personal as heirlooms, as handcrafted as folk Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lover of clean and modern,'' said Gregory Covell, the
creative director of Garnet Hill, who helped bring Charles Eames
tables and Arne Jacobsen chairs into the catalog. ``But when I'm
sick and I want to wrap up in something, I want something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Covell, who lives in Vermont in the house his grandmother lived
in, is now selling the hand on the brow _ items like a sofa throw
based on knitted mittens.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion first spotted grandmother at shows by Anna Sui,
Veronique Branquinho and Stella McCartney for Chloe that featured
the crochets, embroideries and laces found in vintage clothing. Now
it has its knitting hooks in home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone full circle,'' Ms. Sui said. ``I was inspired by the
crocheted throws and pillows I found in flea markets. The only
thing that was going to look radical and fresh was almost fussy,
old-fashioned. Homey, like home cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest from younger customers may stem from the revival of
the fashions of the 1960s, the decade that last initiated the
``granny'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the completely groovy thing for an age group that didn't
live through it,'' said Diane Brush, the director of merchandising
for Garnet Hill. ``They find it funny to mix nostalgic and sweet
with new and modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Vignola, a senior vice president of home design for Ralph
Lauren Polo, thinks that novelty more than quaint associations will
drive Summer Porch, a new ``vintage-inspired'' collection of
bedding knits, embroidery and needlework.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to think of it as something new for young people,''
Ms. Vignola said of its counterpoint to the dry stylishness of
modern design. ``It was important to Ralph to do some pretty
collections.''
</P>
<P>
   The home furnishings market is having a memory lapse about
grandmother's taste, though. The bottom of the sewing basket didn't
uniformly produce the most brilliant products. Reproducing it
hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's white-on-white quilting, based on an American
vernacular candlewick pattern, is as safe as the snow of a
grandmother's head. Pottery Barn's pom-pom quilt, also a
time-honored technique, looks like a blanket with hives. Garnet
Hill's crocheted pillow looks like a yarn Brillo. Ms. Brush was
quick to say that the pillow's lack of suavity was the larger part
of its appeal _ a kind of outsider art in design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to them if they can sell it,'' Laura Fisher, an
antique textiles dealer on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said of the
pillows. ``They're not so gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher, who showed original candlewick quilts to Ralph
Lauren's team, is also doing a brisk trade in hooked rugs, to
interior designers like Mariette Himes Gomez, and Naomi Leff, who
used them in a house for Steven Speilberg.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother look could be the resurfacing of a deeper
cultural mood that has had an underlying continuity through the
century, despite modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Sumberg, a design marketing consultant in Westport,
Conn., said the heartland look of another era was at the root of
what makes Americans feel most at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every season, `retro country' is the big part of the trend
report,'' Ms. Sumberg said. ``Country is what America wants. It's
an antidote to hustle and bustle and change.''
</P>
<P>
   There is poetry in handiwork's sense of tradition, as well as
power in its sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like folk stories,'' Ms. Sui said of the intricate
throws and pillows she has collected to live with at home. ``All
these stitches and patterns, handed down, are something that one
generation gives another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sui need not worry for now. Knitting is also enjoying a
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   The National Needlework Association, which represents yarn
manufacturers and knitting and needlepoint craft stores, reported a
25-percent increase in yarn sales over the last year, which Barry
Klein, its president, attributes also to the fashion cross-over
from Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are making heirloom stuff, but the image is not
grandma.'' Klein said. He mentioned high-profile knitters like
Juliana Margolies and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Buscaglia, a New York psychotherapist, has knitted the
pillows for his office, after taking classes at Gotta Knit, a West
Village knitting-supply store.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is furnished like a living room, with Stickley
mission,'' he said. ``The pillows give that sense of being at
home.'' Buscaglia knits between patients. ``It's a great way to
clear my mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, grandmothers may not want much to do with the
home fashion that bears their signature, like the pot-holders
photographed like prize roses for May's Martha Stewart Living
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sumberg said: ``Both my grandmothers lived into their '90s.
They looked at this stuff and threw it away. It was
eating-in-the-kitchen _ it was Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted Belgian linens.'' she explained.

HERE'S WHO WINS IN THE `STAR WARS' PREQUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A long time ago in a galaxy far away ... No, it
wasn't the Galaxy, it was the Cinema 21, not far from the Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   A council of San Francisco's press federation was invited for a
Force feeding on Tuesday night, a preview of the prequel, ``Star
Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   If a bomb had gone off in the theater, public relations people
in San Francisco would never have to give out freebies again.
That's how many of the freebie elite were there.
</P>
<P>
   And some stars, too. At least of the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to get to the theater two hours early, so we had
movie hot dogs for dinner. That's how elite we were. The dogs were
Lukedogs, not for Skywalker, but for lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the emanations from all the cell phones in the room
warmed them up.
</P>
<P>
   That's what people did while waiting two hours for the movie to
start. They talked on cell phones. They read comic books; well,
some of the younger press, those looking for the literary roots of
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   We were all instructed to turn in anyone we saw ``camcording''
the film. It's a new verb to me. I can't imagine a camcorded
version of this movie. You wouldn't feel The Force or the booming
Dolby THX.
</P>
<P>
   There would be nothing left but characters and plot, that is to
say, not a lot more than when you camcord family vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The story so far ... No, we can't tell the story, nor reveal the
simple plot or intricate rhinoplasty of ``Star Wars: Episode I, The
Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the pre-preview agreement that allowed the press to see
the prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I give you my summary of a movie George Lucas didn't make.
This is the one that somehow got stuck in my head after two hours
and 10 minutes of being blasted by hundreds of decibels THXing
around the theater. OK, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Queen Onomatopoeia, leader of the Poopee people on the planet
Pokemon, is held prisoner by her hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Chancellor Nafta of the evil Trade Federation is trying
to kill her, but she is carried away by a Jedi knight named Qua-Hog
Jim, played by Liam Neeson, which wouldn't be a bad ``Star Wars''
name itself.
</P>
<P>
   His sidekick is Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Ewan MacGregor, who
will later grow up to be Alec Guinness and a great actor instead of
a Scot hottie.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Allialli-Infree, or whatever her name is, and the Jedi
knight Qui-Nine Gin (or whatever) make friends with a funny
creature named Zsa Zsa Boinks, a member of the floppy-eared,
cartoon-talking Gungadin people.
</P>
<P>
   They all hook up with a young boy named Munchkin Skywalker. I
believe later he will grow up to be Garth Vader, who will dominate
the universe from planet VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   I can't reveal the advice the older Jedi knight, Quik-Straw,
gives to young Ramekin (or whatever his name is), but it's
something like: ``Concentrate on the monumental. Use your
investors. Feel, don't eat the daisies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic fight scene, Obi-Ewan and Li-Am Nee-Son go
light saber to light saber with an evil Sitz knight who looks like
Marilyn Manson on a bad paint day.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you who dies.
</P>
<P>
   But I can say that Queen Ana Mandara (who's cute, but no
Princess Linka) holds a big celebration in the capital of the
Boo-Hoo people, complete with the Trojan marching band in big
rubber masks. Young Napkin, or whatever, smiles a Shirley Temple
smile, and peace reigns.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for long, to look at the face of the new Supreme
Chancellor Peptobysmal.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in the theater cheered, and then the credits rolled,
naming more visual effects technicians than the population of
Planet Fleadh.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was filled wall-to-wall with battle scenes, monster
fish flushed from hell, battalions of marching duck-droids with Uzi
blasters and senators wafting around on gravity-defying podia with
little C-SPAN droids taking pictures of them.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't reveal all this stuff, but you've already seen it in
the previews of the prequel and in Premiere magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some great Cubist lipstick and spinal-compression
hairdos on Queen Amniotic, that's what this movie is about; that
and drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, George Lucas returns to his ``American Graffiti'' roots
with hotrods in the greatest race since ``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Ben-Hur was not Obi-Wan's name after he retired.
</P>
<P>
   The thrilling race all comes down to the final stretch with
young Lambikin against an evil Tatooinisian creature named Slobodan
or Sepulveda. I can't give away who wins.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes I can. George Lucas.

HANG TIME: THE INTERNET MOUNTS ITS MASTERPIECE

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't flip through its 32,600 pages, discovering a
delightful image serendipitously. You can't hold it, feeling the
weight of its scholarship in the heft of its volumes. You can't
drift off to sleep in a club chair, an open volume on your lap
awaiting your awakening.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever a digital book made sense, The Grove Dictionary of
Art Online might be it _ if only because the 34-volume print
version, 26.3 million words written by 6,802 experts and published
in 1996, weighs 168 pounds and takes up 5 feet of shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   Grove is now testing the thesis that the digital book's time has
come, at least as a reference text. It is a sign of how far the
Internet has come. When Grove's print version made its debut,
filling a niche as the most comprehensive art reference, the talk
about a digital Grove Dictionary was all about CD-ROMs. But that
format was ruled out at the time because a single disk would lack
the necessary capacity. The Internet has won out, and not just
because it offers a much greater capacity and has grown so popular.
It can also be updated at will, which makes good sense in a dynamic
area like the art world.
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, the company has offered subscriptions to an
online dictionary (www.groveart.com) that contains the text of the
print version, with additions and updates, all illustrated by links
to artworks in the online collections of museums and galleries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Sutter, a marketing director in New York for Grove's
Dictionaries, a branch of Macmillan Publishers, based in London,
said the company had sold subscriptions to the online dictionary
that so far number ``in the low hundreds.'' By comparison, more
than 5,000 copies of the print version have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   But a spot check of more than a half-dozen museums, libraries
and universities, which are Grove's prime customers, has turned up
only a few reservations about the product and seems to show that
the company is proving its case _ and laying the groundwork for two
similar products, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera Online, which
should be available at the end of June, and The New Grove
Dictionary of Music and Musicians Online, which is expected in late
2000. (Both will eventually have music clips.)
</P>
<P>
   Judith Holliday, the fine arts librarian at Cornell University,
which has already given the print version that 5 feet of shelf
space, made perhaps the most convincing argument for buying the
online product. ``We're definitely going to get it,'' she said.
``The minute the printed version was printed, it was obsolete.
Scholarship happens all the time; people are finding out new things
all the time. And with an online version, things can be updated all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove's mammoth Dictionary of Art, really an encyclopedia that
took 14 years to prepare, obviously has plenty of room for
revisions. The printed version contains 41,000 articles on artists,
patrons, dealers, scholars, genres, media, movements,
archaeological sites, historic cities, art theory and on and on. It
has 15,000 images along with 750 maps, diagrams and drawings
especially commissioned to illustrate its articles. Its list price
is $8,800, though special offers often drop the price to as low as
$6,000.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the online version has all that and more. (It is
accessible on any computer with a Web connection via Internet
Explorer 4.0 or Netscape 4.0 or higher and a minimum screen
resolution of 800 by 600 pixels.)
</P>
<P>
   Grove has already supplemented some entries (on van Gogh and
Cezanne, for example) and added articles on ``Brit Pack'' artists
like Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread and Chris Offili that did not
make the print version. It plans to put pieces on 30 California
artists online by the end of the year, and it says it will
periodically update articles to take into account biographical
developments, new academic research and events that are important
in art history.
</P>
<P>
   In the image-to-image battle, the online version wins by far; it
initially had links to only about 8,000 images, but Grove has since
added links to an additional 4,000. And it recently signed a
partnership contract with the Bridgeman Art Library, which acts as
the licensing agent for more than 750 museums and other collections
worldwide, to give Grove's online subscribers access to 30,000
additional images May 20, followed by 70,000 more by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove Dictionary of Art Online thus adds value beyond the
reference articles by finding and maintaining Web links to images
of art in online museums and on other sites. While the online
images are available to anyone who knows where the links are, Grove
puts them all in context and in one place.
</P>
<P>
   As for price, Grove Online costs $1,500 for a one-year
subscription that allows five concurrent users ($2,000 for 10
simultaneous users). But institutions that already own the print
version pay $1,000 a year for 5 concurrent users, $1,500 for 10
concurrent users. An individual can have access for $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not already own the books, Grove is offering a
combination deal: the books and a one-year subscription to the
Internet version for $5,000 for 5 concurrent users or $5,500 for
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to sell the books _ we've reprinted them and
they're there,'' Ms. Sutter said, explaining the pricing. ``We want
people to buy both.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jack Brown, the director of libraries at the Art Institute
of Chicago, buying the online version of the dictionary was an easy
call. Although the Art Institute owns three Grove hard copies,
Brown was Grove Online's first subscriber. ``I bought it sight
unseen,'' he said. ``It's clearly the essential and definitive tool
for art history at this point, and I wanted to distribute access to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leaving their offices to look up something in a
library, ``curators go to their desks _ we have 1,000 terminals in
the building,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can also remotely access it from any Internet address
associated with the institute,'' he added. ``So they can do it from
home if they're working there.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Institute members and people with a demonstrable need to do
art research may also tap into the museum's Grove Online, just as
they may use its libraries. Brown said he did not yet have
information about how many people, inside or outside the institute,
are using the online dictionary or about the frequency of use, but
he reports no access problems under the Art Institute's five-user
license. ``No one has ever said he was unable to get at it,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Grove Online, he said, is also very useful to the institute's
reference librarians, who answer questions from the public.
``People e-mail us questions, and we cut and paste answers out of
that text,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sachs, the technophilic director of the Frick Collection
in New York, is equally enthusiastic. ``It's handy for a lot of
things,'' said Sachs, who keeps a computer at his side in his
richly paneled office on Fifth Avenue. ``If you suddenly can't
remember Masaccio's middle name, you don't have to get up and go to
the Frick reference library,'' he said, savoring the time he saves
by not riding an elevator down two flights, crossing the Frick
basement into the library next door, then pulling down a book and
finding the correct page.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he can log on to Grove, click on Articles, choose M,
scroll down the page and click on Masaccio to find that the artist,
born in 1401 and regarded as the founder of Italian Renaissance
painting, was named Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Mone Cassai.
</P>
<P>
   All curators at the Frick have the same access to Grove Online,
and many members of the public are using it, Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   To hear subscribers tell it, the online search function is a
major plus. The print version has thousands of cross-references and
a 1,075-page index with 720,000 entries. Online, users can search
for a topic and get a complete list of the times it is mentioned
throughout the database. So search possibilities are endless, and
the cross-references are available with a click _ saving the
researcher the trouble of putting down one volume and picking up
another.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the plan. Right now, ``searching is still a
little clunky,'' Ms. Holliday said. And though she could not think
of a specific example of a problem, she said, ``They still need to
refine the search mechanisms.'' As Sachs pointed out, though,
research is still quicker online, even if the search engine has
quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can search multiple things and very quickly,'' he said,
``whereas taking down Volume 1 and Volume 19 and paging through is
very tedious. And the searches turn up things unexpectedly _ that's
fun, as much as a hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove is aware of the limitations of its search function, and is
overhauling the appearance and functions of its search page. With
the upgrade, which is expected to be available May 20, people will
be able to do simple and advanced searches with more options. They
will be able, for example, to search only the bibliographies that
accompany the articles or only for images.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, art, so those images were a major question
mark for potential subscribers. The published volumes have very
high-quality reproductions, reviewers said. How would they look on
the screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the images were poor, I wouldn't get it,'' Ms. Holliday
said. They are not, for the most part. They vary in quality because
users follow links to images of artwork on sites of the museums
that own the works.
</P>
<P>
   Some museum directors are unhappy about that. Grove paid museums
for permission to reproduce their works in the print version, and
museums make tidy sums from approving such requests from
publishers. But though Grove initially talked to some museums about
reproductions, in the end it did not seek permission for making
images available via Grove Online. Grove argues that it need not
pay museums for access to images because it merely links its users
to museum sites, where the images are already free.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright lawyers seem to think that Grove is right under
current law, but perhaps wrong under evolving laws that cover the
Internet. The Association of Art Museum Directors, an organization
of 170 large North American museums, has discussed making some
protest to Grove, though it has not decided exactly how hawkish it
will be. Sachs, who heads the association's information and
communications technology committee, said the group had sent a
letter to Macmillan asking to talk about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When the Grove Dictionary of Art was published, some book-loving
critics suggested that a different obstacle would render an online
version unusable: Who, they asked, would want to wade through long
articles online? The entry on China, for example, weighs in at 469
pages, while the biography of Michelangelo runs on for 20 pages.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, as things are turning out. For one thing, many
institutions already have the books and are simply adding the
online version. The two are often used in conjunction, especially
by people over 30.
</P>
<P>
   So even though two years ago people questioned the viability of
an online Grove dictionary, today some people think it is the print
version whose days may be numbered. ``Students want things that are
online,'' Ms. Holliday said, ``and if they're not online, things
don't exist for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Online addicts, or indeed anyone familiar with the Web, seem to
have one word for long articles: print. ``I can't tell you how many
people think nothing of printing out pages and pages of material,''
added Ms. Holliday, who says she believes that the print version is
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Sutter said that The Grove Dictionary of Art was in
its second printing (the first was 6,000 copies), she also said
that online subscriptions were ``starting to take off,'' now that
people had tested it. ``No one has slammed the door on us,'' she
said. Rather, the institutions that have taken up Grove Online's
30-day trial offer and not ordered have generally attributed their
decisions against signing up to budget problems or bureaucratic
delays, she said. Owners of the dictionary in book form only, after
all, will not get the new material and updates that online
subscribers get.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Sutter said that ``it's rare for someone to buy the
print version only.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grove is hedging on the technology front. Now that new
compression technology makes it possible to squeeze the dictionary
onto one CD-ROM, Ms. Sutter said, the company plans to offer a disk
version aimed primarily at individuals. That will come later this
year, she said, but Grove has not yet decided how much it will
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The early online converts are not looking back. Some are already
talking about the books in the past tense. Take Sachs. He has had
Grove Online for only a few months; still, he stopped in
midconversation as he related his experience with it and said, ``I
still have wonderful nostalgia for the book, though.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   HANDS ON: USING THE GROVE DICTIONARY OF ART ONLINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I've gone academic. In the last two months, I have
looked up more things about art and artists than I have in, say,
the last two years of writing about the art world. Credit The Grove
Dictionary of Art Online.
</P>
<P>
   When I came back from a week in Spain intrigued by Benedetto
Bonfigli's ``Annunciation'' in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum there,
I logged on to Grove to learn more about him.
</P>
<P>
   When a colleague phoned to ask for help phrasing a line about
Frederic Edwin Church, I kept him on the line while I searched for
Church on Grove (a good thing, too _ I would have failed to mention
that he was second-generation Hudson River School).
</P>
<P>
   Even when I come across artists I do not need to know more about
for my reporting, I have gone to Grove simply to see what's there.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is the collection of images, not the pages of
text, that is so alluring. Watching, for example, Raphael's
``Aldobrandini Madonna'' appear almost line by line, cascading like
a theater curtain until the whole screen is filled, is almost
magical. The experience will never replace seeing the real thing,
but it still delivers a frisson of pleasure, and it's accessible
with just a few clicks, rather than a trip to the National Gallery
in London.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what I expected when I learned about Grove Online.
Although I use the Internet daily, the idea of electronic books
seemed completely resistible. Grove is making me a convert to them,
at least for reference books.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those images _ many of which, after all, can be found
on museum, gallery and academic sites that charge no admission _
Grove has proved that books online can be easy to use and, more
important, at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   To use the dictionary, a paid subscriber goes to Grove's site
(www.groveart.com) and logs in by name and password. Up pops a page
with five choices: Introduction, Articles A to Z, Search, Index and
Appendices.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that I needed no Introduction, I always went straight
to Articles or Search _ and I rarely had a problem finding what I
wanted. Plugging in artists' names worked fairly quickly; the
search is aided by a vertical alphabetical listing of the first
letter of the last name, then another vertical column for the
second letter.
</P>
<P>
   Once you find the text, you must click on Images to see which
ones are available; the menu opens in a window on the right. Most
of the images are available via links to museums and galleries
(that will change May 20, when Grove adds the first 30,000 images
it is getting access to through a partnership with the Bridgeman
Art Library).
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the title of a work, however, did not always work
because titles vary. While Samuel Sachs, director of the Frick
Collection, mentioned Watteau's ``Embarkation to Cythera,'' for
example, Grove has the work as ``The Pilgrimage to Cythera.''
Better to go to Watteau, if you know he was the artist.
</P>
<P>
   There were other disappointments. While I was happy learning
more about Bonfigli's life, Grove provided only one image, a
triptych in Perugia. As usual, some linked sites took ages to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Some links were down when I clicked on them. Worse, some had
changed, apparently without Grove's finding out. When, for example,
I tried to call up Georgia O'Keeffe's ``Evening Star III,'' which
resides at the Museum of Modern Art, I got a page beginning ``The
MOMA Web site has been reorganized to add more content. The page
you requested could not be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove, which says it has been checking links manually and has
updated them four times since November, knows that the problem
needs fixing. It will soon change.
</P>
<P>
   None of these quibbles were deal-breakers, though for me online
books will always have one insurmountable hurdle that makes me
print out anything of any length. How else can I underline?

TURNING ART AND SOUND INTO CHILD'S PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sensuous is not a word typically applied to multimedia. On
screen, spectacle generally trumps texture and nuance. So it is a
pleasant shock to encounter Midnight Play, which has collected so
many international art prizes that its commercial doom in the
United States is almost assured.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a children's story by Kveta Pacovska, a Czech artist
and author, Midnight Play is an interactive picture book with
enough visual sophistication to satisfy any adult. If Joan Miro's
paintings met Edward Gorey's cartoons under the tent of ``Terry
Gilliam's Flying Circus,'' it would look like this.
</P>
<P>
   The story (all four sentences of it) is this: ``The theater at
night is dark and quiet. The actors are all sound asleep, until
midnight, when the moon rises above the theater. As if to say, `Is
anyone down there?' the moon looks down at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   As moonlight beams upon the stage, one by one, the actors awake
to perform all kinds of fun music, movements and tricks.'' But that
is from the box _ there are no words, written or spoken, anywhere
on the disk. As in a ballet, namely ``The Nutcracker,'' the story
is merely a premise for the visual and musical delight that
follows.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Midnight Play is about the qualities of drawing
and painting. After the introductory animation, you might find
yourself in a red painting whose one small figure seems content in
its multicolored box, off to the side. Swept through the box, the
cursor changes hue. Pulled across the screen, it leaves a stripe of
color in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the split-second delay, and the way the color
overlays itself with a subtle shadow, it's more like drawing with
oil pastels than with a computer paint program. The color doesn't
feel as though it's made of pure light. It feels as though it's
made of something soft, unctuous, thick and blendable.
</P>
<P>
   On this digital canvas, there is a pleasure in the gesture of
painting, in the illusion of texture, that makes the experience
into an abstract expressionist exercise whose fluid quality is
enhanced by a trance-inducing drum-and-woodwind soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the moon man who appears at the edge of the painting,
and the screen fills with images of torn paper _ scraps of
stationery, graph paper, musical notebooks and labels. Drag them to
the edges and you'll hear the sharp shuffle of paper against paper
and, underneath, jingle bells ringing on the collar of a cartoon
harlequin _ the drawing buried beneath the scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered, the harlequin expands until the zigzag pattern around
his neck fills the screen and becomes yet another painting, whose
interlocking triangles correspond to the notes of a drum. When
clicked, each wedge sounds a different percussion note and changes
color, until the moon man comes along and transforms the painting's
four triangles into six colored squares, each evoking the sound of
a different art medium (charcoal, chalk or squeaky markers, paper
being crumpled) and leads to another full-screen composition.
</P>
<P>
   As you move among these images, their relationships deepen. The
multicolored squares form the waistcoat of a clown, who turns up in
a painting of a clock. From the clock, a blue circle expands into a
giant chalky moon, framing a cat on a swing in silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by a spotlight, the cat grins, then turns slowly,
revealing himself to be a paper cutout. The ballerina on his
reverse side dances a solo in the next painting, curtsies, then
crumples into a piece of pink paper in the patchwork sound
painting.
</P>
<P>
   The transitions are as intriguing as the images themselves. By
illustrating the links between paintings, they knit the work
together into a visual riddle _ a fractal jigsaw where the pieces
fit together in multiple ways, adjacent to one another but also
inside one another. One painting suggests a path through several
others.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't take those paths, the knowledge that they
exist creates an overlay as palpable as the illusory oil pastels.
When you've experienced the white cat's drum as a sound painting,
when you know the clown's waistcoat turns into a puzzle, you can't
look at the cat or the clown again and not see something else.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the same image a second or third or fourth time,
it's a different experience because you know where the links are.
And the links are so multidimensional and nonlinear that
understanding them becomes a delight in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, the work is an exercise in nonsense logic
worthy of Lewis Carroll. But because the logic is visual, it is
accessible to even the youngest child, though like all great works
for children, Midnight Play speaks equally to adults.
</P>
<P>
   It also speaks to the possibilities of digital media. In Ms.
Pacovska's original book, the images unfold page by page. The
reader's path is one of many. In a collection of interrelated
digital images, animation weaves multiple paths through this
eccentrically rendered universe.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, this is the sort of interactive storytelling that
works only with pictures because pictures can contain one another
in ways that words cannot. Verbal stories dissipate as they branch
because they are progressive _ the only way to learn more is to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Visual stories deepen as they branch because they are recursive
_ you can understand something new by going back. And with images
this beautiful, the return is always a pleasure.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling high pressure extending from central Canada to the
Northeastern states will continue to interfere with the typical
west to east motion of weather systems. As a result a dry weather
pattern will persist Thursday over the Northeast while clouds,
showers and some thunderstorms will linger over parts of the upper
Middle West and Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, unseasonably cool air will
remain over the Northwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful in most of the Northeast as breezes
from the north draw cool, dry air from eastern Canada, however,
patches of clouds will form over northern New England. Farther
south, a wavering front from the Ohio Valley to the Middle Atlantic
states will be the focus for clouds and scattered showers. The
heaviest rain and a few thunderstorms will occur where converging
winds lift relatively humid air from southern Ohio to the mountains
of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thundershowers will form from the Carolinas to the
eastern Gulf Coast as a weakening disturbance at 20,000 feet drifts
across the region. In the wake of the disturbance, sunny and warm
weather will prevail from the southern Mississippi Valley to the
eastern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled, cool weather with a mixture of clouds and sun will
prevail over the Northwest. Clouds and a few showers will dampen
the Northwest coast and some mountain slopes from the Cascades to
the northern Rockies. Most of the Southwestern will be sunny and
hot, although isolated late afternoon thunderstorms will erupt over
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet May
</P>
<P>
   This month is already one of the wettest Mays on record at
Bismarck, N.D. Through the first 11 days, rain totaled 5.04 inches,
leapfrogging this month into fifth place on the city's list of
wettest Mays. The average rainfall for May is about 2.2 inches. In
May, a recurrent pattern of blocking high-pressure systems over
central Canada have impeded the advance of low-pressure systems
from the Pacific. After exiting the Rockies, lows braked, allowing
protracted winds from the south ahead of them to import moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico, setting the stage for a wet early May.

THE CALM DURING AND AFTER THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release May 20)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I became a little concerned when the hail stones started
drowning out my book tape.
</P>
<P>
   The drive toward my office in Atlanta had grown progressively
more difficult as the storm front from Oklahoma moved through. Rain
fell in torrents, and the sky grew dark and ominous. Thunder boomed
so deeply it seemed to be coming out of my stereo speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers of BMWs and Mercedes were stopped under overpasses
trying to protect their car finishes from the grape-sized hail, but
also effectively blocking the road for the rest of us, whose old
minivans and outdated sedans wouldn't notice another ding here or
there.
</P>
<P>
   As I finally pulled into the parking garage, the security guard
leaned forward and said, ``Tornado just hit Lilburn. It's headed
toward Lawrenceville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilburn?'' I said. ``That's where I live. That's where my
children are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give them a call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I raced to the elevator, using my cell phone to call my husband
and trying not to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tornado hit Lilburn,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll find out where,'' he said and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick call to Adam's elementary school and Sarah's day
care, I was reassured that they were safe and the danger had
passed. There was no one to call at our house, but it seemed of
little importance now that the children were OK. I did imagine
Star, our 11-year-old, storm-phobic German shepherd, cowering under
the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we found out a few trees were knocked down, a couple of
roofs leaked, some streets were flooded and lots of homes lost
power. But the tornados hadn't touched down, and there were no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   From our intact, cozy living room, I watched the news reports
from Oklahoma and Kansas that night with a new sense of empathy. A
muddy 10-month-old girl had been found curled up next to a tree
after being sucked from her house by the twister's pull.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering only from a few scratches, she cried to be held as a
policeman wiped her off. Her grandmother had been killed, and her
father was in critical condition, but she was promptly reunited
with her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Adam was quiet at dinner, so I asked him what had happened at
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a twister emergency. We had to sit against the brick
wall with our heads like this,'' he said, lowering his head between
his knees, ``for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing from his teacher that this event had lasted no more than
10 minutes, I stifled a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was anyone scared?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' he said. ``I kept whispering `I hope we don't die,'
over and over again, and then I started talking about what heaven
was like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really,'' I said, imagining that this had probably set
quite a calming tone for the other second-graders. ``And what did
you come up with?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, just that it probably has a lot of candy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Ms. Woods? Did she have to sit with you and put her
head down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. She was reading us a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that just like a second-grade teacher? A row of scared
8-year-olds, an approaching storm ... and a good book read aloud to
keep the fear at bay.

<P>
   GUNS-EDITORIAL _ The gabfest on youth violence which occurred at
the White House Monday was notable for the absence of two key
players: the National Rifle Association and top Hollywood
executives. Still, President Clinton used the meeting to reiterate
the gun-control package he proposed immediately after the Columbine
High School shooting massacre in Littleton on April 20. And, while
the NRA wasn't invited, the president did get support for his plan
from three major gun manufacturers and the American Shooting Sports
Council. (Daily Sentinel, Grand Junction, Colo.) MOVED.

   TEX-SIXTIES-SYMPOSIUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Was the 1960's the
dawning of a new consciousness? Not the hokey ``Age of Aquarius''
of ``Hair,'' but a shift in values more subversive and pervasive,
one that opened the doors of perception and threw the very
conception of reality up for grabs? Or was it a culture collapsing
under the weight of a collective nervous breakdown? A mass ``freak
out,'' in the parlance of the age, a time when ``blowing your
mind'' was considered a good thing. For the walking wounded of the
psychedelic revolution, this was another Legacy of the Sixties. One
suspects that it's a different ``Legacy of the Sixties'' that will
be explored through this week's symposium by that name at the

109 YEARS OF A WELL-WORN NATIONAL TREASURE

 By LES LINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like millions of Americans, I hoarded each yellow-bordered issue
of National Geographic as though it were an heirloom. When I was
growing up in the late 1940s, a neighbor owned every issue from the
beginning _ 1888. Since Playboy magazine wouldn't be invented for a
few years, his son and I spent hours thumbing through the pages to
marvel over pictures of bare-breasted women on remote Pacific
isles, among other natural wonders, of course.
</P>
<P>
   So I felt guilty when, during a move eight years ago, I dumped
my 35 years of National Geographic on a charity rummage sale. (It
was that or give up my jazz LP collection.) I felt guiltier still
when the magazine commissioned me to do a story on vanishing
migratory songbirds, sending me to Jamaica and Costa Rica, among
other places, on the kind of expense budget I could never have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Now that awful load of guilt has been lifted with the arrival on
my desk of The Complete National Geographic on CD-ROM: 109 years
(issues since 1888 and through 1997) on 31 disks in a slipcase
(bright yellow, of course) that would hold less than three years of
the real thing. If that's still too much space, the collection is
available on four DVD's.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society boasts that the collection
includes every cover (1,247), every page (190,000), every article
(9,300), every photograph and illustration (180,000) and every
advertisement, all scanned directly from the original magazines.
The loose fold-out maps are missing, gathered in a CD-ROM package
of their own. In total, they assembled 6,236 magazines that
occupied 90 feet of shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   The society maintains that because the CD-ROM archive consists
of exact images of page as they were originally published rather
than representing further editorial use, no additional payments to
writers and photographers are necessary. This stance has angered
some of the magazine's contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, after running the easy installation program, I
loaded the appropriate CD and checked out my article.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures look great! The magazine's pages are displayed a
spread at a time, and the scans were optimized to favor the
photographs. My words, however, were faint and barely legible, even
on a 17-inch monitor. But after you click on a spread to zoom in
and then maximize it to full-screen size, there are find toolbar
buttons that darken the text (along with the images) in three
incremental steps to make it more readable.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the option of printing a spread, one page at a
time, in the exact size of the original magazine. Using an Epson
Photo 700 ink-jet printer, I tried both glossy and flat
photo-quality paper at settings of 360, 720 and 1,400 dots per inch
with consistently disappointing results: the type was faint and
badly smudged, and the sharp photographic detail you see on screen
was lost in a smear of pixels. Moreover, because the CD's were
created from single pages removed from bound magazines, every
spread is divided by a vertical black stripe. Photographs that
cross over from one page to the next are split.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the 109-year archive, however, yields split-second
results. Entering ``South Pacific'' returned, among other
citations, a July 1948 story called ``Pacific Wards of Uncle Sam,''
the stuff of boyhood memories in brilliant Kodachrome colors.
</P>
<P>
   But browsing is the best way to follow the National Geographic's
evolution from a scholarly scientific journal with a conservative,
dark-brown cover and no photographs into a legendary publication
that today reaches 50 million adults and children each month.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the publication had a longstanding policy of
printing ``only what is of a kindly nature about any country or
people.'' But a browser will notice that the policy changed in the
1970s with the coverage of issues like environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping from issue to issue with a click of the mouse doesn't
quite equal the experience of flipping through the pages of a real
magazine. Reading the stories and picture captions seriously
strains the eyes, even at the darkest type setting. But the fast
and efficient CD-ROM search engine beats hunting through a
shelf-load of magazines for a vaguely remembered article. The
Complete National Geographic reminds us that the magazine itself,
for all its perceived and sometimes imperious faults, is a national
treasure. Even if the
</P>
<P>
   yellow-bound issues sometimes end up in a Dumpster.

   To Convey Eameses' Genius &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who were lucky enough to be in the audience for the
designer Charles Eames' 1970 Norton lectures at Harvard, where he
showed the original version of his film ``Powers of Ten'' (1968),
will never forget its impact. Moving from galaxy to proton, zooming
from the edges of the universe to the hand of a man lying on a
picnic blanket in a Chicago park and then into a carbon atom on his
hand, the film lends the viewer nothing less than a sense of the
proportions of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Eames Office, Pyramid Media and DATT Japan have produced
a CD-ROM called Powers of Ten Interactive, dedicated to expanding
on the ideas of the husband-wife design team of Charles and Ray
Eames, the film's producers. (The disk, which can be bought on line
at www.eamesoffice.com and www .powersoften.com, is based on a
second version of ``Powers of Ten,'' made in 1977.)
</P>
<P>
   Largely the work of their daughter, Lucia Dewey Eames, and
grandson, Eames Demetrios, who direct the office today, the disk is
filled with fascinating video clips of interviews with those who
worked with the Eames Office in Venice, Calif., mini-movies the
couple made as well as images and documents from their body of
work.
</P>
<P>
   An Eames revival of sorts is in progress, keynoted by a show of
the work of the Eameses, originally organized by Donald Albrecht
for the Vitra Museum in Germany and opening on May 20 at the
Library of Congress. (The show will run at New York's Cooper-Hewitt
Museum from Feb. 15 to May 15, 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Charles Eames is best known for his furniture _ the plywood
chairs and chaise lounge he did for the Herman Miller company. But
with Ray he was also a multimedia innovator. Together, they created
some 88 short films and pioneering multiscreen and multipanel
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Eameses was their ability to make a
difficult concept tangible: they designed perspectives and insights
as much as they designed chairs or multimedia displays. The film
``Powers of Ten,'' with its images moving closer to Earth every two
seconds by an exponential power of 10, shows this strength at work.
It is a demonstration of the scales of physics _ from star system
to atom _ that feels like a roller coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating the ``Powers of Ten'' disk, however, proved to be a
challenge. The program slaps together portraits of thinkers on time
and space, from Descartes to Einstein, and interviews with figures
like an Australian aboriginal artist with bits of science and a
history of the Eames work. There are clips from the Norton lectures
as well as transcribed texts.
</P>
<P>
   The first warning sign of the interface difficulties comes in
the form of a bright pink label warning Windows users (the disk
runs on Mac as well) that they must set their monitors to 256
colors and must use Quicktime version 2.5. The former requires
rebooting the computer; the latter violates basic conventions of
compatibility since later versions of Quicktime won't work with the
disk. The second warning sign is the injunction to unfold a complex
set of printed instructions and set them beside the computer. A
good interface should be self-contained.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, the organizing metaphor is an odd choice: a Japanese
fish trap, a woven basket where the thematic strands of the
information are represented by colored lines. The user is most
likely to feel more like the fish than the fisherman. There are
many wonderful pieces, like a short video that takes the viewer up
a road, across a meadow and into the living room of the Eames house
in Los Angeles, a landmark of construction from off-the-shelf
industrial parts. The narrating voice is that of Ray Eames, but
nothing indicates when the clip was first shown. Several
``strands'' titled Space, Time, Tools, People, Patterns and Eames
give what few connections there are among the different pieces
found on the disk.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the sort of needless complexity it was the
genius of the Eameses to cut through. Charles, who died in 1977,
and Ray, who lived until 1987, might have done something
interesting with CD-ROM technology. ``Powers of Ten,'' the film, is
not interactive, but sweeps the viewer along in the hands of a
knowing guide. Such a guide could turn the material here into a
wonderful documentary, linear but exciting in its connections.

   An Open Window Onto Artist's Muses &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The artist Betye Saar has been enjoying a growing reputation
based on her mixed-media collages and assemblages. Through these
folk-art pastiches, Ms. Saar, who began her career in costume
design and is now represented in galleries around the world,
expresses aspects of African-American history and life.
</P>
<P>
   On this multimedia project, Ms. Saar uses the convention of the
griot, a West African storyteller, to lead the viewer down the long
and varied road of her art and life, blending her own narration and
168 pieces of her vibrantly colored art.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with an image of a ``black girl's window'' composed of
many panes, each with its own artwork and heading, like
Inspiration, Bridge of Memory and House of Dreams. The panes are
meant to be tarot cards the griot reads to tell stories.
</P>
<P>
   If you click on Secret Heart, for example, you arrive at an
arresting Saar artwork of an eagle with the word love inscribed
over it. An animated explosion dissolves the word into a beating
heart, accompanied by delicate Satie music. Move to some text, and
a narrator begins, ``My secret heart is seduced by twilight.''
Clicking on a sweetheart icon leads you to more Saar art.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as this disk is, the artifice of the griot isn't
terribly well supported. There seem to be many voices here, many
routes to take, but not the central narrative that the griot
convention might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the House of Dreams to find a well-hidden Room of
Secrets and Sorrows. To find this room, you feel around the screen
with your mouse until the icon on the cursor changes. I had no
luck, but I stumbled upon another icon in the top right-hand corner
and landed in the Index of Images. The first artwork to pop up was
of a girl's face behind a grilled window, a nice surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the House of Dreams (determined to find the secret
room), I came upon Grandma's House, a framed assemblage of raindrop
images and swatches of faded wallpaper against a salmon-pink
backdrop, an inviting scene.
</P>
<P>
   Reverting to the window once more, I clicked on what turned out
to be the most satisfying pane of all: Inspiration. Here are the
smallest but most important treasures Digital Griot offers: a
notebook of watercolor sketchings by Ms. Saar, renderings of trips
to Paris, Brazil, Italy and South Africa. With flutey music and Ms.
Saar's soothing descriptions, the notebook reveals her sources of
ideas for things like a playground fence for a public school in
Queens. (The source was a fence in Paris.)
</P>
<P>
   What unfolds is not only a tour of exotic and gorgeous locales
but also the steps this artist takes to create and an inventory of
her simple raw material. Ms. Saar becomes so accessible through
these sketchings, you want to stay in Inspiration all day, even if
the griot is calling.

<P>
   Every day, Wendy S. Limauge spends an hour online entering
sweepstakes and contests, chasing after the four ``Cs'' _ computer,
cruise, car and cash _ the tantalizing prizes coveted by
sweepstakes entrants everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since January of this year, Ms. Limauge has won 21 prizes
including Nestle's candy, 5,000 frequent flyer miles, $200 in cash,
a mountain bike and bike helmet worth $700, and a CD by Kari
Wuhrer, an actress and pop singer. (Ms. Limauge had no idea who
Kari Wuhrer actually is.) She didn't win a cruise, she didn't nab
the car, and the cash prize barely covered her monthly fuel bill,
but she is thrilled because her son won a $2,000 laptop computer in
an online contest. Now, Ms. Limauge is trying to win a trip to
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm super lucky or I'm crazy,'' said Ms. Limauge,
38, of Ledyard, Conn., a full-time computer instructor and mother
of three who owns a company called The Computer Lady. ``I get to
win things I would never, never buy, or couldn't afford to buy.''
Ms. Limauge has been entering sweepstakes and contests fervently
for five years, both on and offline. Last year, she spent $1,200 on
postage entering mail-in contests. This year she's set her mail
budget at $400 because she's entering more contests free online.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Limauge's perseverance is not unusual for hobbyists who call
themselves ``sweepstakers.'' The spread of sweepstakes and contests
on the Internet is causing the ranks of sweepstakes enthusiasts to
swell, and, not surprisingly, increasing the number of dinky prizes
whose initials are more like C for crab meat or B for beef jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Reilly, webmaster at www.sweepstakesonline.com, a Web site
at which 60,000 users have chosen to register, opened his virtual
doors in 1995. Back then, there were 20 new sweepstakes to list
every week, he says. Today, hundreds of new ones go up daily.
Reilly, who says he inherited the sweepstaking hobby from his
mother, says his Web site lists between 20 and 50 new sweepstakes a
day, sponsored by both large companies and by mom-and-pop Web
sites. On any given day, Reilly's site is a portal to thousands of
contests. In late April, one could log on and link to a national
contest for a trip to Lake Tahoe. Another contest's grand prize was
a signed poster of George Strait and the Dixie Chicks, while second
prize was a George Strait CD. Other contests listed as prizes small
amounts of cash, software, and bouquets, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always plenty of bottom-feeder type sweepstakes on the
Internet,'' said Evan Neufeld, senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a new media research company. ``High-level
sweepstakes, where you can win a million dollars, is a relatively
new medium. A lot of people who design sweepstakes haven't gotten
their heads around it, but I think it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes, online or off, are games of chance in which entry
is free and the winner is chosen from a random drawing. Contests
are games that require the contestant to perform a task to enter,
such as answer trivia questions. Sweepstakes and contests are
time-honored approaches to consumer product and service marketing.
On a grand scale, these games are time-sensitive advertising
campaigns meant to prompt a specific action by consumers with the
lure of potentially enormous winnings. Sweepstakes and contests,
which require contestants to fill out forms with personal
information, have also been used by marketers to generate new leads
and mailing lists. Before the rise of the Internet, sweepstakes and
contests were all about what marketing people call ``branding.''
Online, the objectives are to bring traffic to the site and to
collect personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Webster, the president of a small auction site,
www.edeal.com, routinely runs what Neufeld might refer to as a
``bottom-feeder'' contest but which serves his marketing objective
perfectly. In April the company promised to give away a multimedia
CD player that plays downloaded music off the Internet to new
registered users. The prize cost the company $199. By mid-April,
Webster said he had toted up about 800 new registered users on the
site. For sweepstakers, the edeal contest is a golden opportunity.
The odds of winning _ 800 to 1 _ are exceptionally good. In a
contest sponsored by DeliverE.com, to win a Volkswagen Beetle, for
instance, estimated odds are 300,000 to 1. For a new Buick
promotion, the odds of winning are 1,000,000 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online, all you see is the prize. Branding is almost
irrelevant,'' said John Feldman, an associate at the Washington
D.C. office of Arent, Fox, Kitner, Plotkin and Kahn, an attorney
who specializes in sweepstakes and contest law.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting sweepstaking online last August, Herb Smith won a
Halloween costume and an eight piece Tupperware set, ``a ton of
T-shirts,'' and computer software. He also won a pair of Levi's in
the wrong size. ``Now they're having trouble getting back to me
about exchanging it,'' said Smith, 50, of Bay City, Ore., a senior
technician at a hardware factory. Smith says he enters about 150
contests every day online, going through www.webstakes.com, a Web
site with direct links to promotions, and through leads he finds
through www.sweepstakesonline.com. Smith recently won a Sony
playstation, a device he has no use for. Now, he's vowed to enter
only contests with prizes he's itching to win.

   ``Certainly there are a percentage of people who enter contests,
enter every contest. What the online environment allows you to do
is to qualify these individuals,'' says Andy Batkin, the chief
executive of Interactive Marketing, Inc, an online promotions
company, who also serves as co-chair of the Interactive Media
Council of the Promotion Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz word online is permission marketing,'' said Batkin,
who explained that the forms that contestants fill out online,
often quite detailed, enable the company running the promotion to
target that consumer with an exquisitely appropriate message once
the contest ends. The message, he says, might then be perceived as
content, rather than an ad and thus have more impact.
</P>
<P>
   Contest entrants do have some safeguards against being bombarded
with e-mail after entering a contest. At the bottom of each online
contest entry form _ at least the ones with rules written by
lawyers _ there is generally a click-on box that asks if the
consumer wants more information from the company. It's up to the
consumer to agree to receive more mail or not.
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakers say they rarely receive unwanted commercial e-mail
(``spam'') for that very reason. Unlike less diligent contestants,
they're more likely to read the rules, every last one of them,
looking for loopholes that increase their chances of winning.
Perhaps the most visible rule is the one that the casual
sweepstakes entrant might look upon dubiously. It reads: ``requires
no purchase to enter,'' and is usually at the top of most rule
pages. Who hasn't believed that buying magazine subscriptions
increases the odds of winning the Publisher's Clearinghouse
Sweepstakes, for instance?
</P>
<P>
   ``A purchase can not impact one's odds of winning,'' Feldman
wrote in an e-mail. Purchasing products to enter a contest online,
he explained, is almost a non-issue. The online playing field,
then, appears to be a more level one for the sweepstakes neophyte.
``In the online environment . . . the idea of making a big deal
about whether you bought something or not doesn't come up with
great frequency,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sweepstakers look for ways to beat the system to win.
Norman Posner, of Pikesville, Md., won his first contest in 1969.
His prize was a trip to Miami Beach for his own wedding, with Bob
Hope serving as the best man. Since then, Posner has won cars,
cruises, trips to Europe, television sets and T-shirts galore. He
says he's lucky, yet he still adds that he believes that gimmicks
help. For mail-in contests, he folds envelopes, which he says adds
surface area and makes the envelope more likely to be grabbed. He
draws rainbows across the stamps to attract attention to them. He
also visualizes himself winning or using the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Entering contests over the Internet is trickier, admits Posner,
a parole officer and professional hypnotist. Last year, to enter a
local radio promotion conducted by e-mail, Posner colored in the
background on his entry. ``I didn't know if they would receive the
color, it might be gray,'' he said. Posner's efforts, colored
background or not, won him a trip to London.
</P>
<P>
   While other sweepstaking quests for the big prizes may not be as
fruitful as Posner's, contestants say they all get a thrill when
they find a box from UPS waiting for them at their front doors.
Even if it's a cup of candy, sweepstakers are proud that they are a
rare breed: they are all lucky winners.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; SWEEPSTAKES SHORTCUTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are many sites that directly link to sweepstakes and
contest pages that enable entrants to bypass home pages of the
sponsoring companies. These Web portals are a boon to sweepstakes
hobbyists who enter as many contests as they can as quickly as
possible every day.
</P>
<P>
   But from the point of view of contest sponsors, who are probably
seeking to drive traffic to a particular Web site, ``this is less
than good,'' said Evan Neufeld of Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid fraud and spam e-mail, entrants should read the rules
carefully. If a fee is required for entry, the contest should be
based on skill. Many states have consumer protection laws that
govern the size of the prize in such a contest. Legally, all
sweepstakes in which the winner is decided by chance must be free.
Contestants should read the rules thoroughly and decide whether
they want to click on the box that says they want to be contacted
by the company after the contest.
</P>
<P>
   At one site, www.sweepstakesonline.com, the owner, Mike Reilly,
has written software, Autosweep Desktop, that automatically fills
in contest entry blanks. It is available for a trial run from the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Contest links may also be found at www.sweepthenet.com, a small
online newsletter, run by Bob Delp, that has a loyal crowd of
sweepstakes fans who like its personal approach. Links may also be
found at www.winsweeps.com.

MAKING BOOK: LOTS OF AGONY, LITTLE ECSTASY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Conn.)  (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone rang, and the writer Pat Jordan was saying that the
experience of publishing his latest book, soon to be in stores, was
rather like being smote on the head with a bong starter, and while
what is happening to him was an extreme case, to be sure, it was
leaving him wobbly in the knees and the mind. All he could do, he
said, was take it with a caress of dark humor, assuring himself
that in the end authorship isn't really as horrible as book
publishing sometimes makes it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his experience is so unusual that it is almost at the
terminus of the terrible anxieties that can be unloaded onto an
author. But such things do happen, and a writer can be put through
a roundelay in which the work in progress can bounce like a
spaldeen from editor to editor and publisher to publisher in a way
that surely saps creative vigor.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan it all started in 1975 with the publication of his
first book, ``A False Spring'' (Dodd, Mead), a critically acclaimed
tale of his four years as a minor league pitcher who couldn't
control his fastball, a story of sports and of coming of age in
America. Then followed eight other books, including a novel, and
magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pitch in a real game again, and I wanted to write
a sequel of `False,' '' although the two weren't really connected
in his mind, he said from his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   So in July 1997, he wangled a pitching turn in Connecticut for
the Waterbury Spirit in the Northeast League. He was 56 years old,
and what followed were the inevitable book offers. ``Some wanted a
straight baseball book, an old guy pitching in the minors, and some
wanted to go back to a `False Spring,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the final moment Golden Books _ I then thought they only
published children's books _ called my agent, David Vigiano, and
topped the top offer by $10,000,'' he said. He got a high
five-figure advance, and he took about eight months to write ``A
Nice Tuesday: A Memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   His editor at Golden Books Family Entertainment, the company's
adult publishing group, was Robert J. Asahina, a veteran of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, where he had worked for Richard Snyder before Snyder was
discharged and took over Golden Books. ``Bob told me I could go
wherever I wanted to go in the book, that it could be as much a
memoir as a baseball book. Baseball was the thin line that held it
together,'' Jordan said. ``I had great stories. My father was a
card shark, pretty much a grifter. When I was just about finished,
I sent it to Bob. He loved it and said he was proud to publish this
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fall of 1998. My editor is thrilled, and I'm
thrilled,'' Jordan said. His happy quivers have been few ever
since. ``All of a sudden a friend starts sending me stories from
New York about Golden Books in debt; there's an article on Snyder
that says the company's going down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now I'm starting to panic. I'm getting punchy. This goes on
for months, and every time I call Bob he said, `No problem, no
problem, don't worry about it.' I asked my agent, should we buy the
book back and sell it to someone else, and when he presented that
to Golden Books they said, `Don't worry, we love the book, and it's
coming out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It became a publishing diptych. One panel was Golden's direness;
the other said don't worry. (Golden Books is involved in bankruptcy
proceedings.) His worst fear, he said, was that Golden would go
bankrupt just as the book was coming out and it would simply
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all known fears going,'' was the way the writer
described his state of mind. He started hearing that the Golden
adult division was going to be sold, which he said was a relief,
since the buyer obviously had cash, and it was clear that Golden
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In February Asahina jumped ship and became editor in chief of
Broadway Books, a Random House division, and Jordan was assigned a
new editor, Cassandra Jones, who also had worked on his book.
Asahina said several days ago that he thought ``A Nice Tuesday'' is
``a great book that will do well.'' He continued: ``Pat is one of
those authors with a cult following.''
</P>
<P>
   In March the federal bankruptcy court approved the sale of the
adult division and its backlist and frontlist books to St. Martin's
Press, which left Jordan a bit happier but somewhat emotionally
fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob, a terrific editor who would shepherd my book and who
promised me an eight-city book selling tour, is gone, but now
Cassie is telling me not to worry because she's going to go to St.
Martin's and take my book with her,'' Jordan said. ``By then it's
been printed in hard cover'' (10,000 copies), ``with Golden Books
on its spine, but it will be distributed by St. Martin's, and
Cassie will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important moment in a book's life. A strong, engaged
editor is needed to help guide a book's marketing campaign, to stay
on top of all the events that go into publishing a book well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones arrived for her first day's work at St. Martin's on
Monday, April 26. The following afternoon she called Jordan. He
described that insensate moment: ``She's whispering on the phone
saying, `I have something important to tell you.' I ask, `Is it
good or bad?' She's been there one day, and she whispers, `I'm
leaving St. Martin's.' My only two editors have gone off.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Wallace, St. Martin's editor in chief, said he would
take over from Ms. Jones, who suddenly popped up at Regan Books, a
HarperCollins imprint, to work with Laura Yorke, who was her boss
at Golden Books and is Snyder's wife. They start their new jobs on
June 1. Asked about her one-day encampment at St. Martin's, Ms.
Jones would only say, ``It's a complicated story.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan can say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one thing after another, a series of bad accidents.
I won the card game and got the free ticket on the Titanic,'' he
said. ``This was a last-minute deal. I was ready to sign with
another publisher, and at 6 at night my agent said we can get
another $10,000 from Golden.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordan, the only way Benjamin Franklin could sell
his poems was to stand on a street corner in Philadelphia ringing a
small bell. ``That's how I feel, like I'm standing on the corner
ringing a bell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't have the sang-froid of his remark. This is the
book he has been wanting to write for 25 years. It could have been
a happier experience.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: CURBING JENNYS AND JERRYS WITHOUT CURBING
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jenny Jones case is guaranteed to try the patience of
defenders of free speech. By all the rules of First Amendment
advocacy, Warner Bros., which owns ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' should
have won its case. Instead it was ordered to pay $25 million in
damages to the family of a homosexual man, Scott Amedure, who
announced during a taping of the show that he had a crush on
another guest, his friend Jonathan T. Schmitz; a few days later,
before the show was broadcast, Schmitz, who apparently is not
homosexual, shot and killed Amedure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre affair, with its tangle of personal and corporate
responsibility. Is Schmitz somehow relieved of some portion of
guilt because he was lured into an embarrassment? Do the producers
bear some blame for bringing out his fatal feelings? As if the
situation were not complicated enough, a homosexual advocacy group
has expressed concern that by blaming the show rather than the
killer, the plaintiffs were encouraging homophobia. Not, let's
hope, grounds for a class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones gave herself and her producers an excessive benefit of
the doubt in an interview after the decision by insisting that no
one associated with the show had any responsibility for anything
untoward that its format and content might have invited or might
ever invite.
</P>
<P>
   Her practiced defense of the abysmal show, including her own
role in coaxing Amedure to reveal his graphic fantasies, was almost
enough to convict her on the spot. Yet the notion, proposed by the
plaintiff's lawyer, that a television program should have the job
of screening its guests for mental aberrations and then provide
psychiatric care is putting a slightly comical burden on the whole
shabby enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   I am left with a hunch that the jury was swept away by sympathy
for the Amedure family or just prone to socking television. In
surprising Schmitz on camera with the news of his friend's crush,
the program was being as crude as usual; that's what ``Jenny
Jones'' is all about. But finding Warner Bros. negligent for not
preventing a murder that took place three days after the taping of
a program that was never run requires a considerable leap of
judgment. And the outsize award emphatically bespeaks a disposition
to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of exhibitions like those fronted by Jenny Jones, Jerry
Springer, Rikki Lake and Montel Williams, bottom feeders with a
devotion to the bottom line, see a trend here, a spreading distaste
for downscale shows, particularly the ``ambush'' encounters that
trade on exploiting people's relationships. William J. Bennett,
critic in chief, comments: ``It's a good thing for the public to
look the entertainment companies in the eye and say, `We've had
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but it is not a good thing to crack down on speech for
far-fetched reasons. If this case demonstrates anything, it is the
need for a way for ``the public'' to express itself without using
the courts or the Congress to suppress the speech of others. A more
fitting way to make Bennett's preferred point than through
government in any form is on the commercial terms that producers
and performers cannot fail to understand: a boycott of advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   For Warner Bros. and other media powers and for the tube's
Jennys and Jerrys, the ratings of such shows, which have in fact
gone down since the killing, are all that counts. So a vote by
boycott might further reduce profits without offending the
Constitution. If the shows are allowed to expire altogether, well,
that's free speech.

 &HT;    MARKET TUMBLES, THEN RECOVERS AFTER NEWS RUBIN IS LEAVING
 &HT;    440&AMP;add. With RUBIN. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market shrugged off news Wednesday that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is resigning, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average recouping most of the 213 points it lost in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished down 25.78 points, at 11,000.37, but the
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 0.6 percent to set a
record at 1,364. The Nasdaq composite finished up 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction on Wall Street was attributed partly to the
uncertainty about economic policy under Rubin's deputy and
designated successor, Lawrence Summers. The news also provided an
excuse to sell for investors already worried about the market's
historically high level, said money manager Phillip M. Larkins of
Legacy South in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason for the early stumble may have been due to
Rubin's relationship with Wall Street. Rubin is not only a Wall
Street alumnus _ he headed the Goldman Sachs investment banking
firm _ but like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is well
respected there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin is probably the only person who could take Greenspan's
job without upsetting the market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director
of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The market's subsequent rebound came after investors had time to
reflect on three things, Larkins suggested:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin had indicated many times he would like to step down in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think people came to a conclusion that the worst
of the global turmoil is behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's been fairly well assumed that Larry Summers would
replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see him go, but the market was anticipating it,''
Larkins added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There been a lot that has happened on his watch, and most of
it has been good,'' noted economist Mark Vitner of Charlotte,
N.C.-based First Union bank. He cited the federal budget surplus
and Rubin's handling of international financial crises, first in
Mexico and then in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very protective. He was very, very determined that
financial crisis overseas would not leak back to the United
States,'' Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that Summers has been the Treasury secretary's
``right-hand man. It is not likely to represent that much of a
change.''
</P>

 &HT;    MARKET TUMBLES, THEN RECOVERS AFTER NEWS RUBIN IS LEAVING
 &HT;    440&AMP;add. With RUBIN. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market shrugged off news Wednesday that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is resigning, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average recouping most of the 213 points it lost in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished down 25.78 points, at 11,000.37, but the
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 0.6 percent to set a
record at 1,364. The Nasdaq composite finished up 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction on Wall Street was attributed partly to the
uncertainty about economic policy under Rubin's deputy and
designated successor, Lawrence Summers. The news also provided an
excuse to sell for investors already worried about the market's
historically high level, said money manager Phillip M. Larkins of
Legacy South in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason for the early stumble may have been due to
Rubin's relationship with Wall Street. Rubin is not only a Wall
Street alumnus _ he headed the Goldman Sachs investment banking
firm _ but like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is well
respected there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin is probably the only person who could take Greenspan's
job without upsetting the market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director
of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The market's subsequent rebound came after investors had time to
reflect on three things, Larkins suggested:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin had indicated many times he would like to step down in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think people came to a conclusion that the worst
of the global turmoil is behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's been fairly well assumed that Larry Summers would
replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see him go, but the market was anticipating it,''
Larkins added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There been a lot that has happened on his watch, and most of
it has been good,'' noted economist Mark Vitner of Charlotte,
N.C.-based First Union bank. He cited the federal budget surplus
and Rubin's handling of international financial crises, first in
Mexico and then in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very protective. He was very, very determined that
financial crisis overseas would not leak back to the United
States,'' Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that Summers has been the Treasury secretary's
``right-hand man. It is not likely to represent that much of a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of viewing the news negatively, as the market did
initially, a closer look might lead to a more optimistic outlook,
Vitner said, echoing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may come to the conclusion that Rubin thought the world
economy is in good enough shape that he could step off the stage,''
Vitner said.

U.S. STILL HOPES RUSSIA WILL HELP IN BALKANS DESPITE UPHEAVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is still counting on Russia to
help mediate a peace agreement with Yugoslavia despite political
upheaval in the Kremlin, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials and Russia scholars
agreed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's surprise sacking of
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would not imperil Russian efforts
to broker an end to the standoff between the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The western military alliance pressed ahead with the air
campaign against Yugoslav forces Wednesday. The onslaught began
March 24 in an effort to persuade Milosevic to accept allied
demands that ethnic Serbian forces cease murderous ethnic cleansing
of Albanian Muslims in the province of Kosovo and permit occupation
by a U.S.-led peace enforcement operation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said U.S.-Russian cooperation
is continuing despite Yeltsin's ouster of Primakov, allegedly for
failing to rescue Russia's teetering economy over the last eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials pointed to an agreement in Moscow on Wednesday
between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and former Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The officials set up joint
U.S.-Russian working groups to map implementation of a possible
peace agreement between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said U.S. and Russian
officials were working out a precise timetable for Yugoslav troop
withdrawals from Kosovo as well as the make-up of a multi-national
military force, including U.S. and Russian troops, that would enter
Kosovo to enforce any peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott scheduled more meetings Thursday with Russian officials
to review blueprints for enforcement of a peace agreement and
civilian reconstruction of the devastated province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
Talbott-Chernomyrdin talks ``were not affected by the political
developments in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added: ``We do not discern any effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bush, a Russia scholar at the independent Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said
Yeltsin's ouster of Primakov ``won't have much impact on
U.S.-Russian peace efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia seeks to bolster its international prestige by seizing
the role of mediator between the 19-nation western military
alliance and the Serbs in Yugoslavia, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia wants to be part of this; the United States wants
Russia to be part of this; so Russia will be a key player no matter
what the turmoil in Moscow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbruner, an international affairs specialist at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., predicted that the
Clinton administration would continue to rely upon Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Rubin cited U.S.-Russian negotiations
on a peace plan that are continuing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not ignoring Russia's proposals _ in
fact, we're engaged in a very concrete, substantive discussion
about Russia's proposals and NATO proposals,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the U.S. apology to China for mistakenly
bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade is expected to ease
Beijing's resistance to an eventual effort in the U.N. Security
Council to authorize an international peace keeping force to go
into Kosovo.

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin is reeling not only from Yeltsin's latest sacking of
a prime minister, but accelerating efforts by the
Communist-controlled Duma to impeach Yeltsin, the first
democratically-elected president of Russia in its 1,000 year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Steven R. Sestanovich, U.S. ambassador-at-large and adviser on
the former Soviet Union, told the House International Relations
Committee on Wednesday that Yeltsin's dismissal of Primakov
appeared to be motivated by the Russian president's effort to side
track the Russian Duma from voting on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma had planned to vote later this week on the five
impeachment charges leveled against Yeltsin, including launching
and then botching a war against Muslim separatists in the Russian
province of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But by sacking Primakov, Yeltsin can now submit his new prime
minister, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, to the Duma for
confirmation _ a process that could side track the Duma from
planned votes on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbruner said that Primakov's departure and the looming
battle over Duma confirmation of his successor only signals
deepening political instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changeover is dangerous _ let's hope it's not too
dangerous,'' Steinbruner said. ``Primakov was a moderate and his
ouster is a polarizing move. Let's see if the Russian political
system can keep itself together under these very dire pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Yeltsin's quest for Duma ratification of his new prime
minister will lock up Russia's political system in a prolonged
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian constitution permits the Russian president to
dissolve the Duma if the parliamentary body rejects the choice for
prime minister on three separate votes up to two months apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be political deadlock here,'' Bush said.
``We just can't even talk about political stability until this is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has fired three prime ministers in 14 months _
Chernomyrdin, who served six years; Sergei Kiriyenko, who served
less than four months and Primakov, who served eight months.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Yeltsin's action imperils delivery of an emergency
$4.5 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.
The injection of foreign assistance was designed to help Russia
stave off technical bankruptcy by making payments on the $17.5
billion in debt service due this year on a crippling foreign debt
of $143.9 billion _ $103 billion of it inherited from the Soviet
Union.

celebrated the Rite of Spring on March 20, the day of equal
daylight and darkness that symbolizes the witches' goal of perfect
balance. Their on-post ceremony was possible because three years
ago, Fort Hood's top brass recognized Wicca as a legitimate faith,
making it the first U.S. military base to provide space for
neo-pagan rituals. It's difficult to gauge the religion's reach in
the military. Defense Department statistics on the religious
preferences of members place Wiccans under the ``other'' category,
which represents less than 2 percent of those in the armed forces.
But Pentagon officials said they believe many Wiccans are among the
28 percent who claim no preference. (Perkes, Austin

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a matter of finding the tree in the tree,'' said William
Miller, 41, an arborist who started a tree business on New York's
Long Island 13 years ago and does what amounts to behavioral
analysis on each plant he prunes. ``When we first look at a tree,
we look for what to encourage, what to discourage,'' he said. ``We
want to accentuate forms, allow them to stand out. And we're also
manipulating light.''
</P>
<P>
   Trees are the biggest, oldest living creatures that people know
intimately, even if they spend hours at the zoo. Since trees are
mute, immobile and often slow growing, however, they sometimes seem
like green generalities even to their owners. Gardeners tend to
think about trees only when a limb crushes the roof of the Subaru,
branches turn brown in spring or when the hostas that were happy in
filtered light waste away in the inky shade. (In my case,
consciousness awoke when three black mulberries, trees only a bird
could love, sprouted their annual crop of disfiguring, yardlong
vertical whiskers, more properly called water sprouts, from old
cuts.)
</P>
<P>
   A good arborist can prevent or cure such problems. Most will
visit free of charge for an estimate and will offer a price for the
job, not by the hour. A work crew costs between $120 and $250 an
hour for four people, depending on experience and locality, said
Derek Vannice, who runs the certified arborists' programs at the
International Society of Arboriculture in Savoy, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A certified arborist is one with at least three years of
experience who is licensed at the state or national level, or both.
A consulting arborist, more highly trained and a member of the
American Society of Consulting Arborists, who gets an average of
$180 an hour, is the one to call for expert witness testimony,
difficult appraisals and written reports for insurance or legal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a certified arborist to identify species, recognize
and deal with most pests and diseases, advise what to plant,
install lightning protection on trees, remove dead specimens and
cable branches for safety and support. More earthbound tasks
include fertilizing, aerating the soil and cleaning up with a
chipper and a rake without injuring other plantings. (The last is
an end-of-the-day chore that routinely gets skimped.)
</P>
<P>
   Trees that produce yards of annual growth, like mulberries,
maples and willows, need frequent pruning in situations where
lighter shade is required. Fruit trees are pruned annually to
produce better crops. But Miller, who is not scissors-happy,
cautioned: ``If a tree is in a location to grow freely, I would
discourage pruning. But many are not. They have been pruned
incorrectly before and that's why they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best months for tree work are from heavy frost until the
leaves emerge, about now. But emergency pruning can be done at any
time of year. Some trees, the ``bleeders'' like silver and red
maples and pines, will run with sap when cut late in the season. It
isn't pretty, but it doesn't hurt the trees, either: it is all part
of a healing response to seal off the wound.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason to hire an arborist is to give trees the
optimum chance for long and handsome lives. ``The best way to save
a tree is to make it look good,'' said Miller of Bill Miller &AMP;
Associates in Sag Harbor, N.Y. His everyday working gear includes a
hard hat and a 17-year-old climber's saddle he made from fan belt
webbing. He has a tidy ponytail and works wearing a bow tie _
evidence that his attention to appearance does not stop at trees.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps an ideal shape in mind for each type of tree, a ``prior
vision,'' as he put it. ``But as tree people, we work with the
shape the tree is trying to go, which means moving that vision to
different circumstances for each tree,'' he said. ``Is there wind
off the ocean? Is it reaching for the sun? Is it a forest tree or a
tree growing in the open?''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite look, common in the paintings of the Hudson River
School, is the kind that comes from struggles with wind, drought
and sun. He calls it the ``krummholz look'' after the gnarled trees
that grow in the Alpine krummholz zone, where they are stunted by
high altitudes and low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Guerino, the assistant foreman of the climber-pruners at
the New York Botanical Garden, defined the right and wrong pruning
styles. The right way is to reduce the tree's structure over all
from the outside, a process called ``crown reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCafferty, the foreman on many of Miller's jobs, summed
up his boss' expert touch this way: ``The essence of Bill Miller is
going to the ends of the branches and cutting back _ working from
the tips in, not from the trunks out.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong way (which requires much less climbing skill) is to
work along branches from the trunk outward. This produces what in
the trade are called ``lion's tails,'' branches with no foliage
except at the tips. Long and limber, they can whip around freely in
a storm, destabilizing the tree and making it more prone to damage.
``Limbing up,'' the standard (and often necessary) practice of
removing low limbs to admit more light to the ground and increase
air circulation, can also destabilize a tree unless the arborist
takes the overall structure into account. The widest branches
should be at the base if possible.
</P>
<P>
   One common problem in this age of instant landscape is what is
called a ``root collar.'' Nursery-grown trees are mechanically
cultivated, so inches of soil are sometimes heaped over the natural
baseline of the tree, creating a false ground line: a landscaper
can unsuspectingly replant the tree too deep. When a tree is ailing
and the trunk has that telltale telephone pole look, where the
trunk does not flare out in a natural bole at the base, an arborist
thinks, ``Root collar.'' Roots may be sprouting from the trunk
below the soil line, and will eventually strangle the tree unless
it is dug out to the right level.
</P>
<P>
   It can take years for a tree to recover from a bad pruning, and
some trees never do. Bad pruning often happens when a tree stands
on or hangs over a property line and ``grudge pruning'' has
developed, for reasons either territorial or fiscal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have work done on a tree on your property line,
notify your neighbor,'' Miller advised, adding that both neighbors
have the legal right to prune back to the line.
</P>
<P>
   Miller does not encourage asking the neighbor to split costs,
feeling that it causes more problems than the tree itself. ``How
important is it to you that this person pays for the tree?'' he
asks his clients, ``and how much does the tree matter?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's always one person who cares about the tree,
and that becomes the person who is responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's your tree hanging over your neighbor's property, there
is no legal way to prevent him from advancing on it, chain saw
screaming. Only long-term tact and communication will work. Turning
Robert Frost's line on its head, one can only say, ``Good neighbors
make good branches.''

   New Mini-Notebooks With Ample Keyboards &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mini-notebooks that easily slip in and out of briefcases are
becoming increasingly attractive to business users and seemingly
irresistible to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM recently released its 2.6-pound Workpad Z50, a $999 personal
computer with an eight-inch screen and practically full-size
keyboard. Packed into a black, inch-thick case, the new Workpad is
hardly a Palm Pilot look-alike, its makers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers were telling us that their key needs away from
the desktop were relatively simple,'' said Bill Tsang, a market
manager for the International Business Machines Corp. ``Calendars,
contacts, to-do lists and e-mail are the top things people want.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsang said IBM customers had indicated that they felt
constricted by the relatively small screens of palm-size PCs, which
usually do not come with keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The new Workpad Z50, which uses the Windows CE operating system,
has a keyboard that is only 5 percent smaller than a full-size one.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading maker of PCs, the Compaq Computer Corp.,
confirmed reports that it was preparing to release a lightweight
handheld computer of its own. Like IBM's handheld, Compaq's
computer will use Windows CE and is expected to cost less than
$1,000. But Compaq is not willing to disclose much about the PC,
including its name, until it is officially introduced next month.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq officials were willing to discuss how the new handheld
will feature an embedded smart-card reader. The smart card, said
Frank Varela, product manager for Compaq's handhelds, will give
users a significantly higher level of security.

   A Souped-Up Search Engine Uses a Network to Get Results &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the perfect on-line search engine got a little
more interesting recently with the release of a test version of a
new engine called Fast (www.alltheweb.com). Created by Norwegian
academics, Fast (which stands for Fast Search and Transfer) uses a
network of small Dell computers and is easier to expand to reach
more pages than other engines that operate from huge, centralized
nerve centers. The plan is to have Fast cover 200 million Web pages
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews of the new search engine were mixed. ``Over all,
Fast adds fuel to the fire that Northern Light started earlier this
year about trying to be the biggest search engine on the Web,''
said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, based in
Salisbury, England. ``But size isn't everything, and right now, the
Fast demo site has a long way to go to be compelling to users.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said FAST needed to list only one page per site in its
search results (a process called clustering) and to eliminate
duplicate pages.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sherman, a search specialist at the Mining Co.
(www.miningco.com), a human-powered search page, said Fast could
drive other search companies to expand their databases.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., there are
currently 500 million to 600 million Web pages. Alta Vista
catalogues about 150 million pages, Northern Light about 120
million and Hotbot about 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is cautious. ``If you make the haystack bigger, the
needle is harder to find,'' he said. ``It begs the question, Is it
really important to have a Web site with Uncle Elmo's East Podunk
bowling scores?''

   Handwritten Signatures That Can Open Digital Doors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley start-up company is marketing a biometrics
system that enables you to attach your signature to digital
documents or sign your way into a secured Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The system is called Cyber-Sign, which stands for cyber
signature identifier for global network (www.cybersign.com). It
works by recording the way people provide their signatures _
recording the shape and speed of the strokes, the pen pressure and
the number of times the pen comes off the writing surface.
</P>
<P>
   To use the system, a person must first sign an input tablet
three times; the tablet is wired to a computer that is equipped
with Cyber-Sign software. The software then creates a composite
signature based on those three versions. The next time the person's
signs in, the software will compare the biometrics of the new
signature with the stored composite to verify its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   People never sign their names exactly the same way twice, so
slight variations are taken into account. But an exact copy of the
composite version _ which might be acquired illegally _ would not
be accepted. And unlike a password or PIN, a signature cannot be
forgotten or lost.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-Sign is now selling the system to companies like banks and
health-care institutions. If it takes off, the system and input pad
could become accessories for the home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be used with electronic verification forms so that
paper doesn't have to be printed anymore to authenticate
yourself,'' said Chip Mesec, the company's vice president for
product marketing. &QL;

   Steamy Computer Chips Like The Touch of Refrigeration &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rush for faster desktop computers took a big leap forward
last week when the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices demonstrated a
version of its K7 computer chip running at a cool 1 gigahertz
(1,000 MHz). The computer was able to run that fast because a
special refrigeration system built by Kryotech removed most of the
extra heat that would normally have caused the computer to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Peeples, the chief operating officer at Kryotech, said the
new version was just a demonstration of the technology that company
currently installs in IBM mainframes and special work stations with
the Compaq Alpha chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategic plan,'' Peeples said, ``is based on the plan
that the chips that Intel and AMD are designing are getting hotter
and hotter and hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips expend a small amount of electrical energy in
each calculation, which generates heat. Running a chip faster means
doing more calculations and that means more heat. Some of
Kryotech's systems simply keep the computer chip at room
temperature and others actively cool it to about minus 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Peeples said Kryotech used some of the same compressors and
coolant used in small cube-shaped refrigerators but combined them
with a proprietary design to prevent the condensation that might
short out an electrical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is keeping water, moisture and anything that would
condense at lower temperatures away from the chip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using stock parts like this means that the Kryotech cooling
system would add about $400 to $500 to the price of a desktop
system. Dropping the temperature to minus 40 degrees generally
leads to speed increases of about 25 percent to 35 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer owners bored with their desktop machines can upgrade
them by purchasing an empty computer case with the refrigeration
equipment in place. This Kryotech product, known as the Renegade,
costs about $300 and allows computer users to speed up their own
chips _ and generally voids their warranties.

CASTING FOR TROUT AND CATCHING A BIT OF ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For James Prosek _ prodigy fly-fisherman, skilled watercolorist,
author of two books on trout fishing (``Trout: An Illustrated
History'' and ``Joe and Me: An Education in Fishing and
Friendship'') while still a college undergraduate _ the idea was
not to have to take a summer job between his junior and senior
years at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it in his handsome new book, ``The Complete
Angler,'' he had already proposed to the committee for the Branford
College Class of 1960 Traveling Fellowship that he fish the
headwaters of the Tigris River in eastern Turkey, the site of Eden
in Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' The idea would be ``to glean some
great wisdom from catching trout that were descendants of those
which had witnessed man's fall from Paradise.'' But, as he writes,
the judges ``didn't bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he had a more serious proposal, to follow in the fishing
footsteps of Izaak Walton (1593-1683), author of ``The Compleat
Angler,'' that bible of fishing books that everybody has heard of
but few people _ not including Prosek at the time _ have actually
read. After all, he told the committee, Walton's book was the third
most frequently reprinted book in the English language, after the
actual Bible and the works of Shakespeare. It had gone through more
than 400 editions in 300 years, five within Walton's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Once he had won the fellowship and actually read ``The Compleat
Angler,'' he was able to make a more serious case for Walton's
literary stature. Having made his fortune as a draper (he was never
Sir Izaak, despite frequent misidentifications as such), he turned
to writing and published a life of his friend John Donne, the first
of five biographies, to the art of which he introduced primary
resources and the use of dialogue, Prosek argues.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important was Walton's little book on fishing, Prosek
insists. It was published in 1653, at the height of the English
Civil War, which had caused Walton, as an Anglican persecuted by
the Puritans, to depart London, probably for his birthplace,
Stafford, in central England near the rivers Wye and Dove. Not
merely a celebration of a simpler, pastoral life, it can be read as
an allegory whose title might as well be ``The Compleat Anglican''
and whose contents promote a return to ``primitive Christianity,''
in the sense that Jesus himself and his Apostles, Galilee fishermen
and fishers of men, were primitive.
</P>
<P>
   All this Prosek conveys quite charmingly as he cruises like a
feeding trout in a heavy nsect hatch along the various trout
streams that Walton made so famous. In a particularly instructive
scene, he argues over dinner at Oxford with a group of Jesuits
dismissive of the book that in favoring the hunting of otters over
the destruction of foxes, Walton was really saying that Puritans
were more dangerous to Anglicans than Papists. The Jesuits seemed
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosek is less successful delivering on his promise to lay bare
the religious essence of ``The Compleat Angler.'' What his version
of Walton's message comes down to is ``be humble, be simple, be
nonconfrontational,'' which though worthy seems crashingly banal.
Far more arresting is Prosek's suspicion that Walton expressed just
a little too much humility to be credible, most likely to conceal
his lowly origins and as a way of inviting praise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the theological shortcomings of Prosek's book hardly matter,
for he succeeds in more important respects, particularly in making
you feel what it's like to be on the loose with a fly rod in
England. It's odd that someone with such a shaky sense of grammar
can write so well, yet despite containing at least a dozen
syntactical howlers _ among them the most elaborate dangling
modifier since the opening of Norman Mailer's ``Harlot's Ghost'' _
the book's prose makes you see the special greenness of English
foliage and feel the gentle current of its streams.
</P>
<P>
   Networking with stream-owners he meets through his Yale and
fishing connections, he successfully imposes his American
sensibility on England's landscape and people. As he justifiably
boasts: ``I taught them a new cast(e) system, these strange people
in England; an Englishman couldn't have done what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he writes, ``This life and its accouterments wrapped me in
a blind contagion.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he catch any fish?
</P>
<P>
   Almost with every toss of his line, it would seem, although he
saves a detailed account of a battle for a 24-inch monster trout he
lured into casting range in the River Test by feeding it half a
cookie. But as vivid as the fish he lured are the people he
persuaded to let him fish their streams. Warm and generous, they
took him into their stately homes, made him part of their families
and thereby challenged his pretense to Waltonian simplicity. On
reflection, he came to understand Walton's conclusion that while
riches might cause ``weary days and restless nights,'' they also
``remove many fears and cares.''
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps why Prosek concludes that ``there is no better
portrait of England and of Walton and all his ideals, there is no
better study of Walton's philosophies in vivid motion, than a man I
spent some days with on the stream in southeast England, a Sir John
Swire of Selling, in Kent just south of London.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it must be noted that not least among the attributes that
permit Sir John to be so graciously at ease in the 1,500 acres he
owns is the fact that, as his gamekeeper says, he is perhaps the
fifth richest man in England, worth about (PS)1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled at hooking big fish as he shows himself in this
beguiling volume, Prosek proves equally adept at catching big
fishermen.

SOFTWARE WIZARD KAI KRAUSE TO LEAVE METACREATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CISSY ROSS   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Kai Krause _ self-proclaimed ``soul'' of
MetaCreations, software guru, media star and artist _ is parting
company with the once high-flying Carpinteria enterprise he helped
found.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, his odyssey the last seven years at the colorful
computer graphics software company is a reflection of how quickly
the high-tech industry changes.
</P>
<P>
   MetaCreations Corp. was among the first wave of high-tech
companies to launch a new generation of millionaire executives who,
after a lucrative public stock offering, drove snappy red Ferraris,
or in Krause's case, a white Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   They were generally younger than other CEOs and a lot more
outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   At MetaCreations, there even seemed to be a rivalry between the
two founders _ Krause, a rock star look-alike who came to the
United States from Germany originally to work in the music
industry, and John Wilczak, the former CEO who took care of the
business side.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, Krause acknowledged that Wilczak ``has
done a fantastic job ... but make no mistake: This is my company. I
am the soul of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the company has had mounting losses.
New management is now steering the company in a new direction. But
Krause, 42, said he has other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy,'' said Krause of the decision to leave the
company. ``There is no one to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he even generally agrees with the company's new strategy
to make software for Internet designers. But, he added, ``I don't
want to be the one driving it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company's chief software wizard, Krause had a golden
touch. His particular talent was designing graphics programs that
the Average Joe could use which is not just for computer nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Krause helped develop a host of products emblazoned with his
name. In addition, the company sold more expensive software
packages to professional designers. He also emerged as a big draw
at high-tech conferences, teaming up with musicians like Peter
Gabriel, before large, adoring crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would waltz in there and hold a press conference for 800
people,'' recalled Krause, during an interview at his Montecito,
Calif., estate.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, he was even more of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in my field they know me, but there people ask for
autographs,'' he said. ``In Europe I am the company.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, MetaCreations was ripe for its first initial public
offering, a champagne-popping affair that reaped $45 million,
giving it a pile of cash to buy other companies and grow.
</P>
<P>
   There were more heady days, as Krause hosted some of the first
chats on America Online, worked with physicist Stephen Hawkins on a
CD-ROM of ``Life in the Universe,'' and even had his own Absolut
Vodka ad in ``Wired'' magazine, created with his software.
</P>
<P>
   But the days that Krause could hole up in his estate with a
hand-picked team to design a software program were numbered. The
company had added locations in Santa Cruz, Calif., Princeton, N.J.,
and Ireland, and held weekly meetings via videoconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Krause also said the thrill of making updated versions of his
old products is gone.
</P>
<P>
   While some people in the company grumbled he wasn't turning out
enough new work, Krause reached out in other directions, showing
his own images in museums and meeting with European officials to
discuss how they might tap more high-tech sources.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Wilczak, the former chief executive officer,
left the company, and Gary Lauer, a former Silicon Graphics
executive, is repositioning the company as a ``creative Web''
enterprise, helping designers make eye-catching, three-dimensional
images for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company still sells Kai's consumer software tools, but the
new lineup features the company's name prominently _ MetaFlash and
MetaStream. The former is a computerized flash attachment for a
digital camera that reconstructs pictures into three-dimensional
images. The latter helps stream 3-D images over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still losing money. It lost $19.8 million in
1998, on the heels of a $8.2 million loss in 1997. In July the
company cut 35 jobs at the corporate headquarters here, leaving
about 90 workers.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, the company issued a lengthy press release about
the hiring of a new senior vice president, adding near the end of
it, a one-sentence statement that Krause was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said the company plans a more formal statement, but the
brief notice was to meet its requirements as a public company to
reveal executive changes.
</P>
<P>
   He will consult with the company for a year but he's looking
forward to other plans, such as establishing a think tank in a
castle overlooking the Rhine River.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said German officials have asked him to consider the
possibility, and while he can't talk about it now in detail, he
envisions bringing more minds together than just software
designers.
</P>
<P>
   While MetaCreations' public stock offering helped make Krause a
wealthy man, he said he was already a millionaire at 26 as a result
of establishing another software company before MetaCreations.
</P>
<P>
   Krause's total MetaCreations' compensation last year, including
salary, bonuses and other benefit payments, was $268,000, according
to the company's latest proxy statement, but a lot of his net worth
is stock ownership and options.
</P>
<P>
   Krause is the third largest MetaCreations shareholder with
489,945 shares, worth about $3.4 million. (The largest shareholder
is Bert Kolde, vice chairman of the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team and the Oregon Arena Corp.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Krause received an option to purchase 300,000 shares of
stock for the discounted price of $6.44.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to MetaCreations founders, Krause and Wilczak,
Gary Lauer, the current CEO, is low profile. He repeatedly has
declined to be interviewed since taking over in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lauer can turn around the losses at MetaCreations with
the new Internet strategy remains to be seen. The company still has
$43.8 million in capital to help bolster its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   What seems more certain, however, is that MetaCreations, without
Krause, will be less colorful.

 &HT;    No curl up and dye here: Beloved beauty salon still a favorite
spot for regulars to get a shampoo and a set
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Irene McCoy is rolling hair this morning, as she has
for 53 years. She parts Alaerisse Leitch's long, iron-gray strands
with a black comb, smooths them, pulls them tight, then twirls them
around a purple curler. She picks up the metal clip Leitch is
holding and secures the roller, the comb tucked in her hand all the
while. Then it's on to the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now these will make you hair real tight,'' Irene says, holding
up green, fuzzy curlers. ``That's why we use them on the little old
elderly ones. These,'' she holds up a purple roller, ``will make it
loose, loose, loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them likes it tight, some of them likes it loose. I
like it tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has changed many things at Mozelle's Hair Care, the
venerable beauty salon on 14th Street across from Georgia Tech. A
well-known Atlanta shop in the days when women went in for weekly
shampoos, sets and sessions under huge hair dryers _ think Aunt Bee
in ``The Andy Griffith Show'' _ the shop has aged, and so have its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it endures.
</P>
<P>
   More than five decades after the shop opened, women still come
here for regular shampoos and sets, partly because many other
salons no longer provide those services. Like 84-year-old Irene,
most of them are senior citizens who like their hair rolled tight.
Irene, an energetic woman with ash-blond hair, tan cigarette pants
and bronze pumps, tells customers that she's 62. Irene ran the shop
for decades with Inez Rikard, who eventually turned it over to
Irene. A few years ago Irene gave the business to Mozelle Collins,
who's worked there 40 years herself. Irene didn't stop doing hair,
though. She walks to work or gets a customer to drive her and opens
the shop soon after 6 a.m., four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of mornings, I feel like, God, I just can't make it, I'm
tired. But then I get up, and I feel like a young girl,'' says
Irene, the daughter of a Church of God preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has helped me. I haven't missed a day of work. I had
breast cancer, had two operations. I came straight back to work.
I've never laid out of work a day, have I?'' she says, looking over
at three women waiting their turn at the shampoo sink. They nod
their heads in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never a day I don't come up the street praising
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The shop is Irene's therapy, Mozelle says. The customers agree
with that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go to any cafeteria now and a lot of the elderly women
will come up and hug my neck and say `Irene, I love you,' '' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She's shampooing Dorothy Moore of Atlanta, a customer for four
decades, talking up a storm while running her fingers vigorously
through the scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful with the little elderly ones,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The customers let this talk of elderly women go only so far.
Every time Irene brings up their ages, they fire right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm younger than you. I'm 81,'' Moore says. ``You're 84.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder to find places that do hair the way they do
it here, a time-consuming process of shampooing, rolling up,
sitting under a stationary dryer and combing out. Few people want
to spend close to two hours every week at a beauty salon; few
operators are willing to put the time into that kind of style when
they could do highlights and a blow-dry in the same amount of time
_ 90 minutes _ for at least triple the money. At Mozelle's, a
shampoo and set runs $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have people lined out the door,'' says Mozelle, a
trim woman in jeans with close-cropped hair. She's a master at
styling and teasing, her customers say. Even with a phone glued to
her ear, she rapidly combs out wet hair and twirls it into a
roller.
</P>
<P>
   Mozelle, 58, started here as an 18-year-old shampoo girl working
her way through business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be 14 or 16 of us working on top of each
other,'' Mozelle says. ``Business is dropping because a lot of my
customers have died or moved to nursing homes. I work four days a
week now. Used to work six.''
</P>
<P>
   On the three days a week she's not at her salon, Mozelle styles
hair at a nursing home. She's thinking of going back to school to
study computers, so she can get a job that doesn't keep her on her
feet all day.
</P>
<P>
   She's not sure what she would do with the shop. Maybe, like
Irene did, she will pass it on to someone else. Maybe by then,
there will be another stylist working at the salon who can take it
over.
</P>
<P>
   Irene reminisces about how beautiful the shop was when she gave
it to Mozelle, and what a nice big sign _ Irene McCoy's, it said _
hung outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irene, that sign was ate up with rust,'' Mozelle says.
</P>
<P>
   The shop shows the effects of time, too. One air-conditioning
unit is missing its grille, and the white laminate is cracking on
some cabinets. Plastic covers protect the backs of blue-and-green
floral chairs. A couple of chairs have the poles for stationary
dryers sticking out of their backs, but the hoods are no longer
there. The Coke machine stocks glass bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Carters, Maddoxes and a Talmadge used to come to the shop, Irene
says. Lester Maddox built a ramp so he could wheel in his wife, the
late Virginia Maddox, a customer for at least 50 years. He'd get
her a bottle of Coke to sip while she sat under the hair dryer she
liked best.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of the customers drink Diet Cokes while they sit
under the enveloping dryers, in the front of the store by the big
window facing 14th Street. One reads the paper, one looks out at
the 18-wheelers stopped at a traffic light and another rests, her
eyes shut.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the salon, where the dyeing and curling goes on,
it's livelier. Customers joke with Mozelle, who's divorced, about
finding a man. (Irene's a widow. Her husband, James, worked at the
salon too.)
</P>
<P>
   Irene and Mozelle keep bantering about their relationship,
drawing smiles from the customers. ``We just like an old married
couple,'' Mozelle says as she applies chestnut dye to a woman's
hair. ``One of us start a sentence, the other finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene on Mozelle: ``I get along with her good, and I love her,
but I don't know if it goes the other way or not. She's precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene fired Mozelle once for spending half a day at the Varsity
drive-in. But there were still customers in the shop when Mozelle
got back, and Irene told her she could finish out the rest of the
day. So much for being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both just mean as the devil,'' Mozelle says. ``We're
trying to outdo each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The two of them never stop working. Irene laments how few people
are there this morning, but the six customers keep the two stylists
busy. Mozelle moves swiftly from woman to woman, dyeing hair here,
trimming there, often balancing the phone on her shoulder. Irene
shampoos and works with the rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Irene is removing curlers from Cecelia Saul's hair. It's
pulling, and Saul, a 70-something from Sandy Springs, winces.
Florence Gagliardi, 66, of Dunwoody, removes her own curlers, then
stands up and gently works the rest out of Saul's hair.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning's first group of customers finishes up, a new set
waits by the window. Louise Scheurer, 84, of Buckhead wants her
hair done before a doctor's appointment that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Mozelle, no matter how busy she gets, she
never slights anybody,'' Scheurer says. ``I've been coming here 30
or 40 years, I don't know how long. Irene's business never goes
down, does it?''

HAS ART; RUNS WITH TO GO BOX  
 
  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AVALON _ These days, if time, budget and inclination permit, a
traveler can readily examine the riches of the montane cloud
forests of Madidi National Park in Bolivia. Or the pristine coral
reefs of Indonesia's Togean Islands. Or the hundreds of bird
species in the Kakum Canopy of the west African nation of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   It's a growth aspect of the travel industry, with is own New
Age-sounding name: ecotourism. Obviously, the prospect of seeing
something unique in the natural world has a powerful lure.
</P>
<P>
   Indulging this curiosity, however, doesn't necessarily have to
require a trip halfway around the globe, or passage on a bush plane
or sampan. It's close to Los Angeles. Very close. Achieving it is
as simple as booking a boat ride to Catalina Island and venturing
into the island's rugged interior in a jeep or with a sturdy pair
of hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
   Eight plant species _ including two trees _ make up a list of
Catalina Island endemics. That means they exist nowhere else in the
world but here, on this 76-square-mile chunk of land that _ despite
what the song would have us believe _ pokes out of the Pacific
Ocean less than 20 miles off L.A.'s shore.
</P>
<P>
   Saving and regenerating them after the ravages of overgrazing in
the last century has been an exhaustive chore. But the effort is
yielding dividends, and the plants are there for the inquisitive
traveler to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going wonderfully,'' said Dr. Bill Bushing, who
oversees the island's ecological recovery as an executive for the
Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. ``We're achieving some of the
goals we set as early as the '50s. ... We're finding some plants
that hadn't been seen in some cases since the 1800s.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging developments is the robust health of
the Catalina ironwood, which has begun to flourish along the
northeast spine of Catalina's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here in the '60s, I thought it was dying out,''
Bushing said. ``There was no seed reproduction; there had been only
one seedling noted in 40 years. Now we're seeing seedlings in 18 of
the groves.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironwood _ and other endemics like the Catalina mahogany and
such shrubs as the yerba santa, Catalina live-forever and Catalina
manzanita _ are out there for examination, sometimes even
clustering close to the few primitive roads that cut across the
island. Finding them is simply a matter of tearing away from the
picturesque cove and village of Avalon, which seem to hold most
island visitors as though interlaced with underground people
magnets.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to explore on foot. A visitor who hikes out of
Avalon on the town's only exit road, toward the island's airport,
will reach the east slope of Black Jack Mountain after about seven
miles. The ironwood is making a strong comeback here. The Propst
Grove, along the left side of the road, is marked with a sign. Two
other groves lie down a side road on the way to Echo Lake.
</P>
<P>
   As for all other walks in the island's interior, a permit is
required, but the conservancy issues them at no charge at its
Avalon office (125 Claressa Ave.), which is open from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. daily. Phone: (310) 510-2595.
</P>
<P>
   Car? Bike? They are either limited or expensive alternatives.
There are no car rentals on Catalina, which is keeping its interior
largely unimproved; only residents are permitted to have vehicles.
And because of liability concerns, bike permits are issued only on
an annual basis _ at a cost of $50 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   For the hikers, a 14-mile round trip along a road that is often
abuzz with sightseeing tour vans may not seem particularly
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to book one of the jeep eco-tours operated by
the conservancy. A two-hour excursion to the interior, leaving
Avalon at 10 a.m. daily, costs $65 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Half- and full-day tours are priced more steeply _ $495 and
$795, respectively, for groups of up to six people _ but these
tours have the advantage of being custom-tailored to the group's
wishes. Want to go see the grove of Catalina mahogany that lies
along Bulrush Canyon Trail in the island's southwestern wilds? The
guide can get you there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are most interested in animals. They want to see
buffalo,'' one of the guides, Bruce Poncel, said, referring to the
300 or so bison that roam the island. (Fourteen of the beasts were
brought over for the filming of a movie in 1924; the herd has since
grown and made itself quite comfortable here.)
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of endemic mammals on Catalina, including
the Island fox and Beechey ground squirrel, but sightings are
infrequent. The animals don't stand in one spot, as the trees do.
</P>
<P>
   Poncel, who brings uncommonly stellar credentials to the role of
tour guide _ he holds two degrees in earth science, including a
master's from California State University, Long Beach _ cheerfully
indulges the curiosity most of his guests have about the bison.
Then he gently talks up Catalina's unique plant world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep an eye on the rear-view mirror,'' he said with a
chuckle. ``If I see them starting to nod off, then I stop talking
about it. But a lot of people get interested in plants, especially
when you tell them they're natural only to this island.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another option is the conservancy's shuttle to the
airport. By prearrangement, the driver can drop you off in the
vicinity of Black Jack junction and collect you later in the day on
a return run to Avalon. The shuttle, which costs $15 round trip,
runs irregularly, and all the details of such an arrangement must
be worked out in advance by calling (310) 510-0143.
</P>
<P>
   If Avalon's relentless hold doesn't even permit that degree of
exploration, hope is not lost for dabbling in Catalina's unique
plant world. Deep in the canyon behind the town is the Wrigley
Memorial and Botanical Garden. The Catalina endemics _ along with
other plants native to California (some of them endemic to the
state's offshore southern islands) _ are nurtured and displayed
here.
</P>
<P>
   At the extreme rear of the gardens, just to the right of the
memorial, a trail climbs to the mountain ridge that overlooks
Avalon and its harbor. One way to accomplish some variety of
transit is to rent a bicycle in Avalon, pedal the 1.2 miles uphill
to the botanical gardens, then undertake a four-mile loop hike
along the Wrigley Memorial Road trail and back through Hermit
Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's Bikes, near the boat dock, is the best rental option.
The U-Drive shop on Crescent Avenue, without explanation, refused
to rent a customer a one-speed bike for the pumping climb to the
gardens. Brown's doesn't possess the same Big Brother instinct. The
people there will let you rent anything. They also have an
intermediate option _ a six-speed bike with gooseneck handlebars
that enables a baby boomer to restore a link to his childhood. The
bike rents for $15 a day ($6 per hour) and handles the hill through
the canyon quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   They tell you not to worry about locking the bike in the rack at
the botanical gardens. Just leave it there; it will be waiting when
you return from your visit. That reflects Avalon's pugnacious
determination to distance itself from its urban cousin on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a bike in Avalon is a true delight. There are few cars _
although most of the town's gas-powered golf carts are as noisy as
lawn mowers on steroids and seem to be driven with reckless abandon
by island residents.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is none of the carefully regulated bike culture that
prevails in Southern California. Here, you don't have to don
stretchy, brightly colored bicyclist attire that screams with
Italian brand names. You don't have to wear funny little shoes
either.
</P>
<P>
   People pedal into the canyon wearing flip-flops, swimsuits,
T-shirts, no shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $3 at the botanical gardens, and after climbing the
slope through a substantial region of cactuses and succulents, the
footpath passes through the area of the Catalina endemics.
</P>
<P>
   The Catalina mahogany, which is on the federal
endangered-species list, was found to be an unimpressive tree _
low, scraggly, weedy. It's the kind of thing you'd be tempted to
rip out and replace with a Valencia orange if it suddenly sprang up
behind your garage.
</P>
<P>
   The Catalina ironwood, on the other hand, is a beauty _ a tall,
shady evergreen with long, bright-green leaves and stringy, reddish
bark. In prehistoric times, it flourished throughout the Western
states, according to Bushing, but has long since died out
everywhere but on this tiny island.
</P>
<P>
   On the trail out the back of the gardens, it's a good idea to
keep the botanical gardens brochure handy. It will help in
identifying another island endemic, the Catalina live-forever, an
aloelike succulent that can sometimes be spotted along the path.
(Just wondering: If that species ever becomes endangered on this
island, will they have to change its name?)
</P>
<P>
   The trail is really a fire road, obviously designed more for a
jeep's low gear than a human's legs, but the views of the distant
harbor are spectacular at several junctures. Little shade is
provided by the California scrub oaks along the way, however, and
it is imperative _ particularly as the summer months approach _ to
carry plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   It is the hope of the scientists at the conservancy that walkers
along this path or another island trail might someday be able to
witness a botanical miracle: the return of Trask's monkeyflower. In
the 1800s, it was found only on this island, but it hasn't been
spotted since 1901 and is now considered extinct _ the only
Catalina endemic that did not survive to the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a wonder that other plants did not expire with it.
Catalina, as with the other small islands off the Southern
California coast, was deemed a prime ranching site when the Mexican
government handed out land grants in the middle 1800s. Think about
it: It was a perfect locale at that time, since the surrounding
ocean precluded the need for fences, and there were no large
predators like the black bear and mountain lion that roamed the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters quickly moved in, and by the 1860s, there were an
estimated 20,000 sheep on the island _ ravenously nibbling at every
green sprig in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy, which shares ownership of most of the island
with the Santa Catalina Island Co., has systematically deported as
many feral animals as possible and has also fenced off delicate
areas in need of protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing to see the plants that are coming back,'' said
Bushing, ``and we're hoping there are enough of these species that
`disappeared,' that once the pressure is off of them, they will
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   If such an event were to occur, the travel industry's burgeoning
new wave of ecotourists would likely take note _ and come crashing
onto the shores of Catalina Island. &QL;

   GETTING THERE: The boat is the most popular mode of
transportation to Catalina Island, and Catalina Express operates
the quickest ones. The boats, which run frequently from both San
Pedro and Long Beach, reach the island in about an hour.Round-trip
fares are $38 for adults, with lower fares for seniors and
children. Information and reservations: (800) 805-9201. Catalina
Cruises operates larger, slower boats that reach the island from
Long Beach in just under two hours. Fares are $25 round trip for
adults, with lower fares for children. Information and
reservations: (800) 228-2546. Parking at the harbors ranges from $6
to $9 daily. If you're in a tearing rush, Island Express Helicopter
Service will whisk you from the San Pedro or Long Beach harbors to
the island in a promised 14 minutes _ at a cost of $66 one way,
$121 round trip. Information: (310) 510-2525.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: There are numerous options in Avalon, and the Catalina
Island Visitors Bureau tracks availability and rates: (310)
510-1520.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURING INLAND: The Santa Catalina Island Conservancy oversees
not only the island's ecological balance but also all tourist
trekking to the interior. Its office at 125 Claressa Ave. in Avalon
is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Phone: (310) 510-2595. Daily
hiking permits are available free at the conservancy office.
Bicycling permits are issued only on an annual basis, at a cost of
$50. Jeep Eco-Tours, operated by the conservancy, offers two-hour
($65), half-day ($495) and full-day ($795) excursions; the cost is
per charter, and the vehicles will accommodate up to six. Another
option is to ride a conservancy-operated airport shuttle from
Avalon to the vicinity of Black Jack Mountain, get dropped off, and
make arrangements for a later pickup for the ride back. The shuttle
costs $15 round trip. Information: (310) 510-0143.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSER TO HOME: An option in Avalon is to rent a bike, ride up
the canyon to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens, and then
hike to the ridge beyond. Admission to the gardens is $3 per
person. The best rental option for a bike is Brown's Bikes, just a
few steps from the boat dock. A six-speed bike _ fairly well-suited
for the climb to the gardens _ rents for $6 an hour, $15 for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE WEB: A comprehensive tourism site, www.catalina.com,
offers information on transportation, tours, activities, lodging
and dining. The convervancy also maintains a site,
www.catalinaconservancy.org, which is a bit more challenging to
negotiate. It exists more for scholarly purposes than tourist ones,
but persistent Web surfers will find some fascinating information
hidden amid the scientific jargon.

ASHES OF THREE CHINESE EMBASSY VICTIMS ARRIVE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The ashes of the three Chinese killed by NATO bombs in
Belgrade returned to China on Wednesday, carried off the airplane
by relatives who were wearing white flowers of mourning in a sad
procession shown repeatedly on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Popular anger over the bombing of the Chinese Embassy on Friday
was laced with grief. The authorities, seeking to re-channel the
outrage of the last four days, halted the raucous demonstrations
that had immobilized the American Embassy and urged students and
others to concentrate on their own work to help make China
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the streets around the embassy were quiet,
sealed off by hundreds of police officers. Ambassador James Sasser
emerged from the American Embassy for the first time since
Saturday. Sasser and several staff members walked out the front
door, picking their way through shards of glass and heaps of
plastic bottles and chunks of concrete that protesters had heaved
against the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to give our Chinese friends a day of grief,
and then we can move on and discuss with them how to mend this
situation,'' Sasser said before visiting the families of American
diplomats who have remained all week in nearby foreigners'
compounds. Sasser later returned to work and then left to sleep
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, a skeletal staff will be working in
the embassy and consulate buildings, mainly to clean up. The
embassy remains officially closed.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy flags were hung at half-staff in respect for the
dead. The gesture was shown on Chinese television, another sign
that the authorities were hoping to cool passions as they sought
deeper remorse and explanations from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China flew all flags at half-staff as the entire political
leadership paid homage to the dead, who are described as heroes and
martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the bombing, which the United States says was caused
by a misidentification of the embassy building, were Shao Yunhuan,
47, a reporter for the official New China News Agency; Xu Xinghu,
31, a reporter for The Guangming Daily newspaper; and Xu's wife,
Zhu Ying, 27, an art director for the paper's advertising
department.
</P>
<P>
   Also brought home on the plane Wednesday were six seriously
wounded people and 20 who were sleeping in the embassy when it was
hit by at least three bombs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shao's 19-year-old son carried her ashes. Her husband, a
diplomat, was one of the severely wounded taken off in a stretcher.
Ms. Zhu's father carried two boxes of ashes, those of his daughter
and of his son-in-law, past weeping relatives, politicians and
hundreds of representatives of social groups.
</P>
<P>
   The procession was officially met by Vice President Hu Jintao,
who was shown on television greeting a bandaged man by saying, ``On
behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party I welcome
you home and offer you sincere condolences.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, private memorial services were held at The
Guangming Daily and at the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The television news Wednesday night showed President Jiang
Zemin, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Li Peng, who ranks second in
the Communist Party and heads the parliament, as well as three
other top party leaders, visiting the services before they began,
shaking hands with grieving relatives. Alone among the leaders, the
usually unflappable Zhu was visibly sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Wednesday there was no announcement of any larger
public service, an event that some feared might set off demands for
additional demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese and American governments have barely begun to assess
how far the bombing, and the convulsion of anti-Americanism here,
have damaged relations.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the political climate in Washington, China may be
badly mistaken if it tries to use guilt over the bombing to extract
deep concessions on vital issues. Chinese leaders have made it
clear that they still seek American trade, investment and
technology and that they still want to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the bombing, powerful industries here had
attacked the prime minister for making too many market-opening
concessions in negotiations with Washington over the trade
organization, putting those talks under a cloud. China's leaders
surely know that after the outburst this week Congress will be in
no mood to grant special economic favors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it ever been likely that the Clinton administration
could give China the absolute pledge that it seeks that Taiwan will
not be included in a hypothetical missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, for their part, have suspended talks on arms
proliferation and other issues that are of deep concern to the
United States, and it is unclear what it will take to get them back
to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two countries have many shared economic interests,
and neither wants to see a costly new Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the embassy Wednesday morning, Sasser said he hoped that
``we'll move back in the direction of trying to establish a
productive and stable relationship between our two countries.''

CENTRISTS TAKE A BATTERING IN PRE-ELECTION POLLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the hard-driving politics of Israel, if you stand
in the middle of the road, you just get run over.
</P>
<P>
   This political axiom appears to be holding true once again as
Israel heads into the final days of a campaign for prime minister,
and the newly formed Center Party has dropped precipitously in
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago when the Center Party announced it would be
headed by rising star Yitzhak Mordechai, the choice of was heralded
with fanfare and great promise.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai was dramatically fired by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in January after standing up to Netanyahu on what
Mordechai saw as strategic blunders in the peace process. Then he
took the reins of the new center party.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some of Israel's heaviest hitters, disillusioned
conservatives and disaffected liberals, were creating a unique
middle ground to save the peace process and to heal Israel's deep
ethnic divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, an immigrant from Kurdistan, was seen as an ethnic
outsider who could bring into the fold the ``Sephardic,'' or
Eastern, Jews, deeply alienated by what they saw as an elitist,
liberal Labor Party. This center party, analysts said, was
different than others that had failed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai and his Center Party list of candidates for parliament
have plummeted in recent polls to only 7 percent. This is down from
February polls that said Mordechai would win by 2 percent in a
direct race between him and Netanyahu. Mordechai's campaign slogan,
now embarassingly boastful, is ``Only Mordechai Can Win Big.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai has so far stubornly clung to a promise that he would
stay in the race until the end. But members of his own party have
urged him to throw his support behind Labor Party candidate Ehud
Barak, a move which some analysts say could clinch a victory over
Netanyahu for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai is expected to deliver a major policy speech in
Jerusalem Thursday in which some observers believe he may decide to
pull out of the race in the interest of defeating Netanyahu and
salvaging important parliamentary and Cabinet posts for the Center
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 17 general election, voters decide among the five
candidates for prime minister. Barak is beating Netanyahu by as
much as 9 percent, according to polls released Wednesday. But Barak
is not expected to win the required absolute majority and so the
two leading contenders, almost certainly Barak and Netanyahu, will
then compete in a runoff June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Ma'ariv Wednesday urged Mordechai to drop out,
arguing that if he does so Barak can take the election in the first
round. The center is now watching polls that show Barak winning in
the second round, but as many analysts said that is a risky game.
Netanyahu is a consummate survivor and could come back strong in
the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, the center has already begun to fracture.
The Center Party's founder, Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo, has been
quoted in newspapers as sniping at Mordechai for letting his ego
get in the way of a potential Barak victory. And the third pillar
of the center, the popular and dashing former general and Netanyahu
chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, has publicly stood by
Mordechai but is privately applying pressure to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers said this kind of splitting along the seams
was true of a long list of center parties dating back to the 1955
party known as RAFI, a Hebrew acronym for Workers of Israel,
through to the 1977 DASH party, or Democratic Movement for Change,
and straight through to the 1996 Third Way Party. All of them began
with some of Israel's best and brightest politicians, but fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The centrifugal force of Israeli politics is so strong that
the center can't hold,'' said David Clayman, Jerusalem
representative of the American Jewish Congress and a longtime
political observer.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering DASH from 1977, he said, ``I was a true believer, a
fighter against the corrupt Labor Party and the far right Likud.
They won 16 seats, but it fell apart within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you couldn't take this center party seriously if
you've been around for a long time. They began imploding this week,
and that seemed inevitable right from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that the trio of Mordechai, Milo, and
Shahak have vastly different visions on the two central issues: the
peace process and Israel's religious-secular divide.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University and
an activist in the centrist Third Way party in 1996, said, ``Roni
Milo wanted a centrist party to put forth his antireligious views.
But in same party you have Mordechai kissing the conservative
rabbis. So which is it? Will they be about secular Tel Aviv culture
or kissing rabbis? They never made up their mind, and that is why
they fell apart.''

ACTING PRIME MINISTER KNOWN AS POLITICALLY SAVVY YELTSIN LOYALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-POLITICS, RUSSIA-ASSESS, RUSSIA-DIPLO) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Sergei Vadimovich Stepashin, President Boris Yeltsin's
fourth choice as prime minister in less than a year, is best known
for loyalty to his boss. But that description does not do him
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin has made an entire career in the Russian internal
security apparatus. At one point or another, he has run Yeltsin's
counterintelligence bureau, directed the Federal Security Service,
which was the domestic successor to the KGB, and helped carry out
the president's disastrous war against rebels in the Chechnya
region of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he worked simultaneously as deputy prime minister
and interior minister, and Yeltsin handed him three highly
sensitive political tasks: curbing extremism, attacking government
corruption and policing the next national elections for Parliament
and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Given that employment history, it is perhaps surprising that
Stepashin is given good marks by many liberal, pro-democracy
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a reasonable, very cautious politician, and, I must say,
a literate politician,'' said Otto Latsis, a veteran political
commentator for the newspaper Novy Izvestia. ``Without a doubt,
he's also a democratic politician, and this is how he's made his
career _ by being one of the democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin has so far kept relatively clean hands in some
legendarily dirty businesses. Some democrats questioned his
involvement with the early stages of the Chechen War. But others
give him points for resigning from the Federal Security Service and
Yeltsin's Security Council in 1995 after Chechen rebels stunned the
government by raiding a Russian town outside Chechnya and taking
scores of hostages at a hospital. At the same time, Stepashin won
credit for directing the Russian forces that eventually freed the
hostages after negotiations with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stepashin's Interior Ministry has skated at the edge
of a nasty battle between Yeltsin and the nation's prosecutor
general, Yuri Skuratov, who is investigating corruption in
Yeltsin's inner circle. Stepashin has supported Yeltsin's efforts
to dismiss Skuratov, and Skuratov has complained that state
security agencies under Stepashin's control have been less than
helpful in his inquiry. But Skuratov has stopped short of accusing
the ministry of directly interfering in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a young-looking 47, was born on the Soviet Union's
Pacific coast in 1952. At age 21, he graduated from an Interior
Ministry military-political school, then lectured at the school and
worked in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Yeltsin appointed him chief of security for the St.
Petersburg region and then deputy security minister of Russia. By
1994 he was head of Russian counterintelligence and director of the
Federal Security Service. Yeltsin named him justice minister in
1997, and interior minister in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin speaks English and holds a law degree. He is married
and has one child.

BROWN SCORED THE REAL ROUNDHOUSE RIGHTS IN GAME 2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Like a rose in a minefield, Curtis Brown's performance
was overshadowed by the gore surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   But were it not for his handiwork _ the subtle jabs between
roundhouses _ the Sabres would not have won Sunday's slugfest in
Boston, 3-1, and hence, would not have returned to Marine Midland
Arena for Wednesday night's game locked in a 1-1 tie with the
Bruins in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal
skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's first-period assist and second-period goal, both
artistic counterpoints amid the mayhem, staked Buffalo to a 2-0
lead and for all intents and purposes decked the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:51 into the game, he helped provide Buffalo with crucial
momentum when he outfought P.J. Axelsson for the puck behind the
Boston net and sent a pass into the slot that glanced off goalie
Byron Dafoe's stick and out to center Michael Peca, who converted a
fadeaway wrist shot to the far side.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our strengths is going down deep, setting up our goals
off the forecheck as opposed to the rush,'' said Brown. ``This was
one of those plays. I just threw it out to Pecks, who did a real
good job of getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5:57 of the second period came the coup de grace. Taking an
Alexei Zhitnik feed at the Boston goal line to the right of the net
during a Buffalo five-on-three, Brown deftly threaded the puck
through a pinhole opening between the pads of Dafoe, who was
preoccupied with the traffic on the other side of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking the pass away across the front of the net,''
said Brown. ``He did a good job of deterring the pass, and I
couldn't get it across. I saw a little opening in his pads. The
puck had to have eyes to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's playoff performance _ which began with the goal that won
the first-round opener and triggered Buffalo's four-game sweep of
favored Ottawa _ may be an eye-opener to the uninitiated. But it's
comfortingly familiar to coach Lindy Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving us in the playoffs basically what he's been giving
us all year,'' said Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, the 23-year-old center-left wing gave the
Sabres 16 goals. That total would have been far gaudier if Brown
hadn't endured a 23-game drought at the end of the season. With
40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan sidelined by an ankle injury since
Game 3 against the Senators, it was imperative that Brown shed his
slump to help provide the offense by committee Ruff is relying on
to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had different guys step up,'' said Ruff. ``He's one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   During his extended exile in the scoring desert, Brown did not
despair, partly because he saw encouraging signs, partly because
that's his newfound outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never did bother me,'' he said. ``Goal scoring is finicky.
I counted it up and I hit six posts during that streak. If all
those had gone in, I'd have been the hottest guy in the league. I
was still getting the chances. If I wasn't getting the chances,
then I'd be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't consider that attitude a rationalization; it is, in
fact, his revised blueprint for life. Brown has focused on
accentuating the positive for the past year and a half, since he
underwent a spiritual . . . well, you couldn't really call it a
rebirth or awakening. Perhaps realization would be the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the Lord and the Bible,'' he said. ``If you
believe in those things, you have to go that way. Growing up, I
always believed. But if you believe, you have to take that special
leap. I wasn't a strong Christian. I wasn't sure how to be. I had
to get the right information.''
</P>
<P>
   It was provided by former Bruins goalie John Blue, an old friend
of Brown's who works with the ministry Champions. Brown asked the
questions; Blue provided the answers. It was a gradual process,
Brown emphasizes. There was no precipitating trauma, no epiphany.
And it wasn't that Brown was a confirmed hedonist before he hooked
up with Blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around,'' said Brown, ``from the world's eyes, I
wasn't doing anything wrong. What some people don't understand is
that you don't have to hit rock bottom'' before making a religious
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   His latent awareness hasn't transformed Brown on the ice, though
Ruff said, tongue-in-cheek, ``Maybe he's taken his play to a higher
level.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, no overhaul was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to go out and play hard,'' said Brown. ``That's
what I've always done. You just have to have your eyes focused on
the right thing. I'm probably more focused now because people are
waiting for you to step out of line. I'm not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   He was close enough in Game 2.

 &HT;    Countdown to `Menace:' Fans snap up tickets
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Yoda once instructed, ``Do. Or do not. There is no
try.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Michael Clayton and Susan Cauthen's credo, too, as
tickets for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' sold at a
light-speed clip Wednesday at more than a dozen metro Atlanta movie
megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, 29, and Cauthen, 28, both of Tallapoosa, were first in
line at General Cinemas' Parkway Pointe to snare 24 tickets to the
first showing of ``Phantom Menace'' on opening day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the fever and I'm impatient,'' said Clayton, who'd
arrived with Cauthen at Parkway Pointe at 11 p.m. Tuesday and
camped out on a makeshift sofa _ an opened sleeping bag draped over
two folding beach chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Theater managers reported a steady stream of walk-up buyers,
many grabbing the limit of 12 tickets each. Some 50 minutes into
the sale, Parkway Pointe general manager Larry Smith estimated up
to 500 tickets had been sold at his theater to walk-up customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far beyond our expectations,'' Smith said. ``There are
now 100 people still out there and we expect them to continue
trickling in all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The line of walk-up buyers outside AMC's Colonial 18 in
Lawrenceville (GA.) snaked around the building about 9 a.m., some
six hours before the start of sales. In less than two hours of
ticket sales by walk-up and phone, Colonial had sold out several of
its first-day evening shows and the midnight debut, said AMC
spokesman Joe Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines of a couple hundred ticket buyers were also seen at
AMC's North DeKalb Mall 16 and at United Artists Perimeter Pointe.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, roughly 200 fans had lined up outside Parkway
Pointe by 3 p.m. They had spent hours playing ``Star Wars'' Trivial
Pursuit and Monopoly. Some who'd waited all night had concocted a
sing-song chant: ``We've been chain-smoking since 1 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 theaters _ less than half of those that will
ultimately play ``Phantom Menace'' on about 60 screens _ began
ticket sales Wednesday. The other theaters will start sales either
Monday or opening day.

YOUNGSTOWN NAMES UMASS ASSISTANT HEAD COACH

<P>
   University of Massachusetts men's basketball assistant coach
John Robic was named head coach at Youngstown State Tuesday,
becoming the fourth assistant under former UMass mentor John
Calipari to be named a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Robic, 35, who agreed to a four-year deal at Youngstown,
replaces Dan Peters, who left for an assistant's job at Cincinnati.
Robic had been an assistant at UMass for 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Robic is the last of the three assistants from the Minutemen's
first NCAA tournament team under Calipari (1991-92) to become a
head coach. The others were Bill Bayno, now head coach at
Nevada-Las Vegas, and current UMass head coach Bruiser Flint.
Wright State coach Ed Schilling was a UMass assistant during the
1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right time for me to do this,'' said Robic, a Western
Pennsylvania native. ``I didn't set a timetable for myself. It's
the first job I ever applied for and I like the fit. I still have
ties in Pittsburgh and Ohio, so I like the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what everybody says, there's a good nucleus of players
coming back. The Mid-Continent Conference gets one team in the NCAA
tournament every year, so we will build all our momentum for the
conference tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Robic said he will enter the program with two scholarships to
give. There is talk that former Minuteman guard Rafael Cruz, who
decided to leave UMass but has not signed on with another program,
might join Robic. ``I have to be careful about how I speak about
him,'' said Robic. ``I'd like to (sign Cruz). The decision is up to
him, but I think it would be a good fit.''

LAWMAKERS URGE PRESIDENT TO HIRE MORE BORDER AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional lawmakers, led by Texas Reps. Lamar
Smith, a Republican, and Sylvestre Reyes, a Democrat, attacked
President Clinton Wednesday for failing to comply with a law
requiring him to achieve a net gain of 1,000 Border Patrol agents
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter signed by 47 other House members and 12 senators _
including Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
and Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California _
Smith and Reyes accused the president of surrendering to
traffickers of illegal drugs and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-border drug smuggling and alien smuggling continue to
cost uncounted lives and damages each year ... yet there is no
indication that your border strategy recognizes the emergency
situation,'' Smith and Reyes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing the letter, Rep. Henry Bonilla,
R-Texas, whose district has the longest border in the country with
Mexico, said Congress is ``tired of excuses from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed and the president signed the law
mandating the net addition of 1,000 new Border Patrol agents each
year through 2001. The idea was to double the force from 5,000 to
10,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Border Patrol Chief Gus de la Vina told a Senate
immigration subcommittee that while his agency will hire 1,000 to
1,200 Border Patrol conscripts during this fiscal year, the net
addition to the force will be only 200 to 400 agents because of a
high attrition rate of about 800 a year. The 1999 fiscal year ends
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner announced earlier this year that the administration
will hire about 800 agents in fiscal 2000 but will have no net gain
in the number of agents. The INS is the Border Patrol's parent
agency.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Nicole Chulick said the INS asked the
administration for a net gain of 1,000 agents in fiscal 2000 but
the White House dropped the request from its proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the president was ``breaking the law'' by using the
money Congress had allocated for more Border Patrol agents for
other parts of his budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make the president comply with the will of the
people,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators who signed the letter were Spencer Abraham,
R-Mich.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Chulick said the agency's failure to achieve the net gain of
1,000 agents this year results from a tight labor market. ``Like
most employers, we have had a hard time finding qualified
applicants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the INS has done almost
nothing to recruit new agents, adding that other branches of
government, such as the military, have managed to attract
applicants despite similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chulick also said that the White House budget office chose not
to add any new agents in 2000 because it was afraid that the agency
had too many inexperienced agents working in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration felt some time was needed to give the
thousands of agents hired during the past few years a chance to
gain the experience they need to do their jobs correctly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reyes, a former Border Patrol sector chief in El Paso,
said several sectors along the border were staffed primarily by
``very experienced'' agents who would have little trouble training
the new personnel.
</P>
<P>
   To help the Border Patrol attract more applicants, six
southwestern senators, including Hutchison and Gramm, have proposed
legislation to raise base pay from $33,000 to $41,000 for agents
who successfully complete their probationary year. INS estimates
that the pay raise would cost $40 million to $50 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill is designed to redress some of the pay
inequity that currently hampers the agency. The Border Patrol's
loss of about 10 percent of its 8,000-agent workforce stems in part
from the fact that agents move on to higher-paying jobs within the
INS or in other federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators sponsoring the bill are Bingaman, Domenici, Kyl
and McCain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Walls have come down at the Heard Museum, and not just
the 8-foot-high berm that long separated the white stucco arches of
this celebrated American Indian arts center from an emerging
downtown arts district along Central Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter divisions that have set American Indians against
non-Indian custodians of their culture since the arrival of the
white man are crumbling too.
</P>
<P>
   Resplendent after an $18 million expansion that nearly doubled
its exhibition and programming space, the 70-year-old Heard, with
its staff of Indian experts, is pointing the way to a new
nationwide spirit of collaboration between Indians and the museums
housing their patrimony and sometimes the remains of their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Indian museum has changed its face, and the Heard
was a factor in changing it,'' said John Lewis, executive director
of the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, which just moved into new
quarters across the street from the Heard to be closer to it.
</P>
<P>
   From small collections to the Smithsonian Institution, Indian
museums are increasingly opening their doors to a contemporary
Indian presence, a development that Lewis, a Pima and Mojave
Indian, attributes more to an evolving sensitivity than to Indian
demands. While tribes remain skeptical about how decisions are made
at the Heard and other museums, he said, a spirit of partnership is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took them a long time to wake up,'' said Margaret
Archuleta, the Heard's curator of fine art, who is of Pueblo and
Hispanic heritage and credits the Heard with breaking new ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tribal art continues to be stolen, and clashes still
erupt, as they did last year when Sotheby's auctioned Indian art
despite tribal protests about ceremonial items identified as
sacred. Nineteen objects were later withdrawn from sale and three
others were bought for repatriation to their tribes. The planned
American Indian museum on the Mall in Washington has been stalled
over contractual disagreements between the Smithsonian Institution
and the project's original architect, Douglas Cardinal, an Indian
of Blackfoot ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   But most ownership disputes are attributable to confusion, said
Elizabeth Sackler, daughter of the noted antiquities collector
Arthur Sackler and founder and president of the American Indian
Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And despite widespread fears that a recent federal law would
provoke a spate of contests over Indian holdings in museums, issues
are generally being resolved amicably, officials say. In some
cases, museum directors and Indian leaders say, tribes have even
agreed that museums are better custodians of their art and
artifacts than they could be, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Heard's showcases still brim with Zuni turquoise and silver,
Navajo blankets, Pima baskets, Santa Clara blackware, Apache and
Kiowa beadwork and the late Sen. Barry Goldwater's incomparable
collection of Hopi katsina dolls. (Tribal experts now favor that
spelling to the old kachina.)
</P>
<P>
   But alongside the antiquities that a wealthy couple, Dwight and
Maie Bartlett Heard, began acquiring shortly after their move from
Chicago in 1895 are new galleries of starkly modern art by
contemporary Indian painters and sculptors, work that Joe Baker, a
Delaware Indian beader and artist at the Heard, says belies the
image of American Indians as ``a people of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heard, which unveiled its bold new footprint and
50,000-square-foot expansion in February, has taken other steps to
build what its director, Martin Sullivan, calls ``a living museum,
where the objects aren't just there for esthetics but also to tell
stories about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians hold senior staff positions and an Indian might
conceivably end up as the new director after Sullivan leaves in
June. Indian artists serve residencies at the museum and offer
demonstrations in the galleries, Indian high school students are
trained as guides, and the staff consults regularly with Indian
artists and elders who, in many cases, are as nearby as the
19-member Inter-Tribal Council across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Heard has also taken a leading role in complying with the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990,
which requires museums to conduct an inventory of their human
remains, funerary objects, sacred items and cultural patrimony and
take steps to return them. It has made at least eight such returns,
one of the largest museum repatriations proportionate to its
collection, to nearby tribes of Hopi, Navajo, Gila River
Pima-Maricopa, Salt River Pima-Maricopa and Crow. One returned urn
contained ashes from a cremation. The museum received an
unidentified Indian skull in the mail one day and turned it over to
the Southern Cheyenne for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who helped draw up the act's guidelines, was just
elected chairman of a seven-member repatriation panel that mediates
disputes, including one over whether the 9,300-year-old Kennewick
man, whose remains were found in 1996 in the Columbia River Basin
in Oregon, could be classified as Indian or Caucasoid. Sullivan is
also chairman of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee working
with federal agencies to curb the illegal trade in Indian art and
antiques worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to redefine our relationship in terms of
partnerships and an emphasis on living culture,'' said Sullivan,
who came here nine years ago from the New York State Museum in
Albany, N.Y., where he helped resolve a dispute with the Onondaga
Nation of Indians over 12 wampum belts that the museum had been
holding, some since 1898. The beaded belts, encompassing a kind of
historical charter of the tribes, were returned to the Iroquois.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Heard has shifted emphasis from acquiring
and displaying artifacts to explaining them in what Sullivan calls
``a first-person voice.'' Significantly, in 1989 it shortened its
name from the Heard Museum of Anthropology and Primitive Art, to
the Heard Museum, with the tag line ``of Native Cultures and Art.''
The evolution is more than a fad, he maintained. ``The PC label has
been stuck on this, but I don't want to do it because it's PC. It's
just good practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1950s, the Heard added Indian trustees, and
Indians joined the staff in the '60s. In the '80s, under Sullivan's
predecessor, Michael Fox, the Heard took the initiative in
developing federal standards leading to the repatriation statute,
working with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., then vice chairman of the
Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian presence brought new sensitivities. Ms. Archuleta,
the Heard's fine art curator, said that at her behest the museum
recently took down a painting of a Hopi religious ceremony in a
kiva, or underground chamber, which is off limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a native staff person,'' she said, ``I make sure that
people don't see something that's not kosher.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar case was the museum's adoption of katsina instead of
kachina as its spelling for the traditional spirit dolls given to
girls of the Hopi tribe. An unwritten language, Hopi has no
transcribed form of the word, and the new spelling is said to
better reflect its pronunciation. Because of the religious nature
of the dolls, the museum consulted tribal experts and engaged
another Indian, Alph Secakuku, to write an accompanying book before
putting on a special exhibition several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Archuleta said she was proudest of the Heard's hospitality
to contemporary Indian painters and sculptors who find mainstream
museums inhospitable.
</P>
<P>
   One gallery has a show called ``Art in Two Worlds,'' a
compilation of provocative works by Indians that were exhibited in
seven invitational shows from 1983 to 1997. A second gallery is
also devoted to contemporary fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   In March the museum also started an artist-in-residence program,
sponsoring an Indian artist, Michael Kabotie Lomawywesa, a Hopi
jeweler and painter, to work and mingle with visitors. He and Joe
Baker, the Delaware Indian artist who heads the program, have works
in a new book, ``North American Indian Jewelry and Adornment'' by
Lois Sherr Dubin, published by Harry N. Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   (Similarly, in April the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians
and Western Art in Indianapolis, Ind., announced $100,000 in
fellowships to Indian artists over the next 10 years.)
</P>
<P>
   The modern exhibits often startle visitors emerging from
galleries of traditional baskets, blankets, jewelry and katsina
dolls, but it is part of the museum's purpose to juxtapose the old
and new for maximum effect, said Rebecca Murray, the communications
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the museum is far better known for its historical
collection. Mrs. Heard, the daughter of a leading Chicago hardware
wholesaler whose business grew into today's Tru Value Hardware
chain, resettled in Phoenix with her husband after a lung ailment
sent him in search of a warm, dry climate. They became major
landowners, ranchers, developers and philanthropists, and in 1912
Heard became a publisher as well, buying The Arizona Republican
(which changed its name to The Arizona Republic in 1930). Their
estate, Casa Blanca, off Central Avenue, drew many prominent
guests, including President Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The Heards also became avid collectors of Indian artifacts, some
of them excavated from Hohokum Indian ruins on property they bought
in Phoenix. They also sought other indigenous art on expeditions to
Egypt and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929 they built a Spanish Colonial Revival building on their
property to house their growing art collection. Heard died months
before its completion. His wife opened it to the public, although
it was unmarked and visitors had to ring the bell at Casa Blanca to
gain entry. Mrs. Heard died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The collection grew quickly, often through purchases from Fred
Harvey Co., which began as a provider of food and lodging to the
railroads and became one of the largest dealers in Indian art and
handicrafts. In 1971 Harvey's great-grandson gave the museum about
4,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   The latest expansion of the museum has taken it to eight times
its original size, including a remodeled 400-seat auditorium and a
cafe featuring Indian specialties like Hopi corn stew and Navajo
tortilla wraps. The museum can now display about 10 percent of its
permanent collection at one time, twice as much as before. Casa
Blanca was demolished years ago, the site now occupied by a
high-rise apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   With the demolition of the berm that concealed the museum from
the main thoroughfare, Central Avenue, and the realignment of the
main portal, the Heard has gained a bolder downtown presence. The
nearby Phoenix Art Museum and the Phoenix Theater help anchor what
Sullivan, the Heard's director, says the city is striving to
develop as an arts district. In a city notorious for sprawl, ``We
need something that makes cultural life more pedestrian-friendly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever direction the expanded Heard takes from here, Sullivan
will not be around to see it. He is leaving in June to become
director of Historic St. Mary's, a restoration of the 17th-century
capital of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He said the list of potential successors includes Indian
curators at other museums as well as non-Indians. Being an Indian,
he said, ``is not a condition, but it would be wonderful.'' The
Heard would not be the first museum headed by an Indian; the
director of the National Museum of the American Indian at the
Smithsonian is W. Richard West Jr., a Southern Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis of the Inter-Tribal Council is watching the search process
closely. ``We have a great interest,'' he said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ There is a pointed joke making the rounds in Israel:
Why don't campaign commercials have subtitles in Amharic, the
language of the Ethiopian immigrants here?
</P>
<P>
   Because, the answer goes, Russians don't read Amharic.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli campaign plunges into its final frenzied days
before the election on Monday, Russian immigrants are the wild card
in a close race for prime minister between Ehud Barak, the
front-runner, and Benjamin Netanyahu, the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the immigrant community, whose support
for Barak has climbed from 15 to 40 percent in a few months, will
determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are this vote,'' Robert Satloff, executive director of
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in an interview
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming this country socially, culturally and politically,
some 740,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union have arrived
in Israel since 1989. Unlike native Israelis, they are not born
into political parties. Although many favor the right because they
take a hard line toward conceding territory to the Palestinians,
they are, with 14 percent of the electorate, a swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 they favored Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor Party leader at
the time, and four years later they swung to the right for
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the real center,'' said Yuli Edelstein, the immigration
minister and chairman of the campaign for the Yisrael B'Aliya
party, led by Natan Sharansky. ``You will see that in this race. We
are the ones who are going to break the stalemates in this
society.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the candidates have fixated on the
Russians above all other groups in this diverse society, sometimes
in transparently gimmicky ways.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, who is squat and bald, has been courted with such
passion that he jokes about the Israelis finally coming to see his
inner self _ ``a handsome tall man with thick curly hair.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Netanyahu have faced off in chess matches against
Sharansky, a masterly player, even though he has repeatedly said he
will make no endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the Labor Party leader, lost his match but won the photo
opportunity. Netanyahu, who hates to lose, sweated it out to a
draw, guided by chess advisers and a computer chess program.
</P>
<P>
   But peering over the prime minister's shoulders was Tommy Lapid,
a chess expert who happens to be running for parliament at the head
of an aggressively anti-religious party. So the publicity stunt,
whatever effect it had on the Russians, briefly infuriated some of
Netanyahu's supporters in the ultra-Orthodox world.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews made for uneasy
bedfellows in Netanyahu's coalition government, and tensions
between them have been exacerbated during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At one particularly low moment, Eli Suissa, the interior
minister, referred to Russians in a campaign ad for his
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party as ``counterfeiters, con men and call
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Smith, one of the more cautious pollsters, said
Netanyahu, who can probably count on 60 percent of the Russian
voters, needs 70 percent to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs that to compensate for his losses in other parts of
the population, and it doesn't look he is getting it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating out an uphill battle to hold onto his post, Netanyahu,
who leads the Likud Party, trails Barak by 6 to 8 percent in the
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the campaign, Netanyahu bled supporters to a
new rightist party, headed by Benny Begin, his former science
minister; to the Center Party, headed by his former defense
minister, Yitzhak Mordechai; and to Barak himself.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who fled directly to Barak _ rather than defecting
first to Mordechai, then, as his campaign failed, to the Labor
Party leader _ were Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago he was nonexistent in our community,''
Edelstein said of Barak. ``If he had asked me, I would have said,
`Ehud, you're a nice guy, but you don't stand a chance.' But he
invested time, lots of time, on the ground, and it has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Russians, who think contrarianism is a foundation
of democracy, like to vote out the incumbent. But Barak's campaign
has left no stone unturned in the Russian immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Yisrael B'Aliya held a picnic for party workers.
No candidates for prime minister were invited; it was not to be a
politicized event.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak, a highly decorated former general, was not deterred.
He sent an unmarked car _ no loudspeakers, no bumper stickers _ to
deliver hundreds of carnations, a present that could not be
refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Russian-language radio, Barak's campaign has filled more than
two hours of advertising time in the last two weeks with
biographical tidbits about the candidate and testimonials from his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians don't have roots here, so they don't know his
story,'' said Sasha Klein, a filmmaker and Russian media adviser to
Barak. ``Our main strategy was not to go anti-Bibi, because
Russians like to vote against somebody anyway. It was to explain
Ehud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians don't like generals, but they do like heroes.
Also, he plays the piano, which is very important, and he can talk
about Rachmaninoff, Pushkin, Dostoyevsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Renata Koeppel, who arrived four years ago from Ukraine, said
she listened carefully to the Russian-language election programs. A
resident of the port town of Ashkelon, she feels she is ``not very
strong in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time they told me vote for Netanyahu, and I did,'' she
said, referring to other Russian-speaking immigrants. ``This time,
I'm just like other Israelis. I want things to change, to be
better. I'm influenced by the commercials. I think Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the advantages of an incumbent, Netanyahu has been able to
use his office to appeal to the immigrants. Last week he declared
that May 9, the date that Russia celebrates the Allied victory in
World War II, would become an Israeli holiday _ with its own
postage stamp. He also announced new benefits for the 40,000
Russian war veterans in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, with an eye to the Russian vote, he and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon traveled to Russia, giving interviews
to Russian television stations that are broadcast on cable in
Israel. It was probably the first time in Israeli political history
that politicians tried to appeal to ethnic voters by returning to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an authoritarian state with vast territories, many
Russian immigrants instinctively prefer Netanyahu's image as a
strong leader reluctant to turn over land to the Palestinians and
tough enough to resist the pressures of American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry the conceptual baggage of a totalitarian regime,''
said Roman Bronfman, a Yisrael B'Aliya member of parliament. ``And
Netanyahu represents a more totalitarian approach, with his message
of a `strong leader for a strong nation.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, new immigrants, many of whom are workers and
small-business owners, are among the hardest hit by the rising
unemployment and stagnant economic growth of the last two years.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   To make inroads into what he has called ``our most precious
electorate,'' Barak has been able to take advantage of new
alliances, forged after November's municipal elections, between
newly elected Labor Party mayors and Yisrael B'Aliya
representatives who were named deputy mayors in several key cities,
including Haifa, Rishon Lezion and Akko.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also benefits from the Likud Party's weaknesses on the
ground. On Election Day, when getting out the vote will be crucial,
the Labor Party's superior organization and close relationships
with the Russians in several cities could be critical.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky's party burst onto the political scene in 1996, when
it captured seven seats in parliament. Before that victory, the
Russians played a far less visible role on the public stage. Their
votes were sought at election time, but the stakes were low:
Individuals were promised bus rides to the polling stations or
sometimes apartments that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Russians are demanding, and the candidates are
promising, key ministries in the next government. In particular,
Sharansky has set his party's sights on the interior ministry,
which has belonged to Shas for years.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has indicated that he is more than willing to give Yisrael
B'Aliya that powerful post, breaking Shas' control of an agency
that has refused to register many Russian immigrants as Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stigma against Russians has been so bad in the last few
years that I've considered changing my name from Sasha to Shmuel,''
Klein said. ``It's interesting that we're so important in this
campaign, given that our place in the society is so
controversial.''

   The New York Times plans a page of coverage on the firing of
Russia's Prime Minister:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Ledeall: Ever the master of surprise,
President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly fires Prime Minister Evgeni M.
Primakov, pushing Russia to the brink of a crisis that could
endanger its fragile political stability. Yeltsin's latest
government dismissal _ his third in 15 months _ came as the Russian
parliament Thursday opened what promises to be a stormy and
emotional debate on his impeachement, with the outcome of a vote
scheduled for Saturday increasingly uncertain. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ A news analysis: Encircled by his
leftist opponents and reduced almost to a cipher in opinion polls,
clearly ill and on the cusp of impeachment, Boris Yeltsin rose
Wednesday to sack a government he had never embraced and position
himself once more as Russias savior. But after eight years of
dramatic sackings, the question this time was who Yeltsin was
trying to save: democratic Russia, or himself? By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-STEPASHIN (Moscow) _ A profile: Sergei Vadimovich
Stepashin, President Boris Yeltsin's fourth choice as prime
minister in less than a year, is best known for loyalty to his
boss. But that description does not do him justice. Stepashin has
made an entire career in the Russian internal security apparatus.
At one point or another, he has run Yeltsin's counterintelligence
bureau, directed the Federal Security Service, which was the
domestic successor to the KGB, and helped carry out the president's
disastrous war against rebels in the Chechnya region of Russia. By
Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-DIPLO (Washington) _ Having invested considerable capital
in nurturing Russia as a partner in a Kosovo settlement, the
turmoil in Russia today appeared to represent another impediment to
the Clinton administration's hopes of finding a diplomatic end to
the war. After dismissing his government today, President Yeltsin
threatened to withdraw from negotiations on Kosovo, saying that
Moscow's proposals were being repeatedly ignored. By Jane Perlez.

AIDS SEEN AS POSING DIRE THREAT IN THIRD WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers and researchers warned Wednesday that the
rapid spread of the AIDS virus threatens to destabilize Africa and
Asia unless the United States and other wealthy nations pump more
resources into halting the spread of the disease in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., the chairman of a congressional
task force on the international scope of AIDS and HIV, said that
``the general health of the developing world has suffered a setback
unlike any other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa has been the hardest hit, but now there is evidence
that Asia is on the brink and will soon be plunged into a crisis
many times worse than Africa,'' McDermott told a House conference
on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Citing U.N. statistics, McDermott said in a statement that in
Africa and Asia HIV infection rates are four times higher in the
military than in the civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will soon lead to a major destabilization of militaries
throughout the developing world,'' he said. ``If the United States
is to help maintain global security, then we as a nation must
realize that HIV/AIDS could have a massive and very negative effect
on global security.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., a 27-year House veteran
who now heads Atlanta-based Healthcare International Management
Co., a company that provides health services in poor countries,
warned that AIDS was sowing seeds of political instability in
Africa by creating a generation of hopeless and impoverished
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Dellums called for the creation of an ``AIDS Marshall Plan''
focused on Africa. He wants the federal government and
pharmaceutical companies each to chip in $100 million. The money
would help pay for expensive anti-viral drugs that have
dramatically lowered death rates from the disease in wealthy
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called triple drug therapy costs over $15,000 annually
per patient in the United States. But the average amount of money
available to an HIV-infected person in a poor nation is about $10
per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. needs to step up and take an incredible response,''
Dellums said. ``We've been nickel-and-dimeing Africa for years and
that has to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government currently provides about $125 million
annually for international HIV and AIDS efforts, aimed mainly at
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to deadly
infections. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has introduced a bill in the
House that would provide tax breaks for companies doing research on
AIDS vaccines, urged the heads of the world's wealthiest countries
to hold a meeting devoted to stemming the spread of AIDS in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Berkeley, the director of the New York-based International
AIDS Vaccine Initiative, added that the most effective way to
curtail the rapid spread of the disease in poor countries was the
development of an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few major companies are involved in the vaccine effort and
only one AIDS vaccine candidate has been deemed ready for testing
on large numbers of human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``No viral infection in the world has been stopped without a
vaccine,'' said Berkeley, who urged the government to provide more
incentives for companies to work on an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Africa has been particularly hard hit by the disease, but the
occurrence of AIDS across Asia is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer number of Africans affected by the epidemic is
overwhelming,'' said a report by the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 years since the epidemic exploded onto the scene, an
estimated 34 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa have been
infected with HIV. About 11.5 million of those people have died, a
quarter of them children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Health Organization, 83 percent of
worldwide AIDS deaths have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and at
least 95 percent of all children whose parents died of AIDS are
African.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO reported Monday that AIDS had become the world's most
deadly infectious disease in the last year, overtaking tuberculosis
and moving up to fourth place among all causes of death worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Here amid the hubbub of Lower Downtown's hip eateries
and art galleries, two-and-a-half blocks from Coors Field baseball
stadium and just blocks from the daytime hangout for many of
Denver's transients, Frederick and Jan Mayer bought a parking lot
and built the first private single-family residence to rise in this
old industrial district in a century.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, when the Mayers moved from suburb to city, they
have been lauded as urban pioneers, the most visible homesteaders
in a surge of billion-dollar loft and condominium development. In a
decade this formerly seamy neighborhood bordering the freight yards
has become Denver's second most expensive neighborhood (after
Cherry Creek).
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, once named Wildcatter of the Year, made a fortune in oil
in the early 1980s and then sold his oilrigs the year before the
oil market collapsed. He is currently a director of the American
Petroleum Institute and chairman of the board of Captiva Resources,
an oil and gas exploration and production company.
</P>
<P>
   But to locals, Mayer, 71, and his wife, who is the president of
the American Federation of Arts, are mostly known as extraordinary
art patrons. For more than 40 years they have been avid collectors,
and they were among the first to explore and understand the value
of Costa Rican pre-Columbian art and Spanish colonial art from
Mexico. In 1994 the Mayers gave the majority of their pre-Columbian
collection to the Denver Art Museum, which displays more than 2,000
of those objects on the fourth floor. The Mayers' gesture is
particularly taken to heart in a rapidly changing city where half
public school children are Hispanic. The Art Museum makes a
showcase of its pre-Columbian collection, one of the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Mayers were included in a listing of the world's
200 top collectors in Art News magazine. Their colonial Latin
American art was specifically cited, but they also collect stamps,
coins, American watercolors, 20th-century American prints and Greek
antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976 Mayer has served three times as the Denver Art
Museum's board chairman, and he is currently chairman of the
governing board of the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven. At
both institutions he has been a proponent of ``deaccessioning,'' or
selling artworks that are stored in basements and never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the Mayers commissioned Mope, a 19-year-old graffiti
artist who frequents the Spot, a nearby nighttime center for
at-risk adolescents, to paint a mural on the plywood construction
walkway in front of their emerging town house. The 50-foot mural
was Mope's interpretation of the future of Lower Downtown, or LoDo:
in dark canyons there were flying city buses, a traffic cop
resembling an alien, and Coors Field on a precarious precipice.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of his daily predawn commute from Cherry Hills Village, a
south Denver suburb, Mr. and Mrs. Mayer began experimenting with
urban living a few years ago, staying at the historic Oxford Hotel
or borrowing a-friend-of-a-friend's loft for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mayer said: ``I was so bored walking my dog in our old
neighborhood. Every time you walk outside here it is so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer added: ``Our old house was built for raising three
children. We had nine collections and we had no place to show them.
We were at a stage in our lives where we thought it would be fun to
live with these things rather than keep storing them.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year national search, the Mayers asked Jim Olson of
Olson Sundberg Architects of Seattle to oversee the design of a
town house that could be used for displaying the Mayers' art and
for entertaining. Olson has created a contemporary three-story town
house with a courtyard on three city lots; the building is at once
a museum, a home and a response to its urban context.
</P>
<P>
   Olson explained: ``I think the Mayers really wanted to create a
Florentine-like town house in a modern setting. Everywhere I looked
in Colorado I saw red brick, red rock, red sandstone, and the
Mayers like red. In their collection of Spanish colonial art red is
frequently used, and the contemporary art they chose has a lot of
red in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The town house, which cost about $3 million to build, is called
the Red House because of its dark red facade, made of a base of
precast concrete, stucco and sandstone from India. To a passerby,
the main door of the Mayers' ``cloister'' is as imposing as the
Wizard's portal in the ``Wizard of Oz.'' A sliding security gate
opens to reveal an 11-foot door of hammered bronze, coated and
waxed with a Chinese brown patina. The entry hall extends the
atmosphere of subtle grandeur. Ceilings rise to 15 feet, and an
inner courtyard has a gently flowing fountain, strawberry plants
and a white grid sculpture by Sol LeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a little private paradise, a private world
within the public world,'' Olson said. ``With the layout of the
house turning in on a courtyard, the courtyard becomes their little
secret garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The rooftop sculpture garden is visible to gallerygoers and bar
hoppers below, with a grand aluminum and steel-wire sculpture by
Kenneth Snelson jutting into the skyscape like a child's toy placed
just out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that the town house's main floor ``is about
community, about people, events,'' adding: ``The Mayers have
something going on in those spaces all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The second floor I call the nest,'' he said. ``It is really
their private space and more about creature comforts. The top floor
we call the sanctuary, and it is about spiritual, universal things.
You can look out at the mountains, look at the stars. It is about
going out beyond the immediate community.''
</P>
<P>
   On what was once skid row the Mayers have built a live-in
gallery that they frequently open to benefit some of their favorite
local institutions. Patrons of the Denver Art Museum have enjoyed
cocktails surrounded by the works of Milton Avery, Hans Hofmann,
John Singer Sargent and George Innes. In January the Mayers held a
party for supporters of the Spot, the nearby youth center.
</P>
<P>
   David DeForest-Stalls, director of the Spot, said, ``What's
wonderful is that the Mayers have reached out for the benefit of
groups like ours. The Mayers enjoy the diversity around them. They
celebrate that diversity.''

of the black man who was dragged to death by whites in East Texas
has unexpectedly emerged as one of the most emotional, political
flashpoints of the current session. Democrats are charging that
Republicans loyal to Gov. George W. Bush are attempting to bottle
up the James Byrd Act, to kill it in committee so it would never
land on Bush's desk and force him to make a decision to either
support it, and alienate right-wing Republicans who object to the

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Edith Coliver has watched history from a
front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   As an analyst at the Nuremberg Trials or a representative to
developing democracies, Coliver has been deeply involved in the
international community for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she was named the 1999 International House Alumna of
the Year at the University of California at Berkeley for her
half-century of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to make people aware of what is going on
in the world,'' said Coliver, 76. ``I grew up in the faith of our
forebears and sages. One of them, the first-century sage Hillel,
preached a credo that lives to this day: ``If I am not for myself,
who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I?'''
</P>
<P>
   Coliver was born in a small German city near the Swiss border in
1922, but fled to the United States in 1937 as the Nazis began
targeting Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about the extermination camps, but we knew
about the concentration camps, and we knew people who were sent to
them,'' Coliver said. ``Had we tried to leave two months later, it
would have been impossible to get out because Germany closed its
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks in New York, her family moved to San
Francisco. She became part of Washington High School's first
graduating class, but felt alienated from her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their concerns were so very different from mine,'' Coliver
said. ``I was following the war in Europe, and all the other girls
would talk about movie stars and makeup. They didn't want to get
involved in the war and didn't want to think about the war.''
</P>
<P>
   She then went to the University of California at Berkeley,
graduating summa cum laude in international relations and
languages, and headed to Washington for a job with the Office of
War Information.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the United States was fighting in both Europe and the
Pacific, and Coliver would encourage the European allies and warn
countries that supported the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, she worked as a translator at the first U.N.
Conference in San Francisco. That led to a job as an analyst and
translator for the American prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials.
</P>
<P>
   At Nuremberg, she stayed with other dignitaries at the only
hotel left standing after the Allied bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being there felt odd,'' Coliver said. ``I kept thinking to
myself: Oh, how the mighty have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitler had killed himself before he was arrested by the
Allies, his second-in-command, Hermann Goering, was put on trial at
Nuremberg. Coliver served as his interpreter during the pretrial
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would not have minded being shot, but to be hanged
was ignoble,'' Coliver said. ``He convinced someone to give him
cyanide, which he hid in a cosmetics jar. I was in the pressroom on
the night before his hanging and someone came in and told us:
`Goering has cheated the gallows by doing away with himself.'''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While working at Nuremberg, Coliver visited her hometown and ran
into an old schoolmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was asking me about various girls in our class,'' Coliver
said. ``One was in the United States, another in Australia, another
in Israel. Then she asked me about Gertrude Marx, my best friend. I
told her she had died in the camps.;;
</P>
<P>
   Coliver said she realized she would never live in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many memories,'' she said. ``Every person I run
into around my age, I wonder _ were they Hitler's willing
executioners? Were they members of the Nazi Party?''
</P>
<P>
   After Nuremberg, she pursued another passion, writing. She
worked as an assistant editor for the Stanford Research Institute's
Chemical Economics Handbook, then as a propaganda analyst for Radio
Free Asia in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my opportunity to work directly in human rights came in
the course of a 40-year career with the Asia Foundation,'' Coliver
said. ``I was assigned to the Philippines during the last years of
the Marcos dictatorship. It was very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The democratic movement in the Philippines began in 1983, four
years after Coliver was chosen as the first female representative

   NEW YORK _ Saul Steinberg, the metaphysically minded artist and
cartoonist and brooding doodler whose drawings appeared in The New
Yorker for more than half a century, elevating comic illustration
into fine art, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg was compared with Picasso, Klee, Miro, Duchamp,
Daumier, Beckett, Pirandello, Ionesco, Chaplin and Joyce. Art
critic Harold Rosenberg called Steinberg ``a writer of pictures, an
architect of speech and sounds, a draftsman of philosophical
reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg was known to most people, as he lamented late in
life, as ``the man who did that poster.'' That poster, one of the
most famous American drawings, portrays a New Yorker's
short-sighted view of the rest of the world, in which everything in
the landscape recedes according to its cultural distance from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg was not, at least in spirit, an inhabitant of
that provincial metropolis he drew. Born in Romania, a country he
called pure Dada, and educated in Italy, the home of Surrealism and
fascism, he lived most of his life in the United States. He was
enthralled and appalled by America. The Chrysler Building, Uncle
Sam, the Easter Bunny, Lady Liberty, Mickey Mouse, crocodiles
crawling the city streets, police cars and post offices kept
creeping into his drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg was ``a virtuoso of exchanges of identity,'' Rosenberg
contended, and his art was ``a parade of fictitious personages.''
His influences were Seurat, Klee, Egyptian paintings, drawings
found in public toilets, primitive art, insane art and embroidery.
He had a number of ways of referring to himself in his drawings: as
a man in profile, a cat, a dog, a fish, and as a rabbit peering
warily out of a man's geometrical head. Steinberg's alter ego was
always, Rosenberg observed, ``detached, curious, passive and
fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   The very first picture he ever sold, in 1935, showed a man
staring in the mirror, saying to himself: ``Dammit! This isn't me.
I got lost in the crowd.'' That could have been Steinberg's motto
for life. More than once he was photographed with one of his
paper-bag masks over his face. That, after all, he once said, is
what people do in America, ``manufacture a mask of happiness for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg was born on June 15, 1914, near Bucharest, the
son of Maurice Steinberg, who had a printing and box manufacturing
business, and Rosa Jacobson Steinberg, who made cakes that her son
found ``too beautiful to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Steinberg was trained as an architect, he never designed
a single building. After studying sociology and psychology at the
University of Bucharest, he moved to Italy and received a doctoral
degree in architecture from the Reggio Politecnico in Milan in
1940.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in architecture school, he began his career as an
artist. He founded a magazine with Italian novelist Giovanni
Guareschi and began publishing his drawings in the magazine
Bertoldo. ``The study of architecture is a marvelous training for
anything but architecture,'' Steinberg said. ``The frightening
thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasoned lines, and lines that reasoned, became his stock in
trade. ``The doodle is the brooding of the hand,'' Steinberg once
said. The only reason he didn't become a writer, he said, was that
he was deprived of being born into ``a good language.''
</P>
<P>
   His visual language was a thin, sharp line that was always
remarking on its own existence. ``My line wants to remind
constantly that it's made of ink,'' Steinberg said. ``I appeal to
the complicity of my reader who will transform this line into
meaning by using our common background of culture, history,
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what saves me,'' he said on another occasion, ``is
that drawing is close to precision while painting is drunkenness,
it's narcissistic _ all that swirling oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Often his drawings poked fun at the art of drawing, the artist
growing out of his own pen and winding up as a square or becoming
entangled in his own rococo fancies or unable to break out of a
never-ending spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's art also played on the theme of emigration and the
bureaucratic guises of identity: passports, fingerprints,
signatures. He had plenty of experience with those things as a
foreign Jew living in Milan under a fascist regime that was growing
more anti-Semitic. His diploma in architecture was awarded by
Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, King of Albania and Emperor of
Ethiopia (after Mussolini's conquest) to a man identified as ``of
the Jewish race'' (``di razza Ebraica'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty for me,'' Steinberg told Robert Hughes of Time
magazine in 1978, ``is that this diploma was given by the King; but
he is no longer King of Italy. He is no more King of Albania. He is
not even the Emperor of Ethiopia. And I am no architect. The only
thing that remains is razza Ebraica.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, in the midst of World War II, he fled fascist Italy for
the United States using what he described as a ``slightly fake''
passport that he had stamped with his own rubber stamp. It got him
to neutral Portugal and then as far as Ellis Island, but he was
deported to Santo Domingo because the tiny quota for Romanians was
already filled. From there he sent The New Yorker some cartoons,
hoping the magazine would support his entry into the United States.
Eventually that happened. But his art preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   His first New Yorker drawing appeared on Oct. 25, 1941: an
artist's playful rendition of a reverse centaur, one with a man's
rear end and a horse's head. Steinberg himself arrived in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, 1943, was momentous for Steinberg. He had
his first American one-man show, at the Wakefield Gallery in
Manhattan. He married Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, a painter. (They
were separated in the 1970s but never divorced, and she survives
him.) And on the same day that he became a U.S. citizen he was
given an ensign's commission in the Navy. He was assigned to teach
Chinese guerrillas how to blow up bridges, and for a year flew the
mountainous route known as the Hump from China to India, making
sure that the cargoes of explosives reached their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then Steinberg was sent to North Africa and Italy by William
Donovan, the director of the Office of Strategic Services. His
assignment was to draw cartoons that would inspire anti-Nazi
resistance within Germany. Steinberg made lurid images of Hitler
with skulls hiding behind him and of Mussolini's twisted face with
one eye popping out. These and other drawings were dropped behind
enemy lines and printed in Das Neue Deutschland, a resistance
newspaper created by the OSS.
</P>
<P>
   During the war The New Yorker published Steinberg's visual
reports from Asia, North Africa and Europe and satiric drawings of
Nazis. In one drawing, ``Benito and Adolf _ Aryan dancers,''
Mussolini and Hitler are wrestling, half-naked. But the artist, now
Lt. Steinberg, also did drawings of military life: pictures of GIs
bewildered by Europe and waiting for mail from home. His pictures
were published in 1945 in a book called ``All in Line,'' the first
of many collections of his drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, the year Steinberg was discharged from the Navy, he
received his first major recognition as an artist when his work was
included in the show ``Fourteen Americans'' at the Museum of Modern
Art.
</P>
<P>
   After the war his style changed, becoming more abstract,
philosophical and symbolic. In the 1950s he devised a whole roster
of characters: cats, sphinxes and empty-looking men and women, then
crocodiles (his emblem for primitive political society), horses and
knights. One memorable drawing featured a knight about to spear a
giant bunny. (Steinberg called this a moral drawing: ``Should he be
destroyed, or should he be educated?'') Women in his drawings also
appeared as heroic medieval knights: with spiked heels, makeup that
resembled war paint and handbags and umbrellas that looked like
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s Steinberg's work was filled with geometrical forms,
baroque comic-strip balloons, letters of the alphabet, numbers,
punctuation marks, false passports, stamps, legal documents and
government regulations on matters like dragons and monologues. He
was particularly attached to the question mark, which he drew
hovering overhead, embraced in bunches or carried like a briefcase.
He traced his obsession with punctuation and letters to his
father's printing business in Romania, in which condolences like
``Crushed by Sorrow'' were printed in big wooden type.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and '70s Steinberg branched out. He did
architectural fantasies, watercolor landscapes and vicious pictures
of New York street life that indicated a pessimism about urban
life: Mickey Mouse as a terrorist in boots, doormen as saluting
soldiers, building facades as frightening mazes. He made a library
of rubber stamps, with which he canceled his drawings, and postcard
landscapes. He also made a series of ``tables,'' which were wood
constructions full of visual puns _ rulers, brushes, erasers and
pens _ painted onto the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``His drawings are, in a sense, anthologies of art history,''
the critic Hilton Kramer once wrote. ``There are cubist and rococo
characters. Expressionist conversations, Renaissance objects.
Gothic words and Pointillist emotions. There is a kind of
primitivism in all this, an animism, for everything in Steinberg _
even the most inanimate object or abstract thought _ is teeming
with feeling, aspiration, ambition and portents. Numbers are
erotic, words are predatory or faltering, a coiffure may be
cerebral, or a boot didactic. Steinberg sees experience itself as a
parody of experience, with `style' the only reliable clue to its
mysterious gyrations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his many guises Steinberg always portrayed America with a
mixture of bemusement and mockery. He traveled to all 50 states and
enthused: ``I'm crazy about the Dakotas. And Nebraska! ... The
sunsets in Arizona are watercolors.''
</P>
<P>
   He was fond of diners, motels, kidney-shaped swimming pools and
highways, and he thought the country was best seen from the height
of a bus window. He was a European sophisticate posing as a regular
American guy. Roger Angell of The New Yorker recalled that
Steinberg became such a baseball fan that ``he acquired a Milwaukee
Braves uniform that he used to put on to watch the games on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all Steinberg's amusement with America, he remained an
outsider, with a cool European perspective. ``He fixed on American
life without being too close to it,'' said Edward Koren, the
cartoonist. And he filtered it all through an analytic pen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinberg arrived in New York around the same time as
some of the Abstract Expressionists and collected the works of de
Kooning, Klee, Picasso, Baziotes, Giacometti and Guston, he saw
himself working against the expressionist grain. He once called
expressionism the antithesis of humor. ``I believe the artist's
feelings must be sublimated and objectivized through the language
of art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg observed, ``Instead of seeking `contact' (Pollock's
term) with the singular, unattainable self, Steinberg conceived the
theater of Abstract Man, Anybody (and his wife), in their countless
poses, self-disguises and self creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's place in the art world was always in question, as he
well knew: ``I don't quite belong to the art, cartoon or magazine
world, so the art world doesn't quite know where to place me.''
Nonetheless, he made a splash in all three. He did 85 covers and
642 drawings for The New Yorker. He published several books,
including ``All in Line'' (1945), ``The Art of Living'' (1949),
``The Passport'' (1954), ``The Labyrinth''(1960), ``The New World''
(1965), ``The Inspector'' (1973) and ``The Discovery of America''
(1993). From the start his work was often exhibited in the best
museums and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   He had a show at the Galerie Maeght in Paris in 1953 and one at
the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1973. And he had a retrospective at the
Whitney Museum of American Art in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people never stopped asking, ``But is it art?'' And for
many Americans he remained the man who drew the Manhattanite's view
of the world, which first appeared on The New Yorker cover of March
29, 1976. It was subsequently copied in knockoffs made for London,
Paris, Rome, Venice, Kansas City, Durango, wherever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have retired on this painting,'' if royalties had been
paid, he once mused. But they weren't, and he didn't. Finally, sick
of the many knockoffs, he sued Columbia Pictures for an
unauthorized version of the painting used as an advertisement for
the 1984 movie ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' A federal court ruled in
his favor in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg may have been an anomalous presence in the art world,
but that doesn't mean he fit any more comfortably in the cartoon
world. Many cartoonists believe he shunned them. ``Steinberg kept
away from cartoonists,'' Koren recalled. ``Steinberg was not a warm
man. He was chilly and Olympian with a somewhat hauteur tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Koren said, the two were together at a dinner party. ``I
got somewhat in my cups, cheery, and I said, `You know, Saul,
you've been a profound influence on me.' He looked at me chillily
and said, `I would be surprised if I wasn't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Angell said: ``There was a strange combination of things in
Saul. He was a famous person and a private person.'' He was always
thinking about the constrictions of fame. At his retrospective at
the Whitney in 1978, Steinberg spoke about the perils of
``retrospectives'': ``Looking back is a mistake, a taboo. The most
famous example . . . is the wife of Lot (fleeing Sodom) who, by
looking back, became a pillar of salt . . . a monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg once drew a picture titled ``Between Parentheses,''
which appears to be a meditation on his own fame. In the foreground
there are flowers and hills and telephone poles. A parenthesis
floats above the horizon line. Inside it is the date 1905 (not
Steinberg's birth date) followed by a hyphen, followed by a little
man who is being dogged by a dove flying above him with a laurel
wreath that looks like an angel's halo.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg called it ``the portrait of a famous man,'' and this
is how he described it:
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks, followed by his birthday and facing his death day.
That dash hints at his end, eagerly awaited by historians who can
thus officially close the parentheses. The essential thing about
him, and this is the essence of fame, is that he is between
parentheses. He is not free. This monumentalization of people, this
freezing of life, is the terrible curse of the consciousness of
fame. Anybody with instinct destroys conventional fame and misleads
his admirers and biographers by being unreliable and therefore
unpleasant. ... This gives him the possibility of looking instead
of being looked at.''

LAWMAKERS URGE PRESIDENT TO HIRE MORE BORDER AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: CORRECTS word in 6th graf; it's recruits, not conscripts)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional lawmakers, led by Texas Reps. Lamar
Smith, a Republican, and Sylvestre Reyes, a Democrat, attacked
President Clinton Wednesday for failing to comply with a law
requiring him to achieve a net gain of 1,000 Border Patrol agents
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter signed by 47 other House members and 12 senators _
including Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
and Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California _
Smith and Reyes accused the president of surrendering to
traffickers of illegal drugs and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-border drug smuggling and alien smuggling continue to
cost uncounted lives and damages each year ... yet there is no
indication that your border strategy recognizes the emergency
situation,'' Smith and Reyes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing the letter, Rep. Henry Bonilla,
R-Texas, whose district has the longest border in the country with
Mexico, said Congress is ``tired of excuses from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed and the president signed the law
mandating the net addition of 1,000 new Border Patrol agents each
year through 2001. The idea was to double the force from 5,000 to
10,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Border Patrol Chief Gus de la Vina told a Senate
immigration subcommittee that while his agency will hire 1,000 to
1,200 Border Patrol recruits during this fiscal year, the net
addition to the force will be only 200 to 400 agents because of a
high attrition rate of about 800 a year. The 1999 fiscal year ends
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner announced earlier this year that the administration
will hire about 800 agents in fiscal 2000 but will have no net gain
in the number of agents. The INS is the Border Patrol's parent
agency.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Nicole Chulick said the INS asked the
administration for a net gain of 1,000 agents in fiscal 2000 but
the White House dropped the request from its proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the president was ``breaking the law'' by using the
money Congress had allocated for more Border Patrol agents for
other parts of his budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make the president comply with the will of the
people,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators who signed the letter were Spencer Abraham,
R-Mich.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Chulick said the agency's failure to achieve the net gain of
1,000 agents this year results from a tight labor market. ``Like
most employers, we have had a hard time finding qualified
applicants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the INS has done almost
nothing to recruit new agents, adding that other branches of
government, such as the military, have managed to attract
applicants despite similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chulick also said that the White House budget office chose not
to add any new agents in 2000 because it was afraid that the agency
had too many inexperienced agents working in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration felt some time was needed to give the
thousands of agents hired during the past few years a chance to
gain the experience they need to do their jobs correctly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reyes, a former Border Patrol sector chief in El Paso,
said several sectors along the border were staffed primarily by
``very experienced'' agents who would have little trouble training
the new personnel.
</P>
<P>
   To help the Border Patrol attract more applicants, six
southwestern senators, including Hutchison and Gramm, have proposed
legislation to raise base pay from $33,000 to $41,000 for agents
who successfully complete their probationary year. INS estimates
that the pay raise would cost $40 million to $50 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill is designed to redress some of the pay
inequity that currently hampers the agency. The Border Patrol's
loss of about 10 percent of its 8,000-agent workforce stems in part
from the fact that agents move on to higher-paying jobs within the
INS or in other federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators sponsoring the bill are Bingaman, Domenici, Kyl
and McCain.

IN SOUTH KOREA, CRISIS CAUSES MORE WOMEN TO GET INVOLVED IN
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Seoul Journal) 
(rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ As Choi Yang Sook saw it, her place was in
the home, cooking for her husband and cleaning up the house and
raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian economic crisis changed all that, virtually
destroying her husband's architectural design business and forcing
Mrs. Choi to look for ways to make money herself. So now she is
enrolled in a course on how to run a flower shop, and she expects
to start her own flower business this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that women seek jobs,'' said Ms. Choi, a
mother of two teen-agers. ``Some of our husbands have lost jobs,
some have had cuts in salaries, and businessmen have had a hard
time. So women want to help their husbands and maintain the
household.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Asian crisis was particularly harsh on women,
and in South Korea many companies, cutting costs, laid off women
while keeping male employees. But the crisis has also forced women
into the job market alongside their husbands. And the eventual
outcome may be more entrepreneurs and even business executives who
are women.
</P>
<P>
   Among Asians, Korean women have been among the most traditional
of wives and mothers. A few hundred years ago, when a girl was
born, her parents frequently named her Gutsuni, or Last Girl, in
hopes that she would be the last girl born to the family. Even
today property is still generally handed down mostly through men.
</P>
<P>
   These days, young women frequently work after high school or
college, but it is common for them to quit after marrying or having
children. Very rarely have women pursued high-powered careers while
also marrying and raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Now with family finances crimped, those traditions are fading
and women are acquiring greater economic significance in South
Korea. Discrimination against women is at least as intense as ever
in the business world, but women are nonetheless emerging from the
home to help their husbands run start-up restaurants, do the
banking for a new business, or keep the books for the old company
when workers are let go.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ai Ja, a 55-year-old former housewife, was in the office of
Sae Ki Trading Co. the other day. It is her husband's company,
importing chemicals, and she sat behind a corner desk, way across
the room from her husband's spacious and enclosed office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Park seems a stabilizing force in the business. The company
is struggling, and none of her three sons will take it over. But
she says she and her husband are happy because he still has an
office, while many of her husband's friends have been forced out of
their salary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her husband's health is weak, and so they are not thinking
of expanding or starting anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just maintaining the company, and maintaining our
health, which is important,'' Ms. Park said. The office, she added
with a wink, is really for her husband's pride. ``If you don't have
a card, if you don't have a title, people may look down on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women are also venturing out on their own to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men usually stay at a company for a long time; they have
narrow views,'' said Park Kyung Ja, 55, who teaches the class on
how to open flower shops attended by Mrs. Choi. ``But women,
whether at a job or at home, are more open. Their personality is
more broad, they are more adaptable to society.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there is no pain in the process, as Chang
Young Bun _ with her topaz earrings, her flowing white overcoat and
her lion-patterned shirt _ knows well. Ms. Chang, 43, started a
factory with 18 employees making linens, and when she was married
her husband joined the business.
</P>
<P>
   It grew rather successful over the years, as Ms. Chang began
supplying linens to insurance companies, which would then give them
away as gifts to their good customers. At the peak, she earned the
equivalent of $25,000 a month from her business.
</P>
<P>
   Then the economic crisis struck in the fall of 1997 and demand
for linens dropped sharply. As if that was not enough, South Korea
was hit by flooding last summer, and Ms. Chang's factory went under
muddy water, soaking all the curtains, the lace bed covers and
sheets _ her entire inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any friends for six months,'' said Ms. Chang, who
has a 16-year-old daughter in high school. ``I was in confinement,
and if I met somebody, I would just cry.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband have parted ways, and she refuses to discuss
the topic further. She is raising her daughter alone, and now she
has joined Ms. Park's flower shop class and hopes to start afresh
with some of her savings. Ms. Chang is already showing promise.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the three-month course, she has already received
orders for flower arrangements she sent to a friend as a gift, and
for days she stayed up until the wee hours cutting, folding, and
designing paper flower arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can overcome the near comatose state I was in,'' Ms.
Chang said. ``I've always loved flowers. When we had hard times
with the bedding business, I would go out to the flower shops to
console myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women who are breadwinners are forced into that situation,
especially if their husbands have left them, or divorced them. The
divorce rate is still very low in Korea compared with Western
countries, and a divorced woman with children may still feel like
an outcast in Korean society.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chun Kyung Rye is plodding on. A 44-year-old mother with
a son in sixth grade, she went from running her own piano institute
for 17 years to being an investor in the women's wear section of a
department store. When the department store folded, it took all her
savings with it, and she could not return to piano tutoring because
of stricter government rules on private lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is learning how to start up her own flower shop,
Ms. Chun is much more cautious about investments, and she may wait
awhile before she dives into another new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still manage with my savings for me and my son,'' she
said. ``But I had poured all I had into the store, and now I can
barely make ends meet.''

   The afterlife. Today it rivals Vancouver as one of the most
popular movie locations. Ever since Ernst Lubitsch sent a departed
mortal hurtling back to earth in ``Heaven Can Wait,'' heaven itself
has been fascinating Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   When Wim Wenders sent his angels earthward in ``Wings of
Desire,'' a trend was reborn. What with John Travolta, Robin
Williams and Brad Pitt all going celestial, heaven has never been
more hip. Heaven help future historians tempted to interpret this
era's spiritual proclivities from a close reading of recent movies.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, they _ and we _ now have some help from the Japanese
director Hirokazu Kore-eda. His new film, ``After Life'' redefines
our notions of what comes next in a charming fable that's as
profound as it is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' asks its audience to imagine that humans, after
death, enter a sort of purgatory that resembles nothing so much as
an aging school building or government depository. There, a helpful
staff informs them one by one of their status, offers sympathy
(``So sorry for your loss'') and then provides assistance with the
task that confronts them: to choose one memory out of their entire
life to take with them for all eternity. Everything else about
their life on earth will be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Already, ``After Life'' has proved its ability to cast a spell
over its audiences, in part perhaps because of its unusual
combination of fiction and fact. What memory would you take with
you? What would you pick?
</P>
<P>
   In France, the film took the grand prize at the Nantes Festival.
In Argentina, where memory and amnesia regularly duke it out for
ownership of history, it struck a particular chord, picking up a
distributor instantly and winning awards for both Best Picture and
Best Screenplay at the Buenos Aires Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   At festival screenings in the United States, it has acquired
cult status. Even at the Sundance Film Festival, ``After Life''
managed to transfix its notoriously untransfixable crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Kore-eda seems to believe that the very essence of humanity is
memory, if his recent career is any indication. In ``Maborosi,''
the feature debut that brought him international fame in 1995, a
young widow is haunted by grief over her husband's suicide even
after a new marriage offers happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Kore-eda's contemplative regard for this character and the
exquisite gravity with which he invested his images of her memory
and sorrow captured audiences and awards.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Maborosi'' told only part of the story. Kore-eda made
eight documentaries, before and after ``Maborosi,'' exploring the
lives of Japan's outsiders, victims and renegades. The most recent,
``Without Memory,'' tracks the astonishing case of a man who was
the victim of a botched medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   He was left with his memories intact but stripped of the ability
to form new ones. In effect, he remains condemned to an eternal
present excavated by continual forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The third of this trio of memory pictures, ``After Life''
synthesizes the lessons learned along the way. Whereas ``Maborosi''
was a polished fictional construct, this time Kore-eda decided to
retain his documentary style and process. He investigated the
nature of memory by visiting temples, parks and homes for the
elderly to pose his question: If they could carry only one memory
with them after death, which would they choose?
</P>
<P>
   After 6 months and 500 interviews, Kore-eda came to an
unexpected realization. ``Originally, I intended to `steal' their
stories,'' he said through a translator at the Sundance festival.
``But I was so compelled by the authenticity of those stories, and
their facial expressions as they told them, that I realized I could
never beat them and just decided to cast them as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The director's willingness to learn from his own process made
``After Life'' a hybrid in which scripted actors and nonactors are
filmed in the act of actually retrieving their own memories.
Kore-eda eschewed big-movie techniques in favor of natural light,
16-mm cameras and extended shots to avoid unsettling his
nonprofessionals. It's risky , but it pays off brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   One woman particularly captivates audiences. She recalls a
joyous girlhood moment, when her favorite brother bought her a red
dress to wear to a special dance and then showed her off to his
friends afterward. All these years later, she's still intoxicated
by the memory. Other characters recall other memories: the taste of
rice balls cooked in a bamboo grove, the feel of a breeze blowing
in the window of a tram, the sight of clouds in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' is hardly a sober film, however. Its purgatory
staff, for instance, assists the dead by filming their memories,
for their reliving as well as for the collection they solemnly call
``the archives.''
</P>
<P>
   In one hilarious scene, they even order up a lifetime of
surveillance videos for a man who needs a refresher course on his
own life. A documentary filmmaker all his life, Kore-eda cannot
resist poking fun at the film production process itself while
gently considering the relationship between a film crew and its
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is memory and its unreliability, its vagaries and
gaps, that fascinate Kore-eda. ``I developed this idea, at a young
age, that you forget everything, and then you die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He forged such beliefs in his own childhood, living with a
grandfather who started losing his lucidity, then developed
dementia and senility as Kore-eda grew up. Alzheimer's had not yet
been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, he no longer recognized our faces,'' Kore-eda
recalled. ``Finally, he could not recognize his own.'' Haunted by
this experience, Kore-eda imagined an alternative: ``What if you
got to hold onto one thing?'' Out of this idea, first conceived 10
years ago, Kore-eda developed ``After Life.''
</P>
<P>
   His film continually challenges viewers to sift and sort
artifice from authenticity, yet the line between the fictional and
the factual can never be entirely clarified. One character, for
example, recalls her life of prostitution, then chooses to remember
a tender encounter that was the exception to the rule. Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   Her story changes drastically as she gets deeper into its
telling. Surely she must be an actress with a script? Not quite.
Now an actress, she was once a well-known Japanese porn star.
</P>
<P>
   Kore-eda noted how the film's production was shaped by unusual
transformations: ``There was a script, but the actors on the set
were so moved by the stories of the real people that they began to
insert their own lives into the script. She wanted to tell this
story.'' It's not surprising to learn that the film's title was
suggested by a Japanese vaudeville expression meaning ``neither
here nor there.''
</P>
<P>
   If audiences wonder to what extent ``After Life'' reflects
Japanese attitudes toward life after death, Kore-eda avoids
grandiose claims. Asked about whether the bells heard tolling in
``After Life'' are a reference to the 108 chimes at Japanese New
Year for the 108 sins of man, he said, ``I think I just like the
sound of bells.''
</P>
<P>
   He happily discusses a range of Japanese faiths: that there is a
heaven and hell; that there is nothing after death, according to
scientific empiricism; that the divide between the brain and the
objective world is no longer clear. He links this last view to
Oliver Sacks' study ``A Leg to Stand On,'' which has had a great
influence in promoting the idea of mind-body connection in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In Kore-eda's films, what stands out most is the compassion with
which characters are imbued. This is a director who is infinitely
patient, prepared to wait and to listen. Perhaps this capacity for
empathy was forged in childhood, when his family experienced
Japan's postwar economic boom of the 1960s within the confines of a
poor Tokyo neighborhood called Gumma.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was very poor,'' he said. ``We drew our water from a
well, our bath was heated with firewood. It was hardly evocative of
metropolitan Tokyo life.''
</P>
<P>
   If his grandfather lost memory, his father retained it: ``He was
in the military. He became a prisoner of war in Manchuria and spent
two years at hard labor in Siberia. I believe that the deaths of
his fellow POWs and friends in the camps in Siberia had a major
impact on his life.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, in turn, loved to watch Hollywood movies on
television, especially ``those starring Joan Fontaine or Ingrid
Bergman,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It is out of this mix of pleasure and deprivation, trauma and
memory, that Kore-eda has emerged as one of Japan's most original
cinematic talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' taps into a wellspring of emotion in audiences
drawing on intensely different public and political histories. In
Japan, its sold-out screenings are a striking phenomenon for a
culture that prefers to dismiss its memories. As Kore-eda points
out, ``The Japanese, after all, at the end of every year have a
bonenkai, literally, a year-forgetting party, in which all the
events of that year are put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a party is unimaginable, of course, in American culture,
where memory can be malleable or marketable, exposed on daytime
television or sold on the memoir circuit, rewritten or restored,
but never discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, ``After Life'' has riveted audiences. People leave
the theater strangely silent, caught up in revery, perhaps
reviewing the events of their life. Kore-eda, by fashioning a story
of death and memory, has slyly delivered a movie that reaffirms
life _ and the magic of movies.

 &HT;    YELTSIN FIRES PRIMAKOV, SETTING UP ANOTHER SHOWDOWN WITH DUMA
 &HT;    850&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By JULIA SHARGORODSKA 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin plunged the country
into political turmoil once again Wednesday, firing Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and replacing him with Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, a longtime ally.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of a new prime minister, the fourth in fourteen
months, sets the stage for yet another showdown with the
Communist-controlled State Duma, the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The sacking of Primakov, who was popular with the Duma, comes on
the eve of the start of impeachment hearings against Yeltsin in the
lower house -- which Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said would go ahead
as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma will attempt to muster the 300 votes needed to impeach
Yeltsin, while the president threatens to dissolve the Duma if it
does not confirm his choice of prime minister in three votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If yesterday about 300 could have voted for his impeachment,
now there will be 400 of them,'' Seleznyov predicted, adding that
confirmation hearings on the new prime minister wouldn't begin for
a week -- the maximum time frame allowed under the Russian
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are busy with another procedure right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zakharin, deputy general director of the Policy
Foundation, a Russian think tank, said dissolving the Duma could
make the country spiral into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency markets and stock markets could fall, and Russia's
role as a negotiator in the Yugoslavia would have to start from
zero,'' he said. ``The IMF would again have to rethink its
relations with the government. And if the government doesn't
receive the ($7.5 billion in foreign loans), the ruble falls and
the situation in Yugoslavia becomes worse, it could cancel Duma
elections on the premise that there isn't any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the popular Primakov's sacking have been
circulating for weeks, as Yeltsin grew more disapproving of
Primakov's cooperation with the Communist dominated duma. Three
weeks ago, Yeltsin ceded Primakov's negotiating powers in the
Kosovo crisis to former prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who
would report directly to Yeltsin. It was clearly a slap in the face
for Primakov, who had served as Foreign Minister before his
appointment as prime minister last September -- replacing
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   While Primakov's powers have been eroding, Stepashin's have been
on the rise. On April 27, Yeltsin brushed aside Primakov's
right-hand man and appointed Stepashin first deputy prime minister
in addition to his duties as Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov tried to put a positive light on the situation in his
farewell address to the Cabinet Wednesday, which was met with a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government has nothing to be ashamed about. We performed
our responsibilities professionally and well,'' Primakov said. He
said he would remember his eight-month tenure in the government
``with great pleasure and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who was also deputy prime minister, said Yeltsin's
appointment came as a surprise to him. He praised the government
for stabilizing the economic and political situation in the
country, and said he would continue the economic course and fulfill
all agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's dismissal sent the Russian stock market sharply
lower, and trading was suspended twice over the course of
Wednesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Moscow on Wednesday, news of the
government turnover was met with little reaction. People riding the
subway continued to read Tuesday's newspapers and do crossword
puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the same to me who (is prime minister),'' said a 40
year old teacher, who refused to give her name. ``There was
something of a beginning of stability. I think the president did it
so it wouldn't get too boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, in a televised address to the nation, gave
contradictory reasons for firing Primakov. While praising Primakov
for stabilizing the economic situation following the August 17
crisis, Yeltsin criticized Primakov for not doing enough to spur
economic growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He said Primakov's government ``fully accomplished their
tactical assignment'' although ``we are still tapping in place in
the economic sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   There is currently ``no basis for serious and stable economic
growth,'' Yeltsin said, adding that the decision couldn't be
postponed until the Duma elections -- scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that the entire economic activity of the
government is linked only to negotiations with the IMF,'' Yeltsin
said, ``as if the treatment of the Russian economy depends solely
on the extension of Western credits.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF had tentatively agreed to give Russia $4.5 billion in
new loans, and the World Bank had promised an additional $3 billion
loan for Russia, which is now on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just about to try and conclude our arrangements for a
$3 billion package,'' World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in
Washington. ``But now we don't have a government to deal with, and,
until there is a new government, clearly there is nothing more we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   An IMF spokesman in Washington said nothing had been decided so
far on implementing the loan. The IMF is in contact with the
Central Bank and technical experts in the Russian government, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (ED: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts and Duma deputies strongly criticized Yeltsin's
move, saying
</P>
<P>
   it set the stage for a new political crisis as the Duma seeks to
carry out impeachment before Yeltsin dissolves it.
</P>
<P>
   Zakharin, of the Policy Foundation, said the real reason behind
Primakov's firing is that in Yeltsin's opinion, he didn't do enough
to protect his interests in the Duma. While the lower house is
moving ahead with an impeachment vote, the upper house recently
voted to reinstate Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov, whom Yeltsin
tried to fire after Skuratov was allegedly found in a sauna with a
group of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a matter of disapproval with the economic course, he
would appoint a prime minister with an economic orientation, and he
doesn't know Stepashin's economic plan,'' Zakharin said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matvienko said Primakov
plans to resume work at the Russian Academy of Sciences and write a
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on,'' she said.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ During one of our first meetings with
humanitarian workers in Iraq, we were told that economic sanctions
have not only caused the deaths of thousands of children each
month, but have created a breakdown of the family structure, with
many children now forced to help with the family income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are too important to become a pawn of politics,''
Anupama Rao Singh, the United Nations Children's Fund
representative in Iraq, told us.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen children dying in the hospitals of the city.
Elsewhere we saw the effects of the family breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Walid, 14, and his brother Ramy, 15, have been working the
streets of Baghdad for eight years, the same length of time
sanctions have been in place. They live in a dark two-room
apartment with three younger stepbrothers and their mother and
father.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient TV droned on in the background while their mother
explained their situation, which she blamed on poor economic
conditions as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who was a butcher, lost his shop shortly after the
Persian Gulf War and hasn't worked since. The mother had an
untreated thyroid condition and couldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The father sent the younger boys to school, but Walid and Ramy
are his stepchildren and didn't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the older boys shined shoes on the streets around the
Palestine and Sheraton hotels to support the family. Walid and Ramy
both were quick to make friends among the members of the Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Walid had a wide smile and he could sing _ in English _ ``My
Heart Will Go On,'' the theme song from the movie ``Titanic.'' Ramy
was slower to smile, but, with his freckles, he conjured up an
image of Huck Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Not a day went by that the boys couldn't be found shining some
delegate's shoes at 50 cents a pop, making them, for a while
anyway, among the highest paid workers in Baghdad. The delegates
often got two shoeshines a day. Baghdad is a dusty city.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage in downtown Baghdad was clean and bright and the
children, who ranged from week-old infants to 5-year-olds, wore
identical colorful pajamas. There were almost as many women
volunteers as children on view.
</P>
<P>
   The number of orphanages in Iraq is growing along with the
divorce and suicide rates, and as more families abandon children,
according to humanitarian workers in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, appropriately called Government House Orphanage,
had government showcase written all over it. Its director, Bayon
Hasui Ali, a woman with six years of experience working at
orphanages, said the volunteers were all women because this kind of
work required a woman. She said many Iraq and foreign officials had
visited her orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage was supported by the government and by wealthy
donors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ali, whose job it is to escort members of the news media
wherever they want to go during their stay in Baghdad, translated
while the orphans sang songs of welcome to the visiting
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a teacher,'' the
children chanted in unison, with one little boy stepping out and
shaking his fist emphatically to the last words of the verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a farmer,'' the
children chanted, and another little boy stepped out from the group
and shook his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father Saddam Hussein shows us how to be a soldier,'' the
children chanted. This time an older girl stepped out from the
group and said, ``And we will kill the American invaders.'' The
children smiled and clapped their hands.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Not long after we arrived in Baghdad, Hans von Sponeck, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, told us that the
sanctions ``are turning the social structure upside down.'' We
didn't have to go far to see what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   On the street along the Tigris River, not far from the Palestine
Hotel, a nervous-looking man approached me, thinking I was a member
of the WPSR delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask your help,'' he said, speaking softly in perfect
English. ``I'm a doctor, and I'm fed up with working in this
country. I want to leave. I'm thinking about leaving my
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned he was talking to a reporter, he said I must
never use his name or where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would kill me and my entire family if they found out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't live here watching people die, with his
family suffering as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the father of a baby boy,'' he said, ``but I'm not happy
because I can't imagine his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor blamed the sanctions, but his No. 1 concern, at the
moment, was whether I would help him if he and his family got out
of the country. I said I didn't know what I could do, but I gave
him my business card, and he said I would hear from him very soon.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter probably lasted less time than it took to write
about it.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   At a school not far from the Palestine Hotel last month, dozens
of smiling students welcomed American visitors warmly, then sang
songs about Saddam Hussein and about killing American invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a picture of Saddam Hussein,'' a bright-eyed cherub
chanted. ``I like it very much, very much.'' Nothing personal was
intended; it was just the morning ritual.
</P>
<P>
   In an art class, several student paintings showed boys and girls
firing guns at warplanes bearing U.S. ensignias. One picture showed
tombstones with a caption written in Arabic that said, ``Martyrs
are better than us all.''
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet residential district, a single-story building built
around a large courtyard served as a military training school for
members of the Baath Party, Iraq's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, for two hours a day, for one month, every member of
the party, male and female, is required to learn how to fire an
AK-47 assault rifle, administer emergency first aid, and march in
formation. The training session we observed, at least the women's
class, seemed to require a lot of marching in formation.
</P>
<P>
   The women, all looking quite healthy and prosperous in
fashionable dresses, high-heels and makeup, watched carefully while
male soldiers showed them how to aim the rifles. Then each woman
practiced pulling back the bolt and aiming at an imaginary enemy
across the courtyard. In this class, the target was often the
Post-Intelligencer photographer or reporter. We assumed the rifles
weren't loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the soldiers said more than 1 million members
of the Baath Party went through this militia training last year.
The party wants everyone to be prepared, he said, in case Iraq is
invaded.
</P>
<P>
   As the women did a modified goose-step around the courtyard,
they sang a verse or two from a song that roughly translated as,
``Saddam Hussein will always remain in power no matter what the
Americans do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the troop of women marched by, one rather tall, heavily made
up, husky-looking woman in a masculine-looking suit-dress winked at
me, and her dark red lips broke into a wide grin. I laughed, but I
was flattered. And I knew then it was time to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers gathered them together for one last group photo,
with the carefully coiffed women holding their AK-47s high in the
air, and we said goodbye. My new friend broke formation long enough
for a little wave.

   The New York Times plans a page of coverage on the resignation
of Treasury Secretary Rubin and the appointment of Lawrence Summers
to succeed him:
</P>
<P>
   RUBIN-RESIGN (Washington) _ Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin,
whose insistence on deficit reduction early in the Clinton
administration helped propel the American economy to its strongest
performance in generations, announced today that he was resigning.
Clinton said he would nominate as Rubin's successor Lawrence H.
Summers, currently the deputy secretary of the Treasury, a longtime
ally of Rubin's and the day-to-day manager of a succession of
international financial crises that have rocked the global economy
over the past three years. By John M. Broder and David E. Sanger.

<P>
   RUBIN-ASSESS (Washington) _ There is a case to be made that his
approach exacerbated the global financial crisis of the last few
years. He could be politically tone deaf, as when he initially
resisted efforts in Congress to overhaul the IRS. At times he was
stubborn and turf conscious, traits on display in his continuous
battle with the Fed's Alan Greenspan to preserve the Treasury
Department's powers as a bank regulator. But the enduring fact
about Robert E. Rubin is that he was consistently the most
influential voice in shaping economic policy through more than six
years in which the economy performed remarkably well, bringing
great benefits to the United States and incalculable political
advantage to his boss, President Clinton. An news analysis by
Richard W. Stevenson. (1200 words)

<P>
   RUBIN-SUMMERS (Washington) _ A profile of the Treasury
appointee: He arrived in Washington six years ago with a reputation
for brilliance and an equal reputation for intolerance. But in the
past year or two, a new Larry Summers has emerged _ one who has
tamed his sharp-edged wit, who regularly solicits key congressmen
and senators for their advice, who now occasionally admits to
errors of political judgment. As he trained to take over the most
visible job in the world economy, he has become, one close
associate at the Treasury said recently, ``more Rubin-esqe.'' By
David E. Sanger. (900 words)

   MARKET (New York) _ After a 200 point drop in the Dow on the
announcement of Rubin's resignation, markets strengthened. At the
close, the Dow industrials were down 25, the S&AMP;P was little
changed, and the Nasdaq composite up 39 points. European markets
were little changed. In Asian trading, the Nikkei closed 1.22
percent higher, and Hong Kong stocks rose 1.08 percent. On the
credit markets at midday the 30-year bond was yielding 5.81
percent. By Jonathan Fruebringer.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS SCOLD CLINTON ON BORDER PATROL HIRING LAG
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers from both parties charged Wednesday that
security is deteriorating along U.S. borders and scolded President
Clinton for failing to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents a year
as required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In an escalation of grumbling from Capitol Hill, the members
protested that only about 200 new agents will be hired this year
and that no additional agents are planned for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, cross-border drug smuggling and alien smuggling
continue to cost uncounted lives and damages each year, and
terrorists may enter the United States at any time,'' said a letter
to Clinton signed by 49 representatives and 12 senators, most of
them from border areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the House subcommittee on
immigration, blamed an ``apparent lack of interest in protecting
Americans'' and ``bureaucratic bungling'' for the failure to
recruit the additional agents.
</P>
<P>
   He said the current 8,000 border agents, fewer than the police
force of Chicago, was not nearly enough to guard the nation's 4,000
miles of southern borders and 2,000 miles of border to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense of urgency'' about the problem, said Rep.
Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, a 26-year veteran of the Border Patrol.
``There is no serious effort by the (Immigration and Naturalization
Service) to comply with this mandate'' to hire more agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're missing is will,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who said that Clinton ``wants to spend this money on other
things.'' His fellow Texas Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
echoed that view, saying that border areas were being treated as a
``stepchild.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the lawmakers spoke in the U.S. Capitol, the
president was in the Rose Garden announcing $95 million in new
grants as part of his signature program to hire 100,000 community
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration offered no assurance that it would
meet the congressional demands.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Chulick, spokesperson for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the agency was ``challenged in meeting
this goal'' of finding 1,000 qualified new agents because the
booming economy offers too much competition for qualified
applicants. ``It's the same as in the military,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has added a toll-free number in the past week and
stepped up visits to military bases and colleges, she said, but the
ranks of agents is still expected to grow by only 200 to 400 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Border patrol agents are paid less than drug enforcement
officials, but the administration has the authority to raise pay
and has not done so. Chulick said INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
``has been studying that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Attorney General Janet Reno told Congress early this year
that the INS has hired new agents so rapidly that the service has
too high a proportion of new recruits. She urged a temporary halt
in hiring in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   That idea was rebuffed by lawmakers on Wednesday. ``We cannot,
as some have suggested, take a break in our fight against illegal
immigration and drug trafficking,'' Reyes said. ``Border
communities deserve full, complete attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, said the dangers along the Mexican
border are reaching the critical stage. He said some ranchers in
his border district check their cattle in the evening only with
their wives accompanying them with a gun as protection from drug
smugglers. ``We're tired of excuses,'' he said.

   BAGHDAD,IRAQ: for a little wave.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   In an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Baghdad, a woman said
she was trying to persuade her brother, a well-known surgeon, to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can only survive here because my mother gives him money,''
she said as her eyes filled with tears. ``All of our inheritance is
being used up; we will have nothing for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose 10-year-old Toyota was one of the few cars I'd
seen in Iraq that didn't have crumpled fenders and a cracked
windshield, said her two young children would have the opportunity
to get advanced degrees here if they wanted to, but they would have
nothing to look forward to after they graduated.
</P>
<P>
   A painting on the wall of her clean, modern house traced her
husband's family tree back to the prophet Mohammed. The woman was a
college graduate and her family came from a long line of
intellectuals _ her father obtained an advanced degree in the
United States. Her husband, who ran a business, came from a family
of soldiers and merchants. He had spent four years on the front
lines during the war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   She wore modern dresses, but covered her head with a scarf, a
nod to tradition that kept her from getting a decent job in
business, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (modern businessmen) want younger women who dress in
short skirts,'' she said. Even her daughter, she said, refuses to
wear a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she had heard so much about the new diseases
making a comeback under the sanctions that she worried about her
children's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, if my brother goes abroad, he can make money and
help us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   We had come to Iraq expecting that suspicious government
officials would watch our every move. We feared people would hate
us because we came from the country whose warplanes were bombing
some part of their country almost daily. But we found that most
people were warm and friendly. The first thing people wanted to
know was where we were from. After hearing we were from the United
States, the next thing they said was ``welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   And we found that amid the death and destruction, the squalor
and deterioration of Baghdad, that life _ and love _ go on.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   The Palestine Hotel, the Baghdad home for the Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility delegation, was the host to 51
wedding parties on a Thursday night. Friday is the only day off for
most Iraqis (Christians also get Sundays off) so Thursday has
become the day of choice for getting married. The one-day honeymoon
beats no honeymoon at all.
</P>
<P>
   Marriages in Iraq are almost always arranged by families. The
couple is accompanied to the hotel, and often right up to the room,
by a crowd of relatives and other well-wishers and by musicians
playing horns and drums. Most of the couples wore Western-style
wedding clothes _ the women's outfits were especially elaborate
with large hoop skirts and long veils.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was repeated across the road at the Sheraton, and
according to the Palestine Hotel manager, similar celebrations were
going on at several other of the nicer hotels around Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   One wedding party took over the Palestine Hotel ballroom for the
night, and filled it with about 400 wedding guests.
</P>
<P>
   Several young men standing at the door of the ballroom waved us
in and showed us to the center of the room where the bride and
groom were seated on a stage while relatives and friends crowded
around them for photo opportunities. The groom even invited his new
guests up on stage to pose for wedding pictures with himself and
the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men formed a line and danced for us. Their
wild gyrations and laughter suggested that the Muslim prohibition
of alcohol might have been temporarily suspended for this occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is sold openly by stores in Baghdad, but it can be
consumed only in private.
</P>
<P>
   The groom's brother, Amar Karim Kitan (we spoke in Spanish) said
the couple could afford the lavish celebration _ a dinner for all
the guests and a live band _ because Hadi, the new husband, was a
car dealer. His brother was a very modern man and would take only
one wife, although four wives are allowed, Amar said.
</P>
<P>
   The party lasted all night. The Post-Intelligencer's reporter
and photographer didn't.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Abu Ali, the journalists were allowed into two large
mosques in Baghdad. After checking our shoes at the entrance of the
first mosque, Abu Ali made a path through the worshipers to the
front of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi TV crew had already set up its camera and microphone.
It was Friday, the Muslim holy day, and we were shown to an area of
the mosque that was packed with men. The women and children,
according to custom, worship separately.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard outside the mosque, we were warmly welcomed by
the clerics but inside, at the front of the room, the atmosphere
was less welcoming. The religious leader's sermon was animated and
the word America seemed to pop up frequently, and when it did, many
eyes shifted our way.
</P>
<P>
   It felt good to get outside, in the courtyard, again. But on the
way out, the man who gave the sermon, broad-shouldered and more
than 6 feet tall, suddenly appeared with an entourage of disciples
and asked where we were from and who we were. After learning we
were journalists from the United States, he said, ``You are
welcome.'' Then he instructed us to send him a copy of whatever we
do. He wasn't the kind of man who would take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the second, more historic Golden Mosque, we decided to
wander through the immense courtyard surrounding the inner-prayer
hall. Pilgrims were sprawled along the outer walls. Entire
families, some with sickly looking infants, appeared to have taken
up residence there.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ali said many families were waiting for their relatives to
return from the annual Hadj pilgrimage to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, a
trip every Muslim is required to make at least once in their lives
if it is economically possible.
</P>
<P>
   There were many soldiers visiting the Golden Mosque, and we were
challenged several times, but each time, Abu Ali flashed his ID and
we were free to continue our visit.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Nestled on the banks of the Tigris River across from the
Palestine Hotel, the tea house became a late-night ritual for many
members of the WPSR delegtion. For a few cents, you could sit among
crowds of Iraqis _ men on the inside, women and men outside _ and
drink heavily sugared hot tea and smoke flavored tobacco from a
large water pipe.
</P>
<P>
   For a few cents more, the waiter would bring dominoes, which
seemed to be widely popular. The low murmur of conversations was
frequently interrupted by the click, click, click sound of the
wooden domino rectangles as they slapped against the tables to
cries of victory or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Tea was served in small, clear glasses nearly one-third filled
with roughly-granulated sugar. The water pipe, with a choice of
peach-, apple- or berry-flavored mild tobacco, was more than 3 feet
tall, and was usually placed to one side of the table, with only
the hose passed among the smokers. The combination of sweet tea and
flavored tobacco was such a relaxing treat that even non-smokers
often shared the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Street children often hovered in the background, eager to run
errands or shine shoes, and often some of the children would join
us at the table for a treat _ a Pepsi or the big splurge, a Coke.
Pepsi was produced in Iraq; Coke was imported.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, a couple of women from the WPSR delegation
broke the taboo on having women inside the tea house, but the men
there seemed non-plussed. The waiters served them and eventually
the boredom of it all drove them back outside with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   With the stars overhead and good company at hand, we talked of
mundane things throughout the night. Malnutrition, dying children
and the sanctions that fully occupied our days were rarely
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   -- -- --
</P>
<P>
   Sabehna Jasim smiled and straightened her black robe and warmly
welcomed us into her home.
</P>
<P>
   We had come looking for a better vantage point to photograph the
farmers' market that ran along the street on one side of her
building. Her second-story apartment overlooking the intersection
of two streets was perfect. Abu Ali, whose job is to assist foreign
journalists, conveyed our request and translated during our visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim took us out onto the balcony for a better view. After
reluctantly acquiescing to our requests to pose for photos, she
insisted on making us tea.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other members of the family lived there in three small
rooms. In the hallway, a retarded woman sat on the floor and helped
one of Jasim's granddaughters shell peas. She smiled and murmured
softly each time we passed her in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   In a place of honor, dominating the living room wall, was a
photo of a young officer in uniform. It was Jasim's first-born son.
He had been killed by U.S. forces during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's widow smiled shyly at the guests and helped serve
tea.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, the UNICEF representative, in Baghdad, said economic
sanctions have caused a breakdown of the family structure, with
many children now forced to help support their families and
dropping out of the educational system.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen some evidence of these problems _ street children
begging for handouts, shoeshine boys working late into the night,
children sitting on the floors of underfunded classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jasim's home, the family remains strong. The children go
to school. A son and a daughter have jobs. And it was clear that
the strong-willed 70-year-old Jasim was the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an hour taking photos and talking. Times are hard,
Jasim said. The U.N. food rations always run out at least a week
before the end of the month. There is work, but little pay. The
sanctions are no good, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hated President Bush, and when reminded that he was
no longer president, she said President Clinton was just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim said she had no hard feelings for Americans. She said she
blamed the government of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are the same everywhere,'' she said. ``Only governments
are different.''
</P>
<P>
   When we left, Jasim told us we were always welcome in her home.
So, just before leaving Baghdad, we went back, taking the family a
present in gratitude for their help and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Jasim excitedly ushered us into her apartment, and informed us
with great satisfaction that we had, by our last visit, made her
the toast of her little part of the town.
</P>
<P>
   And, once again, despite our pleas, she insisted on serving us
tea, cheese and bread that a grandson fetched fresh from a nearby
bakery.

stroller over that spot, as their kids rode a bike, or as someone

ITALY WATCHES PRESIDENTIAL RACE, FOR INTRIGUE MORE THAN ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ On Thursday, the Italian Parliament will begin selecting
the next president of Italy, a largely ceremonial figure.
</P>
<P>
   But for Italians, the back-room process is not a dull civic
exercise; it is the nation's equivalent of David Lynch's bizarre
television series, ``Twin Peaks.'' Months in advance, newspapers,
politicians and soothsayers keep track of elliptical signs and
veiled political maneuvering, and the only certainty is that things
are not what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election of the Italian president is a game played behind
closed doors in which some oligarchs choose their doge according to
a secret pact,'' Sergio Romano, a former Italian ambassador,
explained in a recent column for Corriere Della Sera, a Milan
daily. ``The political parties never declare their full intentions
and limit their exchanges to elusive messages.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only Italian to wax indignant about a process that
seems a throwback to Venetian court intrigue. But actually, the
baroque exercise may be a way for Italians to purge their passion
for dietrologia _ the Italian science of seeking the hidden motives
behind an act _ on an election that while significant, does not
determine the fate of the nation. The seven-year term of the
current president, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, 80, expires this month.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, no major political party had put forward an
official candidate. Transparency in the presidential race is
considered unseemly and politically obtuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema hopes to set a precedent. In
an effort to avoid delaying tactics and the appearance of back-room
politics as usual, D'Alema Wednesday held a flurry of meetings with
key leaders in his majority and the opposition, and persuaded all
of them to back his choice. That was Treasury Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, 78, who is widely credited with securing Italy's
entry into the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no guarantee that the deal would stick once
voting, by secret ballot, begins on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are several other figures who had been described as
front-runners, particularly on talk shows or elaborate newspaper
charts. One is Nicola Mancino, 67, the president of the Senate,
whose small Popular Party, a Catholic movement, has provided
crucial support to the governing center-left coalition of D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   But the Popular Party has also been lobbying on behalf of Rosa
Russo Jervolino, 62, the minister of Interior, a Catholic who
fought against the legalization of divorce in the 1970s. She has
told reporters that she is not worthy of the office, and that
display of reticence instantly convinced Italy's political class
that she was a serious candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one candidate openly running for the office, Emma
Bonino, 51, the European Union's humanitarian aid commissioner. In
a brazen departure from tradition, her followers have set up voter
petition drives, raised funds by selling ``Emma for President''
T-shirts, and sent campaign letters to all elected officials who
can vote in the presidential race, a lack of delicacy that
political experts view as sealing her doom.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Italy has tried to reform its unwieldy
and chronically unstable political system, with only moderate
success. At least 16 political parties have seats in Parliament.
Last month, a national referendum to put an end to proportional
representation and move toward a two-party system narrowly failed
to attract enough voters to pass.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, Parliament will have a chance to debate a bill
to allow voters to directly elect the president.
</P>
<P>
   For now, presidents are elected by 1,010 grand electors, made up
of senators, members of the lower house of Parliament and 58
leaders from regional councils.
</P>
<P>
   Italian presidents mostly unveil plaques and greet foreign
dignitaries, but one reason political parties work so passionately
behind the scenes is that presidents also have the right to
dissolve Parliament when a government collapses.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, D'Alema said his effort to reach a consensus
was a ``sign that shows the sense of responsibility of our
political forces.''

SAUL STEINBERG, 84, CELEBRATED `NEW YORKER' CARTOONIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: this obituary is a shortened version of OBIT-STEINBERG,
which was about 2,500 words and moved earlier.) 
(bl) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saul Steinberg, the metaphysically minded artist and
cartoonist and brooding doodler whose drawings appeared in The New
Yorker for more than half a century, elevating comic illustration
into fine art, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg was compared with Picasso, Klee, Miro, Duchamp,
Daumier, Beckett, Pirandello, Ionesco, Chaplin and Joyce. Art
critic Harold Rosenberg called Steinberg ``a writer of pictures, an
architect of speech and sounds, a draftsman of philosophical
reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg was known to most people, as he lamented late in
life, as ``the man who did that poster.'' That poster, one of the
most famous American drawings, portrays a New Yorker's
short-sighted view of the rest of the world, in which everything in
the landscape recedes according to its cultural distance from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg was not, at least in spirit, an inhabitant of
that provincial metropolis he drew. Born in Romania, a country he
called pure Dada, and educated in Italy, the home of Surrealism and
fascism, he lived most of his life in the United States. He was
enthralled and appalled by America. The Chrysler Building, Uncle
Sam, the Easter Bunny, Lady Liberty, Mickey Mouse, crocodiles
crawling the city streets, police cars and post offices kept
creeping into his drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg was born on June 15, 1914, near Bucharest, the
son of a businessman. As a young man, he moved to Italy and
received a doctoral degree in architecture from the Reggio
Politecnico in Milan in 1940. He began his artistic career while
still in architecture school, and never designed a single building.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoned lines, and lines that reasoned, became his stock in
trade. ``The doodle is the brooding of the hand,'' Steinberg once
said.
</P>
<P>
   Often his drawings poked fun at the art of drawing, the artist
growing out of his own pen and winding up as a square or becoming
entangled in his own rococo fancies or unable to break out of a
never-ending spiral.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, he fled fascist Italy for the United States, but he was
deported to Santo Domingo because the tiny quota for Romanians was
already filled. From there he sent The New Yorker some cartoons,
hoping the magazine would support his entry into the United States.
Eventually that happened. But his art preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   His first New Yorker drawing appeared on Oct. 25, 1941: an
artist's playful rendition of a reverse centaur, one with a man's
rear end and a horse's head. Steinberg himself arrived in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   1943 was momentous for Steinberg. He had his first American
one-man show, at the Wakefield Gallery in Manhattan. He married
Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, a painter. (They were separated in the
1970s but never divorced, and she survives him.) And on the same
day that he became a U.S. citizen he was given an ensign's
commission in the Navy. Steinberg was sent to North Africa and
Italy by the the Office of Strategic Services to draw cartoons that
would inspire anti-Nazi resistance within Germany.
</P>
<P>
   During the war The New Yorker published Steinberg's visual
reports from Asia, North Africa and Europe and satiric drawings of
Nazis, and pictures of GIs bewildered by Europe and waiting for
mail from home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, the year Steinberg was discharged from the Navy, he
received his first major recognition as an artist when his work was
included in a show at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   After the war his style changed, becoming more abstract,
philosophical and symbolic. In the 1950s he devised a whole roster
of characters: cats, sphinxes and empty-looking men and women, then
crocodiles (his emblem for primitive political society), horses and
knights. Women in his drawings also appeared as heroic medieval
knights: with spiked heels, makeup that resembled war paint and
handbags and umbrellas that looked like weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s Steinberg's work was filled with geometrical forms,
baroque comic-strip balloons, letters of the alphabet, numbers,
punctuation marks, false passports, stamps, legal documents and
government regulations on matters like dragons and monologues.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and '70s Steinberg branched out. He did
architectural fantasies, watercolor landscapes and vicious pictures
of New York street life that indicated a pessimism about urban
life: Mickey Mouse as a terrorist, doormen as saluting soldiers,
building facades as frightening mazes.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg always portrayed America with a mixture of bemusement
and mockery. He traveled to all 50 states. He was fond of diners,
motels, kidney-shaped swimming pools and highways, and he thought
the country was best seen from the height of a bus window. He was a
European sophisticate posing as a regular American guy. But he
remained an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinberg arrived in New York around the same time as
some of the Abstract Expressionists and collected the works of de
Kooning, Klee, Picasso and others, he saw himself working against
the expressionist grain. He once called expressionism the
antithesis of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's place in the art world was always in question, as he
well knew: ``I don't quite belong to the art, cartoon or magazine
world, so the art world doesn't quite know where to place me.''
Nonetheless, he made a splash in all three. He did 85 covers and
642 drawings for The New Yorker. He published several books, and
from the start his work was often exhibited in the best museums and
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people never stopped asking, ``But is it art?''
</P>
<P>
   And, for many Americans, Steinberg remained the man who drew the
Manhattanite's view of the world, which first appeared on The New
Yorker cover of March 29, 1976. It was subsequently copied in
knockoffs made for London, Paris, Rome, Venice, Kansas City,
Durango, wherever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have retired on this painting'' if royalties had been
paid, he once mused. But they weren't, and he didn't.

 &HT;    TRAINING FOR APACHE HELICOPTER PILOTS IN ALBANIA 'MENTALLY'
TOUGH
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWK BASE, Albania _ Flying an Apache helicopter leaves Matt
``absolutely exhausted,'' he says, not so much from physical
demands but from the mental concentration of flying the gun- and
missile-laden aircraft at low altitudes, at night, over hilly
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening terrain -- like that not far from this gathering
point for America's Apache helicopters near the Kosovo border.
Enemy terrain -- like that not far from the green drab colored
tents that are home to Matt and the other Apache pilots between
simulated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Matt -- military censors would not allow him to be identified
any further -- is from the West Point class of 1996, husky, single,
of medium build, easy going and for the last 15 months the
``driver,'' as he calls it, of one of America's most lethal killing
machines -- the AH-65 Apache attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   He belongs to the ``Pale Riders'' troop of the Six Shooters
Squadron of the 12th Aviation Regiment from Illesheim, Germany.
Most squadrons have their own personality, and his is made up of
mostly single guys who like to party. But the squadron patch on the
shoulder of their grey flight suits underscore the serious nature
of their jobs: Ducit Amor Patriae -- ``For Love of Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt spent four months last year on ``peacekeeping'' duty with
the Apaches in Bosnia. Now, with some four dozen other Apache
``drivers,'' he is training for attacks in the event that NATO
deploys the killer choppers against Yugoslav forces in embattled
Kosovo province. The Apache force sees itself as ``the tip of the
spear'' in any ground assault on Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   The training takes place mostly after dark, so Matt tries to
sleep in his tent in the daytime. The sun is murder, though, and
sleeping is nearly impossible in the heat and mud and tension of
Task Force Hawk. Even so, ``no matter how bad it gets here, it can
never be as bad as it was in the first year at the Academy,'' Matt
told reporters Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after every training mission and the post-mission
de-briefing, Matt tries to force himself to sleep, even though he
is still keyed up. ``I don't want to be drowsy when I'm flying,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt's tent could hold up to 12 people, but he shares it with
only one other pilot. Out back is a small patch of grass on which
is set up a wash stand and a mirror for Matt and his neighbors.
Trips to the latrine require everyone to ``saddle up,'' that is,
don pistols and vests.
</P>
<P>
   Training is dangerous. Two Apache crew members died last week in
the crash of their aircraft during a training exercise. They were
friends of Matt. ``They died doing what they wanted to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the training crash, Matt said he has ``total
confidence'' in the Apache. ``I think the aircraft is absolutely
safe,'' he said. ``I think the Apache is an extremely rugged
aircraft . . . I don't think you could pick a safer aircraft to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a helicopter as lethal. The twin-engine chopper carries 16
Hellfire missiles -- eight on each side. And under the fuselage is
mounted a 30-millimeter machine gun capable of firing 625 rounds a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do a whole lot physically when you are actually in
the aircraft,'' Matt said. ``But your mind is working a thousand
times an hour to keep up with what's going on. So when you pull
yourself out of the cockpit at the end of the night, you are
absolutely exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The darkness in which the Apache usually operates also adds to
the tension, as do the craggy cliffs and sharp valleys leading up
to northernmost Albania -- the Apaches's practice flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the occasional Albanian who is curious about
all the helicopters flying around and hits them with a spotlight
just to see what is making all the fuss. Such an incident occurred
during one of Matt's training exercises this week. His cockpit
filled with light just as he and his co-pilot were about to land
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared us both a little bit at first, but I realized it was
probably a curious person who was trying to figure out what we were
doing in his front lawn,'' Matt said with a chuckle. ``I can
imagine . . . if we landed in somebody's yard in Michigan, they
probably would have shot at us.''

IN THE RACE FOR WTO MEMBERSHIP, TAIWAN MOVES AHEAD OF CHINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ While international attention has been focused on
Beijing's effort to join the World Trade Organization, Taiwan has
quietly been moving ahead with its own application.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the island, which Beijing considers a
renegade province, met formally with trade organization delegates
Wednesday to advise them on Taiwan's progress in complying with the
market-opening requirements to be admitted to the 134-member group
that makes the rules for international trade. The Taiwan
representatives said their administration had essentially fulfilled
the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Unstated, however, was the crucial question of whether Taiwan
will be able to join before the Chinese government in Beijing,
which is at a much less advanced stage in the application process
but has insisted that it must be admitted first.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's bid could be completed in July, trade organization
officials said. But an approval of its application could develop
into a diplomatic confrontation, inflaming the already delicate
situation in which China has been avidly seeking admission to the
trade organization for a dozen years. Its recent efforts have been
complicated by the accidental American bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade only weeks after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
lobbied heavily during a trip to the United States to clear the way
for China's acceptance into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   While Beijing officials have suspended human rights and other
discussions with the Clinton administration to protest the bombing,
analysts have noted that they did not cut off trade talks, which
are a high priority for the rapidly growing economy. Beijing is
almost certain to protest if Taiwan gains entry first.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could result in an effort by China's allies among
developing countries, which make up the majority of trade
organization members, to block Taiwan's admission. All actions at
the trade regulatory body are supposed to be taken by general
agreement among all member countries. That includes the admission
of new members.
</P>
<P>
   However, Taiwan's bid could force a vote in the already
splintered world trade body, which has been at very public odds in
recent weeks over who will be named its next director general.
</P>
<P>
   China's supporters argue that a 1992 ``China first'' statement
agreed to by the trade organization's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, requires that Beijing gain
admission before Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has always maintained that both applications should be
evaluated on their merits, and the United States supports that
view. Taiwan's negotiator, Yi Fu Lin, said Wednesday that ``our
opinion has been that the two accessions are dealt with
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nationalist government, since overthrown and moved to
Taiwan _ where successors are still in power _ China was among the
23 original signers of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But Chinese membership lapsed after the Communist revolution of
1949. Since 1986 Beijing has been seeking to rejoin the trade
forum.

CONGRESS CLOSER TO PASSING KOSOVO FUNDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators moved toward agreement
Wednesday on giving President Clinton nearly $11 billion in
emergency funding for the war against Yugoslavia, but the White
House warned of a veto if lawmakers insist on attaching extraneous
spending measures to it.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators hoped to reach a compromise Wednesday night that
would win passage in both chambers and have the bill on Clinton's
desk by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But there were substantial differences between a House-passed
bill authorizing nearly $13 billion for the Kosovo funding measure
and a package favored by the Senate that would provide $10.9
billion for U.S. military operations and refugee relief connected
to the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   Both are way above the $6.05 billion request Clinton sent to
Congress several weeks ago when he asked for supplemental funding
for the U.S. portion of the allied campaign through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate insisted on adding billions more to cover
the cost of a military pay raise and numerous other Defense and
State Department-related programs. The Senate also decided to merge
the Kosovo bill with another emergency spending measure that would
provide about $1 billion for hurricane relief in Central America,
$372 million for victims of the recent Oklahoma and Kansas
tornadoes, and $570 million for financially troubled farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the negotiation process between House and
Senate conferees are efforts by a few senators to add additional
spending and other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is insisting that language
be included in the final bill that would allow unrestricted use by
the states of $246 billion to be paid by the tobacco industry as
part of its agreement to settle lawsuits brought by the states. The
administration opposes the provision, which would prevent the
federal government from claiming a share of the tobacco money to
cover Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is demanding that a $1 billion
loan guarantee program be included in the emergency package to help
U.S. steel companies and other businesses hard-hit by foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
   As the House and Senate negotiations continued Wednesday, White
House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart signaled that Clinton would veto
the final bill if it contains ``extraneous political issues''
unrelated to prosecuting the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be seen as a positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, however, that Clinton supports the idea of
merging the aid to hurricane and tornado victims into the Kosovo
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true emergency, both Central America and the Kosovo
operations. We ought to get this through. We ought to leave out
other people's political agendas and pass it,'' Lockhart said,
adding that the tobacco provision and other issues should be
debated later on this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that the very important funding for this
Kosovo operation should not be held hostage to other political
agendas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to head off a possible veto, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
urged colleagues not to load up the Kosovo bill with ``nondefense''
spending seen as benefiting only a handful of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that both men would like to see Byrd's loan program
left out, along with a provision that would prevent gas producers
from having to pay interest on $200 million in customer
overcharges.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the two leaders are lobbying hard to keep
Hutchison's tobacco settlement provision in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped to have a ``clean bill'' free of
riders, or add-ons, on the president's desk sometime this week. But
in addition to the tobacco, steel and gas issues, House and Senate
conferees are arguing over a dozen smaller items that members would
like attached.
</P>
<P>
   They include an effort to keep the Alabama sturgeon from being
added to the endangered species list; an attempt by Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., to overturn a court ruling preventing mining
companies from expanding their milling operations on public lands;
and a proposal to create a $500 million loan program for
financially depressed oil and gas companies.

BUSINESS GROUPS PROTEST JURY'S $581 MILLION AWARD IN FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By TOMMY STEVENSON   
 The Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAWYERVILLE, Ala. _ George Merriweather said he was ``mad as
hell'' when he realized he had been cheated on installment payments
for a television satellite dish he and his wife, Velma, bought in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   A Hale County jury sympathized and last week awarded $581
million to the 80-year-old retired foundry worker, his wife and
their daughter, Barbara Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we won't get that much when it's all over, and I'm
still mad about what they did to us,'' Merriweather said. ``Money
doesn't excite me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have grown excited.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between the relatively small amount of fraud
involved and the state-record $581 million award sparked an outcry
from business associations, politicians and lobbying groups such as
Alabama Voters Against Lawsuit Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous, ruinous, revolting and graphic proof that
our civil justice system is out of whack, out of control and out of
common sense,'' said Lewis Fuller, chairman of the tort reform
advocacy group's board of directors. ``This crazy verdict is
obviously not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The award has provided new vigor for passage of proposed tort
reform laws that seemed all but dead in the waning days of the
state legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Merriweather spoke during a news conference in the
yard of his small, pre-fabricated home off a dead-end road about
100 miles southwest of Birmingham. Four television cameras,
including two from the ABC and NBC nightly news programs, pointed
his way, while a half dozen reporters took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I want the world to know, the public to know, is how
I've been cheated, how I was cheated out of my earnings so they
won't cheat nobody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict rendered Friday against Whirlpool Financial National
Bank includes $975,000 in compensatory damages along with $580
million in punitive damages. Whirlpool is appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Methvin, the Montgomery lawyer who represented the
plaintiffs, said salesmen came to the Merriweather and Carlisle
homes and tricked them into the credit agreement, which carried an
interest rate of more than 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony showed Carlisle and the Merriweathers were told by
Gulf Coast Electronics that the dishes, which cost about $1,000,
would cost them $34 a month for three years. But the contract ran
for 4 1/2 years, costing the three an additional $612 in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool, a former subsidiary of Whirlpool Corp., is now owned
by TransAmerica Bank. Whirlpool provided the financing for the
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-day trial last week, Methvin suggested a $6.9
million verdict to the jury. When it was suggested that the huge
judgment might backfire against law firms like his by giving new
life to tort reform issues, he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the appeals courts are going to lower it down,
and the jury was very sophisticated and I think they realized that
too. They were just trying to call national attention to the
problem, and that is why they made it so large,'' Methvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the whole country to know that some segments of
corporate America and Wall Street, who are behind these credit
schemes, are coming into the living rooms of the illiterate and the
elderly and the blind, and they are fleecing them out of thousands
of dollars each, and the total fleece is in the millions,'' Methvin
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merriweather has a third-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Methvin organized the media circus in the Merriweathers' yard in
rural Hale County. He closely monitored the interviews conducted
with his clients, at one point admitting that he was worried they
might express an opinion about how much they would really be
willing to accept in a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he put such a settlement at about $5 million. On
Monday, however, he had estimated that he and his clients would
probably receive less than $1 million after the appeal process,
which could go all the way to the Alabama Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it and decided I had it too low on Monday,''
he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Methvin said the amount a law firm takes as payment in such a
case is typically one third of the award or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Merriweathers and their daughter seemed to
have no illusions about actually receiving in excess of half a
billion dollars, nor did they seem to be making any big financial
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not going to get that much money,'' said
Carlisle, a 40-year-old who works for an apparel company in
Greensboro, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Velma Merriweather, 60, who works the midnight shift at Peco
Foods in Tuscaloosa, said she has given no thought to spending the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired,'' she said as she posed beside the satellite
dish at the corner of her vinyl-sided home. ``I didn't get off
until 8 this morning, drove all the way home, and I couldn't go to
sleep because I knew all these people were coming here. I just want
to get some rest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Nearly 25 years ago Neil Meron, a senior at Brooklyn
College, invited Craig Zadan, a writer who had just completed a
book about Stephen Sondheim, to present a lecture to students about
Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I spoke, Neil said he was looking to get into the
musical theater and did I know anyone who could give him a job,''
said Zadan. ``I said, `How would you like to be my assistant?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who soon began working for Joseph Papp's Public
Theater, eventually forged a producing partnership that has taken
them to television, where they have revived a form of entertainment
that executives had given up for dead: Hollywood's version of the
musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Once a studio mainstay, musicals are almost extinct in films and
never established much of a beachhead on television. In recent
years Meron, 44, and Zadan, 50, have begun to turn this around. In
1993 on CBS they produced a three-hour version of ``Gypsy'' with
Bette Midler that won high ratings. In 1997 on ABC, they produced
``Rodgers' and Hammerstein's `Cinderella,''' with Whitney Houston,
Bernadette Peters and Brandy, for ``The Wonderful World of
Disney.'' Reaching over 60 million viewers, the show gave ABC one
of its highest ratings in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at 9 p.m. the producing team's newest musical,
``Double Platinum,'' with Diana Ross and Brandy, will be on ABC.
Ms. Ross and Brandy sing original songs from their solo albums in
the production. Ms. Ross plays a diva who has sacrificed motherhood
for stardom, and Brandy plays the daughter whose success threatens
Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Future plans include the Sondheim-John Weidman ``Assassins,''
directed by Barry Levinson, for HBO; ``Annie,'' starring Kathy
Bates as the harridan Miss Hannigan, to be broadcast next year on
ABC; ``The Music Man,'' and ``Mame.'' They have also signed Judy
Davis to portray Judy Garland and lip-synch her songs in an
adaptation of the autobiography ``Me and My Shadows: A Family
Memoir,'' by Lorna Luft, Garland's daughter. Zadan and Meron are
also producing an original television musical, ``Heavens to
Betsy,'' in which Dolly Parton will star and direct.
</P>
<P>
   Zadan and Meron have tapped into their contacts in the musical
theater to shape ``Double Platinum,'' which was written by Nina
Shengold and directed by Robert Allen Ackerman. The producers, who
said they have been friendly with Ms. Ross for years, came up with
the mother-daughter idea and pitched it to the two women, who
immediately agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a musical for television is doing something very
fragile,'' Zadan said during an interview with the two men in the
living room of his home in the hills above Sunset Strip. ``The
first criteria is that it has to be dramatic, it has to be
emotional. The second is that it has to have very, very strong
characters. And the third is that you have to have event casting:
you have to have stars.''
</P>
<P>
   They said musicals had been given a bad rap in films and
television by executives who insist that younger audiences are not
interested in the genre. Zadan and Meron disagree. ``Actually this
generation has been brought up on MTV and VH-1,'' said Zadan.
``They're used to seeing superstar videos of people like Madonna or
Michael Jackson that tell stories through singing. They're actually
like musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Where movie musicals have gone wrong, said Meron, citing
``Star,'' ``Hello, Dolly,'' ``A Chorus Line,'' ``Mame,'' ``Dr.
Doolittle,'' ``Annie'' and ``Newsies,'' is in miscasting (Lucille
Ball in ``Mame'' and Barbra Streisand in ``Hello, Dolly,'' for
example) and poor filmmaking. ``They blame the genre rather than
the film itself,'' said Meron.
</P>
<P>
   Zadan and Meron recall attending Broadway musicals as
star-struck children. Zadan, who used to write about the theater
for New York magazine, quit his job to work Off Broadway after
writing his book ``Sondheim and Company'' in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership evolved after Meron graduated from Brooklyn
College, and they produced shows at the old Ballroom in Soho
featuring evenings devoted to such musical comedy composers and
lyricists as Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sheldon Harnick and
others. Joseph Papp, the theater impresario, had asked them to work
at the Public and help develop musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just done `Chorus Line,' the money was pouring in and
it was the most vibrant time in the history of the Public
Theater,'' Meron said. What they learned from Papp was that ``when
we wanted to do a show he'd say, `Do you love it?''' Zadan said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Do you absolutely love it?' '' he said. ``If you don't love
it _ if you like it _ I don't want to do it.' He also said, `Don't
ever be afraid to fail.'''
</P>
<P>
   The shows they worked on at the Public Theater include
``Runaways,'' ``I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It On the
Road'' and an adaptation of ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s Zadan moved to Hollywood to work for the
producer Peter Guber, who was running Casablanca Records and Films.
Meron stayed in New York to develop plays and musicals for Guber.
The team later split up for several years to work for other
producers until Zadan made his successful producing debut in 1984
with the movie musical ``Footloose,'' directed by Herbert Ross and
starring Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   They produced or were co-producers on nonmusicals as well,
including ``Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story,''
which was based on the Army colonel who challenged the military's
policy on gay enlisted personnel. But it was ``Gypsy'' that cleared
the path for Zadan and Meron on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fluke,'' said Meron. ``One day I was on the phone
with Shirley Bernstein, who represented Arthur Laurents and who is
Leonard Bernstein's sister, and she said, `How would you feel about
doing ``Gypsy'' for television?' I said, `Absolutely.' '' Laurents
created the Broadway classic show with Jerome Robbins, Jules Stine
and Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagansky, then a top executive at CBS, promptly agreed to
make the television movie if the men could find a top star. It took
months of pressure to secure the services of Ms. Midler, who had
told them she was worried that the part was too closely associated
with Ethel Merman and that a leap into television might not benefit
her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally said to her: `Is ``Gypsy,'' not one of the greatest
musicals? Is it not one of the greatest roles for a female?' and
she said, `Yes.' And we said, `So what's your problem?' And she
said, `OK, I'll do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Midler won a Golden Globe for best actress for ``Gypsy,''
which was one of the year's top-rated programs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not all their efforts have ended happily. They yearn to put
``Dream Girls'' on television, but the rights are owned by David
Geffen and Warner Brothers, whose plan to make the musical was
recently scrapped. They were planning to make a film version of
Sondheim's ``Into the Woods,'' but John Calley, chairman of Sony
Pictures Entertainment, dropped the project. These musicals and
others are viewed in Hollywood as too risky and too expensive.
Numerous other musicals are unavailable because estates that own
the rights often decide that a television presentation would hurt
the future income of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is the history of failure of so many movie
musicals. ``If an action film fails, no one says, `Let's stop
making action films,''' said Zadan. ``But if a musical fails, it's
like cutting our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Meron agreed. ``We're crazy to keep wanting to do musicals,'' he
said. ``They're so fragile. There are so many problems. But when
they succeed, there's nothing like it.''

COMMENTARY: MISSISSIPPI LEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNICA COUNTY, Miss. _ I stood beside the cotton field in the
morning quiet of the Delta and listened to the echoes of the
tortured souls from years and decades and centuries past. To enter
Mississippi has always been, in my view, to descend to a lower
place, a world of fanatical race hatred in which blacks were
condemned by whites to a perpetual state of humiliation and often
gruesome suffering.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told that Mississippi is changing. Casino gambling has
flooded some areas with money and jobs and is threatening to lift
at least part of the state into the 20th century. Many of the jobs
have gone to blacks, and many of the gamblers are black. This has
been hailed as great progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go into a casino and sit down and play blackjack,''
said C. Penn Owen Jr., a 63-year-old white man and one of the most
powerful farmers in the Delta, ``I may be sitting next to my _''
This was during an interview in Owen's office. He stopped, looked
up and then started again. ``Very often there are colored people in
this community that I know well,'' he said, ``and it's kind of fun
to mix and mingle.''
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical planter, pulled by a tractor, moved slowly along
the field. Now a yellow plane, a crop duster, came into view,
flying low, and the stillness of the moment was lost. The cotton
field, which belongs to Owen, is in Robinsonville, an
unincorporated area of northern Tunica County, one of the most
rural parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to come here because something strange is going on.
There are only 8,500 people in the entire county, which is spread
over 460 square miles and consists mostly of cotton fields, soybean
farms and vacant land. Most of the people are black, poor and
poorly educated. There is only a tiny handful of children, nearly
all of them black and desperately poor, in the vicinity of
Robinsonville, which is not even a town. And yet the movers and
shakers at the local, county and state levels want to build a brand
new $8 million elementary school for 500 pupils in Robinsonville.
And only in Robinsonville.
</P>
<P>
   A new school in the middle of nowhere. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Robinsonville is just south of the largest and most successful
cluster of casinos in the state. The entire area is remarkably
empty except for the casinos. Most of the casino workers commute to
work from other parts of the state and from Memphis, just a few
miles farther north.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the proposed school was sold to the county Board of
Education by none other than Owen. And Owen is planning to build an
upscale residential development that will begin practically on the
school grounds and then fan out from the school in a series of
progressively wider arcs.
</P>
<P>
   He needs the school to serve as a magnet for the upscale
families he wants to draw to his development. Those families will
almost surely be white. Hardly any of the black people in Tunica
County, not even those employed by the casinos, will be able to
afford to buy or rent a home in Owen's development.
</P>
<P>
   For many years a small number of black families have lived in
dreadful shacks on property in Robinsonville that is owned by Owen.
One by one they are being forced out, and as they leave the shacks
are bulldozed and the rubble burned.
</P>
<P>
   Penda Hair, a Washington lawyer who is working with a group of
black Tunica residents who are angry about the plan, put the matter
plainly: ``They are attempting to create an all-white, or virtually
all-white, enclave with its own school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with stiffening opposition, proponents of the
state-of-the-art school are now saying most of its first students
will be black youngsters drawn from miles around, but that white
students will be added as white families move into Robinsonville.
What appears to be happening is grander than the simple creation of
a white enclave. Owen is not the only wealthy plantation owner
(yes, they still call them plantations) who is planning to build in
Robinsonville. There are others, and their goal seems to be nothing
less than the creation of a powerhouse, upscale, incorporated
community _ in other words, a prosperous, largely white town in an
overwhelmingly black county that has always ruthlessly exploited
its majority population.
</P>

SEC SUITS CITE ILLEGAL INTERNET SECURITIES SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed civil
cases against several companies and individuals for allegedly
selling fraudulent securities on the Internet, SEC officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each case involved outrageous or baseless promises to
investors, in some instances guaranteeing annual profits in excess
of 500 percent,'' said James B. Adelman, associate Boston district
administrator of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The commission alleged that Bruce W. Lynch, of Brookline, and a
Long Island, N.Y. company called Neurotech Enhance Resources, Inc.
created an Internet offering of $15 million in notes in August 1998
to finance the construction of hospitals in Turkey. No such
hospitals were being built, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch went beyond representations made to him by Lawrence M.
Artz, of Roslyn, N.Y., an official of Neurotech, by publishing
revenue and earnings projections for completed hospitals ranging
from $4 million to $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is seeking a cease and desist order in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also filed a complaint against Richard J. Briden,
of Ashland, and two corporations he founded, Empowerment Funding
Group LLC and Infopro Group Ltd., asserting that they conducted a
fraudulent offering of so-called ``prime bank'' notes on the
Internet, and that they sold interest in another bank-trading
program to seven investors.
</P>
<P>
   Briden allegedly used Web sites to offer purportedly risk-free,
high-yield investment opportunities to people with a minimum of $1
million to invest. The SEC also alleges that Briden convinced the
seven people to invest $295,000 in a program called Mutual Assets
Limited, promising the investors a return of 640 percent per
40-week period.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions prohibiting Briden and
his companies from further violations of specific provisions of
securities law and a civil monetary penalty to be determined by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also filed a civil complaint against a former
Gloucester resident, Jason R. Rosenthal, currently of Dunedin,
Fla., alleging that he violated federal securities law when he
solicited investors to purchase unregisterd securities in companies
that would sell software for operating commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission, the securities were issued by a
company known as VentureLink Capital Corp. or one of its
affiliates, and Rosenthal's solicitation falsely projected
investment returns of 500 percent to 2,000 percent within two year.
Rosenthal also allegedly misrepresented the offering as an
opportunity to invest in a company that had obtained millions of
dollars of start-up capital from venture capitalists who had
financed Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting
Rosenthal from further violations of specific federal securities
law, the disgorgement of his gains, prejudgment interest on the
gains and a civil fine.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants could not be reached Wednesday.

COMMENTARY: BORIS STRIKES AGAIN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of Bill Clinton's impeachment, the
president of the United States changed the subject by firing
missiles. On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's impeachment, the president
of Russia dominated the news by firing another of his prime
ministers. Both stunts were briefly effective; the Russian way is
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Primakov was sent to the showers not only because he is
an economic ignoramus but because he did not stand up for his boss
to the Communist impeachers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently he had been warning Communists in the Duma that
if they impeached Yeltsin, he would resign as prime minister. But
this week the ambitious ex-spymaster changed his mind and told them
he would stick around, impeachment or not, which impelled Boris to
yank him.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I'll miss Yevgeny; he was the devil we knew. When a
team of New York Times correspondents went to interview him last
year, he spent the first 10 minutes denouncing my columns as glupo,
``stupid'' _ a display of thin-skinniness that warmed my heart. But
it's good for Russia and the world that he's gone; Saddam Hussein's
longtime friend was too adept at evildoing.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging to the mound in relief is Sergei Stepashin, the KGB
chief who blundered into Chechnya and the police chief who failed
to uncover Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich's nerve-gas dealings with Syria.
He is the fourth Russian prime minister in about a year, and mail
addressed to him should read ``or current occupant.''
</P>
<P>
   More important than who Yeltsin's choice is to be seasonal front
man is what faction will win elections to the Duma in mid-December.
Here's what to root for:
</P>
<P>
   Communists, who now dominate, are using impeachment as their
vehicle. Democratic reformers of the Yabloko Party are focused on
reviving the failed economy. If the reformers push their Duma
percentage up into the teens, they will be kingmakers in the
presidential elections next year. Root for that.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the stickler: Although Yabloko opposes four
impeachment counts, it supports a fifth, castigating Yeltsin for
the bloody war in Chechnya. If it passes, Yeltsin could not disband
Parliament, and the Communists could refuse to approve his prime
minister and Cabinet. Result: deadlock and crisis. Only six years
ago, that led to the shelling of Parliament. We should root for the
Duma's impeachment to fail.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does Yeltsin want? He wants (1) to stay in control,
politically and physically, until his last day in office; (2) to
help defeat the Communists, his foes for the past decade, and (3)
to keep the country stable enough to hold elections as scheduled.
These are worthy goals and we should root for him to attain them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he may also want (4) to guarantee the welfare of
his relatives and enriched oligarchs who sustain him, and (5) to
bestride the world stage like the superpower Russia is no longer,
protecting Serbia from the consequences of its state-sponsored
savagery. We should offer catcalls and brickbats and Bronx cheers
to call attention to our disapproval of this dangerous pretension.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Americans now forced to switch channels from
economy-watching to military affairs should root for an awakening
in the White House to its greatest current folly: using unstable,
NATO-resentful, Chechnya-transfixed Russia as the broker in a deal
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   We do not need any go-between. NATO mediation should
disintermediate immediately. If Slobodan Milosevic wants the
bombing stopped, he knows what number to call. If we want to send
him a message, we can do it over public airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   A middleman only guarantees that we split ``core'' differences
and thereby fail to protect returnees with the guns of the nations
proved willing to fight for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond Primakov, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Stepashin, even
Yeltsin. There looms a presidential front-runner, Yuri Luzhkov,
Mayor of Moscow, who revealed his mindset last month to Harvard's
Graham Allison in The Boston Globe: If NATO dares send troops into
Serbia, Russia would supply the Serbs missiles to shoot down U.S.
aircraft. This could ``lead to direct military conflict between the
U.S. and Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not deal through Serbia's blustering ally. Deal direct.

 &HT;    CLINTON PUTS SUMMERS IN THE SPOTLIGHT, SALUTES RUBIN FOR SERVICE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Softening the loss of outgoing Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, President Clinton named Rubin's top deputy to replace
him and assured the nation Wednesday there would be no shift in
policies that have helped guide the strongest American economy in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the difficult act he must follow, Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers pledged to stay the course of fiscal
moderation and global integration at the heart of an economic
strategy that has driven eight years of uninterrupted growth and
impelled the stock market to dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right course has been set,'' said Summers, 44, ``and the
challenge is to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build further on the theme of continuity, Clinton
named Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic
affairs, to replace Summers in the No. 2 job at the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed Summers, a former Harvard professor and one-time
chief economist at the World Bank, as a ``brilliant'' strategist
who has served for six years in senior positions at the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely has any individual been so well prepared to become
secretary of the Treasury,'' said Clinton. ``He has always been Bob
Rubin's partner in many, many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no attempt, though, to disguise the fact he is
losing his most trusted economic aide, an ideological soul mate and
one of the most respected cabinet members of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss his cool head and steady hand, his sharp mind and
his warm heart,'' Clinton said during a White House ceremony at
which Rubin's resignation was announced. ``Everybody believed as
long as he was secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the Lincolnesque millionaire who used his Wall Street
instincts and progressive politics to help steer Clinton's economic
policies, said he planned to leave by early July.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a yearning to return to public life in New York, where
he spent 26 years as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs. But
Rubin, who has written extensively on the need to broaden economic
opportunity to take in widening numbers of the nation's poor,
announced no specific plans for his life after public service.
</P>
<P>
   The news Rubin is leaving initially made Wall Street shudder.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 2 percent in early
trading before rebounding to close down 25.78 points for the day,
at 11,000.37.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than three times higher than the close of 3,241.95
on the day Clinton first took office, Jan. 20, 1993, with Rubin
close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year before that, Clinton the candidate had summoned
Rubin to the Arkansas governor's mansion in Little Rock to discuss
economic policy. Convinced that Clinton was serious about trying to
balance the federal budget and helping the country's disadvantaged
at the same time, Rubin signed on as a key adviser and important
link to wealthy Democrats in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took office, he named Rubin as the first director
of the newly created National Economic Council, responsible for
overseeing economic matters ranging from tax and budget to trade
and commerce, and coordinating the efforts of various departments
with economic responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought it all together,'' Clinton said during his Rose
Garden remarks Wednesday. ``He got us to work as a team. He worked
for consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, 1995, Rubin succeeded former U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
as Treasury Secretary. One of the most influential economic
position in the world, the job pays $99,500 a year -- a fraction of
what Rubin once earned engineering mergers and acquisitions at
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin took the helm amid a crucial test of Clinton's commitment
to the global marketplace: the collapse of the Mexican peso, which
threatened to bring down emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing the public strongly opposed, Rubin
convinced Clinton to back a multi-billion-dollar bailout package
for the peso. Rubin later told the New York Times that was one of
the most nerve-wracking gambles of his high-stakes career.
</P>
<P>
   The gambit paid off: Mexico paid back to the Treasury more than
$12 billion in currency support loans -- with interest and ahead of
schedule. The deal was seen as staving off long-term recession in
Mexico and as a hallmark of Rubin's ability to balance U.S. risks
and interests in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Those skills have been tested and retested in recent years, as
Rubin has traveled the world as Clinton's chief economic diplomat,
working to stave off financial collapse from China to Russia to
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   He's also jawboned the Japanese into adopting long-promised
economic stimulus aimed at lifting the world's second-largest
economy out of a decade in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   What Rubin seemed proudest of, though, was his role in the
administration's deficit-reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration inherited federal budget deficits topping
$250 billion a year. This year, buoyed by strong growth in tax
revenues, the budget is projected by the White House to show a
surplus in excess of $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While the country's total debt has risen from $4.4 trillion to
$5.4 trillion under the Clinton administration, the White House has
reduced the privately-held portion of that debt -- the amount the
government owes to bankers and global investors - from $3.1
trillion in March, 1997, to $2.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the debt, and the interest paid on it, is
essentially money the government owes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's departure comes at a difficult moment for Clinton, who
is riding out one of the most challenging sets of foreign policy
problems of his career.
</P>
<P>
   As much of the developing world struggles to recover from the
economic crash that shattered the promise of emerging markets two
years ago, Clinton is leading NATO in a war against Yugoslavia that
has left a deep chasm between the United States and two global
giants -- Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has worked extensively to build U.S. economic partnerships
with both of those countries.

surplus in excess of $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While the country's total debt has risen from $4.4 trillion to
$5.4 trillion under the Clinton administration, the White House has
reduced the privately-held portion of that debt -- the amount the
government owes to bankers and global investors - from $3.1
trillion in March, 1997, to $2.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the debt, and the interest paid on it, is
essentially money the government owes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's departure comes at a difficult moment for Clinton, who
is riding out one of the most challenging sets of foreign policy
problems of his career.
</P>
<P>
   As much of the developing world struggles to recover from the
economic crash that shattered the promise of emerging markets two
years ago, Clinton is leading NATO in a war against Yugoslavia that
has left a deep chasm between the United States and two global
giants -- Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has worked extensively to build U.S. economic partnerships
with both of those countries.

   RUBIN-SUMMERS (Washington) _ Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, who was nominated on Wednesday to succeed Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, arrived in Washington six years ago with a
reputation for brilliance and an equal reputation for intolerance
of those he considered slow to grasp the dynamics of an unforgiving
global economy. But in the past year or two, a new Larry Summers
has emerged _ one who has tamed his sharp-edged wit, who regularly
solicits key congressmen and senators for their advice, who now
occasionally admits to errors of political judgment. By David E.

AS DIVISIVE TIMORESE VOTE NEARS, A CRITICAL VOICE IS SILENCED

<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ The editor was in New York, covering the
signing of an agreement to end a generation of war in his small,
remote homeland. But his articles never saw print. While he was
away, thugs bent on scuttling the agreement destroyed the office of
his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because they did not like the newspaper's brand of journalism,
one side in the conflict here in the territory of East Timor
decided to close it down.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, Suara Timor Timur, has been the only independent
daily in this former Portuguese colony, where rebels have resisted
annexation by Indonesia since 1975. Until recently, it published
six days a week, for a circulation of 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed violence has swept the territory in recent weeks as new
civilian militias, backed by the military, try to block moves for
independence before a referendum on East Timor's future set for
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Suara Timor Timur represents an
eloquent voice of attempted reason and logic in that horrid
situation,'' said A. Lin Neumann, the Bangkok-based consultant on
Southeast Asia for the Committee to Protect Journalists in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There couldn't be any clearer indication of the barbarism of
those militias than that they would choose that institution to
destroy. The CPJ thinks this is absolutely one of the key
institutions if East Timor is going to have any chance of a
successful transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's reports have irritated pro-Indonesian authorities
since it began publishing in 1993, challenging what the managing
editor, Aderito Hugo da Costa, calls ``the culture of lies, always
covering things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported the official versions of events in East
Timor, statements from the opposition and the results of its own
reporting. Officials accused it of favoring anti-government
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the slaughter at Liquica town, the government said five
people were dead,'' Hugo said, offering an example of the paper's
coverage. ``In my reporting I got more than 10. That's the kind of
thing we've been writing in our paper. We do our own reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his number was higher than that given by the government,
it was also lower than the 25 reported by pro-independence forces.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper was accustomed to vandalism and threats, but it is
suffering from the stepped-up violence of what may be a final phase
in East Timor's independence struggle. Several of the paper's 18
journalists have received death threats and have gone into hiding.
Both Hugo and the editor, Salvador Soares, have left East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper was one of the targets in a three-day rampage
through the capital of Dili that began on April 17 and took as many
as 30 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before, Hugo said, he received an assurance from
military officials that his paper would be safe. Then, he said,
more than 100 young men arrived in three trucks and two vans at the
office, which was closed because it was a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing guns and bamboo spears, they broke down the door,
crowding into the tiny office. Two office boys who were there hid
under tables in the darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   The men threw computers and fax machines to the floor, ripped
out telephones and smashed printing presses. Someone with a machete
slashed a couch. Someone bludgeoned a hole in a reception desk.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Liquica killings in early April and other recent
attacks, Hugo and his reporters could describe in detail the
destruction of their office. But this time, like their editor in
New York, they had nowhere to publish a report.

NEW GENE MAY PROVIDE KEY TO AGING PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, studied by
many biologists as a model organism, does not live very long: a
mere three weeks if amply supplied with its favorite food,
bacteria. But the little creature has become of keen interest to
students of longevity because it will live up to four times as long
when mutations are engineered in certain of its genes.
</P>
<P>
   A longevity gene, even one that works in worms, might give clues
as to how to make people live longer, too. But skeptics have noted
that most of the life-lengthening mutations are in genes that
control the worm's hibernation and may be of little relevance to
species, like people, that do not hibernate. The worm prudently
enters a dormant stage when food is scarce or when too many other
worms are around.
</P>
<P>
   But discovery of a new worm gene, reported in Thursday's issue
of Nature, now suggests a possible link between those
life-lengthening genes and a leading theory of human aging, the
belief that cells age through stress as reactive chemicals, such as
free radicals, attack DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The new gene, discovered by Dr. Martin Chalfie, James Taub and
colleagues at Columbia University, is one that breaks down reactive
chemicals, like the hydrogen peroxide often formed when fat is
metabolized. At least two of the previously known life-lengthening
worm genes must work by turning on the newly discovered gene,
called a catalase gene, because when it is disabled, the other
longevity genes fail to prolong life as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Chalfie believes the catalase gene is normally switched on in
hibernating worms to keep their cells healthy. The life-lengthening
genes found by other biologists, which are mutations of normal
genes, probably work by causing the catalase gene in adult worms to
be unusually active, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists have strong theoretical reasons for
doubting the existence of any longevity gene, however. One is that
natural selection increases fitness up to reproductive age but not
beyond, because organisms living to a greater age than that would
not leave extra descendants. Also, a crowd of post-reproductive
animals would compete for food with their own progeny.
</P>
<P>
   Chalfie does not dispute these arguments but notes that the
normal role of the catalase gene is to protect the hibernating
worm, increasing its lifespan before reproduction, just the kind of
property that natural selection would be expected to favor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the worm's genes have recognizable counterpart genes in
humans, despite the millions of years since the two organisms last
shared a common ancestor. Chalfie has searched through the public
data banks that record the human DNA sequences known so far, but
has not yet found a counterpart to the catalase gene. ``Maybe it is
only expressed when people are starving,'' he said, meaning that it
might not have been picked up by biologists searching for active
genes in the cells of well-fed people.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Ames, an expert on DNA damage in aging, who works at
the University of California, Berkeley, said the result was
important because it confirmed the idea that aging in animals
resulted from accidental damage to DNA, like that caused by free
radicals, and not from a genetically directed clock.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Ruvkun, a worm biologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital, said the new finding could prompt ideas for intervening
in human aging, perhaps by using a hormone to turn on the human
counterparts of the suite of genes that includes the new catalase.
But if increasing protection against reactive chemicals like those
known as free radicals is good for us, why don't we do it all the
time?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that the body's immune system generates free
radicals to attack bacteria. ``People who lack the enzymes that
make free radicals have terrible bacterial infections,'' Ruvkun
said. Hibernating animals can step up protection against free
radicals ``because if you're hibernating you are not exposed much
to bacteria. I don't think there's a free lunch _ if people want to
live a long time they're going to have to be a little sedated,'' he
said.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Stojan and Gordana Antic were asleep in
their house in the Kosovo village of Lipljan about 11 p.m. last
Wednesday when the missile came through the bedroom above their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   As the walls and roof collapsed, injuring them and two of their
children, the missile knocked a hole in the wall of the new house
next door before bouncing back into the garden to lie amid the
yellow and red tulips and purple pansies of late spring.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when the press arrived, the village was gaping
and gossiping, standing around the beige remnants of the projectile
as if a cow had dropped down from the moon. Some people kicked at
the missile, presumably aimed at the nearby airport at Slatina, the
way they might a dead snake.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandara Antic, the couple's 12-year-old, who was unharmed,
was describing how she awoke with her mouth and nose filled with
dust and smoke.  &QC; She was young enough to be enjoying the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Milenko Djokic, 65, who lives next door, seemed quite outraged,
pointing repeatedly to the hole in his house and taking journalists
on tours. Cveta, his wife, 63, said she nearly died of fright
thinking of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the room, lifting the blanket to get into bed, when
it happened,'' she said, holding her heart. ``The house was
shaking, and all the windows shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   She was clearly frightened. But when a television camera
appeared, even this Kosovo villager went into speech mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we guilty?'' she asked with dramatic effect. ``We
think nothing bad about anyone. But what should God do to these
people? Let Clinton's daughter be under a broken roof like the
children next door.''
</P>
<P>
   No Gas? He'll Have to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Although it was difficult to secure the permission of the
Yugoslav authorities to visit Kosovo from Belgrade, it was possible
with the correct papers to travel freely in a private car through
the province without an escort _ so long as one had gasoline, which
is essentially unavailable for private purchase in Kosovo, even on
the black market.
</P>
<P>
   But there are foreign journalists based in Pristina, nearly all
of them Greek. Even though Greece is a NATO member, it makes little
secret of its pro-Serb orientation, and the Greeks have been
quickest to provide needed relief assistance _ both medicine and
food _ to the Serbs and Albanians who are living in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There are also various Serbian journalists who work for the
Serbian media or for Western news agencies; a Turkish journalist,
who largely covers the Turkish minority in Kosovo; and one
Canadian, Paul Watson of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Watson managed to drive back to Pristina after having been
expelled, with other Western journalists, in March. Having shown up
at the dreary Grand Hotel in the midst of chaos, his car was
rapidly stolen or confiscated. So Serbian officials let him stay,
said Milivoje Mihajlovic of the Media Center, based at the Grand,
mostly because they had no car or gasoline with which to expel him
again.
</P>
<P>
   In the wonderful ways of bureaucracies, even during a war, his
presence here has now been institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   A Holdover From the '60s
</P>
<P>
   Wartime Kosovo also receives puzzling official visitors. Last
week, it was Regis Debray, a French intellectual of the 1960s who
promoted the wit and wisdom of Che Guevara. Debray has moved
ideologically over the years, becoming an adviser to President
Francois Mitterrand and something of a nationalist, and he said he
would consult with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Debray also stayed at the Grand, asking questions and meeting
officials, including a puzzled Mihajlovic, who is also the editor
of the local state radio station. After their meeting, Mihajlovic
wondered, ``Does he know where he is?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Against Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   There is enormous destruction throughout Kosovo, with thousands
of Albanian houses and shops looted and burned, and many bridges,
buildings and other public works bombed from the air. Amid the ash
and the fear, there is also a sort of gallows humor. One Albanian
man, pointing to the taped glass of the Corso cafe in central
Pristina, said, ``Here we call this Windows '99.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians have always frequented the Corso, and they continue to
do so. But they don't go to the Brooklyn Bar, about 100 yards away,
where Serbs tend to sit under a modernist wall hanging that depicts
the Brooklyn Bridge. The main problem is the outdoor terrace, where
Serbian soldiers and police officers tend to gather for midmorning
espresso and mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   Two Views of the Future
</P>
<P>
   Albanians and Serbs, interviewed separately, endlessly chew over
the possible future of Kosovo. Surprisingly, perhaps, in view of
their pain, the Albanians seem to have more confidence in the
long-term future and seem ready to try to live again with the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an Albanian named Rahim said, many more Albanians
still live in Kosovo than Serbs, ``and we have NATO on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Serbs strut through the cities with confidence. But
many Serbs privately worry about how a future can be shaped after
so much violence. Many say if members of the Kosovo Liberation Army
are installed at the center of a new police force, as a Western
draft peace plan would carry out, many Serbs would be unwilling to
remain. Few Serbs here regard the rebel group as anything but a
terrorist organization committed to killing Serbs and winning
Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Mihajlovic, a practical man, thinks that an east-west partition
of Kosovo, with the Serbs' retaining Pristina and points east and
the Kosovar Albanians' taking Pec, Prizren and the Albanian border,
may be the best long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many bad things on both sides, maybe too
many to live together,'' he said in a dark moment. ``There are no
simple rights and wrongs in this story, no good solution. Too much
has happened for the West's social engineering. We should do
something to insure that this doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what form of solution is reached now, Mihajlovic said,
``the KLA will do whatever it can to get rid of the Serbs in
Kosovo, and some Serbs feel the same way about the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Balkans, he said, where nationalities have struggled
for dominance for centuries. Western plans for shared sovereignty
and minority rights ``may look like a balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm afraid there is no balance here,'' he said. ``There is
only another recipe for war.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Despite the success allied warplanes are
having against Serbian forces in Kosovo, NATO's top air war
commander said Wednesday that the alliance needs to renew its
attacks against the Yugoslav leadership in the central Belgrade to
force Slobodan Milosevic to give in to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since the conflict began, Lt. Gen.
Michael Short said that the alliance has expanded its attacks in
Kosovo, including a dramatic day-time bombing raid by B-52 bombers
against Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But he also stressed that NATO needs to press its attacks in
Belgrade, brushing aside critics who say the allies should show
restraint following the mistaken strike against the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that I am executing SACEUR's number one
priority _ killing the army in Kosovo _ I also need to strike at
the leadership and the people around Milosevic to compel them to
change their behavior in Kosovo and accept the terms NATO has on
the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SACEUR is the NATO acronym for the alliance's surpreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, a four-star army officer and Short's
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Short offered his blunt assessment of the planning and conduct
of the war in an hour-long interview last week at his headquarters
on an air base in Vicenza, Italy. He amplified on his comments in a
telephone conversation Wedbesdat.
</P>
<P>
   While he was careful not to criticize NATO diplomats, Short
signaled that he feels constrained by the political limits on the
bombing of Belgrade in recent days and that the graduated air
campaign approved by NATO's diplomats runs counter to his instincts
as an airman.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force doctrine calls for striking government ministries,
television stations, electrical plants and command centers from the
outset. But it took weeks for the military to win approval to bomb
``leadership targets,'' institutions that the Milosevic regime uses
to run the country and which are important to maintain his hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airmen would have liked to have gone after that target set on
the first night and sent a clear signal that we were taking the
gloves off from the very beginning, that we were not going to
incrementalize, that we're not going to try to a little bit of this
and see how you like it and try a little bit of that and see how
you like it,'' Short said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we did business during the first couple of nights in
Baghdad went to the heart of the problem,'' the general added,
referring to the strikes at the outset of the 1991 Persian Gulf
war. ``We sent a clear signal to Saddam that we were after the very
heart of his operation. Nineteen nations voting, competing
pressures, that makes it very, very difficult to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The base in Vicenza is located at the end of a two-lane road and
seems entirely unremarkable, especially compared to the bustling
Aviano Air Base an hour's drive to the south, which is bursting
with warplanes. But it houses one of NATO's most critical command
posts: the Combined Air Operations Center, a windowless office that
directs the air war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Large screens in the darkened battle center shows NATO's air
armada in and around Yugoslavia. More than 400 NATO officers,
including war planners, air traffic controllers and intelligence
specialists work at the center during each shift. Short runs the
war from the battle center, dressed in his green flight suit and
wearing an aviator's scarf.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The son of an army officer, the 55-year year general flew combat
missions during the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. Plainspoken, but
intense, he has been virtually invisible to the public during the
seven week campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Working behind-the-scenes, he is trying to do something that the
military has never done: win a war from the air alone. An
enthusiastic proponent of airpower, he has a very personal stake in
the conflict: His son is an A-10 pilot over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Short has been involved with the former Yugoslavia since 1995
when as chief of staff for the NATO air forces in southern Europe
he planned air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Balkan conflict thrust him in a diplomatic role.
He accompanied Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, to Belgrade. The
general's task was to negotiate monitoring arrangements for an
accord limiting Serb forces in Kosovo, drawing on U-2 spy planes,
reconnaissance drones and other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the Belgrade meetings, Milosevic asked him
jokingly if he would be the man to bomb Yugoslavia if Holbrooke's
talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Yugoslavia's Air Force, however, was not in a
joking mood. He stressed his units were not responsible for the
assaults against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and were not looking
for a fight with NATO. But Short left the Serbian Air Force under
no illusion that it would escape attack if NATO decided it needed
to resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, I understand that, but you are part of your
national defense establishment,'' he recalled. ``You are part of
Milosevic's regime.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yugoslavia violated the accord and NATO launched air
strikes, however, Short found himself under many constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force generals involved in the air campaign during
the Gulf War had far more authority to plan and carry out the
bombing strikes. They also had a direct relationship to Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the allied commander.
</P>
<P>
   But Short, the top airman in an airwar, admits he is more of an
implementor of a political-military strategy designed in Brussels
than its architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an executor more than I am an air campaign planner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under NATO's complex command structure, Short does not report
directly to Clark, but to a U.S. Navy admiral in Naples _ James O.
Ellis Jr., the commander of allied forces in southern Europe and a
naval aviator _ who in turn reports to Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that colors the equation a bit in terms of my
latitude, if you will, in this air campaign, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other difficulties, which have turned what
was intended to be a brief demonstration of force into a grinding
battle of attrition. Without troops on the ground, for example, it
is hard for NATO pilots to identify their targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question it affects me,'' Short
said. ``I'd like to have that company commander down there on the
ground saying to my son, the A-10 driver, `OK, they are dug in
5,000 meters in front of me. I can see tanks. I can see artillery
dug in. I can see troops massed on the other side of that
village.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing refugees and the alliance's concern with limiting
civilian casualties have added to his burden. After U.S. F-16s
mistakenly bombed ethnic Albanian refugees who were interspersed in
a Serbian convoy, Short instructed his young pilots to contact
senior officers at the command center in Vicenza if they are
unsure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I put out guidance saying that if you are working a target
area and you're not sure call me and I'll tell you whether to drop
or not,'' he said. ``Call me and describe the village and say,
`Boss, I see a village and I see tanks parked next to the houses in
the village. What do you want me do do?' And I'll say `Tell them to
hit the tanks.' And if he hits a house by mistake, that's my
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to take the monkey off the young captain's back,'' he
added. ``They're up there at 400 to 500 miles an hour, people
shooting at them, dodging in and our of the weather. They don't
need the additional responsibility of, `What'll happen if I miss
that tank? Will I be in trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As more planes have been sent to bases in Europe and as the
weather has improved, NATO has escalated its air strikes.
Wednesday, officials said the alliance launched eight waves of
attack, including a record 327 bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Military experts, however, still differ about the utility of
airpower and how it should be used. While Air Force officers
generally believe the best way to score a decisive victory is to
take the war to the enemy leadership from the start, Army and
Marine Corps have traditionally been skeptical of Air Force
strategy, stressing the need to attack enemy ground troops and cut
off their supplies and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, for their part, have been anxious to see the war
brought to a close, but have been worried about civilian
casualties. Given the political constraints, many Air Force
officers insist the bombing campaign against Kosovo is not a true
test of what air power can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many of the bombing decisions are not up to Short.
Some political targets are still off limits. Concern over civilian
casualties had prevented the alliance from attacking some
communications centers. Military targets in Montenegro cannot be
struck without elaborate political consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO escalates its strikes, Clark noted he is stepping up his
attacks on Serb troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Clark has set for me as my number one priority, the
killing of that Army in Kosovo,'' Short said. ``And I think I am
going to be able to do that. Not tomorrow or the next day, but we
have flown our first daytime B-52 air strikes in Kosovo. And if I'm
a young Serb soldier, eating my lunch at two o'clock in the
afternoon and out of the gray skies over my head comes a hundred
plus Mark-82s, that ought to be a signal that we're entering a new
phase of the air campaign and we're taking the gloves off a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb troops in Kosovo are just one class of targets he
is interested in. The other include Belgrade, where the Yugoslav
leadership lives, and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   And these days striking directly at the Milosevic regime is very
much on his mind. While NATO says it is not fighting against the
Serbian people, Short also hopes the distress of the Yugoslav
public will undermine support for the authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think no power to your refrigerator, no gas to your stove,
you can't get to work because the bridge is down _ he bridge on
which you held your rock concerts and you all stood with targets on
your heads. That needs to disappear at three o'clock in the
morning.''

 &HT;    Casinos boost S.C. town's odds of economic survival
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCOLL, S.C. _ The White Sands video gambling parlor closed 2
1/2 weeks ago, giving hope to opponents of the casino operators
encircling this economically embattled town.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory appears to be fleeting. White Sands plans to
reopen early next week, joining eight other parlors flourishing on
the outskirts of McColl. With three more casinos under
construction, this town of 2,750 suddenly finds itself hooked on
video gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the parlors, prosperity is as rare as rolling lucky
sevens in this swampy patch of South Carolina. Squeezed between the
Great Pee Dee River and the North Carolina state line,
industry-starved McColl lost its last factory last year.
</P>
<P>
   Casino operators are making big money along South Carolina's
northern border, luring gamblers from North Carolina. Once
dependent upon cotton and textile mills, McColl is now debating the
virtues and vices of its new growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go in and say, `Next time I'm going to win,' but they
wind up with all their paycheck for the week in that machine,''
said the Rev. Joe Elvington, interim pastor of First Baptist Church
in McColl.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition from preachers and ambivalent support from
McColl's mayor haven't slowed the spread of video gambling, which
flourishes at convenience stores in McColl as well as in the
casinos outside the city limits. Just a block from First Baptist,
an old gas station is reopening with 10 machines.
</P>
<P>
   That will put video gambling on three of the four corners of
McColl's busiest intersection. At the other corner sits a blue and
white metal building, most recently home to the Sunrise Church of
Jesus Christ, but now vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on a stool in Nic's Pic Kwik, accountant Bob Jones, 52,
lights a Winston, sips a cup of coffee and slips more bills into a
machine. He plays a game called Superball Keno, flashing $6,551.77
as the jackpot prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is a source of pleasure and relaxation,'' Jones
said. ``People have a choice of whether or not to play. Their arms
are not being twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Columbia, 100 miles to the southwest, conservative
Republican legislators are calling for stiff regulation of the
fast-growing, $2.5 billion industry. It seems, though, that the
most ardent gambling opponents are holding a losing hand.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the state House of Representatives takes up
legislation, passed last week by the Senate, calling for a
referendum in November 2000 to let voters decide whether to ban
video gambling. In the meantime, winnings per hand of black jack,
poker or other video games would be capped at $900. Some House
members have proposed a $600 cap.
</P>
<P>
   At present, state regulations limit daily winnings to $125 per
player. The industry largely ignored that law until a federal judge
recently ordered five major operators to abide by it. The judge
ruled in response to a lawsuit by addicted gamblers who say the
advertisement of large jackpots is an unlawful inducement.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the operators _ including one at Interstate 95 tourist
attraction South of the Border _ said they're laying off 400
workers as they shut down video gambling machines rather than abide
by the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Balking at the Senate proposal, the House last week passed a
bill calling for tougher restrictions, including a $125 daily limit
on winnings. But Gov. Jim Hodges backs the Senate version, and he
has threatened to convene a special session next month if the House
and Senate don't agree to regulations.
</P>
<P>
   With big contributions from the video gambling industry, Hodges,
a Democrat, ousted incumbent Republican David Beasley in November's
gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulation is coming,'' said Robert Huckabee III, who is
building a casino on the outskirts of McColl. He is hurrying
construction, just in case legislators enact a law banning the
opening of new gaming halls.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee's company, Southland Gaming Corp. of Wilmington, N.C.,
is building on a tract next to a swamp dotted by yellow-flowering
lily pads.
</P>
<P>
   The eight casinos around McColl employ more than 300 people,
most earning about minimum wage. Many welcome those jobs in
Marlboro County, where the unemployment rate tops 10 percent and
the median family income of $32,000 trails the state average of
$40,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as poor a town as there is anywhere,'' said McColl
Mayor Lynn Bisbee, who swears off video gambling, but not its
economic boost. ``It does furnish a lot of jobs.'' McColl officials
are tossing around the idea of annexing the casinos clustered along
U.S. 15/401 between the town and North Carolina. The town would
collect property taxes and licensing fees while providing police
protection to the brightly lit strip of casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even some staunch opponents, such as longtime First Baptist
Church member Edna Guilherme, can't escape the economic reach of
video gambling.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent Wednesday night prayer meeting at First Baptist,
Guilherme, 75, denounced the casinos as ``terrible.'' Yet just
three weeks ago, she and her husband, Albert, sold a 10-acre tract
where Huckabee is building the casino near the state line.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Guilhermes had dreamed of building a house in the
piney patch they had owned since the 1950s. Huckabee approached the
couple about selling three acres. They agreed, if he'd buy all 10
acres. The couple concluded the spot was no longer suitable for a
house.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Guilherme is still stirred up from what she called an
``agonizing decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish any of them any bad luck,'' she said. ``No, I
take that back. I wouldn't care if everyone of them went broke.''

STUART EIZENSTAT: A POLICY PRO PREVAILS FROM CARTER TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.C, Mass.)   (With RUBIN-RESIGN)  
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bill Clinton became the first Democrat in a
dozen years to move into the White House, the party's cognoscenti
saw the treatment of Stuart Eizenstat as a sign of the young
administration's disdain for the political skills of the old crowd
of former top aides to Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat, who had been President Carter's chief policy maker
for his domestic agenda and then spent the Reagan and Bush years on
the sidelines at a large law firm, was sent by President Clinton to
Brussels, where he had the relatively obscure post of ambassador to
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Eizenstat demonstrated to the president that he could be
trusted to handle sensitive assignments, and after tackling many of
the most difficult trade issues as a high-ranking official at both
the State Department and Commerce Department, it was hardly
surprising that Clinton would turn to him Wednesday to become the
next deputy Treasury secretary, one of the most important economic
policy jobs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat was praised by aides and friends for having a mind for
the mind-numbing minutiae of trade policy but who can also see the
bigger picture. His assignments from Clinton have included
negotiating with the Swiss government and banks over reparations
for Holocaust victims, dealing with the Europeans over threatened
trade sanctions for foreign companies doing business with Cuba,
leading the American delegation to the global warming conference in
Kyoto, Japan, and resolving a difficult trade dispute with Japan
over shipping issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stu has handled many of our nation's most difficult missions
over the last six years, from our successful efforts to lift food
and medicine sanctions on trading partners _ or nontrading partners
_ to the struggle for justice in compensation on behalf of the
victims of the Holocaust, an endeavor he will continue,'' Clinton
said Wednesday in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. ``With his
legendary grasp of policy and the art of practical government, his
long experience, his stamina and his steady judgment, he will be a
vital, full member of our economic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Elliott Eizenstat was born in Chicago on Jan. 15, 1943.
After graduating from the University of North Carolina and Harvard
Law School, he landed a job as a junior aide to President Johnson
in 1967 and worked the next year as research director for the
unsuccessful presidential campaign of Hubert H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Carter administration, he became a partner in
the Washington office of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer &AMP; Murphy, a
large Atlanta law firm, and his clients included several large
American and foreign companies with trade issues pending in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Away from work, Eizenstat is known for dedication to religion
and religious causes. A practicing Jew who leaves his office early
enough on Fridays to observe the Sabbath, he once had Carter to his
home for a Passover seder. He also took his own china to Belgium
and raised tens of thousands of dollars in private donations to
refurbish the kitchen of the American embassy in Brussels to make
it kosher.
</P>
<P>
   One question that emerges from the appointment will be how
Eizenstat, who had his share of turf fights during both the Carter
and Clinton administrations, will get along with Lawrence Summers,
who was nominated as the next Treasury secretary. Explaining
Eizenstat's success both in government and in private practice,
Simon Lazarus III, a close friend and former law partner, said,
``He is relentless in trying to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so determined that he finds it physically painful to
lose,'' Lazarus said. Summers is known to be similarly
strong-willed, leading some officials to wonder how the two men
would work together.

LYCOS LEADER LOOKS AHEAD AFTER COLLAPSE OF USA NETWORKS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bob Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc., was
disappointed but upbeat as he confirmed reports Wednesday that the
deal to merge Lycos with elements of USA Networks Inc. had
collapsed three months after it was struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos was a good business three months ago,'' Davis said.
``Lycos is a great business today.'' Davis vowed Wednesday to
continue making deals that would further expand the audience for
Lycos' Web sites, which now trail only America Online Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. in total Internet audience. And the Associated
Press, citing an unnamed source, said late Wednesday that Lycos
nest week will announce a partnership with a software company that
could put a direct link to Lycos on millions of desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spoke at a press conference to officially announce the
deal's demise. Davis had hoped to merge Lycos, one of the most
popular Internet portals, with several broadcast, on-line, and
retail assets of New York-based USA Networks, which is owned by
Barry Diller. The resulting company was to have been an electronic
retailing powerhouse, with $1.5 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Lycos shareholders rebelled against the terms of the deal,
saying that their share of the new company would be too small.
Lycos shares lost a third of their value the week the deal was
announced in February. Worse yet, Lycos board member David
Wetherell, chief executive of the Internet venture firm CMGI Inc.
in Andover, reversed his earlier support for the merger. Because
CMGI holds almost 20 percent of Lycos' outstanding shares,
Wetherell was able to kill the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Conn, CEO of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, one of the
USA Networks assets that was to have been merged, said that the
failure of the merger has left a residue of bitterness between
Lycos and CMGI. ``I'm sure there was animosity on many fronts about
that and I'm sure there'll be more of that over time,'' said Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Davis. ``Our relationship with Dave is cordial,''
he said. ``Dave was a partner of ours for a good long time and
provided the seed money to get this venture started. And life is
too short for this to be anything other than a good, cordial
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI officials did not respond to requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the merger proposal, the deal could only be
called off by mutual consent. In negotiations that lasted until
early Wednesday morning, the two firms worked out a separation
agreement that gives Lycos many of the benefits it hoped to gain by
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   For example, USA's CitySearch Web service will be linked with
Lycos to information on events and tourist attractions in
communities throughout the United States. People who purchase
tickets through Ticketmaster will receive materials promoting
Lycos. And Lycos also will be promoted on USA Networks' television
properties, including the USA Network and the SciFi Channel.
</P>
<P>
   These arrangements are non-exclusive, leaving Lycos free to
pursue other merger or acquisition opportunities after a
``standstill'' period that ends on July 15. Davis said that Lycos
is very interested in making additional acquisitions of other Web
companies, though he didn't cite any by name. ``We're interested in
more of the same,'' said Davis. Lycos attained its present size
through a series of acquisitions of major Web sites such as Tripod,
HotBot, WhoWhere, and Wired News.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said that Lycos will soon be free to use the
``pooling of interests'' method to acquire companies by swapping
shares of stock. Accounting rules barred the use of this method
because CMGI formerly owned more than half of all Lycos stock. But
CMGI reduced its stake in 1997, which entitled Lycos to use the
pooling method after two years had elapsed. The deadline passes on
October 9. After that date, Davis said, Lycos will be able to
acquire companies without having to write off goodwill expenses, a
practice that reduces the firm's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said that there are still many major media firms that
may be interested in doing a partnership with Lycos. He cited Time
Warner Inc., News Corp., CBS Corp., Viacom Inc., and the German
publishing house Bertelsmann. Davis rejected the view that Lycos
was desperately in need of a hookup with one of these firms. ``If
anything,'' said Davis, ``I think we can look at it and say media
companies need us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., closed Wednesday up 8 3/4 to
107; CMGI lost 4 15/16 to close at 239 3/4; Ticketmaster-CitySearch
closed up 3 7/16 at 36 1/16; and USA Networks gained 3 9/16 to
close at 39 7/16, all on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

HOUSE OKS BILL BANNING OPEN CONTAINERS OF ALCOHOL IN VEHICLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The House on Wednesday approved a bill that
would ban open containers of alcohol in vehicles, and a Houston
proponent of the measure predicted it has a 75 percent chance of
survival in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Rep. Ron Wilson said the Senate would support the ban
mainly because the state can gain access to about $120 million in
federal highway funds if a strict ban is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's bill included an array of strong anti-drinking
proposals, but some of them were expected to be watered down in the
Senate before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, hoping to end a long string of defeats, proponents of the
tough new sanctions were advancing some of the same proposals in
free-standing bills. In addition to a separate open container bill,
another back up measure that excludes minors from bars is on
today's House calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, common sense is going to prevail,
although it didn't look like it yesterday,'' predicted Rep. Harold
Dutton, D-Houston, who opposed the package of anti-drinking
proposals approved late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really getting to a point where we're criminalizing
drinking, and that's not what I think we should do,'' he said.
``All that stuff is going to come off in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's amended package, House Bill 3555, which won final
approval Wednesday and was sent to the Senate, would ban open
containers in passenger compartments of vehicles on public roads,
ban minors from bars and outlaw liquor sales in topless bars.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Nixon, R-Houston, who offered the amendment to Wilson's
bill that would preclude liquor sales at sexually oriented
businesses, said he's already been told his proposal will be
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Leo Alvarado, D-San Antonio, said he's doubtful
his amendment banning minors from bars will pass muster in the
Senate. But Thursday he's offering the same concept in a separate
bill _ just as he has in the past four biennial sessions. His goal
is ``to protect the little children from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite existing laws that ban alcohol sales to those under age
21 and require minors to be hand-stamped in bars so they won't be
sold liquor, Alvarado said the laws are often and easily
circumvented. He claimed that not only do illegal sales occur, but
drug- and alcohol-selling ``predators'' prey on youths going into
bars, ``selling them half pints of whiskey, crack cocaine, Ecstacy
and marijuana to get their buzz outside so they can have fun
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they come back out,'' Alvarado continued, ``they get
in cars they can barely drive and either kill themselves, somebody
they love or some poor guy coming home from work.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal probably won't become law because even if it passed
Thursday, it would arrive in the Senate too late to win both
committee and floor approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had support. It's just that one or two people kill
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the open container proposal is likewise uncertain.
On Wednesday, the House approved Wilson's bill that included the
ban and then approved a similar measure, House Bill 487 by Rep.
Fred Hill, R-Richardson, that included fewer exemptions and
potential loopholes. Generally, both would outlaw open containers
in passenger compartments, except in locked glove boxes or behind
the vehicle's last fixed seat.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's bill included the open-container ban, but the other
controversial features were added by other members. Dutton said the
additions were allowed because of the wide range of regulatory
topics the original bill addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a bill starts to bleed a little bit, the sharks start
to circle, attack and feed,'' Dutton said. Proponents of the
anti-drinking amendments, who helped approve a lowering of the
legal intoxication threshold this week as well, commandeered
Wilson's, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent the radical view, not me,'' Dutton said. ``If
the premise is to make sure the streets are safer because we don't
want people drinking and driving, then outlaw drinking and
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton unsuccessfully proposed a lowering of the intoxication
level from the current .10 percent blood alcohol content to zero.
The House on Tuesday approved a .08 percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is sitting in a bar on Dowling Street, how are
they supposed to know what level they're at?'' Dutton asked,
adding, ``We're sending the wrong message to Texans that we're
somehow making the streets safer.''
</P>
<P>
   He advocates stiffening penalties for existing liquor-related
laws instead.
</P>

<P>
   LONDON _ Something is stirring behind Britain's television
screens and its name is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Just as this country's networks prepare for a
satellite-versus-cable battle over the spoils of high-technology
digital television, the American software giant is positioning
itself as a dominant player in a contest that will revolutionize
Britain's cable industry and shape the oft-foretold era when the
cable in the living room delivers not just soaps but high-speed
Internet access, interactive shopping, telephony and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a blurring of the frontiers between personal
computer services and television services, a kind of convergence of
service options,'' said Jerome Steenbrink, a vice president at the
AT Kearney consultant firm in Paris. ``Given that Microsoft
dominates the personal computer world, it's clear that they also
want to impose some sort of standard'' on the future of cable
services, in Britain, Continental Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a worldwide expansion,'' said Howard Anderson,
managing director of Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston.
``Microsoft has made something like 31 technology investments,
almost all in the U.S. Now it's the time for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Just since January, Microsoft has taken a $500 million, 5
percent stake in NTL Inc., Britain's third-largest cable company.
It has agreed to buy a $300 million stake in United Pan-European
Communications in Amsterdam, Europe's largest cable TV provider.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as part of a deal with AT&AMP;T, Microsoft also committed
itself to buy 29.9 percent slice of Britain's Telewest
Communications cable operator, currently controlled by Mediaone
Group. And Wednesday The Wall Street Journal reported that
Microsoft was negotiating for a 30 percent stake in Cable and
Wireless PLC's cable-TV company, Cable and Wireless Communications.
Neither company would publicly confirm the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Between them the British cable companies have relatively low
penetration into a British pay television market where Rupert
Murdoch's B Sky B's satellite television has the lead with 3.45
million subscribers. The cable companies' subscribers number around
2.22 million _ equivalent to between 10 percent and 15 percent of
the market, according to Steenbrink in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But, far more significantly, the companies' cable networks pass
12.3 million homes and, because the cable industry was developed
much later in Britain than in the United States, the networks are
more technologically advanced, offering a range of telephony,
television and high-speed Internet access services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.K. cable companies are still in the construction and
deployment mode, so they have been able to deploy relatively
up-to-date technology compared to companies with much older
networks,'' Steenbrink said. With its entry into this tangled
realm, Microsoft is bound to have a major impact, providing the
cable industry with capital and clout to fight B Sky B for the
digital market, and pushing the individual cable companies into
consolidation that analysts had seen as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even before word of Microsoft's reported interest in Cable and
Wireless Communications, Cable and Wireless had been in talks with
Telewest on a merger. What Microsoft wants, Anderson said, is a
beachhead in a still uncertain technological era. ``No one is sure
what this world will look like,'' Anderson said in a telephone
interview, referring to Microsoft's recent acquisitions not just in
cable but also in wireless technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure it like a Las Vegas game,'' Anderson said. ``I may have
most of my chips on computers, but I'm also putting a few chips on
wireless and a few on cable.'' In that way, Microsoft's charge into
the British cable market runs parallel with its maneuvers with AT&AMP;T
in the United States to deliver Internet services by cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is going to be Gates' partner in the U.S., but Gates
wants to move overseas,'' Anderson said, referring to Bill Gates,
the Microsoft chairman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that Microsoft's strategy for cable is to
dominate the operating systems of cable set-top boxes as a vehicle
for licensing versions of their existing Internet software. That
may produce conflict. The major British cable companies had earlier
signed up with the Oracle Corp. _ a Microsoft rival _ for the
operating systems to be used in the digital television set-top
boxes that would essentially be the gateways into homes for the
projected new cable services.
</P>
<P>
   The British companies, moreover, are locked in battles on
various other fronts. By offering packages of television programs
and telephone services, for instance, the cable companies are in
direct competition with British Telecommunications PLC, which also
has a deal with Microsoft to develop wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders range from B Sky B with its dominance in
pay-television sports and movies, to the much smaller On Digital, a
30-channel land-based service that started up last November
offering a blend of programs that includes some of B Sky B's, but
is delivered through the familiar roof-top antenna.
</P>
<P>
   But what has really upped the stakes, analysts said, is the
contest to lure customers from analog to digital TV. That is where
cable's lower prices and edge in delivering interactive services
will pose what Murdoch has called the biggest challenge to
satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, B Sky B announced that it would give away the
$320 set-top boxes needed to convert old, analog TV sets to
digital's enhanced sound and vision for a new 140-channel B Sky B
digital TV service begun last October. This put pressure on On
Digital to follow with free set-top boxes, evoking memories of the
price wars initiated by Murdoch's News Corp. _ which controls B Sky
B _ in the battle for readership of his British newspapers.

PRIMAKOV OUSTER PLUNGES RUSSIA INTO POLITICAL TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia plunged anew into political turmoil Wednesday
after President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly fired Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, triggering a domestic crisis and possibly
torpedoing NATO's hopes that Moscow could broker an end to the
conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's dismissal of the popular prime minister and his
Cabinet set off a confrontation with the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, which is poised to launch an impeachment
process against Yeltsin Thursday. Yeltsin named Sergei Stepashin, a
longtime ally who heads the country's police and internal security
forces, as acting premier.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Moscow could not have come at a worse time for the
Clinton administration and its NATO allies. They had hoped Russia
would use its close ties with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to help negotiate an exit from NATO's 50-day old bombing campaign
and allow the return of the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders expressed hope that the shakeup would not affect
Russia's positions on Kosovo, but the first reaction was not good.
Yeltsin issued an unusually harsh threat that Moscow would break
off its diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis if its views
continued to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   By firing Primakov, Yeltsin issued a challenge to the
opposition-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament, where
Primakov enjoys strong support.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma responded by voting to call on Yeltsin to step down for
the good of the country, but the Kremlin is sure to ignore the
non-binding resolution. Leaders of the Communist Party, the largest
in the Duma, warned of an impending coup and threatened nationwide
protests. The house also called for an emergency session Friday to
discuss the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is once again far from stability, in the economy
and politics,'' Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address. The
aging president, who has suffered numerous ailments in recent
years, spoke slowly and had trouble pronouncing some words.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's special envoy for Kosovo, ex-premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin, said Yeltsin's dismissal of the government ``will
cause us special difficulties.'' Chernomyrdin met with US Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott here Wednesday, and the two
expressed guarded optimism without going into details. But Moscow
reiterated its stand that NATO must halt all airstrikes before a
political solution can be found in Kosovo, while Talbott said the
alliance will continue to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin had given signals in recent weeks that he was
ready to fire Primakov, the news shocked Russian markets, which had
only just begun the recover following last year's financial
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian lawmakers warned of an impending crackdown against
parliament and opposition parties. Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov appealed to police and military forces not ``to carry out
criminal orders, no matter where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov portrayed Yeltsin as an isolated, ill man who ``doesn't
remember what he said 15 minutes ago,'' surrounded by ``people who
do not want the country to live well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov had stabilized the situation; this is the main reason
he was removed,'' Zyuganov said. ``We hope the people of our
country will react to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's deputy speaker, Sergei Baburin, a frequent critic of
Yeltsin, caused a stir when he arrived in Wednesday's session
wearing combat fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared for everything,'' Baburin smiled.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the rhetoric on a day that also brought Moscow a
rare May snowstorm, by mid-afternoon it was business as usual for
the Duma, which labored through a mind-numbing discussion on
agriculture. And on the street, there was little interest in the
day's developments. Some commentators suggested that the country
had grown accustomed to political crises, a common feature in
Yeltsin's eight-year term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing for us is snow in May; these political
shakeups are nothing unusual,'' said Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of
the Moscow daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov became the third prime minister Yeltsin has fired since
March 1998, when the president abruptly fired Chernomyrdin's
government. After forcing the Duma to accept the obscure and
youthful Sergei Kiriyenko as Chernomyrdin's replacement, Yeltsin
then fired Kiriyenko following Russia's financial collapse last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, named in September, is widely credited with ending
that political crisis and stabilizing the economy, while Yeltsin,
beset by illness, retreated to an almost symbolic role. But the
president, who has never had patience for aides who overshadow him,
has grown more reassertive since the Balkan crisis, and has given
numerous signs in recent weeks that he was planning to remove
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   One sign was Yeltsin's promotion of the 47-year-old Interior
Minister Stepashin to the post of first deputy prime minister last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin praised Primakov for bringing stability to the world's
second nuclear power, but he criticized the outgoing premier for
failing to take action to improve the economy. Given that most
Russians blame Yeltsin, not Primakov, for the ailing economy, this
may seem rather bold, especially for a president with whose
approval rating in polls stands at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caution of the prime minister, his readiness to take only
those measures that would receive the maximum approval and support,
is starting to create harm,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Duma leaders agreed the 450-seat chamber would consider
Stepashin's nomination on Wednesday. Yeltsin said Stepashin would
be more dynamic in implementing economic change.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin, ever the master tactician, referred to the words of
other leading politicians, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov and senior
lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky, before giving his own opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin pointed to Russia's reliance on the International
Monetary Fund as a sign of Primakov's inability to fix the economy.
That sounded to some like another favorite Yeltsin tactic: blaming
others for his own failed policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has the feeling the government's activity on the economy
came down simply to negotiations with the International Monetary
Fund, as if curing Russia's economy depended solely on the handing
out of Western loans,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the IMF conditionally approved a $4.5 billion loan,
funds Russia desperately needs to avoid defaulting on its external
debt, including its debt to the fund itself. Many of those debts
have piled up under Yeltsin, only to be frittered away by a corrupt
and inept administration.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's entire Cabinet was dismissed, with the exception of
Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko, who was named an acting deputy
prime minister. The other ministers will remain until a new premier
is confirmed by the Duma and forms a Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one goal today: to move ahead with clear and
tough market reforms,'' Stepashin told the acting ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to see how Yeltsin's move would make the Duma
any more pliant in passing laws needed to implement proposed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's nomination needs the approval of 226 of the Duma's
450 members. If the house rejects his candidate three times,
Yeltsin can dismiss the parliament and call new elections. But the
president would lose that power if the Duma musters the 300 votes
needed to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin faces five impeachment charges: instigating the 1991
collapse of the former Soviet Union; improperly using force to
dissolve parliament in 1993; launching the failed 1994-96 war in
Chechnya; destroying the nation's military; and waging genocide
against the Russian people through misguided economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process prescribed by the Russian constitution
is a daunting one, however. If the Duma votes to impeach, the
motion must also be approved by the Supreme Court and the
Constitutional Court, and then by two-thirds of the upper chamber
of parliament. That was seen as unlikely before Primakov's removal,
although some Duma members indicated that the situation had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president made a gross error, said Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov. ``Maybe it is his most serious mistake in recent
times.''

IN SOUTH KOREA, CRISIS CAUSES MORE WOMEN TO GET INVOLVED IN
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ As Choi Yang Sook saw it, her place was in
the home, cooking for her husband and cleaning up the house and
raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian economic crisis changed all that, virtually
destroying her husband's architectural design business and forcing
Mrs. Choi to look for ways to make money herself. So now she is
enrolled in a course on how to run a flower shop, and she expects
to start her own flower business this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that women seek jobs,'' said Ms. Choi, a
mother of two teen-agers. ``Some of our husbands have lost jobs,
some have had cuts in salaries, and businessmen have had a hard
time. So women want to help their husbands and maintain the
household.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Asian crisis was particularly harsh on women,
and in South Korea many companies, cutting costs, laid off women
while keeping male employees. But the crisis has also forced women
into the job market alongside their husbands. And the eventual
outcome may be more entrepreneurs and even business executives who
are women.
</P>
<P>
   Among Asians, Korean women have been among the most traditional
of wives and mothers. A few hundred years ago, when a girl was
born, her parents frequently named her Gutsuni, or Last Girl, in
hopes that she would be the last girl born to the family. Even
today property is still generally handed down mostly through men.
</P>
<P>
   These days, young women frequently work after high school or
college, but it is common for them to quit after marrying or having
children. Very rarely have women pursued high-powered careers while
also marrying and raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Now with family finances crimped, those traditions are fading
and women are acquiring greater economic significance in South
Korea. Discrimination against women is at least as intense as ever
in the business world, but women are nonetheless emerging from the
home to help their husbands run start-up restaurants, do the
banking for a new business, or keep the books for the old company
when workers are let go.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ai Ja, a 55-year-old former housewife, was in the office of
Sae Ki Trading Co. the other day. It is her husband's company,
importing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Park seems a stabilizing force in the business. The company
is struggling, and none of her three sons will take it over. But
she says she and her husband are happy because he still has an
office, while many of her husband's friends have been forced out of
their salary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just maintaining the company, and maintaining our
health, which is important,'' Ms. Park said. The office, she added
with a wink, is really for her husband's pride. ``If you don't have
a card, if you don't have a title, people may look down on you.''  &QL;

RAYTHEON   UNIT SETTLES INDUSTRIAL SPYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla., Ala.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Aerospace Co., a subsidiary of the Lexington,
Mass.-based Raytheon Co., has agreed to settle allegations that it
used a security firm to spy on a small competitor in Alabama three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, days before a lawsuit was to go to trial, Raytheon
agreed to pay $16 million to AGES Group, of Boca Raton, Fla., to
settle allegations that it had engaged in at least three days of
industrial spying that included video and audio surveillance and
thefts of documents. Raytheon also agreed to make an undisclosed
amount of future purchases from AGES, which sells aircraft engines
and parts and services them.
</P>
<P>
   A security firm that Raytheon allegedly employed to undertake
the surveillance, Wackenhut Corp., agreed to pay AGES $5 million to
settle the claims.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual aspect of the case, Raytheon and Wackenhut's offer
for a judgment to be entered in favor of AGES on all of its claims
did not disclaim liability, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed a complaint alleging industrial espionage and both
the plaintiff and defendants decided to avoid going to trial in a
case in which the plaintiffs were seeking substantial amounts of
monetary damages,'' said the lawyer for AGES, Mark Lawson, of the
Birmingham, Ala. firm of Burr &AMP; Forman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Raytheon Wednesday denied that the company had
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize that there has been no evidence of
criminal wrongdoing in the case, and that's about all we can say on
the record,'' said David Polk, a spokesman for Raytheon, the
third-largest defense contractor in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Wackenhut did not respond to requests for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The judgments, entered by US District Judge W. Harold Albritton
3d, marked the end of a 2 1/2-year suit connected with a
competitive bid for a government contract worth about $450 million,
according to court papers. The contract was for the servicing of
the US Army C-12 aircraft, a military transport. Raytheon
eventually was awarded the contract.
</P>
<P>
   AGES had hired a company in Slocumb, Ala., The Libertatia
Associates, to help prepare its bid.
</P>
<P>
   AGES alleged in the lawsuit that Raytheon hired Wackenhut to
send private investigators to spy and eavesdrop on Libertatia while
it was preparing the bid. AGES asserted that investigators
illegally monitored and intercepted communications from
Libertatia's office, using sophisticated electronic eavesdropping
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the case said that officials of both Raytheon
and Wackenhut denied that such activity occured during the
discovery phase of the trial, prior to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But AGES had assembled eight eyewitnesses who asserted that they
saw vehicles with specialized equipment, like parobolic microphones
and a tape recorder, as well as people leaving the Libertatia
offices who were later identified as Wackenhut employees.

NATO'S AIR COMMANDER WANTS TO PRESS ATTACKS ON BELGRADE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Despite the success allied warplanes are
having against Serbian forces in Kosovo, NATO's top air war
commander said Wednesday that the alliance needs to renew its
attacks against the Yugoslav leadership in central Belgrade to
force Slobodan Milosevic to give in to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since the conflict began, Lt. Gen.
Michael Short said that the alliance has expanded its attacks in
Kosovo, including a dramatic day-time bombing raid by B-52 bombers
against Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But he also stressed that NATO needs to press its attacks in
Belgrade, brushing aside critics who say the allies should show
restraint following the mistaken strike against the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that I am executing SACEUR's number one
priority _ killing the army in Kosovo _ I also need to strike at
the leadership and the people around Milosevic to compel them to
change their behavior in Kosovo and accept the terms NATO has on
the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SACEUR is the NATO acronym for the alliance's surpreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, a four-star army officer and Short's
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Short offered his blunt assessment of the planning and conduct
of the war in an hour-long interview last week at his headquarters
on an air base in Vicenza, Italy. He amplified on his comments in a
telephone conversation Wedbesdat.
</P>
<P>
   While he was careful not to criticize NATO diplomats, Short
signaled that he feels constrained by the political limits on the
bombing of Belgrade in recent days and that the graduated air
campaign approved by NATO's diplomats runs counter to his instincts
as an airman.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force doctrine calls for striking government ministries,
television stations, electrical plants and command centers from the
outset. But it took weeks for the military to win approval to bomb
``leadership targets,'' institutions that the Milosevic regime uses
to run the country and which are important to maintain his hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airmen would have liked to have gone after that target set on
the first night and sent a clear signal that we were taking the
gloves off from the very beginning, that we were not going to
incrementalize, that we're not going to try to a little bit of this
and see how you like it and try a little bit of that and see how
you like it,'' Short said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we did business during the first couple of nights in
Baghdad went to the heart of the problem,'' the general added,
referring to the strikes at the outset of the 1991 Persian Gulf
war. ``We sent a clear signal to Saddam that we were after the very
heart of his operation. Nineteen nations voting, competing
pressures, that makes it very, very difficult to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The base in Vicenza is located at the end of a two-lane road and
seems entirely unremarkable, especially compared to the bustling
Aviano Air Base an hour's drive to the south, which is bursting
with warplanes. But it houses one of NATO's most critical command
posts: the Combined Air Operations Center, a windowless office that
directs the air war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Large screens in the darkened battle center shows NATO's air
armada in and around Yugoslavia. More than 400 NATO officers,
including war planners, air traffic controllers and intelligence
specialists work at the center during each shift. Short runs the
war from the battle center, dressed in his green flight suit and
wearing an aviator's scarf.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The son of an army officer, the 55-year year general flew combat
missions during the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. Plainspoken, but
intense, he has been virtually invisible to the public during the
seven week campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Working behind-the-scenes, he is trying to do something that the
military has never done: win a war from the air alone. An
enthusiastic proponent of airpower, he has a very personal stake in
the conflict: His son is an A-10 pilot over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Short has been involved with the former Yugoslavia since 1995
when as chief of staff for the NATO air forces in southern Europe
he planned air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Balkan conflict thrust him in a diplomatic role.
He accompanied Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, to Belgrade. The
general's task was to negotiate monitoring arrangements for an
accord limiting Serb forces in Kosovo, drawing on U-2 spy planes,
reconnaissance drones and other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the Belgrade meetings, Milosevic asked him
jokingly if he would be the man to bomb Yugoslavia if Holbrooke's
talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Yugoslavia's Air Force, however, was not in a
joking mood. He stressed his units were not responsible for the
assaults against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and were not looking
for a fight with NATO. But Short left the Serbian Air Force under
no illusion that it would escape attack if NATO decided it needed
to resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, I understand that, but you are part of your
national defense establishment,'' he recalled. ``You are part of
Milosevic's regime.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yugoslavia violated the accord and NATO launched air
strikes, however, Short found himself under many constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force generals involved in the air campaign during
the Gulf War had far more authority to plan and carry out the
bombing strikes. They also had a direct relationship to Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the allied commander.
</P>
<P>
   But Short, the top airman in an airwar, admits he is more of an
implementor of a political-military strategy designed in Brussels
than its architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an executor more than I am an air campaign planner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under NATO's complex command structure, Short does not report
directly to Clark, but to a U.S. Navy admiral in Naples _ James O.
Ellis Jr., the commander of allied forces in southern Europe and a
naval aviator _ who in turn reports to Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that colors the equation a bit in terms of my
latitude, if you will, in this air campaign, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other difficulties, which have turned what
was intended to be a brief demonstration of force into a grinding
battle of attrition. Without troops on the ground, for example, it
is hard for NATO pilots to identify their targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question it affects me,'' Short
said. ``I'd like to have that company commander down there on the
ground saying to my son, the A-10 driver, `OK, they are dug in
5,000 meters in front of me. I can see tanks. I can see artillery
dug in. I can see troops massed on the other side of that
village.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing refugees and the alliance's concern with limiting
civilian casualties have added to his burden. After U.S. F-16s
mistakenly bombed ethnic Albanian refugees who were interspersed in
a Serbian convoy, Short instructed his young pilots to contact
senior officers at the command center in Vicenza if they are
unsure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I put out guidance saying that if you are working a target
area and you're not sure call me and I'll tell you whether to drop
or not,'' he said. ``Call me and describe the village and say,
`Boss, I see a village and I see tanks parked next to the houses in
the village. What do you want me do do?' And I'll say `Tell them to
hit the tanks.' And if he hits a house by mistake, that's my
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to take the monkey off the young captain's back,'' he
added. ``They're up there at 400 to 500 miles an hour, people
shooting at them, dodging in and our of the weather. They don't
need the additional responsibility of, `What'll happen if I miss
that tank? Will I be in trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As more planes have been sent to bases in Europe and as the
weather has improved, NATO has escalated its air strikes.
Wednesday, officials said the alliance launched eight waves of
attack, including a record 327 bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Military experts, however, still differ about the utility of
airpower and how it should be used. While Air Force officers
generally believe the best way to score a decisive victory is to
take the war to the enemy leadership from the start, Army and
Marine Corps have traditionally been skeptical of Air Force
strategy, stressing the need to attack enemy ground troops and cut
off their supplies and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, for their part, have been anxious to see the war
brought to a close, but have been worried about civilian
casualties. Given the political constraints, many Air Force
officers insist the bombing campaign against Kosovo is not a true
test of what air power can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many of the bombing decisions are not up to Short.
Some political targets are still off limits. Concern over civilian
casualties had prevented the alliance from attacking some
communications centers. Military targets in Montenegro cannot be
struck without elaborate political consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO escalates its strikes, Clark noted he is stepping up his
attacks on Serb troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Clark has set for me as my number one priority, the
killing of that Army in Kosovo,'' Short said. ``And I think I am
going to be able to do that. Not tomorrow or the next day, but we
have flown our first daytime B-52 air strikes in Kosovo. And if I'm
a young Serb soldier, eating my lunch at two o'clock in the
afternoon and out of the gray skies over my head comes a hundred
plus Mark-82s, that ought to be a signal that we're entering a new
phase of the air campaign and we're taking the gloves off a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb troops in Kosovo are just one class of targets he
is interested in. The other include Belgrade, where the Yugoslav
leadership lives, and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   And these days striking directly at the Milosevic regime is very
much on his mind. While NATO says it is not fighting against the
Serbian people, Short also hopes the distress of the Yugoslav
public will undermine support for the authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think no power to your refrigerator, no gas to your stove,
you can't get to work because the bridge is down _ he bridge on
which you held your rock concerts and you all stood with targets on
your heads. That needs to disappear at three o'clock in the
morning.''

MECIAR ONCE AGAIN FIGURES IN SLOVAKIA'S ELECTION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia _ Six months after dumping Vladimir Meciar
as prime minister and putting their small Central European country
back on track for membership in the European Union and even NATO,
Slovaks are again tussling over whether Meciar should have a share
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Meciar's surprise entry last month into Slovakia's presidential
election on Saturday has again confronted his country, created
after the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia in January 1993, with
the choice of continuing democratic reform or sliding back into
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning heavily on Slovaks' distaste for NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia, the maverick Meciar kicked off his presidential
campaign on April 15 by announcing that he had invited President
Slobodan Milosevic to Slovakia ``for a rest and some hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added in this waggish vein that the Yugoslav leader had
declined the invitation on grounds that there had been enough
bloodshed. Meciar also compared the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to
the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the armies of the Warsaw Pact in
1968, claiming that the Serbs are now going through ``what we
experienced in 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that most Slovak voters, while opposed to a military
solution to the Kosovo conflict, have grown wary of Meciar's brand
of populism. Although 65 percent of Slovaks polled say they oppose
the NATO bombing, about the same number hold Milosevic responsible
for the tragedy of Kosovar Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   With Meciar as prime minister from 1992 to 1998, with a
nine-month hiatus in 1994, Slovakia lost its chance to join NATO,
and was not designated a prime post-Communist candidate for the
European Union. Under the coalition that defeated Meciar six months
ago, however, the country has emerged from its isolation. The new
administration hopes that Slovakia will join Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic in the first wave of candidates for membership
at the European Union summit meeting in December in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   The current election is one attempt to allay any lingering
European Union doubts over Slovakia's democracy. When the term of
Michal Kovac, independent Slovakia's first president, expired last
May, the deeply divided Slovak Parliament was unable to agree on a
successor, and Meciar assumed some presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
   Then in September, a four-party coalition led by the current
prime minister, Miklos Dzurinda, defeated Meciar in parliamentary
elections. The coalition's candidate for president, Rudolf
Schuster, leads opinion polls in a crowded field of 10 candidates.
A runoff between the top two finishers is likely on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster, 65, turns off some Slovaks because of his past in the
Communist Party, which he joined in 1964. He was the last Communist
chairman of Slovakia's Parliament before the ``Velvet Revolution''
of 1989 ended 41 years of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Communist Party in 1990, and then served as the
Czechoslovak ambassador to Canada. For the last five years, he has
been mayor of Kosice, turning the isolated eastern Slovak town into
a lively urban hub. He makes no excuses for his former Communist
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been an aparatchik _ I always served the
citizens, not the party,'' Schuster said in a recent interview. ``I
entered the Communist Party out of conviction as a young man. I
don't have the slightest regrets about my past.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuster has donated most of his campaign budget to hospitals
and orphanages. He runs only one simple television ad and has
almost no billboards throughout the country, relying largely on
backing from the prime minister, who appears at his side at rallies
and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Meciar on the campaign trail has tended to pose with children
for a few select journalists. Meanwhile, officials are looking into
some of the worst alleged scandals of Meciar's time in office. The
police are investigating his former interior minister for having
scuttled a 1998 referendum on direct presidential election and NATO
membership. Meciar's former secret service director was detained
for alleged complicity in a number of crimes, including the 1995
kidnapping of the son of former President Kovac.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show Schuster with 34 percent support and
Meciar with 26 percent. Showing 19 percent support is an
independent candidate, Magda Vasaryova, a popular former actress
and a former Czechoslovak ambassador to Austria who appeals to
younger, urban and more educated voters.
</P>
<P>
   Her chances of advancing to the runoff on May 29 slumped with
Meciar's entry into the race. In a runoff pitting Schuster against
Meciar, Ms. Vasaryova's backers are likely to back the Kosice
mayor.

 &HT;    `Relentless' mastery of policy to be expected from Eizenstat
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta native Stuart Eizenstat has been an all-around
global troubleshooter for the Clinton administration for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat, 56, was named by President Clinton on Wednesday to
take over as the No. 2 official at the Treasury Department,
succeeding Larry Summers, who is moving up to replace Robert Rubin
as Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat, a one-time Henry Grady High School All-America
basketball star, got his first exposure to national politics in
1976 when, as a young attorney with the Atlanta law firm Powell,
Goldstein, Frazer &AMP; Murphy, he went to work for Jimmy Carter's
Atlanta-based presidential campaign as issues and policy director.
After the election, Carter named the then-34-year-old as his top
White House domestic policy director.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter lost his 1980 re-election campaign, Eizenstat
returned to Powell, Goldstein as director of the firm's
high-powered Washington office for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was from there that President-elect Bill Clinton plucked
Eizenstat to become ambassador to the European Union in Brussels in
1993. At the time, he faced intractable trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Eizenstat began his long march upward through the
Clinton administration's economics/foreign policy ranks.
</P>
<P>
   First, he was named undersecretary of commerce for international
trade. He was sworn in two days after Secretary Ron Brown was
killed in a plane crash in Croatia. Brown's successor, Bill Daley,
assigned Eizenstat to de-politicize the department's overseas trade
missions.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the lead on the administration's politically
explosive decision to boycott World Trade Organization proceedings
on the legality of Washington's 35-year-old economic embargo of
Cuba. Eizenstat was given a special White House assignment to
negotiate repatriation of gold seized from Holocaust victims by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   When Madeleine Albright was named secretary of state in 1997,
she summoned her friend of 20 years to join her inner sanctum on
the seventh floor of the State Department as undersecretary of
state for economics, business and agriculture.
</P>

   The Harvard-trained lawyer, who had also graduated from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said he viewed the
post as an opportunity to ``bring an economic dimension'' to
foreign policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued his assignment on Nazi gold, persuading three
Swiss banks to return $1.6 billion to Holocaust survivors. He also
continued the thankless task of defusing allied objections over
U.S. policy toward Cuba, even getting pelted with eggs from Mexican
protesters at one point.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he took on global warming and the crises
surrounding the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race. His efforts
earned him the sobriquet, ``Undersecretary for Impossible Issues.''

<P>
   Eizenstat is known as a skilled negotiator and relentless master
of complicated policy issues. ``Stu is the most dedicated,
relentless sort of master of the policy process that I think I've
ever worked for,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Al Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat spent 10 years flying to Boston to lead weekly spring
semester seminars on presidential decision-making at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government. That training, he has said, helped
prepare him for his government assignments, in particular on the
importance of keeping Congress informed. Eizenstat, father of two
grown sons, returns to Atlanta regularly to visit his family, which
is active in Atlanta's Jewish community. He has said his
86-year-old mother, Sylvia, has ``the cheapest room in town.

STUDY RAISES CONCERN OVER SAFETY OF LIPOSUCTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of doctors in New York is questioning the safety of
liposuction, the immensely popular cosmetic surgery in which body
fat is suctioned out through a tube to get rid of ``thunder
thighs,'' ``love handles,'' pot bellies and other hated bulges.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' warning, being published Thursday in The New
England Journal of Medicine, is based on their review of five
deaths that occurred after liposuction from 1993 to 1998. Four of
the deaths were in New York City and the fifth was referred to the
office of the city's chief medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of deaths was small, and all surgery carries
some risk, the researchers said the cases were cause for serious
concern because liposuction is not medically necessary and is
performed on healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the number of complications and deaths from
liposuction is not known, the authors of the paper said, because
doctors do not have to report bad results to any central registry.
The researchers recommended that the procedure be studied further
to assess its safety, and that death records in other regions be
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should there be any deaths from a cosmetic procedure?'' asked
Dr. Rama B. Rao of New York University Medical Center and Bellevue
Hospital, an author of the paper with a colleague, Dr. Robert S.
Hoffman, and Dr. Susan F. Ely, a forensic pathologist in the office
of the chief medical examiner in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Liposuction has become the most common cosmetic surgery in the
United States, with more than 400,000 operations done in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The patients who died, four women and one man, ranged in age
from 33 to 54, and each was treated by a different doctor. Three
died because their heart rate and blood pressure suddenly plummeted
in surgery, for unknown reasons. The fourth had a fatal blood clot
in the lung, and the fifth died because doctors infused so much
fluid into her body as part of the procedure that it seeped into
her lungs and caused pulmonary edema, in effect drowning her.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who perform liposuction had mixed reactions to the new
report, saying on one hand that it was unfair and sensationalistic
to focus on a handful of deaths when most liposuctions were done
safely. But they also said that like any surgery, liposuction could
be dangerous if done incorrectly. They found it worrisome that the
procedure had been taken up by many doctors, some with minimal
training in the technique, who were eager to cash in on people's
desperate desire to look sleek in shorts or a swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do the procedure correctly, it's very safe,'' said Dr.
Alan Kling, a dermatologist in New York who performs liposuction in
his office. ``The problem is that so many people are trying to get
in and make a fast buck, and they're not taking adequate
precautions or getting adequate training.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Schnur, associate professor and chairman of the
department of plastic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale,
Ariz., said, ``If you just finished your internship yesterday and
you want to do liposuction, you can, according to state law.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors perform liposuction in their offices, and in most
states they can do that without being tested or certified by any
professional group, Schnur said, adding that doctors who wish to
operate in hospitals do have to be approved by the hospital's
professional board.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur, who is also president of the American Society of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgeons, said a handful of other widely
publicized deaths from liposuction had led the group to create a
panel that is now studying the procedure and will recommend ways to
make it safer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ely of the medical examiner's office said that in 1997 she
investigated two deaths related to liposuction and became concerned
about the procedure. A search of 48,527 autopsy reports in New York
City for 1993 to 1998 turned up three more cases.
</P>
<P>
   All five patients had had the most common form of liposuction,
tumescent, in which doctors pump several quarts of fluid into the
area of the body that is to be suctioned. The fluid is a salt
solution containing a local anesthetic, lidocaine, to numb the
patient, as well as a stimulant, adrenaline, to help prevent
bleeding. The fat is sucked out through a tube attached to a vacuum
pump. Some doctors use a general anesthetic as well as the local.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that high doses of lidocaine are used, compared to the
amounts given for other procedures, the researchers suggested that
the three unexplained deaths from low blood pressure and heart rate
might have been the result of an overdose of lidocaine, or its
interaction with other drugs. Lidocaine is known to lower the heart
rate and in fact is used as an emergency treatment for dangerously
rapid heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur says the plastic surgeons' society is concerned about the
possibility of lidocaine overdose and has advised members to stay
within a conservative limit. He said that in addition to potential
problems from too much fluid and lidocaine, patients can be
endangered if the surgeon tries to remove too much fat at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more fat you take out, the more trauma to the body,''
Schnur said. ``This is like an internal burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal report did not say how much fat doctors had been
trying to remove from the five patients who died, but Schnur said
that liposuction that removes 12 pounds of fat or more should be
done in the hospital so that the patient can be carefully
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Kling says that he never removes more than five or six pounds in
one session and that he does not use general anesthesia. He said
the cases described in the medical journal broke ``every single
rule of safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The death from pulmonary edema, for instance, was that of a
210-pound woman who had been given more than 13 quarts of fluid, 7
intravenously and 6 infused into surgical sites, in a
four-and-a-half-hour procedure. That was considerably more fluid
than the other patients received.
</P>
<P>
   She also underwent more extensive surgery in one session,
including breast enlargement and liposuction of her chest, arms,
back, abdomen, thighs, buttocks and knees. In addition, she had
general anesthesia and at the time of surgery was being treated
with seven psychiatric drugs.

EX-SALVADORAN GENERALS SUED BY FAMILIES OF MURDERED CHURCHWOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly two decades after Salvadoran national
guardsmen murdered four American churchwomen, the families of the
victims have filed a lawsuit against two former Salvadoran generals
who have been granted residency in Florida despite evidence that
they covered up the internationally publicized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to highlight the growing problem of
suspected human rights offenders who have taken refuge in the
United States in recent years. Human rights advocates and relatives
said they hoped the suit would force US officials to take action
not only against the two ex-generals but also a number of suspected
human rights criminals whose presence in the United States was
documented in a Globe series earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this suit, not for the money, but to draw attention
to these people and to get them to come out from the rocks under
which they've been hiding,'' said William P. Ford, a New York trial
attorney whose sister Ita, a nun, was among those slain in the 1980
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of the most notorious crimes of the 13-year
civil war in El Salvador, which ended in 1991. The churchwoman --
Ford, Maura Clarke, Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan -- were
kidnapped by the national guardsmen, taken to a remote location,
raped, then shot to death. The case was solved only after US
authorities circumvented a widespread coverup by the Salvadoran
military.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed in US District Court in Miami, the families
charge that Jose Guillermo Garcia, the minister of defense at the
time of the murders, and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, who
directed the National Guard, ``initiated, organized, orchestrated,
directed and implemented a coverup of the Salvadoran National
Guard's responsibility for the crimes under their command.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit echoes the 1993 findings of a United Nations Truth
Commission, which concluded that Garcia had failed to adequately
investigate the murders and that Vides ``knew that members of the
National Guard had committed the assassination and...had
facilitated the concealment of facts, obstructing the respective
judicial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is expected to help clarify the vaguely defined role of
US courts in prosecuting human rights crimes committed abroad. The
faimlies charge the two ex-generals with overseeing extrajudicial
killing, torture and crimes against humanity. The former generals
are being asked to pay unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New
York-based group, discovered last year that the two ex-generals
were living in Florida. Garcia lives in Plantation, a suburb of Ft.
Lauderdale. Vides lives in Palm Coast, about 45 minutes north of
Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be reached for comment Wednesday. But in a recent
interview with the Globe, Vides adamantly denied his involvement in
the murders or the coverup. He said he entered the United States
through normal channels and had received his visa from a US
consular officer in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Citing privacy restrictions, both the State Department and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service have refused to discuss the
cases publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates said they have been stymied in their
efforts to find out why the two ex-generals were granted residency
in the US despite the allegations. US Rep. James McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat who has led efforts to press the government
for information about the case, said he planned to send a letter to
President Clinton requesting that all documents relating to the
case be released to the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the murders of four American women who
were brutally raped and killed by members of the Salvadoran
National Guard,'' said McGovern. In conversations with US officials
involved in El Salvador over the past several years, he said,
``everybody agrees that Vides Casanova and Garcia were involved in
the coverup, if not worse. Given that reality, how the hell did
they get here?''
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who also has
been involved in human rights issues in El Salvador, said he was
upset when he heard that the two former generals had been granted
residency. ``Here are the heads of organizations that were involved
in the killing of the churchwomen and they get residency status? I
know people down there that have never done anything wrong and they
can't get out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Scott Greathead, a member of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, which helped prepare the case, said he hoped that the suit
would help bring human rights offenders to justice. ``I think it's
enormously important to pursue the notion that the commander who
orders the crimes or who presides over the institutions that are
responsible for this kind of criminal activity are criminally
culpable for their acts,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Strange things happen in a state legislative
session when the governor becomes his party's front-runner in the
next presidential election. Everything is refracted through the
national prism, which may be why a hate crimes bill named in honor
of the black man who was dragged to death by whites in East Texas
has unexpectedly emerged as one of the most emotional flash points
of the current session.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said that Republicans loyal to Gov. George W.
Bush were attempting to bottle up the bill, the James Byrd Jr. Act,
to kill it in committee. That way, it would not land on Bush's desk
and force him to either support it, and alienate right-wing
Republicans who object to the inclusion of protections for gays and
lesbians, or veto it and offer Democrats a juicy issue to batter
him with in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all being driven by emotion, not logic,'' said Sen.
Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat who is sponsoring the hate
crimes legislation. ``And when I say emotion, I mean politics. The
Republicans are worried that if they pass the bill and if the
governor signs it, the religious right, the ultra-right, will seek
political retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Republicans say it is the Democrats who are
playing politics with the bill, trying to find an issue in Austin
that they can use against Bush in the presidential election. And
what better than painting him as a politician who is not solidly
against hate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's surprising for everyone that this bill has turned
into a political football, but it's the Democrats who have chosen
to make this a divisive issue for us,'' said Sen. Florence Shapiro,
a Plano Republican. ``I believe they are trying to hurt the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening in January of the 140-day session of the Texas
legislature, the last before the 2000 presidential campaign,
everyone had their list of pending bills that were considered most
likely to dominate the session's debate _ Bush's proposed $2
billion in tax cuts, utility deregulation, parental notification
prior to abortions for teen-agers, a pilot program of school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded hate crimes legislation was on nobody's list.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush's proposed tax cuts are likely to become the
dominant issue of the session before its close on May 31, it is the
hate crimes bill that has stirred the most passionate debate in
Austin in recent weeks. This is partly because the brutal death of
Byrd has given the issue added momentum this year. But politicians
in both parties, while blaming members of the other party for the
situation, acknowledge that it is largely the prospect of a Bush
presidential campaign that has pushed the issue to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overdramatic standoff over the hate-crimes bill has little
to do with reality or the bill's content, yet it's coming to
dominate the legislative session,'' said a lead editorial in
Wednesday's Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   A vote in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, the body
charged with deciding whether to forward the bill to the full
senate, was postponed after several hours of behind-the-scenes
negotiations Wednesday night during which members haggled over new
language that might make the bill agreeable to committee
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A new vote is set for Thursday, whether the new language can be
worked out or not, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, there is no assurance that the bill would pass the
senate. And if it fails in the committee, supporters say they have
several more tactics to bring it up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to give up,'' Ellis said, though he denied that
he was trying to find a political advantage for national Democrats
in 2000. ``I've been trying to pass this bill since 1990, that's
why I'm doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to say whether he favors the bill, only that
he would consider it if it lands on his desk. Nor has the governor
or members of his staff been drawn into the discussion of the
issue's ancillary political implications, even as far as
speculating whether Democrats are attempting to seize on the issue
as a fertile one to use against the governor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the natural tendency sometimes is to magnify an issue
by bringing in the issue of the governor's national aspirations,''
said Karen Hughes, the governor's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   But there is, at the very least, ``a widely help perception in
the capitol that the governor does not want this bill to reach his
desk,'' said Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, an El Paso Democrat. ``And in
politics, the perception is the reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have charged that high-ranking state Republicans
have been working, behind the scenes, to scuttle the hate-crimes
bill, including perhaps even the governor and his staff. Not true,
Hughes said. And Shapiro said that she had not received a single
call from the governor or anyone on his staff on the subject,
though hers was one of the critical votes on the senate committee
looking at the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ellis said he is inclined to believe Bush has not pushed to
kill the bill _ ``I think I can take my governor at his word,'' he
said _ but he is not so sure that other Republicans in Austin have
decided that it would be best for the party and their governor for
the issue to quietly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a fund-raising visit to Austin last week,
met with members of the Byrd family and called on legislators to
pass the hate-crimes bill. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is seeking
the Democratic presidential nomination, has also weighed in,
calling at least one Republican legislator and urging her to
support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted when he called,'' Shapiro said. ``I
couldn't imagine why he would ever make the call. I'm afraid I was
rather cool to him, I thought someone was pulling my leg. Then I
realized that the call was coming on the same day the president was
in town and met with the Byrd family. I think this really is
pressure form the Democrat side to turn this into a potential
national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's office issued a statement Wednesday urging the Texas
legislature to pass the hate-crimes bill, and a spokesman said he
had called Shapiro at the request of Texas Rep. Senfronia Thompson,
a Houston Democrat who sponsored the bill in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Texas already has a five-year-old hate-crimes law, though it
does not specify which groups _ minorities, gays, women, etc. _ are
covered. Opponents of the current bill say it is unnecessary, that
the existing law is satisfactory, that it has even been
strengthened in recent legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis and others have been trying for the last five
legislative sessions to pass a bill that does specify groups who
might be targets of hate crimes. In past sessions, the debate has
usually been over the inclusion of sexual orientation among the
hate categories. This time, though, that has not emerged as an
issue, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the other senators during the hearing on this bill that
I was glad, at least, that we had progressed to a point in Texas
where opponents of the bill do not feel able to say out loud the
real reason that they oppose it,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of
Texas who specializes in presidential politics, agrees that the
governor's national role has had a tendency ``to elevate certain
issues like this that otherwise would not have gotten as much
attention.'' But he thinks there is something a little deeper at
work, too, that the Democrats may have found a way to highlight a
certain predilection in the governor toward playing his cards close
to his vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People smell a reluctance in the governor to be smoked out,''
Buchanan said, especially on controversial, hot-button issues.
``And they see something like this as significant for that
reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of more interest, he said, is that years of bipartisan
cooperation in the legislature _ something that the governor has
often pointed to with pride and sometimes taken partial credit for
_ appeared to be fraying in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to pass the bill in the house was largely along part
lines, and the breakdown in the senate committee appeared to be
breaking in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the very heart of Bush's national appeal, that
he's just what the doctor ordered for Republicans trying to get
over Gingrich and Company,'' Buchanan said.

   PIANO-RECORDING-HISTORY (Undated) _ Is it possible to sum up the
vast recorded legacy of the piano? One answer has begun to arrive
in recent months. Philips has been releasing the first volumes of
Great Pianists of the 20th Century, which it says is the largest
recording project ever. It may well be: so far, 60 two-CD volumes
have been released, and when all 100 volumes become available by
the end of October, they will include 15,006 minutes of music. If
that number is a little difficult to comprehend, you might do the
math this way: figuring on a 35-hour-per-week listening schedule,

   ANDRE-DINNER-FILM (New York) _ ``My Dinner With Andre,''

were philosophical as well as personal. Last fall, the movie was
shown as part of an archival series of classic films at the
Hamptons International Festival, and it has just been re-released,
beginning with an exclusive engagement at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas

asks its audience to imagine that humans, after death, enter a sort
of purgatory that resembles nothing so much as an aging school
building or government depository. There, a helpful staff informs
them one by one of their status, offers sympathy (``So sorry for
your loss'') and then provides assistance with the task that

work, ``Fill the Woods With Light,'' which had its world premiere
at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., last summer, to a
commissioned score by the jazz composer Phil Woods, who will play
it at the Joyce with his Little Big Band. To Woods's mix of funky

   WOZZECK-OPERA (Undated) _ Two operas are closely linked:
``Wozzeck,'' a devastating success; ``Moses und Aron,'' a failure
of epic stature. The pupil, Alban Berg, wrote the first; the
teacher, Arnold Schoenberg, the second. Perhaps no opera since
Mozart feels as complete as ``Wozzeck.'' ``Moses und Aron'' lies
unfinished, although its first two acts were written some 20 years
before the composer's death in 1951. The words for a third act
awaited only the music for them. Both works played at the
Metropolitan Opera this season, showing us two minds going in
opposite directions. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). Photo.

MARKET PLACE: SEC GOES AFTER BOGUS SECURITIES OFFERINGS ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One company promised to turn iron-ore rocks into gold,
generating profits of 2,600 percent a year. Another sought money to
construct prefabricated hospitals in Turkey. A third offered an
opportunity to invest alongside the original backers of Microsoft
and Intel in a new venture that would sell software to operate Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, were frauds, using the new medium of the Internet for
the old-fashioned task of separating investors from their money.
They did so by promising profits that seemed too good to be true,
and, of course, were.
</P>
<P>
   Their practices were revealed Wednesday in an SEC enforcement
action against 18 individuals and eight companies in 14 cases of
fraud _ the agency's third sweep in seven months of Internet
investment scams.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous sweeps, in which 57 companies and
individuals were accused of touting investments without disclosing
they were being compensated to do so, the latest action focused on
bogus offerings of securities.
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which the Internet allows potential frauds to
reach out quickly to a broad group of people also gives regulators
a great ability to identify, track down and halt investment scams,
said Richard Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet makes everything more visible,'' Walker said.
Using scores of investigators to scour investment opportunities
being offered over the Web, ``we're able to get in and stop the
fraud earlier than we otherwise would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the cases announced Wednesday resulted in only small
losses by investors. For example, the SEC charged that a New York
company called American Brightstar Gold used the Internet to sell
at least $50,000 of its own securities. The agency said the company
told investors they would earn returns of up to 2,600 percent
annually, receiving a proportionate amount of gold that the company
would extract from a type of ore called magnetite concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC charged the company and David Abramson, a New York
resident, with securities fraud and sought the return of the
proceeds. A lawyer representing Abramson declined to comment on the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest cases announced Wednesday was one involving
five pyramid schemes that promised risk-free returns of up to 400
percent a month, operated by three people in Indiana, Missouri and
Amsterdam. The SEC said the operators gathered $1 million from
investors, who were promised additional money if they recruited
more investors, before a New York federal judge issued an
injunction freezing the group's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The offers to help build the hospitals in Turkey, supposedly
backed by three well-known Turkish banks, as well as the venture
investment alongside the Microsoft and Intel backers, also were
false claims, the SEC said. None of the groups had connections with
the institutions named.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cases announced Wednesday, eight used the long-popular
device of selling investments in so-called ``prime bank''
securities. Those investments are said to be in bonds or notes that
are backed by domestic or foreign banks, the World Bank or overseas
central banks; they typically promise outlandish investment
returns, of up to 100 percent every few weeks. According to the SEC
and the Federal Reserve, which have been fighting such scams for
years, ``prime bank'' securities do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's enforcement actions came one week after SEC Chairman
Arthur Levitt said the agency would double, to 250 lawyers, the
number of people it had working to uncover investment fraud on the
Internet. The commission has asked Congress for additional
resources to fight Internet fraud, and the White House has said it
will also request more funds from Congress for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also issued a series of tips for investors to help them
avoid online investment scams, encouraging them to check with state
or federal regulators to see whether companies offering securities
are registered to do so before committing money. The agency's tips
can be found at www.sec.gov, its Web site.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Beverly Hills voters have overwhelmingly
rejected a proposal to require that fur coats sold here carry a tag
describing the grisly ways that animals used to make them may have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, the sole issue in a special election on Tuesday
that drew roughly a quarter of the city's 20,473 registered voters,
was defeated by 63.8 percent to 36.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition A, the Consumer's Right to Informed Choices Act of
1999, would have required that furs, and products with $50 or more
worth of fur on them, carry a tag saying, ``Consumer notice: This
product is made with fur from animals that may have been killed by
electrocution, gassing, neck breaking, poisoning, clubbing,
stomping or drowning and may have been trapped in steel-jaw
leg-hold traps.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the measure, Beverly Hills voters deflected a
direct attack on a symbol of the city's image of glamour and
wealth. Beverly Hills, with its exclusive furriers and department
stores and Rodeo Drive boutiques, is one of the largest fur retail
markets in the United States, according to trade association
figures, and the city's name alone conjures images of wealth and
power.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said they resented their city's being used as a
stage to attract national attention to the plight of animals killed
for their pelts.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides raised more than $150,000 to press their causes.
The proposal's backers cast the issue as one of truth in
advertising, contending that fur sellers misled consumers by
routinely assuring them that animals were humanely killed for their
pelts. The advocates forced the city to hold a special election by
gathering signatures from more than 15 percent of the voters in
support of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew the backing of some Hollywood stars, including
the comedians Buddy Hackett and Sid Caesar and the actor Jack
Lemmon, who sent a mailer to voters on his own stationery asking
them to consider approving it. About 5,000 homes also received a
videotape with graphic images of animals' being killed. The effort
to win passage drew vast publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to educate a few consumers here in Beverly Hills
about how fur animals are killed by clubbing and electrocution, but
we succeeded in educating millions of people around the world,''
said Luke Montgomery, the 25-year-old campaign manager for Yes on
A. ``So if our intent was to educate people about these killing
methods the fur industry uses, we certainly did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said they had opposed the proposition because they
felt that it would mean an undue burden for Beverly Hills furriers
and that the tag's wording _ that the animal ``may have been''
killed in a painful manner _ would have been too vague.

SENATE REJECTS BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: An expanded version of this story is scheduled to move by 9
p.m. ET) 
(rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday narrowly defeated a
Democratic measure that would have tightened regulations on the
sale of firearms at gun shows, a clear illustration of lawmakers'
limited appetite for gun control even in the aftermath of the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, senators approved a rival Republican measure that would
create a voluntary system for unlicensed dealers at gun shows to
conduct background checks on their customers. Under current law,
only licensed gun dealers are obliged to do so, and while the
Democratic proposal would have changed that, the Republican
alternative does not. It was a major setback for gun control
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures were put forward as amendments to a broader
juvenile justice bill whose fate has yet to be decided, and the
votes split largely along party lines, with the Republican majority
electing the voluntary measure and the Democratic minority
preferring the mandatory one. The National Rifle Association
lobbied heavily in support of the Republican position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the NRA lives in here,'' grumbled Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., as she left the Senate floor after the votes.
``I find it extraordinarily discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that their measure took into account the rights
of the law-abiding citizens who represent the majority of
participants at gun shows, while the Democrats' amendment was
unduly meddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called the Democrats' amendment ``too
costly, too burdensome and too bureaucratic. We all know this is a
much more complex problem than guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had considered their gun show amendment to be the
single item in a package of 10 gun control amendments with the best
shot at garnering enough bipartisan support to pass. Its failure
created serious doubt that any of the rest of their proposals on
gun control would succeed, and it suggested that the political
ground on gun control had not shifted all that much since the 15
deaths at Columbine High School three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have put forward a few modest gun control proposals
that, like the voluntary measure they passed Wednesday, are clearly
intended to deflect any criticism that they are soft on guns and
too cozy with the NRA. But gun control advocates said the
Democrats' amendments, which are themselves quite limited in scope,
are more substantive and potentially effective.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the shootings at Columbine, Republicans have fixed
their attention not on guns but on the cultural realities that may
be influencing violent behavior among children.
</P>
<P>
   That focus was reflected Wednesday in the passage of a
Republican amendment to the juvenile justice bill that would
authorize federal studies into the marketing of violent imagery to
youth and encourage the makers of movies, video games and other
entertainments to enter into voluntary codes of conduct. Democrats,
too, supported the measure, which passed unanimously, 98-0.

FLYNT PLEADS GUILTY IN OHIO OBSCENITY CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Larry Flynt, who has been battling legal authorities
in Cincinnati for two decades, pleaded guilty Wednesday to two
counts of pandering obscenity in a deal that allows him to avoid
any jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, publisher of Hustler magazine, and his brother, Jimmy,
partners in an adult gift shop in downtown Cincinnati, agreed to
stop selling sexually explicit videos and pay a $10,000 fine. In
return, 13 obscenity charges against the two were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Flynts, who were indicted last year on charges of selling
obscene videos to a 14-year-old boy, could have each faced
sentences of up to 24 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they got the better of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is,'' Flynt said, ``we accomplished
what we wanted. And that is, Hustler magazine can be sold and
distributed in Cincinnati and throughout Hamilton County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to remove these videos from Hamilton County,''
said the county prosecutor, Mike Allen. ``And that has been
accomplished. It was never our goal to incarcerate the Flynts.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt had predicted that the trial would demonstrate the
changing mores of society. He had said that contemporary community
standards, a cornerstone of the constitutional definition on
obscenity, had changed sharply since he was convicted of pandering
obscenity in Cincinnati in 1977. But in making his plea agreement
in the third day of jury selection, Flynt chose not to test his
theory.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of First Amendment scholars, Flynt did not win the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flynt's point was that standards have changed in 20 years _
now we'll not know,'' said William Marshall, a law professor at
Northwestern University and a constitutional expert. ``If he still
sees himself as somebody who's carrying the torch on the limits of
obscenity and pornography, I think he lost.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Flynt's lawyers, Lou Sirkin, insisted the plea deal gave
the 56-year-old publisher a way out of the case that leaves him
``without any real scars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are off the hook,'' Sirkin said. ``Sometimes,
there's an advantage to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt had opened his store near the city's gleaming Fountain
Square because, he said, he was angered by crackdowns in Cincinnati
that were making it difficult for him to sell his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati officials have announced plans to acquire the store
and adjacent properties as part of a development of a new arts
center. If owners of the properties are unwilling to sell, city
officials have indicated they will seek to invoke the powers of
eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been delayed twice because Flynt, an Ohio native,
needed surgery for a urological problem related to his paralysis,
and had developed pneumonia. Flynt has been in a wheelchair since
being shot in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection had been moving slowly, with some potential
jurors in this conservative county saying they found the videos too
distasteful to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asserted that the images in videos, which often
featured violence against women, were much more profane than those
in Flynt's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   After being convicted in 1977 on pandering obscenity charges,
Flynt served six days of a 7- to 25-year sentence and was released
pending appeal. The conviction was overturned in 1979. The
prosecutor, Allen, promised Wednesday to prosecute Flynt if he
again attempted to sell explicit videos in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does, we will be back in court,'' Allen said.

 &HT;    Attorney general joins suit to open Olympic records
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker filed a motion
in Fulton County Superior Court on Wednesday to intervene in a
lawsuit over the sealed Atlanta Olympic bid records.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is joining the litigation as a co-defendant
with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the suit filed by Olympic
officials in their quest to keep bid records closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have upped the ante in my continuing effort to make the
Olympic records public,'' Baker said. ``I'll do everything I can do
as attorney general to move this issue forward and argue the case
for openness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, which owns the
records, filed suit against the newspapers last week seeking a
judgment that the documents are not subject to the Georgia Open
Records Law.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and the newspapers contend that the Olympics were a
public-private enterprise and that records pertaining to the bid
and the staging of the Games should be accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has made nine boxes of records available to the
public by appointment at the Atlanta History Center, but it
maintains that information related to staff, volunteers and
contributors to the bid effort are private and may be purged from
the files. Some documents were removed from the nine boxes.

LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST TWO SALVADORAN GENERALS IN 1980 SLAYINGS OF
NUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass.)  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The families of four American churchwomen who were
murdered while on mission in El Salvador more than 18 years ago
have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against two senior Salvadoran
military officers who are now retired and living in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says both officers were responsible for the
torture, rape and murder of the three nuns and a church lay worker
in 1980, an incident that sparked international outrage and led to
furious debate in the United States about the wisdom of its support
of the Salvadoran government.
</P>
<P>
   The four women, Mary Elizabeth Clarke, Jean Donovan, Ita C. Ford
and Dorothy Kazel, were detained on the night of December 2, 1980,
at a military checkpoint near the international airport in San
Salvador. The next day, their bodies, with bullet holes in the head
and signs of physical and sexual assault, were discovered along a
back road by local peasants.
</P>
<P>
   The murders occurred at a time when the Salvadoran security
forces, and allied death squads, were engaged in a brutal campaign
of torture and killings against real and perceived sympathizers of
the country's guerrilla groups. The targets included religious
leaders and others who were critical of the army's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the women decided to file the lawsuit after they
learned last year that the two defendants, Gen. Jose Guillermo
Garcia, El Salvador's defense minister at the time, and Gen. Carlos
Eugenio Vides Casanova, then a colonel who was director general of
the National Guard, were living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of deepening American involvement in the
civil war, the killings led the Carter administration to halt aid
to El Salvador briefly. Assistance resumed, however, when U.S
officials decided that the Salvadoran government was doing
everything in its power to investigate the crimes. During the civil
conflict, which began in 1979 and lasted about a dozen years,
American assistance to El Salvador grew to about $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, five members of the national guard were convicted of
the murders and sentenced to 30 years in prison. For years, both
the U.S. and Salvadoran governments maintained that the guardsmen
bore sole responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In March, four of the guardsmen broke their silence and admitted
to a group of American human rights lawyers that they had killed
the churchwomen, acting on orders given to them by their superiors.
They later repeated the admission to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guardsmen did not mention Garcia or Vides by name,
the lawsuit charges that, as commanding officers, both men were in
a position to know about the murders before they were committed and
both tried to cover up the involvement of senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the specific accounts of the abduction and murder, it is
clear that the women were obviously targeted,'' said Robert Weiner,
with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which is assisting the
lawyers for the families of the churchwomen. ``We had every
indication that there was some sort of reporting being disseminated
throughout the intelligence channel before the killing. These two
men headed the intelligence network.''
</P>
<P>
   Vides, who lives in Palm Coast, about 25 miles north of Daytona
Beach, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, denied the accusations
contained in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am far removed from any likelihood of having had knowledte,
much less, been involved, in the act,'' he said. ``This case has
taken on a dimension, I don't know if it's personal or political.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia added that those who had killed the nuns were trying to
create a rift btween El Salvador and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The charges contained in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal
court in West Palm Beach, are consistent with accusations made over
the years by human rights organizations, most notably, by a 1993
U.N. Truth Commission report. Last year, the United States released
declassified documents that indicated that both Garcia and U.S.
officials believed that the murders had been committed at the
behest of other senior officers, including Vides, who received two
Legion of Merit awards from President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such suspicions, the two generals were allowed to
retire, and were granted resident visas to the United States in
November 1989. Robert G. Kerrigan, the lawyer for the families,
said the statute of limitations for filing the lawsuit would expire
10 years from that time.
</P>
<P>
   After their confession last year, two of the four guardsmen, as
well as their commanding sergeant, were released on parole for good
behavior. The Salvadoran government said that it does not plan to
investigate the case any further. The State Department has said
that issue of whether or not the five guardsmen acted alone has not
yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   To the families of the churchwomen, the U.S. government's
attitude, which they say flies in the face of mounting evidence, is
reason enough to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought the suit to expose these people and to bring
pressure on our government to expel these people,'' said William
Ford, Ita Ford's older brother. `'This country has no place being a
retirement place for murderers.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern said that he and Rep. Joseph Moakley, a
fellow Massachusetts Democrat who investigated the murders of six
Jesuit priests and two other people in 1989 in El Salvador, plan to
ask the Clinton administration to release all documents pertaining
to the case so that the plaintiffs in the suit can use it during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the lawsuit, McGovern said he hoped it would send a
message to other people who are accused of atrocities and who seek
a safe haven in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on the United States government for allowing this to
happen,'' he said.

CORPORATE GIANTS ANGLE FOR SMALL MOBILE PHONE COMPANY IN BRITAIN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It is Britain's smallest mobile phone
company and has yet to turn a profit. But One 2 One has ignited a
heated bidding war between Europe's biggest telecommunication
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after its owners, Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC and Mediaone
Group, announced their interest in selling out, One 2 One has
attracted several bids around 10 billion pounds, or more than $16
billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   That would be nearly 13 times One 2 One's 1998 revenue of 781
million pounds. The high purchase price reflects strategic and
technological changes sweeping through Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom AG, which is already struggling to complete its
acquisition of Telecom Italia, is intensely interested. So is
Mannesmann AG, Deutsche Telekom's biggest competitor in Europe,
which owns stakes in numerous other European communications
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi SA, the French water utility that has transformed itself
into a media and communications conglomerate, has also acknowledged
submitting a bid. Industry executives think that France Telecom is
considering one, as well.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, mobile phone service is still growing at a torrid
pace. But the bidding for One 2 One also illustrates a scramble by
companies for a pan-European position as well as the imminence of
new technologies for high-speed data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall play here is not just for the subscribers,'' said
Steve Wreford, an analyst with Charterhouse Securities in London.
``It's for the growth that will take place over the next three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom succeeds in acquiring Telecom Italia, it
would own mobile phone networks in Europe's biggest and
second-biggest wireless markets. One 2 One would give it a national
franchise in Britain, the third-largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom is in the midst of trying to raise about 20
billion marks, or $11 billion, to finance its international
expansion. Though the company has refused to comment about One 2
One, people close to it say the German phone giant would love to
acquire a base in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, which obtained Germany's second mobile phone license
and is slightly ahead of Deutsche Telekom in mobile customers, is a
partner in the Italian wireless company owned by Olivetti and is
supporting Olivetti's rival bid to take over Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, France Telecom may well be interested in
blocking further expansion by Deutsche Telekom. The French company
had a strategic alliance with its German counterpart, but was
infuriated when Deutsche Telekom made its bid for Telecom Italia.
France Telecom announced plans to sell its 2 percent stake in
Deutsche Telekom and is threatening to take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   But at least as important as the desire for geographic expansion
is the introduction of much faster data technology in Europe, some
of it in the next few months. The technology is based on the
European digital standard for mobile phones, called GSM, which is
ubiquitous in Europe and most other countries, but not in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this summer or fall, European carriers are expected to
introduce ``high-speed circuit switching data,'' a technology that
can transmit material at 56,000 bits a second _ almost as quickly
as today's fastest modems over normal phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, carriers plan to offer a faster technology, called
general packet radio service, which could transmit at 115,000 bits
a second.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia, the big Finnish maker of cellular phones, plans to
produce telephones equipped with the packet technology later this
year, and Nordic countries may start offering the service early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And European governments are already beginning to distribute new
radio licenses for a third-generation technology that would be fast
enough to transmit video and high-resolution pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has announced plans to auction five new radio licenses
for this new technology in the next year. Industry analysts predict
that four of those will go to the nation's four existing cellular
telephone companies, because they can integrate the new networks
into their existing systems. ``They don't have a special right to
those licenses, but they can afford to bid more because it will
cost them a lot less to build the networks,'' said Justinian
Clifford Bowles of Commerzbank Global Equities in London.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has heightened the value of existing cellular phone
services, even though competition and price warfare has become
intense. Orange, Britain's third-largest carrier, now has a stock
market capitalization around $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One 2 One's current owners hired Lehman Brothers to explore
options two months ago. The company is a 50-50 joint venture
between Cable &AMP; Wireless and Mediaone, which AT&AMP;T is acquiring for
$58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mediaone had been trying to sell its international properties
before it became a takeover target itself, and AT&AMP;T has indicated
that it wants to sell foreign properties, as well. Cable &AMP; Wireless
reiterated Wednesday that it was considering all options for its
stake, including a public stock offering. But industry executives
say it is most likely to sell One 2 One to another company.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine a more confused environment for an
auction. Many government officials in Italy oppose Deutsche
Telekom's intended takeover there. Beyond that, many institutional
investors have been extremely dissatisfied with Deutsche Telekom's
new stock offering. Money managers here complain that the company's
chairman, Ron Sommer, has offered little explanation of its plan
for expansion. ``We'd prefer they made the acquisitions first and
then asked for more money,'' said Michael Schneider, fund manager
for DEKA Tele Medien, a German mutual fund that specializes in
communications and media stocks. ``We were unconvinced.''
</P>
<P>
   Big competitors are also unsettled. European companies are still
getting used to the idea that Vodafone, Britain's second-biggest
cellular carrier, has an agreement to buy Airtouch Communications
of San Francisco. Airtouch owns numerous cellular interests in
Europe and is a partner with Mannesmann in Germany's second-biggest
cellular carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Airtouch deal means that Vodafone must sell its own
minority stake in Germany's third-largest cellular company, E-Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann is waiting for the outcome of the Telecom Italia
takeover process. If a hostile offer by Olivetti should beat
Deutsche Telekom's, Mannesmann has an agreement to buy Olivetti's
stake in Italy's second-largest cellular carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that what happens in Italy could have a big impact
on what happens in Britain. And regardless of who wins the fight in
Italy, there is a good chance that a German company will end up as
Europe's new wireless giant

ONE TOUGH-TALKING SPYMASTER REPLACES ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By replacing Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov with
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin Wednesday, President Boris N.
Yeltsin substituted one tough-talking former spymaster for another.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is in loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 69, the outgoing premier who spied for the KGB in the
Middle East and later headed Russia's foreign intelligence agency,
was a survivor who built his own support base among Yeltsin's
Communist opponents and often clashed with an increasingly jealous
president.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Stepashin, 47, could not be more unlike his
predecessor. He has faithfully served Yeltsin, including a term as
the head of the KGB's domestic successor.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that capacity, in 1994 and early 1995, that Stepashin
was in charge of intelligence operations in Chechnya, where Russia
fought a war that failed to put down a separatist rebellion and
cost tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is well known for his successful work in the government, in
law enforcement bodies, for his active work in Russia's `hot
spots,' '' Yeltsin said of Stepashin in a televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said Stepashin would give a jump start to an economy he
said had stagnated under Primakov's eight-month tenure, and
Stepashin himself pledged to accelerate market reforms. Amiable and
approachable, Stepashin is a master networker but expresses no
individual political ambitions, all of which could be plusses for
his candidacy as premier.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepashin's reputation for unswerving loyalty to Yeltsin,
and his past role as head of Russian security agencies, have some
lawmakers concerned that he may use the country's second most
powerful post to orchestrate a crackdown against Kremlin opponents.
Other observers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin could ``without fear or reproach break up the
parliament,'' wrote the Moscow daily Izvestia recently.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin joined the Interior Ministry troops in 1973 and from
1980 to 1992 taught at a military academy. In 1986, he earned a
doctorate, defending a thesis with the title ``Party Leadership in
Leningrad's Fire Brigades During World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   He got Yeltsin's attention as head of the defense and security
committee of the Supreme Soviet, the legislature whose power
struggle with the Kremlin ended in street fighting in 1993.
Throughout the conflict, Stepashin sided with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus his reputation as a reformist with ideas for
modernizing the security service, led Yeltsin in 1994 to name
Stepashin head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin played a key role in the Chechnya conflict, first
organizing a botched attempt to overthrow the separatist government
of Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, then leading the Kremlin's
campaign to ``liquidate illegal bandit groups'' and ``restore
constitutional order.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have said flawed intelligence from Stepashin's
agency persuaded Yeltsin to order the disastrous December 1994
invasion of Grozny that started the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he was fired after a mismanaged attempt to solve a
hostage crisis that arose when Chechen guerrillas raided the
southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk. But Stepashin went on in 1997
to become Justice Minister and after April 1998 headed the Interior
Ministry, which oversees Russia's police and internal security
army. In that job, Stepashin has made no noticeable headway in
fighting crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has closed Russia's border with Chechnya and
pledged to have troops shoot ``bandits'' on sight. That solidified
his reputation as a tough talker, but also won praise from Yeltsin.

<P>
   In the latest consolidation deal by a cable company preparing to
offer telephone, Internet and interactive services as well as
ordinary television to its subscribers, Cox Communications &UR;  &LR; Inc.
announced Wednesday that it was acquiring TCA Cable TV &UR;  &LR; Inc. for
$3.264 billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal moves Cox up the ladder of the nation's largest cable
companies from No. 5 to No. 4, behind Time Warner &UR;  &LR; Inc.,
AT&AMP;T &UR;  &LR; Corp. (new owner of Telecommunications Inc.) and
Comcast &UR;  &LR; Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, based in Atlanta, will have almost 5 million cable
subscribers upon the completion of two deals _ Wednesday's with
Texas-based TCA, which has 883,000 customers mostly in Texas,
Arkansas and Louisiana, and its recent $1.4 billion acquisition of
Media General Inc., of northern Virginia, with 264,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was the last attractive takeover candidate among
the publicly traded cable companies,'' Fred Moran, an analyst with
ING Baring Furman Sels, said of TCA. Moran's company was among
several investment firms that gave TCA a ``buy'' rating recently.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation trend that began with enormously expensive
acquisitions by the three biggest cable companies is now spreading
to middle-sized companies, analysts said. Cable companies need to
acquire more systems and subscribers to achieve economies of scale
in building costly new networks capable of delivering telephone and
Internet and interactive digital television to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox-TCA transaction is valued at $63.89 a share, with Cox
offering TCA shareholders $31.25 in cash and 0.3709 share of Cox
common Class A stock for each TCA share. Cox will also assume $736
million in debt. The transaction has been approved by both
companies' boards.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said that the deal translated to a multiple of roughly 20
times TCA's estimated cash flow in the current fiscal year, which
ends Oct. 31, or a value of about $4,100 a subscriber. He described
that price as ``right in line with other recent transactions in the
industry and very rewarding for TCA shareholders because they get
both cash and stock in Cox, which is one of industry leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T paid about $4,600 a subscriber when it agreed to acquire
MediaOne Group Inc., last week.
</P>
<P>
   Another large multisystem operator, Adelphia
Communications &UR;  &LR; Corp. of Coudersport, Pa., has made three
acquisitions, each for more than $1 billion, of small cable
companies in the last two months. The latest was its purchase of
privately held Harron Communications in April.
</P>
<P>
   James Robbins, Cox's president and chief executive, said his
company planned to make further acquisitions, calling TCA ``the
cornerstone of our plans to offer advanced services in
middle-market communities.''
</P>
<P>
   TCA reaches 74 percent of the homes in its markets, well above
the industry average of 67 percent. And Robbins said it had several
other attributes important to Cox, including what he called ``a
powerful commitment to customer service, a solid management team, a
strong balance sheet and a technologically advanced network.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cox and TCA are both well ahead of most other cable
companies in making many of the technological improvements needed
to enable cable lines to provide advanced services and digital
television. Both have also been aggressive about deploying new
services to customers relatively quickly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Half of TCA's systems and more than 65 percent of Cox's have
two-way capability for data and telephone services. TCA offers
high-speed Internet access to about 2,300 customers now in
partnership with At-Home Corp. and digital-cable television service
to about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cox currently has almost 100,000 digital television subscribers,
in eight markets, and provides high-speed Internet access via cable
modem to 88,900 customers; it also provides digital telephone, but
to only about 42,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox stands today as the most technologically sophisticated
cable operator, already,'' Moran said. ``And TCA, as a
well-positioned Southwestern property, complements Cox perfectly
because they, too, have been aggressive in deployment of new
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the transaction is completed, Cox Enterprises Inc., will be
the majority shareholder of the new company, with 67.2 percent of
the equity and 76.8 percent of the voting power in Cox
Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement, Standard &AMP; Poor's placed debt of Cox
Enterprises Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. on CreditWatch with
negative implications, apparently because the Media General and TCA
deals will require substantial financing. While it has an extensive
investment portfolio that includes equity in AT&AMP;T and At-Home, Cox
has not announced a definitive financing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cox Communications fell $1.9375, to $8.625. TCA Cable
gained $7.96875, or 15.31 percent, to $60.03125.

A REJUVENATED SUTTON IS PLAYING AS WELL AS EVER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The PGA Tour is in Texas this week, which means
Hal Sutton is a good bet to play well.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton will enter the opening round of the GTE Byron Nelson
Classic on Thursday with confidence, playing in a state that has
been good to him. Sutton won last year's Westin Texas Open, he tied
for second at last year's Byron Nelson and he tied for second
earlier this month at the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   That success has been part of a resurgence that has rejuvenated
Sutton's career. During the early 1990s, Sutton fell from being one
of the tour's top players to being a player who was embarrassed to
hit balls on the driving range.
</P>
<P>
   His low point came in 1991, when he won only $39,234, finished
185th on the money list and wondered if he should find a different
line of work. But last year, Sutton came back, winning a
career-best $1.83 million, and capping his season with a dramatic
victory at the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 21 in the world, Sutton is 10th on this year's money
list ($849,070), and at age 41, his game is as good as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been driving the ball really well, my iron game has been
good and my short game is right there,'' said Sutton, the winner of
the 1983 PGA Championship, who has 10 career victories on tour.
``I've never won the Byron Nelson, but this course seems to fit my
game. I'm looking forward to this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The field has six of the world's top 13 players _ Tiger Woods,
Mark O'Meara, Nick Price, Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson and Fred
Couples. On Thursday and Friday, players will be divided between
two courses at the Four Seasons Resort and Club _ the TPC at Las
Colinas and Cottonwood Valley. The final two rounds will be played
at Las Colinas.
</P>
<P>
   For Sutton, every tournament during the next few months will be
significant because he is trying to secure a place on this year's
U.S. Ryder Cup team. Sutton is currently eighth in the Ryder Cup
points standing, and the top 10 players will make the team, along
with two players selected by this year's captain, Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton made the Ryder Cup team in 1985 and 1987, but both times,
the United States was beaten by Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would very much like to be on the Ryder Cup team,'' Sutton
said. ``I was a part of two teams, and I would like to make that a
brighter spot on my career.''
</P>
<P>
   This has already been a special year for Sutton and his wife,
Ashley, who became the parents of twins, Sadie and Sara, in
January. Sutton skipped the year's first three events, making his
season debut at the Phoenix Open, yet he already has five top 10
finishes in 11 starts. And considering his past success in Texas,
Sutton had reason to feel confident this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a reason for it, other than maybe
being from Louisiana, Texas is close to home,'' Sutton said. ``A
lot of my friends come over here for the tournaments. Maybe that
has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, I think I'm a better player than I ever have
been. Experience is both good and bad, depending upon what kind
you've had. But physically and mentally, I feel good. I'm looking
forward to some good things.''

EX-SALVADORAN GENERALS SUED BY FAMILIES OF MURDERED CHURCHWOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly two decades after Salvadoran national
guardsmen murdered four American churchwomen, the families of the
victims have filed a lawsuit against two former Salvadoran generals
who have been granted residency in Florida despite evidence that
they covered up the internationally publicized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to highlight the growing problem of
suspected human rights offenders who have taken refuge in the
United States in recent years. Human rights advocates and relatives
said they hoped the suit would force US officials to take action
not only against the two ex-generals but also a number of suspected
human rights criminals whose presence in the United States was
documented in a Globe series earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this suit, not for the money, but to draw attention
to these people and to get them to come out from the rocks under
which they've been hiding,'' said William P. Ford, a New York trial
attorney whose sister Ita, a nun, was among those slain in the 1980
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of the most notorious crimes of the 13-year
civil war in El Salvador, which ended in 1991. The churchwoman --
Ford, Maura Clarke, Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan -- were
kidnapped by the national guardsmen, taken to a remote location,
raped, then shot to death. The case was solved only after US
authorities circumvented a widespread coverup by the Salvadoran
military.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed in US District Court in Miami, the families
charge that Jose Guillermo Garcia, the minister of defense at the
time of the murders, and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, who
directed the National Guard, ``initiated, organized, orchestrated,
directed and implemented a coverup of the Salvadoran National
Guard's responsibility for the crimes under their command.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit echoes the 1993 findings of a United Nations Truth
Commission, which concluded that Garcia had failed to adequately
investigate the murders and that Vides ``knew that members of the
National Guard had committed the assassination and...had
facilitated the concealment of facts, obstructing the respective
judicial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is expected to help clarify the vaguely defined role of
US courts in prosecuting human rights crimes committed abroad. The
faimlies charge the two ex-generals with overseeing extrajudicial
killing, torture and crimes against humanity. The former generals
are being asked to pay unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New
York-based group, discovered last year that the two ex-generals
were living in Florida. Garcia lives in Plantation, a suburb of Ft.
Lauderdale. Vides lives in Palm Coast, about 45 minutes north of
Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be reached for comment Wednesday. But in a recent
interview with the Globe, Vides adamantly denied his involvement in
the murders or the coverup. He said he entered the United States
through normal channels and had received his visa from a US
consular officer in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Citing privacy restrictions, both the State Department and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service have refused to discuss the
cases publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates said they have been stymied in their
efforts to find out why the two ex-generals were granted residency
in the US despite the allegations. US Rep. James McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat who has led efforts to press the government
for information about the case, said he planned to send a letter to
President Clinton requesting that all documents relating to the
case be released to the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the murders of four American women who
were brutally raped and killed by members of the Salvadoran
National Guard,'' said McGovern. In conversations with US officials
involved in El Salvador over the past several years, he said,
``everybody agrees that Vides Casanova and Garcia were involved in
the coverup, if not worse. Given that reality, how the hell did
they get here?''
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat who also has
been involved in human rights issues in El Salvador, said he was
upset when he heard that the two former generals had been granted
residency. ``Here are the heads of organizations that were involved
in the killing of the churchwomen and they get residency status? I
know people down there that have never done anything wrong and they
can't get out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Scott Greathead, a member of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, which helped prepare the case, said he hoped that the suit
would help bring human rights offenders to justice. ``I think it's
enormously important to pursue the notion that the commander who
orders the crimes or who presides over the institutions that are
responsible for this kind of criminal activity are criminally
culpable for their acts,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: YELTSIN, HIS BACK TO THE WALL, TAKES HIS BRASHEST RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Encircled by leftist opponents and reduced almost to a
cipher in opinion polls, clearly ill and on the brink of
impeachment, President Boris Yeltsin rose Wednesday to dismiss a
government he had never embraced and to try once again to position
himself as Russia's savior.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years of such dramatic sackings, the question
this time was who Yeltsin was trying to save: democratic Russia, or
himself?
</P>
<P>
   In a political career distinguished by bold risks, Yeltsin took
one of the brashest Wednesday. On the eve of a parliamentary vote
on his impeachment, he fired a popular prime minister and dismissed
a government fashioned to mollify the same legislators who are
about to rule on his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the only
leader on whom reformers and Communists could agree after Russia's
economic collapse last August, had gone from stabilizing the nation
to stagnating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of economic strategy, even today, nine months
later, is still open,'' Yeltsin said, speaking laboriously and not
always clearly, in a broadcast address. ``I am convinced that
procrastination and delay is the most serious blow today to
stability in the economy and the social sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Yeltsin was seeking a return to stability and prosperity,
Wednesday's actions seem likely to lead to precisely the opposite
end. By dismissing a coalition government, Yeltsin may well have
assured his impeachment by an angry lower house of Parliament later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he lighted the fuse on a political and constitutional
crisis that could easily immobilize Moscow for months, with the
Parliament refusing to approve an impeached president's new
government, and the president dismissing the Parliament in return
and calling new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also has thrown into limbo the fate of several billion
dollars in loans that the International Monetary Fund has
tentatively pledged to Moscow, and which seem critical to Russia's
fiscal and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs the fund's money merely to avoid defaulting on its
existing foreign debt and choking off its access to credit for
years to come. The fund agreed last month to make the loans, but
only if Russia's Communist-controlled Parliament enacts unpopular
tax increases and budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's dismissal of Primakov, Yeltsin has yanked away
the only politician who could give the Communists the political
cover they need to vote for belt-tightening and against their own
party's economic ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Just what Yeltsin stands to gain in return is not completely
clear. The Parliament is unlikely to confirm his new prime
minister, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, and even if he were
confirmed, Stepashin's economic and social proposals would be dead
on arrival in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin could be angling to call new elections in the lower
house of Parliament, betting that voters would sweep out the
Communist plurality and install friendlier legislators. But even
the quickest elections could not present Yeltsin with a new
legislature before September, barely nine months before his term in
office expires and hardly enough time to pass any bold initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, many analysts say, is that Yeltsin was faced with
the very real prospect of political irrelevancy: a drawn-out
impeachment effort in Parliament's lower house, the crumbling of
his support in the upper house, which rejected his firing in April
of Russia's controversial chief prosecutor, and Primakov's own
rising popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has never brooked challenges to his authority, as his
repeated reshufflings of government show. Yeltsin shelled
Parliament in 1993 to put down a Communist uprising. Less
dramatically, he has run through five prime ministers in just the
last year, one of them _ his current envoy in the Yugoslavia
crisis, Victor Chernomyrdin _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly believed that Chernomyrdin was first dismissed
because he appeared too eager to succeed Yeltsin as president.
Primakov has repeatedly denied any ambitions for Yeltsin's job, but
opinion polls suggested that he was the most trusted _ and
electable _ politician in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin may have believed, when he accepted Primakov and two
Communist ministers in his government last September, that he had
bought harmony and new support for his policies. What he got was
the renewed pursuit of his impeachment by Communists and steady
nibbling at his authority by Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin looks like a bear in his den which doesn't see any
hint of light around him,'' said Otto Latsis, the veteran political
commentator for the newspaper Novy Izvestia. ``But this is a real
bear. This bear is not scared in such a situation. On the contrary,
it's on the offensive. He is simply showing his political character
hasn't changed.''

GAINS SEEN IN CONSUMER PRIVACY ON INTERNET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study of consumer privacy on the Internet shows that
nearly two-thirds of all commercial Web sites display some type of
warning if they collect personal information, a sharp increase
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable improvement, but there is still work that
needs to be done,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission, which has been waiting for the results of the
industry-financed survey before completing a report to Congress on
whether to regulate online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups said the findings, made public Wednesday, showed
that new federal regulations were not warranted, but consumer and
privacy advocates said most sites' practices left much to be
desired.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by Mary J. Culnan, a business professor
at Georgetown University, at the request of the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   A similar study by the commission last year showed that only 14
percent of Web sites warned consumers how their private information
was being collected, prompting warnings from Pitofsky that he would
push for new regulations in Congress this year if industry efforts
at self-regulation did not yield improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new study would play a central role in the FTC's
recommendations to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which looked at 364 commercial Web sites in February,
found that 93 percent collect some type of personal information. Of
those, 65.7 percent warned that businesses were collecting personal
details from visitors, including names, postal and e-mail addresses
and even likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   While most commercial Web sites now explain how those personal
details are used, just 10 percent of those sites had what the FTC
and industry experts consider comprehensive privacy policies. Those
sites notified consumers, gave them the chance not to have their
personal information collected, allowed customers to review their
information and explained how to contact the company with
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the largest companies on the Web, including IBM, America
Online, Microsoft, Compaq and eBay, paid a total of $60,000 for the
study. They have also formed new trade associations and
certification and monitoring groups like BBB Online and TrustE to
assure consumers of their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former FTC commissioner who is now a
consultant for one of the groups, the Online Privacy Alliance,
called the study an ``absolute vindication'' for those trying to
make self-regulation work.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates noted that few sites offered comprehensive
privacy policies and said that finding underscored the need for a
legal framework establishing basic practices. ``It's clear that
data collection is clearly the norm, yet one-third posted no
privacy practices at all,'' said Beth Givens, director of the
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.

TREASURY CHIEF RUBIN TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, architect of the Clinton
administration's remarkably successful economic policies at home
and its controversial response to unprecedented financial crises
abroad, submitted his resignation Wednesday after four years in the
post.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton confirmed that Rubin would be leaving the
administration on July 4 and nominated Rubin's trusted top aide,
Deputy Secretary Lawrence Summers, to take over as Treasury
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Washington pundits and Wall Street economists do not expect big
shifts in trade and budget policies if Summers' nomination is
confirmed by Congress. The stock market, after an initial jolt,
recovered Wednesday from news of Rubin's departure.
</P>
<P>
   But his resignation in the midst of war in Kosovo may be
ill-timed for an administration seeking to ensure the continuation
of this country's longest peacetime expansion. Rubin, a former Wall
Street financier, has presided over Treasury during a period of
tremendous growth that saw the benchmark Dow Jones industrial stock
index nearly triple in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss his cool head and steady hand,'' Clinton said.
``He cares very deeply about the impact of abstract economics on
ordinary people. I can tell you that for all these years, he has
always been one of the administration's most powerful advocates for
the poor and for our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Summers, a distinguished former professor
of economics at Harvard University who was instrumental in dealing
with Asia's financial crisis last year, as a ``brilliant'' member
of his team. ``Rarely has any individual been so well-prepared to
become secretary of the Treasury,'' the president said at a Rose
Garden ceremony under a bright blue sky. Also attending were
members of his Cabinet and the Congress and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he would nominate Stuart Eizenstat,
undersecretary of state for economic affairs, to succeed Summers as
deputy treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who is 60, said he found it difficult to leave because he
was committed to the administration. Rumors swirled that he may be
a candidate to replace Greenspan when his tenure ends in June 2000,
though administration sources said that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his decision to resign, Rubin said his 6 1/2 years in
Washington had been ``all consuming'' and that it was time to
return to his wife in New York, Judith Oxenberg Rubin, who remained
there during his entire tenure and rarely flew to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a truly extraordinary experience,'' Rubin said. He
was first assistant to the president for economic policy from the
beginning of Clinton's first administration in 1993 through 1994
and was appointed the nation's 70th secretary of the Treasury on
Jan. 10, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Rubin will go down in history as one of the handful of
great secretaries of treasury in our country's history,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts.
``Every American with a job should be grateful for his wise and
steady service.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Price, chairman of Franklin Mutual Advisors Inc., which
manages about $24 billion of assets, credited Rubin for keeping
``investor confidence at a very high level, and because of that the
markets have done very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Rubin amassed a fortune estimated to
exceed $100 million during 26 years as an executive at one of New
York's most prestigious investment banks, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. He
was co-chairman of the firm when he left.
</P>
<P>
   A Goldman spokesman said Rubin cashed out his equity position in
the firm and ``did not participate'' in the firm's recent public
offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street veteran was widely viewed as possessing a rare
mix of loyalty to the Democratic party _ he raised millions for the
Democrats during the Clinton campaign _ and Wall Street shrewdness
in dealing with Congress and international currency traders.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and 1996, when Congress faced a crisis on the
federal debt limit, Rubin found creative ways to continue funding
of essential government functions.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Munnell, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for
economic policy who is now a professor at Boston College's School
of Management, said Rubin ``deserves a lot of credit'' for
advocating early in Clinton's first term that ``if you want to
restore confidence you have to get this deficit under control.''
</P>
<P>
   As Treasury secretary, Rubin later found himself the
administration's point man during a string of financial emergencies
that threatened a worldwide recession or worse. They ranged from a
Mexican debt crisis in 1996 to a plunge in Thailand's currency in
1997, which spread throughout Asia and into Russia and threatened
to destabilize Brazil's _ and the world _ economy.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Rubin's Wall Street experience served him well
in dealing with the unprecedented crises. When the yen was going
into freefall last summer and threatening to further destabilize
economies in southeast Asia, he oversaw a US-government led
intervention to buy yen and prop up the currency and followed up
with strong prescriptions for Japanese economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not you want to credit the US Treasury for
arranging that or the Japanese government itself coming to its
senses, the fact is, within short order of the intervention in June
'98, the Japanese government did change course,'' said Adam Posen,
a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More controversial under Rubin's term was the administration's
backing of stiff conditions required by the International Monetary
Fund for aiding Russia and Thailand last year. Some critics believe
that the IMF-administration bailout packages worsened, rather than
eased, the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that problems in Asia and risks to the world were
made worse for a time by the methods applied'' by the IMF and by
the administration, said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for
Primark Decision Economics based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sinai added, the trio of Greenspan, Rubin, and Summers
ultimately played a major role in calming markets by deciding to
cut interest rates in the United States. ``I have no doubt'' Rubin
was involved in those discussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers is expected to be confirmed by the Senate Finance
Committee. A spokeswoman for Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of
Texas and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he plans
to hold hearings on the appointment as well.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, a prickly academic who is said to have become wiser in
Washington's ways while working under the low-key Rubin, is
expected to continue his policies. Analysts, for example, expect
Summers to support Rubin's strong-dollar policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers, who has written extensively on an array of topics
as an economist, may go further afield in his policies than Rubin
did, said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution in Washington.
``He might get involved in things you didn't expect _ things like
global warming, for example, because it involves tax policy,''
Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers left the podium in the White House Rose Garden barely
able to contain his emotions. ``I'd like to thank the people who
made it possible for me to be here today,'' he said. ``My teachers,
my parents, my wife, my children. . . . Mr President, thank you for
this opportunity.''

IN PHILADELPHIA MAYORAL CONTEST, RACIAL ISSUES EMERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was the kind of day politicians locked in a
close race only dream of. John F. Street, the former City Council
president who is one of five Democrats running for mayor of
Philadelphia, awoke on Tuesday morning to a long and ``heartfelt
endorsement'' in the city's largest newspaper, The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial endorsement not only urged Philadelphians to vote
for Street in the primary next Tuesday but also begged them _
``please, please'' _ to not vote for one of his closest
competitors, Marty Weinberg, a wealthy lawyer who was once an
adviser to Frank L. Rizzo when he was mayor from 1972 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging rebuke, the endorsement called Weinberg the worst
candidate in the field, based on his association with the
controversial Rizzo.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Street appeared at a news conference with
construction union leaders, who presented him with a check for
$100,000. Opening the envelop, he looked genuinely surprised. ``I
knew it was going to be a check,'' Street said. ``This is
unbelievable.'' He said it was the largest single donation he had
ever received.
</P>
<P>
   In a rough-and-tumble campaign to succeed Mayor Edward G.
Rendell, a popular Democrat who is barred by the city charter from
serving a third consecutive term, Street, 55, appears to be sailing
along as the front-runner, little concerned by the efforts of four
other Democrats and one Republican to overtake him. Altogether, the
six candidates have raised nearly $15 million, a record for
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rendell's leadership for the past eight years,
Philadelphia has reinvented itself as a vibrant city that has grown
in sophistication without losing its characteristic grit and
feistiness. Chronic budget deficits of previous administrations
have turned into annual surpluses, and economic development
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of Philadelphia's progress, the Republican Party
plans to hold its national convention in this overwhelmingly
Democratic city next year.
</P>
<P>
   In general, all the Democratic candidates have campaigned on the
urgent need to continue the progress of the Rendell administration
by improving the public schools, maintaining fiscal restraint,
expanding economic development into the neighborhoods and lowering
crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sam Katz, who is trying to become the city's first
Republican mayor since 1952 and faces no opposition in the primary,
is making the same points.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, the race for the Democratic nomination
seems to be tightening a bit, based on a number of polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mayor's strong support of Street, Weinberg, 62, and
John White Jr., 50, who once led the city's public housing agency
and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, appear to be
narrowing Street's lead.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Dwight Evans, 44, and Happy Fernandez, 60, a former
council member, are widely viewed as long-shot challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not coincidentally, the campaign dynamics began changing
last month, when the candidates began broadcasting a flurry of
attack ads, the most caustic from Weinberg's campaign. They
underscore how close to the surface the issue of race is in a city
where voters often cast ballots along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   As the only white candidate among the three leading contenders,
Weinberg is counting heavily on a strong turnout among what he
describes as ``row-house voters,'' essentially, white working- and
middle-class residents who constitute about half the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It is Weinberg's calculation that if the three black candidates
_ Street, White and Evans _ split the black vote, he can prevail.
Ms. Fernandez, who is white, is not expected to win enough white
voters to affect Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on that equation, Weinberg began running television
advertisements that use 18-year-old filmed images of Street, then a
young councilman, shoving a television reporter to the floor. In
another advertisement, Street is shown throwing water in the face
of a City Council administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Each advertisement asks: ``John Street for mayor? You decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg has also run commercials that cite Street's past
financial problems, including bankruptcy, and ask voters, ``Does
this sound like someone who should be in charge of a $2.7
billion?''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Weinberg said of his advertisements: `'I'd like
to view them as informational. These are things voters should know
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg's target audience is also reflected in his promotional
brochure that shows a series of five photographs of the candidate
and voters, only one of whom is black, a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   As the front-runner, Street has resisted being drawn into any
personal attacks. He has not denied the financial problems cited in
the Weinberg commercials, but he has refrained from responding
except to to call on Weinberg to avoid negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate people do desperate things,'' Street said in an
interview, referring to Weinberg's tactics. ``He is a candidate who
is drowning, failing in almost every way. I consistently said I am
not interested in doing anything negative.''
</P>
<P>
   White was drawn into the advertising wars only after Katz, the
Republican, began broadcasting commercials last week that attacked
the credibility of Weinberg and the managerial skills of White as a
way to prop up Street. Campaign aides in several camps say Katz,
49, would have an easier time defeating Street, especially if the
vote breaks along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg has virtually ignored Katz's foray into the Democratic
campaign, but White responded to Katz's criticism by calling his
contentions ``Republican lies'' in his own commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by polls showing him gaining on Street and pulling about
even with Weinberg, White said the race was now ``wide open,
anyone's to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm discovering that if the candidates can be viewed at all
objectively, there's a certain comfort level voters have discovered
with me,'' he said in an interview. ``For us, that's a big plus.''

BOMBING STEPPED UP; RUSSIAN CRISIS CLOUDS PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO stepped up its attacks on Yugoslavia
Wednesday, dropping bombs on assorted targets during one of the
busiest 24-hour periods for the air campaign, as political
instability in Russia intruded on diplomatic efforts to find an end
to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides reported unusually heavy bombing in Kosovo, the
southern Serb province that is seeking independence. Yugoslav media
said the bombs struck several civilian targets in both Kosovo and
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic acknowledged that the
military had suffered casualties on the eve of Security Day, which
honors the country's police and security forces. He paid tribute to
the ``many members'' of the country's forces killed in the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yugoslav troops stormed two northern Albanian
villages in an offensive aimed at cutting supply lines of the
Kosovo rebels, in one of their deepest incursions yet from Kosovo,
according to international observers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, during a visit to the
Albanian capital, Tirana, said the alliance would not allow attacks
that pulled Albania into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict is not going to be sent into Albania,'' he said.
``I want to reassure the people of this country that NATO will not
tolerate any action against this country stemming from the presence
of NATO forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said two dozen US Apache helicopters deployed in Albania
would go into action ``very soon'' against the Yugoslav Army and
police accused of purging Kosovo of hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance had
launched 327 airstrikes, ``the highest number of strike sorties to
date.'' Allied warplanes struck five airfields, eight bridges,
armored vehicles, a missile launcher, barracks, command posts,
ground troops and destroyed five MiG-21 aircrafts on the ground in
raids late Tuesday and early Wednesday, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign to pin down, cut off and take out Serbian forces
is gathering pace,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   As the air strikes intensified, Russian Prime Minister Boris
Yeltsin warned that his country may pull out of Yugoslav peace
talks and cease its shuttle diplomacy if its proposals are not
given more consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's special envoy for Kosovo, ex-premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin, said without elaborating that Yeltsin's dismissal of
the government ``will cause us special difficulties,'' Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Solana played down the significance of developments in Russia
for Kosovo diplomacy, telling a Spanish state radio during a brief
interview: ``I am sure that whatever the final result of the change
of government in Russia is, the diplomatic process will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --Defense Secretary William Cohen said the air strikes were
having an impact far beyond degrading Serb military forces. He said
Pentagon officials are now getting reports that senior military
leaders have joined the elite in Yugoslavia in sending their
families out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic may not admit that he is taking his country down the
road to ruin _ politically, economically and militarily _ but his
top leadership is apparently more realistic,'' the secretary said.
He added that Yugoslav leaders ``are now seeing the handwriting on
the wall, and it's not a forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   -- As the ashes of three Chinese journalists killed in the NATO
bombing of Beijing's embassy in Belegrade returned to Peking in an
emotional welcome, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, on a
16-hour visit to China, said he had apologized for the accident,
but China refused to soften demands that NATO halt its air war. He
said he had come to Beijing to try to persuade China to play a
constructive role in the search for a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   -- The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said new donations
from the United States and Canada will help it cope with a cash
crunch that threatened to disrupt getting help to Kosovo refugees.
The Geneva-based office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
had appealed for money to cover the Kosovo crisis for the first six
months of this year. Since warning of the cash crisis,the UNHCR
said it had received donations of $5 million each from the United
States and Canada. But officials said the money crisis is not over.
</P>
<P>
   The military buildup also continued. The 104th Fighter Wing in
Westfield, Mass., joined two units in other states being called to
active duty for the Kosovo operation.
</P>
<P>
   The other two units are the 124th Fighter Wing, in Boise, Idaho;
and the 110th Fighter Wing, in Battle Creek, Mich. All three will
depart from Barnes Air National Guard base in Westfield as a joint
force under one commander.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials said the units will take six A-10 attack jets,
low-flying tank-killing planes also known as Wart Hogs, that have
been put to use recently over Kosovo, as well as crews, maintenance
and support personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials refused to say how many troops will go, when
they might go or how long they might be gone, saying such
information was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, 47 members of the 260th Air Traffic Control
Squadron was ordered to report Wednesday to Pease Air National
Guard Base to provide help in the conflict. Though the date for
their departure or where they will be going was not known, they
were expected to serve for 270 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest airstrikes, explosions boomed Wednesday afternoon
across Nis, a frequent target in central Serbia, and cluster bombs
rained down on the eastern sector of the city, reported Tanjug, the
state news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The city is the headquarters of the army group responsible for
operations in Kosovo. Eight missiles struck the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, Wednesday morning, hitting the local airport and two
suburbs, the Serb-run media center there reported.
</P>
<P>
   An ``unspecified'' number of people were killed in an attack on
a Serb collective farm in Svetlje, housing Serb refugees from
northern Kosovo and two nearby villages, Yugoslav media reported.
Two people were wounded in airstrikes near the central Serbian town
of Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people, all reportedly civilians, were killed in the
preceding 24-hour heavy bombardment, the Yugoslav media said.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's sole remaining rail link with Yugoslavia, a 20-mile
route running between the Hungarian town of Szeged and the Yugoslav
town of Subotica, was cut by a bombed overpass that collapsed on
the track, the Hungarian State Railways said. Other links have
already been bombed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is demanding a total withdrawal of Milosevic's forces from
Kosovo, the return of refugees and the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force before it halts the strikes.

SHAKEUP IN RUSSIA ADDS UNCERTAINTY TO KOSOVO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The turmoil in Russia on Wednesday appeared to
represent another impediment to the Clinton administration's hopes
of finding a diplomatic end to the conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   After dismissing his government, President Boris Yeltsin
threatened to withdraw from negotiations on Kosovo, saying that
Moscow's proposals were being repeatedly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our calls and repeated suggestions are clearly not reaching
somebody,'' a Kremlin spokesman quoted Yeltsin as saying. Without
calling specifically for NATO to halt its bombing as he has in the
past, this appeared to be Yeltsin's point.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has tried hard to make Russia a partner
in the search for a Kosovo settlement, said the changes in Moscow
were internal matters. American officials also said they hoped the
Russian special envoy to the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, would
continue in his role as a shuttle diplomat with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But several officials said they worried that the Russians'
wrangling could sideline a peace settlement, or shift the emphasis
away from one, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis unfolded as Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
met in Moscow with top Russian officials, for the second time in
three weeks, to try to work out details on an international
security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the officials Talbott met with was Igor Ivanov, the
foreign minister. But because of the shakeup in the Russian
government on Wednesday, Ivanov only held the post as acting
minister and his future was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov has become a key contact for Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who has spent up to two hours on some days talking to him
during the Kosovo crisis as she tried to insure that he understood
NATO's positions.
</P>
<P>
   She met with Ivanov in Oslo a month ago to set the stage for
bringing Russia into the administration's orbit on Kosovo. Last
week the seven richest industrial countries and Russia agreed on a
joint statement of principles for ending the war, the most
far-reaching agreement between NATO countries and Russia on Kosovo
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott also spoke on Wednesday with Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin
does not hold a government position, and his role as envoy was
probably not threatened, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Chernomyrdin remained as involved in the diplomacy
as he has in the past several weeks, his platform within Russia
could well be eroded by internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   A special adviser to Albright, Stephen Sestanovich, acknowledged
at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that it was unclear how the
Russian envoy would be affected if Sergei Stepashin, Yeltsin's
choice for prime minister, assumed the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather hard to tell at this stage,'' Sestanovich said.
``We know Mr. Stepashin; we don't know whether he will have a
mandate to pursue different policies from Mr. Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   With the mistaken bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
having created difficulties for a diplomatic solution,
administration and NATO officials said they hoped the upheaval in
Moscow would have only a limited effect on the process.
</P>
<P>
   The French president, Jacques Chirac, arrived in Moscow on
Wednesday to talk to the Russians about their role in ending the
war. The French, who view the Russians as an essential element in
solving the Kosovo conflict, said they would persist in working
with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The groundwork was laid last week by the G8 in Bonn, and our
objective is to resolve this conflict,'' said Hubert Vedrine, the
French foreign minister, in alluding to the agreement between the
Group of 7 and Russia last week.'
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said on Wednesday
that Ivanvov told him in a telephone conversation on Wednesday he
could be reappointed as foreign minister if Stepashin was confirmed
by the Duma. But given Ivanov's closeness to Yevgeny Primakov, the
dismissed prime minister, it was not a certainty that Ivanov would
remain foreign minister, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sestanovich, the adviser to Albright, gave a careful view of
what the Russians could accomplish in Kosovo, when he appeared at
hearings of the House International Relations Committee. ``Their
objectives, if we look at what they say, are to end this
conflict,'' Sestanovich said. ``They say that it has to be ended on
a basis that protects the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. And
with that we can agree.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sestanovich cautioned: ``If Russian objectives are to solve
this problem in Kosovo, and instability in the Balkans more
generally, in a way that is simply aimed at hampering American
policy, then we won't be able to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott left Moscow on Wednesday night for Helsinki where he was
to meet with the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari. The
administration and other NATO countries believe that Ahtisaari may
be a suitable negotiator with the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, when NATO gets to the point of presenting a cohesive
plan concerning an international security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari heads a country that is not a member of NATO _ a plus
in the mind of Milosevic. But the Finnish president has been
outspoken against the the reports of atrocities and forced
expulsions against ethnic Albanians, a position that benefits NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is scheduled to take the chair of the European Union in
July for six months, a position that would give Ahtisaari extra
clout as a negotiator with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy, Chernomyrdin, was also expected to visit
Ahtisaari on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has stressed that there is still a lot of
work to do with the Russians on bringing their and those of NATO
closer together on the key elements of the international force that
is planned to secure Kosovo and take back refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Russia would like to diminish NATO's role in such a force, but
if agreement can be reached, Milosevic would be presented with the
plan, administration and NATO diplomats said.

HOUSE TENTATIVELY OKS CAMPAIGN FINANCE PACKAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the blessing of top legislative leaders,
the House on Wednesday tentatively approved new rules for reporting
political contributions that should make it easier for the public
to decipher a campaign's backers and activities, including
last-minute infusions of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a separately approved bill to put the information
on the Internet, proponents of the reforms said Texas is on the
verge of eliminating secretive contributions of cash and corporate
``soft money'' into state officials' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to candidates, House Bill 5 by Rep. Pete
Gallego, D-Alpine, increases from $50 to $100 the amount of
contributions and expenditures that must be itemized in reports
filed with the Texas Ethics Commission. But its main features are
aimed at allowing public scrutiny of campaigns for governor, judge
and the Legislature, the author said.
</P>
<P>
   If finally approved by the House on Thursday, Gallego's bill
goes to the Senate, where key supporters are prepared to press it
through the legislative process in the session's waning days. The
biennial lawmaking session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly significant for the fact that for the first
time, we do some innovative things like soft money reporting,''
Gallego said. Soft money is the unlimited money that corporations
or others can give to political parties rather than individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a provision that requires corporations to report the
amount of money they spent ... on administrative expenses for
political action committees that wasn't there before,'' Gallego
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of sunshine on the political process, it makes a big
difference,'' he said. The bill was crafted during months of
meetings that involved candidates, elected officials, political
parties and advocacy groups. Only provisions that both major
parties agreed to in advance were included in the package, Gallego
said.
</P>
<P>
   One key improvement, he said, would be a new requirement to
report direct expenditures of more than $5,000 that aren't funneled
through a campaign, such as when a benefactor buys airtime for a
candidate's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a big contributor to causes, particularly if you're
doing it in the last few days of a campaign, within 24 hours you
have to file either by fax or telegram a report with the ethics
commission what you've spent,'' Gallego said. ``That's a good thing
because it lets you know who's doing what in the final days of the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals should work well with a previously approved
requirement for electronic filing of campaign finance reports, the
author said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the last day for the House to give initial approval
to its own members' bills, so the chamber is expected to work until
midnight if necessary. But most of the measures approved this week
face uncertain fates in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   The House approved new safety regulations for the state's 500
body piercing studios, including a mandate to obtain a parent's
written consent before piercing is done to anyone under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The measure controls piercing of noses and navels, but not ear
lobes, which rarely produce consumer complaints, said sponsoring
Rep. Ron Clark, R-Sherman. After being changed to prohibit piercing
of an intoxicated person, Senate Bill 61 by Sen. Frank Madla, D-San
Antonio, was headed back to the originating chamber for
reconsideration.

   Yeltsin's latest government shakeup _ his third in 15 months _
comes on the eve of the what promises to be a stormy and emotional
debate on his impeachment in the Russian parliament on Thursday,
with the outcome of a vote scheduled for Saturday increasingly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the danger of his being removed from office is slight,
Yeltsin _ weakened by poor health and isolated politically - has
already succeeded in throwing Russia's future into uncertainty,
jeopardizing a pending package of badly need foreign credits and
increasing the chances of early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised statement Wednesday, the 68-year-old president
said he had taken the ``difficult decision'' because Primakov,
whose coalition cabinet included Communist ministers, had failed to
pull Russia out of its economic crisis by putting too much emphasis
on political consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premier's caution, his readiness to take only those
measures that get maximum approval and support are now beginning to
cause damage,'' said Yeltsin, whose face looked pallid and puffy,
and whose speech was labored. ``The time of soothing talk is over,
the turn of vigorous action has long come.''
</P>
<P>
   To replace Primakov, a former foreign minister appointed eight
months ago as a compromise candidate, Yeltsin named Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin, a Yeltsin loyalist and a veteran of
Russia's security services whose own views on Russia's troubled
economic reforms are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Russian parliament's rebellious mood, Stepashin's
confirmation is by no means assured. Liberal deputies hold him
accountable for his role in the bloody Chechen war, while
Communists, overlooking his law and order credentials, might vote
him down as a Yeltsin appointee. His rejection would open the
possibility for Yeltsin to make his next surprise move _ a
disbanding of the lower house, followed by early parliamentary
elections, perhaps by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the president's decision to fire a government that
had their support, Yeltsin's Communist opposition Wednesday called
for an emergency meeting of the parliament's upper house to review
Primakov's dismissal, and ordered its supporters out onto the
streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's sudden announcement topped a week of steady
speculation about Primakov's coming fall from power. Yeltsin, in
recent appearances, has seemed to go out of his way to snub his
prime minister. In private, the president's aides described
Primakov as an unreconstructed Communist, who if left in office,
would slowly lead the country back to its authoritarian past.
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections now due in December, and his own
presidential term expiring in the summer of 2000, Yeltsin, Russia's
first democratically elected president, is concerned about the
survival of a legacy that includes the introduction of a fledgling
market economy, freedom of the press and the return of Russia to
the circle of Western democracies, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's mounting irritation with Primakov has also
been linked to his apparent frustration over the prime minister's
independence, popularity and above all, his close ties to the
Communists. Primakov may have signed his government's death warrant
Tuesday night when he once again reassured his left-wing allies
that he would resign rather than accept the dismissal of his top
Communist deputies, Yuri Maslyukov and Gennadi Kulik.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, a Middle East expert and former intelligence chief who
once served as a top diplomatic adviser to Soviet leaders, was
widely credited with calming Russia's political turbulence after he
took office last fall. Ever the cautious diplomat, he avoided any
grand schemes for economic recovery but managed to avoid the
hyperinflation, and total economic disaster that many experts had
predicted for Russia after last August's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to opinion polls, Primakov soon emerged as Russia's
most trusted politician, even as economic statistics showed a
steady rise in the number of Russians living below poverty levels.
In a recent poll by the Center for International Sociological
Studies of 4,730 russians, 82 percent credited Primakov with
stabilizing the political situation in the country, while 77
percent approved of his domestic policies. But the same poll showed
only 40 percent in favor of Primakov's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
   At a farewell meeting with his cabinet Wednesday, Primakov said
his team had nothing to be ashamed of, listing his government's
success at paying back debts to pensioners, and at preventing the
collapse of the currency. After packing up his office, Primakov,
69, spent the evening watching a European soccer championship at a
Moscow stadium.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Primakov repeatedly denied any presidential ambitions,
his name inevitably surfaced as a plausible candidate to succeed
Yeltsin next year. But without the authority that comes with power,
it is not clear whether Primakov, who suffers from a back ailment,
will pursue a political career of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian economy crippled by debt, corruption and
mismanagement, Primakov's lack of any economic program become more
and more of a liability. ``Last fall, Primakov did a great thing
when he managed to stabilize the situation,'' said Mikhail Berger,
editor of the newspaper Sevodnya in a radio interview Wednesday.
``Brakes are an important part of any car. You cannot drive a car
without brakes. But if you apply the brakes all the time, it is no
longer a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian politicians _ including Moscow Mayor Yuri
luzhkov, the leading presidential candidate _ had recently stepped
up their criticism of Primakov, accusing him of marking time as
economic stagnation set in. But the timing of his dismissal _ on
the eve of a highly charged impeachment debate _ was greeted with
almost universal dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Grigori Yavlinky, leader of Yabloko, Russia's largest liberal
party, compared Yeltsin's move to a chess player who overturns the
chessboard, throwing the pieces, and his opponents, into disarray.
``It is a typical radical move,'' said Yavlinsky who was the first
to float Primakov's nomination during Russia's last political
crisis which followed Yeltsin's dismissal of the short-lived
government Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky had harsh words for Primakov's economic performance
but he was even more pessimisstic about the prospects for the
Russian economy during the coming period of political instability.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov called Primakov's firing ``unjust and unjustified,''
while several regional governors lamented the onset of another
period of political inactivity, as a new government puts together a
new team and new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fully functioning government, the Russian parliament
is unlikely to give prompt approval to a package of politically
unpopular measures set by the International Monetary Fund as
conditions for the staggered delivery of an $4.5 billion credit,
earmarked for payment on Russia's outstanding IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's political disarray has also raised concerns about
Moscow's ability to follow through on its diplomatic initiatives in
the search for peace in Kosovo. At a press conference Wednesday
held jointly with U.S. assistant secretary of state Strobe Talbott,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special Balkans enovy, admitted that
frequent changes in government ``create certain problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the biggest concern is over a potential
constitutional clash that could develop if the parliament's lower
house votes on Saturday to start impeachment, and subsequently,
votes to reject Stepashin's nomination as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian constitution, drafted by the Yeltsin Kremlin and
adopted in 1993, gives the parliament's lower house three chances
to approve the president's nominee for prime minister. If the
nomination fails on the third try, the president is obligated to
disband the parliament and set early elections.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same constitution forbids the president from
disbanding the parliament once an impeachement vote is taken. If
both events take place, then Russia could face another
constitutional clash like the one that led to the street violence
and shelling of the old parliament by army tanks in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five charges brought against Yeltsin in the indictment
pending in parliament, only one _ accusing him of waging of an
illegal war in the breakaway region of Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 _
has a chance of collecting the 300 votes needed for passage in the
450-seat lower chamber. The difference will be made up by members
of Yavlinsky's Yabloko faction which on this charge alone, is
prepared to join the Communist-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Before a russian president can be ousted from office, the
impeachment charge must be cleared by both the Constitutional Court
and the Supreme Court, and finally must be approved by the Council
of Federation, the parliament's upper house. The process could take
months, and could be easily tripped up by legalities at any step.
</P>
<P>
   A successful impeachment vote Saturday would deliver another
devastating blow to Yeltsin's dwindling authority. In recent
months, he has already seen his once-assured support in the Council
of Federation _ made up of regional governors and legislative
leaders _ chipped away in a battle over the Kremlin's efforts to
force Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argued that Yeltsin's gamble may pay off, with the
restoration of a balance of power between the presidency and the
parliament. ``Tthe president suddenly realized that the price being
paid for Primakov's support in the Duma was too high,'' said Vitaly
Tretyakov, editor of the Independent Newspaper, a Moscow daily.
``He realized that in this triangle two is company, but three is a
crowd, and he was the odd man out. He couldn't bear it, and fired
Primakov to restore the balance.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TEAM EFFORT SUREST WAY TO WIN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A decade ago, a continent away, a basketball team was
practicing and a rookie guard was penetrating and the players with
him on offense were observing. The coach, by reputation the
creative wizard of the day, watched the pint-size point man dribble
into the lane, into traffic, leave his feet and throw the ball to
... no one.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson's face became contorted with disgust, and he shouted
his Golden State Warriors to a halt. He marched over to Tim
Hardaway and placed his hand on the new kid's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen,'' Nelson said, ``we have ourselves a special talent
here. But for him to do what he does best, which is make all of you
look better, you're going to have to put yourself in position for
him to pass you the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice continued. Later that day, Oct. 17, 1989, an earthquake
fractured the San Francisco Bay area. For its pro basketball team,
which was loaded with offensive weaponry and had lightning-quick
Hardaway at the trigger, the aftershocks would last for years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, by the time the structural core had collapsed for
Nelson and Golden State and Hardaway wound up with Pat Riley in
Miami, he was an All-Star with a surgically repaired knee, a gunner
in his own right who took one look at the undistinguished players
around him and decided they were all his license to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first got here, I don't think he trusted the other
guys,'' said Bob McAdoo, a Riley assistant who fired up a few
forced jumpers in his own playing days. ``He's had to learn to
trust them, to not think he has to take every big shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the story of Game 2, Heat versus Knicks, Miami's
desperate push for an extended first-round playoff series. Whether
the Heat could win a game at Madison Square Garden, Wednesday night
or in Game 4 Friday, and take the series back to Miami was likely
to depend on the Heat's ability to make the Game 2 story a
serieslong theme.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning aside, could Hardaway continue to trust the
likes of Keith Askins, Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown? Could he
count on Riley's commonplace supporting cast to keep making the
shots?
</P>
<P>
   There are no sure things in playoffs this season, now that the
Bulls dynasty has run its course, and that means every flawed team
has its share of insider intrigue. So while the evolving Knicks
have struggled to define themselves in relation to Patrick Ewing,
their longtime 7-foot franchise player, here is the Heat,
top-seeded in the Eastern Conference, still trying to decide how
best to use its 6-foot shooting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   That's the inherent appeal of the pro playoffs, as opposed to
the one-and-out college tournament. The best-of-5 or best-of-7-game
series allows for adjustments in strategy and attitude. Every game
can be a new season, which is why no declarative statements should
be made until the word elimination is attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on Tim about getting better shots after the first game,
about not always settling for the long jumper,'' McAdoo admitted
before the Miami shoot-around Wednesday at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway had taken 19 shots in Game 1, made four. His right knee
is hurting, though he threatens to terminate any interview in which
he is asked how much. Whatever. As much as Hardaway has tormented
the Knicks from afar, he has had his share of games when,
completely healthy, his shots seemed magnetically drawn to the rim,
front and back. With all due respect to this electric player, no
team ever won a championship on the strength of a little man
hoisting jumpers from 23 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McAdoo said Hardaway's instructions for Game 2 were to not
surrender his dribble to the Knicks' pressure, get into the teeth
of the defense, create a medium-range game, as opposed to always
looking for a Mourning dunk or a 3-point shot. Hardaway took five
shots and the Heat won by 10. He was back in that practice gym,
distributing the ball the way Nelson envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' he said Wednesday night. ``I'm not worried
about getting off my shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has always said the same thing, but the proof of
conviction is how ego mixes with team when the season is on the
line and the cast starts clanking its shots. Out West, Hardaway had
the young Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin around him, and then
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Knicks, who have other perimeter scorers, there is no
one of comparable ability on this Heat team, built in the combative
image of its celebrity architect.
</P>
<P>
   Four years and counting in Miami, this is Pat Riley's team. If
it wins, he gets the glory. If not, then he, not Hardaway, takes
the heat. &QL;

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I often get e-mail from people whom I'd like to add to
my Address Book, but creating new contacts is time-consuming. Is
there an easy way in Outlook 98 to transfer e-mail addresses in
messages to the Address Book?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Indeed, there is. Open up the message. Now right-click
on the sender's e-mail address, which you'll see on the From: line
at the top of the window. Choose Add to Contacts from the menu that
pops up. This will bring up the Contact dialog box and
automatically insert the e-mail address. You also can use the box
to add other useful information you may have about the person, such
as a phone number. When you're done, click Save and Close.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing Solution
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am running Windows 98 on a fairly new computer. When I'm
using Internet Explorer 4, I often get ``frozen'' and can't escape
the program. As a result, I am forced to shut down by turning the
power off. Is there some way to get the computer to quit the
program without having to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have an uncle who sometimes freezes, and we've found that
the best way to get him going again is to shout at him. But yelling
at your computer isn't going to help. There is something you can
try, however. Press one of the Control keys (they're probably
labeled Ctrl) and, at the same time, press one of the Alt keys and
the Delete key. This will display the Close Program box. In theory,
if you then click End Task, the program will close and you can get
back to business.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Ctrl-Alt-Del combination sometimes doesn't
work. In which case you can do one of two things: Press
Ctrl-Alt-Del twice in a row, which should restart the computer, or
do what you've been doing and shut down the system.
</P>
<P>
   Because your problem seems to happen most often in Internet
Explorer 4, you also might try downloading the latest version of
the browser, IE 5, which may prove more stable for you. You can get
it for free at  &LR; www.microsoft.com/ie. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Font Frenzy
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there way to print out all the fonts in Word 97 for
comparative viewing? If not, is there another resource for doing
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Windows only lets you print separate samples of each font. To
do that, go to Fonts in the Control Panel (Start
Button/Settings/Control Panel/Fonts), double-click a font and click
Print.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, there are some good third-party programs
that can print the comparative lists for you. One that's gotten
high marks in reviews is FontLister, a $5 shareware program that
you can download from ZDNet's software library at
 &LR; www.hotfiles.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At the same site, you also can download a free program that lets
you view a sample list of fonts right from the Word toolbar _ which
may save you the trouble of having to print them. This is a feature
that Microsoft has included in some other programs, notably
Publisher, but which for some reason hasn't been available in Word.
(It will be, however, with the arrival of Office 2000 next month.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the program you should try is called ``Enhanced
Drop-Down Font List for MS Word 97,'' which is about as descriptive
as a name can get.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM Facts
</P>
<P>
   Q: Currently my system has a 40x CD-ROM drive. I would like to
install a recordable CD-ROM drive (CDR) so I can record stuff on
CDs for backup purposes. But the CDR I have in mind has a slower
reading speed than the CD-ROM drive I already have. Is it possible
to have two CD drives at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure it's possible, but I don't know whether there's much
advantage to it. The CDR drive you're contemplating probably reads
at 24x, which is plenty fast. And since it can also read ordinary
CDs, it would make your existing CD-ROM drive redundant.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of having two CD drives is that you could copy a CD
directly. But that's time consuming, and it's actually easier to
``rip'' information off a CD, store it temporarily on your hard
drive, then write it to a blank CD. And for that procedure, all you
need is the CDR.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Tired of the same old sounds that your computer emits when you
start Windows, shut down your system or perform other Windows
functions? You can easily customize your system with short audio
clips that you can record or download from the Web. Once you have
the sounds on your hard drive (they must be stored in ``.wav''
files), use the Sounds feature in the Windows Control Panel to
substitute them for the boring Windows sounds.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street flinched, but then quickly brushed off
Wednesday's announcement that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was
resigning and being replaced by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks did fall on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial
average plunging more than 200 points in the morning. Bond prices
dipped and the dollar, which was rallying in Europe because of the
sudden dismissal of the Russian prime minister, gave up some gains.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for traders and investors to realize
that the resignation news was not that bad and the three markets
began to rebound almost immediately. Indeed, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov had
more impact, but it was still muted. While the dollar moved as some
investors sought a haven, bond and stock prices fell only
moderately in key emerging market countries.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day in the United States, stocks were
mostly higher, the dollar rose against the euro and bond prices
were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rebound is that Summers is respected, though
his bluntness might mean some volatile trading days when he speaks
his mind. Additionally, Clinton administration policy initiatives,
including support for a strong dollar, open markets and its focus
on the repair of global financial markets, are not expected to
change. The U.S. economy is in good shape and the world financial
crisis has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, Wall Street was prepared. Rumors of a
Rubin-Summers switch have been circulating for so long that the
only uncertainty was the timing of the change. The Treasury went to
great lengths to prepare financial markets and investors for the
change, even insisting that the cover photograph for a Time
magazine article on the taming of the global financial crisis
include Summers with Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a move that had long been contemplated,'' said John
Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. ``And there is
no sense that Summers is untried in directing policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley,
Dean Witter, said the change in leadership at the Treasury would
not have an effect on his outlook for the stock market. But he did
say there would be a ``vacuum in the Cabinet'' because Rubin's
contributions included more than his Treasury duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``His influence and his wisdom covered geopolitical areas and
areas of public policy well beyond financial, and that is what will
be sorely missed,'' Wien said.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that with ``the credibility of the Clinton
administration damaged, Rubin was the one person who had the
respect of Congress and the respect of our partners abroad. And it
will take a while for Summers to grow into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Fand, the senior foreign exchange strategist at
BankBoston Corp., suggested that the appointment of Summers might
even give an extra upward push to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar will benefit from his frankness on the problems
with the Japanese and European economies,'' said Fand, because his
comments will presumably make it clearer to investors why they
should be investing in the United States rather than Europe or
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Fand also said that ``the dollar is likely to be more volatile
because Summers will be less controlled with his remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.78
points, to 11,000.37. Two oil companies _ Exxon, off 2 9/16 a
share, to 79 1/16, and Chevron, down 3], to 94 11/16 _ accounted
for most of the Dow's loss as the price of oil fell to $17.57 a
barrel, dropping for the fourth time in the last five trading days.
</P>
<P>
   The other major stock indexes ended higher. The NASDAQ composite
index rose 39.86 points, or 1.55 percent, to 2,606.54, led by Cisco
Systems, which reported better-than-expected earnings for its third
quarter and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Earnings jumped 33
percent and the stock rose 6~ a share, to 118}.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks set a new closing
high, finishing at 1,364.00, up 8.39 points. The Russell index of
2,000 smaller-company stocks climbed 2.45 points, at 449.26.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff that greeted the Rubin announcement was a reflection
that traders cannot take time to assess important news. If it
appears to be bad, they have to sell immediately to protect
themselves from serious losses. If the news proves to be less
worrisome, they can always buy again, even profiting from the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Bond investors remained nervous Wednesday ahead of reports on
producer and consumer inflation, set for release Thursday and
Friday respectively, and on retail sales Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes went much better
than Tuesday's five-year note auction, giving the bond market a
little lift. The new 10-year note was auctioned at a yield of 5.51
percent; by the end of the day that slipped to 5.50 percent as the
price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond was up 4/32, to 91 30/32, while
the yield slipped to 5.82 percent Wednesday. A poor five-year
auction Tuesday had raised the yield on the 30-year bond to 5.83
percent, its highest in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar strengthened against the euro, with the euro ending
the day at $1.0653, from $1.0715 on Tuesday. The dollar was off
slightly against the Japanese yen, at 120.95 yen compared with
120.97 Tuesday. The dollar did rebound from the intraday low
against the yen after the Rubin announcement.

   In emerging markets, the Bovespa stock index in Brazil dropped
nearly 1 percent, while the Bolsa index in Mexico fell 1.74
percent. The difference _ or spread _ between the yield on Russian
bonds and comparable U.S. Treasuries jumped to 42.73 percent, which
reflected a 10 percent drop in prices, according to J.P Morgan
Securities. But the moves in Latin American bond markets were much
smaller. In Brazil, the spread widened less than a quarter of a
percentage point to 8.88 percent.

 USA Networks, Lycos Officially Call Off Merger
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Officially throwing in the towel on a controversial deal that
shareholders opposed and Wall Street doubted, Lycos Inc. yesterday
scotched its $22 billion merger with USA Networks by mutual
consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment,'' Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said
in a conference call with reporters and analysts. ``We had a very
difficult time explaining the value of this deal'' to the financial
community.
</P>
<P>
   In February, USA Networks agreed to buy Lycos of Waltham, Mass.,
and combine it with the cable TV network's Home Shopping Network
cable channel and Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., a ticket
agency and online entertainment directory.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos _ the third-most-popular site on the Web _ is in a race
with America Online, Yahoo, Excite and others to reach the most
consumers with an all-in-one commercial Web site. Such super sites,
or ``portals,'' combine online shopping, news, Web searches, e-mail
and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The quashed merger will have ``absolutely no bearing'' on Lycos'
proposed $83 million buyout of San Francisco's Wired Digital, Lycos
officials said. The long-planned deal to acquire the online news
service, which employs 160, should be completed next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people wondered how a leading content provider like Wired
Digital fit into the same company that owns Home Shopping
Network,'' said a Wired Digital employee, who asked not to be
named. ``The question was: What is our role in this beautiful
e-commerce machine?''
</P>
<P>
   Those views evidently were shared by many on Wall Street, who
balked at the idea of an Internet company and cable TV network
melding operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were misgivings about this hybrid Internet-electronic
retailing company that was not a pure Internet or media
transaction,'' said Barry Parr, e-commerce analyst at International
Data Corp. in Mountain View. ``There was a fair amount of
disconnect between two companies with far different selling styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the market wanted (for Lycos) was a deal with a major TV
network, like NBC,'' Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last-minute negotiations Tuesday night, USA Networks CEO
Barry Diller and Davis abandoned plans to create an e-commerce
behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   New York's USA Networks offers cable TV programming available in
70 million homes. Its Home Shopping Network handles more than 1
million telephone transactions every day, and Ticketmaster sells 70
million tickets a year. Lycos, meanwhile, reaches about 32 million
people each month _ nearly half of all domestic online users _
through a network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Media mogul Diller couldn't win over an army of day traders who
own a major piece of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Investors chafed at the deal, flooding Internet chat rooms and
message boards with caustic remarks about the deal, Diller and
Davis. Many wanted Lycos to remain a pure Internet company and
avoid melding operations with a traditional retailer like Home
Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more damning, Diller also failed to keep the support of
Lycos' largest shareholder, CMG Information Services, a Boston
investment firm that owns about 20 percent of Lycos. CMGI initially
supported the deal, then retreated after Lycos shares plummetted.
CMGI went so far as to hire investment banker Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter to help find another suitor to challenge Diller's bid.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell, CMGI chief executive and a Lycos board member,
said Lycos can now turn its attention to developing online assets.
``We are gratified that Lycos shareholders will now have new
avenues to realize appropriate value for their shares,'' Wetherell
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Early bets are that Lycos will renew merger talks with a media
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of eligible bachelors is as large as it's ever
been,'' Ron Sege, Lycos executive vice president, said in a phone
interview. ``Time Warner, Viacom, AG Bertlesmann, CBS and Fox are
presumably looking. There are lots of potential spouses out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos lost a potential mate on Monday, however, when NBC
announced it is teaming with online community Xoom.com and
Snap.com, an NBC-Cnet joint venture that provides news and
searching, to create a super Web site called NBC Internet, or NBCi.
Industry watchers already peg the value of that enterprise at $3.5
billion to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its termination agreement with USA Networks, Lycos is
required to pay the cable TV network $35 million if it agrees to be
acquired by someone else before July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also agreed to feature Ticketmaster and CitySearch
on Lycos' phalanx of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal's demise sent the stock of both companies
soaring. Lycos shares jumped $8.75, to $107. USA Networks shares
improved $3.56, to $39.44.

 Pac Bell Inside Wiring Ruling
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
State regulators today will likely approve Pacific Bell's request
for a rate increase on inside wiring insurance but deny the
company's application for rate increases on other services such as
collect calls and calling cards.
</P>
<P>
   Customers now pay 60 cents per month for Pac Bell's ``inside
wiring repair'' plan. Those who pay the monthly fee can get phone
wiring problems inside their homes fixed for free by Pac Bell.
Those who don't have the plan can either pay Pac Bell for repairs
or hire an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Utilities Commission will vote on two proposals
today: A PUC administrative law judge has proposed raising the
inside wiring fee to $1 a month, and PUC Commissioner Henry Duque
has proposed raising it to $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   Duque's proposal, unlike the $1-per-month proposal, could result
in more increases down the road because it also would recategorize
inside wiring as a fully competitive service. Pac Bell can raise
rates more easily on competitive services than on regulated ones.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have balked at Duque's proposal, saying that
inside wiring services are not competitive and that Pac Bell should
not be allowed to charge much more than $1 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's much competition for this service,''
said Paul Stein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network. ``A
huge percentage of Pacific's customers subscribe to inside wire
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of Pac Bell customers pay for inside wiring
insurance. Pac Bell must repair outside wires, but inside wires are
the responsibility of the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials support Duque's proposal. Pac Bell spokesman
John Britton said customers can get their wiring repaired by dozens
of companies other than Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ads in the phone book for companies that will do
this. It's been fully competitive for quite a while,'' Britton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals agree on this point: Pac Bell should not be
allowed to increase its rate caps on services such as calling card,
collect and person-to-person calls.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell had asked the PUC for permission to set higher rate
caps on these services, but both proposals under consideration
rebuff that request. The company wanted to raise the maximum fee on
a collect call to $1.60 from 95 cents and on a person-to-person
collect call to $4 from $2.95.
</P>
<P>
   However, both the judge's and Duque's proposal would reclassify
some operator-assisted services as fully competitive.
</P>
<P>
   If they are reclassified, Pac Bell could raise rates on those
services more easily than it can now.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a case to be made that his approach
worsened the global financial crisis of the last few years. He
could be politically tone-deaf, as when he initially resisted
efforts in Congress a year and half ago to overhaul the IRS. At
times he was stubborn and turf-conscious, traits on display in his
continuing battle with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
preserve the Treasury Department's powers as a bank regulator.
</P>
<P>
   But the enduring reality about Robert Rubin is that he was
consistently the most influential voice in shaping U.S. economic
policy through more than six years in which the economy performed
remarkably well, bringing great benefits to the United States and
incalculable political advantage to his boss, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he announced on Wednesday his resignation as
secretary of the Treasury, Rubin stood second only to Greenspan as
the embodiment of U.S. economic solidity in a world that has been
roiled by financial instability and accompanying political
upheaval. ``It's hard to argue with success, and his success has
been extraordinary,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman
Sachs International.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin both reflected and encouraged the economic ethos of the
1990s, bringing to Washington from his background on Wall Street a
deep understanding of the power of the financial markets and a
distrust of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is certain to rank among the most important Treasury
secretaries of the 20th century, if only because of the magnitude
of two crises that confronted him: Mexico's near-meltdown in
1994-95 and the financial turmoil that swept out of Asia and into
other regions of the world in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, his responses _ though successful in the sense
that the problems were ultimately contained _ remain the subject of
vigorous debate among economists. Critics say he achieved his goal
of calming global currency and stock markets at the cost of
plunging millions of people in developing nations into poverty
through the policies he prescribed of high interest rates and
reduced government spending. Others say his advocacy of the the
free flow of capital across national borders helped set off the
financial crises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But his most enduring legacy may prove to be his success in
convincing Wall Street and much of the country _ as well as his own
party _ that fiscal and monetary austerity could be compatible with
the progressive aims of a Democratic administration. As chairman of
the National Economic Council when Clinton first took office, Rubin
played a critical role in persuading him that a credible
deficit-reduction policy would lower interest rates and create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put fiscal austerity on the screen as one of the lodestars
of economic policy,'' said Robert Litan, director of economic
studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also argued in favor of free trade against protectionist
interest groups within the party. Despite a large and growing trade
deficit, he maintained a policy of keeping the dollar strong,
helping to hold down inflation and making the United States even
more of a magnet for foreign investment. And he counseled a
hands-off approach toward the Federal Reserve, giving Greenspan
full room to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Given his Wall Street ties, as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs,
and his personal wealth, Rubin's policy leanings may seem
surprisingly liberal. He cautioned against turning Social Security
into a gamble on the stock market. He supported the 1993 tax
increase on the wealthy that was at the heart of the
administration's early deficit-reduction efforts, and he fought
Republican tax cuts with the argument that they did too little for
working people and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part Rubin was seen even by Republicans as a
steady hand on the tiller, a market-oriented pragmatist who
inspired confidence if not agreement with all his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, praised Rubin for having been ``a good stabilizing force
in the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had his share of critics. Stephen Moore, of the
libertarian Cato Institute, said conservatives had always been wary
of Rubin because of his willingness to raise taxes in 1993 and his
unwillingness since then to cut them. ``He's got an
anti-supply-side mentality, and it's always puzzled me why that
is,'' Moore said. ``It may be guilt from making all that money.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance on the world stage has come under even sharper
review, and not just by conservatives. Although the bailout of
Mexico that he orchestrated restored economic calm there, many
economists think it may have planted the seeds of the Asian crisis
that sprouted two and a half years later.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout's primary feature was to rescue investors who had
bet on Mexican bonds and stood to lose fortunes. And that sent a
signal to investors that they had nothing to fear from debt
problems in emerging markets, some economists said, encouraging a
further, large-scale flow of money into developing countries that
their financial systems were unequipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, Rubin also encouraged the free flow of
capital around the world by pressing companies to drop trade
barriers and open their banking systems to global competition. In
hindsight, even some former Clinton administration officials said,
they and Rubin may have missed the potential dangers of allowing
investors to unleash huge pools of cash into less developed
countries at the touch of a computer button.
</P>
<P>
   When Thai devaluation in July 1997 spread gradually throughout
Asia and on to Russia and Latin America, Rubin took the lead in
developing not just the Clinton administration's response but also
the International Monetary Fund's.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the United States and the fund imposed high interest
rates and tight budget policies on countries mired in the crisis to
restore currency stability and calm markets. But austerity sent the
affected economies into deep economic slumps, from which many are
only now emerging.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they are emerging, however tentatively. And perhaps
most important for Rubin's reputation, the United States was never
hit hard by either the crisis in Mexico or the global financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin came to the administration a stranger to the ways of
Washington and to Clinton. But it was a measure of the influence
and respect he has gained that even before his departure was
announced Wednesday, there were rumors that he would be selected to
fill the only shoes in economic policy circles larger than his own
_ those of Alan Greenspan, whose current term as Fed chairman
expires in 13 months.

CLINTON SETTLES ON ADMIRAL TO REPLACE CHINESE AMBASSADOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending a six-month search, President Clinton plans
to nominate Adm. Joseph Prueher to be the next ambassador to
Beijing, a choice that the administration hopes will signal the
importance of working with China on critical national security
issues dividing it from the United States, White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same week that NATO warplanes mistakenly bombed the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, sparking demonstrations throughout
China, the administration finally selected a replacement for the
departing ambassador, James Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had failed to persuade at least six former
officials to accept the post. Many were put off by the prospect of
having to manage a deteriorating relationship with Beijing,
enduring a potentially difficult confirmation process and serving a
short term for a lame-duck president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the White House bypassed the diplomatic corps and chose
Prueher because of his high-profile military background and because
he was ``the most seasoned statesman we could find,'' said David C.
Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher, who was commander of the unified Pacific Command until
March, gained a reputation as a tough military statesman who
improved military ties with the Chinese but also sent U.S. warships
into the Straits of Taiwan to warn China not to use war games to
disrupt the 1996 elections in Taiwan. It is unusual, but not
unheard of, to name a military official to an ambassadorial post.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well respected in Congress, in the White House and
in China,'' said David J. Rothkopf, a former senior Clinton
administration official. ``He is viewed as a real grown-up who
won't give away the store at a time when what's needed is a
soldier-statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Although entry in the World Trade Organization remains an
important issue for China, the emphasis in relations has shifted
toward national security concerns as Congress investigates China's
acquisition of American military secrets and China condemns the
NATO air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher, 56, retired from the military on May 1, after learning
he was being considered for the post. Although he has strong
backing in the White House _ National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
formally offered him the position _ the admiral was not the first
person approached for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the winter, the Clinton administration contacted at
least six former officials _ including two former members of
Congress, a former National Security Adviser, a former secretary of
defense and Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff _ all of whom politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said that when he was approached about the post he
strongly recommended Prueher. ``He would be the best man for the
job,'' the general said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates were reluctant to undergo a confirmation process
in the Senate that could become a forum for attacking Clinton
administration policies and China's record on espionage, human
rights and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Prueher's formal nomination is expected to be sent to the Senate
in two weeks, and a hearing is expected in June, White House
officials said. Sasser had planned to leave China this month,
before he and several other diplomats came under siege by Chinese
protesters angered by the Chinese embassy bombing in Belgrade last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials hope Prueher's confirmation process
will go smoothly, despite anti-China sentiment in Congress, because
he received confirmation as commander of Pacific forces in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During his previous confirmation, he was questioned about his
role as commandant of midshipmen at the Naval Academy from 1989 to
1991, when he oversaw the investigation of a sexual harassment case
against eight midshipmen who chained a female midshipman to a
urinal.
</P>
<P>
   The woman eventually resigned from the academy over what she
said was Prueher's leniency toward her assailants. At his Senate
hearing, Prueher said he regretted some of his decisions in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   While commander of Pacific forces from 1996 through March 1999,
he visited China seven times, promoting military ties between
senior through junior officer ranks. In an address at China's
National Defense University in 1997, he warned that if the United
States and China failed to establish a ``partnership based on
mutual security,'' they could end up in another ``Cold War based on
mutual suspicion, where both sides lose, and neither side gains.''

 Column: Web Site Making Ethnic Media Accessible to the Mainstream
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
They're the most popular newspapers you've never heard of _ but
that could change.
</P>
<P>
   California's ethnic media, covering local events in a babel of
languages, are organizing to put their English translations online.
</P>
<P>
   So now, when a bomb falls on a Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, you
can get more than just the mainstream U.S. news perspective. You
can see what the California editions of the Chinese language press
_ the Sing Tao Daily, the World Journal and the China Press _ have
to say.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers are among 150 news organizations that have a new
home at New California Media Online.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at  &LR; www.ncmonline.com &LR; , aims to be a ``Web portal''
for California's ethnic media, and it's easy to see the concept
spreading nationwide and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   It's the brainchild of Sandy Close, the executive editor of the
Pacific News Service since 1974 and winner of a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius award'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in business and be operating in the world economy now
and to be a monolingual American like myself is to be at a
tremendous disadvantage,'' Close said. ``The parochialism of the
American media desperately needs the voices accessible through the
ethnic media.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Close established New California Media, a coalition of
news and civic groups dedicated to raising the profile of ethnic
media. It puts out news on the Pacific News Service wire, it stages
an annual awards banquet, it earned desks in the City Hall press
room for ethnic media, and on May 27, it's leading a New California
Media Expo at Pier 35.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's launched a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is run by Steven Chin, a former San Francisco Examiner
reporter who now runs his own Web design firm in Multimedia Gulch
called Monkey King Media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to have historic implications for how we see and
do journalism in California,'' Chin said. ``It's potentially of
huge value because you're able to transcend the boundaries you're
limited with in television, radio and print.''
</P>
<P>
   Chin runs the nonprofit site as a paid contractor, with two of
his employees working half time. Ten translators take stories
originally written in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Spanish and, occasionally, Arabic and post them on the site in
English.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The site is updated several times a week and more frequently
when there's major breaking news, such as the Chinese Embassy
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Close and Chin hope that the site ultimately will reap a
financial reward for the ethnic media by connecting them to
advertisers; at the moment, they're trying to build traffic by
placing links on other ethnic Web sites, like Latino Link and Net
Noir.
</P>
<P>
   The NCM Online site now is packed with stories, summaries, links
and chat, as well as searchable and in-depth information on all the
major participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former mainstream reporter, I wish I had had this site,''
Chin said. ``It's the best news tips you'll ever get. It's a whole
new level of information.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FATHERS AND SONS: &LR;  One of Texas governor and putative presidential
candidate George W. Bush's best friends in Silicon Valley just
freed some more time for fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring Communications founder Tony Perkins has relinquished
the chief executive's job.
</P>
<P>
   He'll stay on as chairman _ he owns more than 50 percent of the
company _ and as editor-in-chief of the firm's flagship business
technology magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His business partner Chris Alden last week assumed the reins as
interim CEO, and they're looking for what Perkins called a
``world-class media executive'' who can take the company public.
</P>
<P>
   They reached the decision over dinner one night two weeks ago.
Oddly enough, the fateful meal was at the Duck Club at the Stanford
Park Hotel in Menlo Park, which Alden's father owns. It was through
the elder Alden that Perkins met his young partner seven years ago,
when Chris was a wet-behind-the-ears Dartmouth grad with an
entrepreneurial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Alden had a new Mac as a graduation present, and they started
the company in his Woodside home. Now, they employ 100 people in
the Hamm's Building in San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch, and
Perkins says the company eked out a profit on revenues of nearly
$18 million last year. He expects sales to top $25 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's another father-son connection that led Perkins to Bush,
this going back a generation. It started with William Draper, a
longtime venture capitalist and an old pal of former President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Draper raised a lot of money during Bush's 1980 campaign and
held some prestigious appointments in the Reagan administration,
Perkins said. His son, Tim Draper, also is a venture capitalist in
Silicon Valley, and he is a lifelong buddy of Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Draper led Perkins to the younger Bush. But the
appeal was not just personal: The valley businessmen like the Texas
Republican's views on labor, immigration and the free market.
``Clearly, he's one of us,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Perkins was in Austin speaking at a conference and
meeting with Bush's handlers, promising to raise $2 million from
2,000 technology entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to know how to do it. He's heard enough startups try to
pry cash from tight-fisted bankers over the years; why should
political &UR;  &LR; fund raising be any different?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE PREZ: &LR;  Cnet named its first president yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Marino, currently president and CEO of International Data
Group's PC World Communications, will oversee the San Francisco
Internet media firm's online publishing and television units, as
well as sales, marketing and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet co-founder Halsey Minor remains chairman and CEO, and
co-founder Shelby Bonnie, the chief operating officer, also will
become vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 50, will focus on actually running the company, leaving
Bonnie to look more toward acquisitions and freeing up Minor to
operate on a strategic level.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years at San Francisco's PC World, will Marino help
create a Cnet print product?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Bonnie said, ``but I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CHANGE AFOOT: &LR;  I don't have any inside scoop, but I can't help
wondering: If 4-year-old Internet auctioneer eBay can buy
134-year-old Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, could some upstart media
firm _ like 7-year-old Cnet _ buy the 134-year-old Chronicle?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, but here's my candid take on Halsey Minor's hiring
of Rich Marino: absolutely brilliant. As usual.

EX-LIVENT CHIEF SAYS HE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian impresario who founded Livent
Inc., said in court papers filed Wednesday that he had been too
caught up in the details of producing Broadway musicals like
``Ragtime'' to have had time to help keep the company's accounting
books, which have been found to be false.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky was responding to a suit filed against him last year
in Toronto by the company's new management team, led by Michael
Ovitz, the Hollywood talent agent. The new managers contend that
Drabinsky helped direct an accounting scheme under which the
company recorded more than $60 million in false profits and then
had to file for protection from its creditors in bankruptcy court
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were Drabinsky's first detailed response to the
accusations of Ovitz and the company's other new executives, who
took over the theater company last June.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the Securities and
Exchange Commission made similar accusations in January when they
charged Drabinsky and his longtime partner, Myron Gottlieb, with
orchestrating a criminal financial fraud. The two have refused to
turn themselves in and instead have remained in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers, lawyers for Drabinsky, who was Livent's
chief executive and chairman until June, said that his main role
had been that of theatrical producer. They said he was not an
accountant and did not have the training necessary to establish the
company's accounting procedures or internal financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not and could not micro-manage a complex accounting
system staffed by a myriad of employees and managed by senior
officers and employees, many of whom were chartered accountants,''
the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky's lawyers also said the company's accusations that he
and Gottlieb had given themselves $7.5 million in ``kickbacks'' by
funneling corporate money to another company in the early 1990s
were ``false and misleading.'' The lawyers said Livent was not a
public company at the time the checks were written and therefore
could not have caused a loss to public shareholders. At the time of
the payments, the company was owned by a private partnership
between Drabinsky and Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nathan, a spokesman for Livent, said Wednesday that there
was plenty of evidence contradicting Drabinsky's new court claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the SEC's lawsuit, which describes Garth
Drabinsky's conduct as `a multifaceted and pervasive eight-year
fraudulent accounting scheme' and the 16-count criminal indictment
by a U.S. grand jury makes perfectly clear Drabinsky's
culpability,'' Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC's complaint against Drabinsky, Livent's top
four executives, including Drabinsky and Gottlieb, would often meet
at the end of a quarter to discuss the company's financial results
and what adjustments needed to be made to increase the profits that
would soon be reported to shareholders. The regulators said
Drabinsky had directed his top financial executive to make the
adjustments to the accounting books.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb has also denied the accusations and says he did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said
Wednesday that prosecutors intended to begin proceedings to arrest
the two Canadians and bring them to the United States to face the
criminal charges.

THE ONLY `SURPRISE' HERE IS HOW THIS SHOW MADE IT ON THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprise! Kathie Lee Gifford hasn't lost her phony sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, viewers won't be subjected to it Friday night. A
CBS entertainment special titled ``Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!''
will air as scheduled, but a mawkish and maudlin segment requiring
Gifford to go sincere on us has been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, viewers will no doubt see something just as
manipulative of the tear ducts, but, ideally, more tasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!'' is a little bit ``Candid
Camera,'' a little bit ``Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour'' and a
little bit ``Queen for a Day.'' It's more than a little bit awful,
too, but CBS is testing it to see if it might become a series. It's
from the same company that produces ``Kids Say the Darnedest
Things.''
</P>
<P>
   But where ``Kids Say'' retains a smidgen of honesty born of a
child's unpredictability, ``Surprise'' is about as honest as the
telemarketers who call at dinnertime to say you've won a free trip
to Reno. The premise is simple: Someone gets surprised on the air
and we, the audience, share in the amusement, amazement, etc. The
possibilities run the gamut from reuniting long-lost relatives to
fulfilling a cherished dream.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, a woman who loves karaoke and has
dreamed of singing on TV gets her chance. Her rendition of Gladys
Knight's ``Midnight Train to Georgia'' is enhanced by the pipes of
the Pips, but the whole thing is as spontaneous and surprising as
Al Gore. Still, it's the best part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Kathie Lee is on the slippery slope to slop, and she
falls right in. The low point comes when a woman in the audience
``surprises'' her wrestling-obsessed husband with his own bizarre
World Championship Wrestling fantasy/punishment, featuring herself
and his twin brother tussling on the mat, plus some WCW grapplers
in spandex standing around as the surprisee laughs awkwardly. Even
the impression that the producers had taken the guy's living room
furniture out of the house and reassembled it on stage is phony. In
spite of photos purporting to show the moving men moving, a voice
at the end of the segment advises that the stage set is ``a
duplication'' and that the guy's real furniture ``remains at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise!
</P>
<P>
   The excised segment involved a woman who survived the 1980 fire
at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, in which 84 people died. She
had been rescued by construction workers and said she'd been trying
to find them in order to bring closure to the ordeal. As footage of
the awful blaze played on the screen, Gifford made references to
the ``inferno'' and the ``death trap.'' Finally, the woman got to
meet one of her rescuers _ the other has since died _ in an
uncomfortable scene that ought to be private, not witnessed by
millions. Luckily, some people with good sense at the network
decided to have the segment pulled before it aired. Too bad they
stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the show, Gifford says, ``I guarantee we will
surprise you.'' Alas, the only surprise is that a monumental
embarrassment like ``Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!'' made it on the
air at all.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>

YUGOSLAV FORCES WEAKENED BUT STILL CAPABLE OF FIGHTING, PENTAGON
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NATO) 
(sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior NATO and Pentagon officials said on
Wednesday that after the most intense 24 hours of bombing so far,
NATO had weakened Yugoslavia's armed forces but still not broken
their ability to fight and resist.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that the attacks had exacted ``a significant toll on Serb
forces in Kosovo and throughout the rest of Yugoslavia,'' including
half of the Yugoslav air gorce and a quarter of tanks and other
armored forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia acknowledged on
Wednesday that the NATO attack has caused the deaths of ``many
members'' of its army and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton conceded that Milosevic's forces could continue
operations for weeks. ``It is possible that a force like the one
Milosevic is using for ethnic cleansing and terror in Kosovo could
hold out for quite some time,'' he said at a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton appeared on Wednesday with Secretary of Defense William
Cohen to offer a fairly detailed _ and upbeat _ assessment of
NATO's war in the Balkans, which continued for a 50th day with no
sign of nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   With clear skies, American and allied fighters and bombers have
been attacking in wave after wave. Officials said NATO aircraft
carried out 327 strikes over the 24 hours leading up to early
Wednesday, hitting eight bridges, an air-defense command center in
the Belgrade suburb of Rakovica, an oil production center in
Sombor, in northwestern Serbia on the border with Hungary, and five
airfields, where they destroyed a MiG-29 and five MiG-21s.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, described
seven ``packages'' of aircraft conducting virtually uninterrupted
strikes over the previous 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It began early Tuesday with a wave of 36 American A-10s and
F-16s, British Harriers, French Etendards and Jaguars and others
attacking military vehicles around Suva Reka, in south central
Kosovo. And it ended just before dawn on Wednesday with a wave of
24 fighters and bombers, including B-52s, striking a number of
sites in Kosovo, including the airfield in Pristina, the provincial
capital, and forces around Junik and Stimlje.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO's campaign has done nothing to reverse the
expulsion of much of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population, NATO and
Pentagon officials have portrayed the attacks as successful. Faced
with sharp questions about the progress, they insist the attacks
are steadily whittling away Yugoslavia's military capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would simply say that the game's not over yet, quite
frankly,'' NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said on Wednesday when
asked to assess the progress so far. ``And I don't think we should
start writing the history books until the final results are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels and here in Washington continue to report
an erosion in morale among Yugoslavia's military leaders, though
they provided little hard evidence of that, and other officials
have played down the psychological impact of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that Yugoslavia's senior military leaders had sent
their families out of the country in what he said was a sign of
waning support for Milosevic and his political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic may not admit that he is taking his country down the
road to ruin _ politically, economically and militarily _ but his
top leadership is apparently more realistic,'' he said. ``And at
the very least, they are hedging their bets by hiding their assets
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cohen's aides said they did not have the names of
commanders who had sent their families out of the country. Nor
could they quantify how many families they believed to have left.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton vowed to press the attacks _ soon with
additional aircraft based in Hungary and Turkey and, perhaps, with
Apache helicopter gunships in Albania, which Shelton indicated were
at last ready for combat. Two Apaches that crashed have been
replaced, bringing the total back to 24.

SENATE REJECTS NEW LIMITS ON GUN-SHOW SALES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate defeated a measure Wednesday that would
have required background checks for those purchasing firearms at
gun shows, a sign that the Colorado high school shootings have not
moved the Republican majority to embrace more gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, tacked to juvenile justice legislation now being
debated by the Senate, was killed by a vote of 51-47, with all but
six Republicans opposing the measure and all but two Democrats
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was pushed by Democrats as a response to the recent
Columbine High School shootings, where investigators said some of
the weapons used in the killings were purchased at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two students opened fire with several weapons inside the
Littleton, Colo., school, killing 13 before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The April 20 massacre reinvigorated several gun control
initiatives that had languished in Congress over several months,
but one of the measures most discussed was the tightening of
oversight on gun show sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a loophole to the Brady law requiring background checks of
gun purchasers, unlicensed sellers at gun shows do not have to
conduct such background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a victory for the National Rifle Association, which
has staunchly opposed all gun control measures and came under
criticism after the April school shooting for suggesting that
better law enforcement, not gun control, was the proper response.
</P>
<P>
   It represented a defeat for the Clinton administration, which
had hoped the public outrage over the Colorado tragedy would prod
Congress to approve stronger gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said during debate that the unwillingness by
Republicans to strengthen gun control laws was an indication of the
NRA's lobbying power.
</P>
<P>
   The failed amendment's sponsor, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
complained about how easy it is to procure firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens of thousands of firearms are sold at these events with no
background checks or record keeping,'' he said. ``You can just walk
into a gun show, put down your cash and walk away with a gun,
semiautomatic or any other deadly weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, joined with the state's
senior senator, Phil Gramm, R-Texas, in opposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gramm and Hutchison supported a Republican alternative that
makes instant background checks available to unlicensed sellers and
promoters at gun shows but does not mandate such checks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GOP amendment was approved 53-41, with one Democrat
supporting it and three Republicans opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Hutchison had said Tuesday that she supported instant
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Republican version would not require such
checks, a Hutchison spokesman said the senator believed that the
GOP alternative ``was a more effective approach to getting
compliance with the federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the Republican provision, Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, said that the Democratic amendment would impose
restrictions ``on private citizens who come to gun shows and engage
in discussion with other private citizens and decide to exchange or
sell their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said his provision contains incentives to gun sellers to
conduct background checks because such checks would mean limited
protection from liability in future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Several gun control provisions remain before the Senate, but
only one appears likely to be approved: A youth convicted of a
crime would be banned as an adult from buying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine shooting prompted President Clinton to advocate
several new measures, including background checks at gun shows,
trigger locks for all guns and new restrictions on handgun
ownership. But Clinton's gun control proposals have fared poorly in
Congress since the Republicans took control in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requiring background checks at gun shows was
recently considered and rejected by a Texas House legislative
committee. Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he supported the
legislation even though committee members said he did nothing to
ensure its passage.

 &HT;    Microsoft keeps one step ahead of Justice Department
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Gates apparently isn't waiting for the Justice
Department to break up Microsoft, according to Business Week (May
17).
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Vision 2,'' the Microsoft leaders have launched a
plan to break the software giant into eight groups, ``each with
unprecedented decision-making power and a sharp focus on
customers.'' Gates, co-founder of the company, is executing this
scheme with Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's new president.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the magazine says the company is facing ``more
challenges than ever before. ... Perhaps the biggest threat is the
Justice Department's antitrust trial, scheduled to kick off again
later this month.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate article, Business Week says U.S. corporations have
gotten a second wind from surprisingly strong first-quarter
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observers had fretted that economic problems in Asia and Latin
America, combined with exhausted U.S. consumers, would cut short
the eight-year run of U.S. earnings growth in the first quarter.
But foreign economies appear to have stabilized, and consumers
haven't yet worn out their plastic,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff was a surprisingly strong 12 percent gain in net
profits in the first quarter, and an 8 percent rise in operating
profits, based on the magazine's survey of 900 corporations. That
was in contrast to the 2 percent decline in profits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new environmentalism
</P>
<P>
   Interface, an Atlanta-based manufacturer of carpet tiles used
mainly in commercial buildings, gets favorable mention in Harvard
Business Review (May-June).
</P>
<P>
   The magazine looks at the growth of ``natural capitalism,'' or
the use of natural resources in new ways that extend product life
further than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Interface developed Solenium, a floor covering that lasts four
times longer than ordinary carpets and uses 40 percent less
material, the magazine says. Interface is one of a number of
companies cited for manufacturing techniques that improve the
environment.

 &HT;    Plaintiffs in suit against Coca-Cola to meet company in court
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. emphatically denies that it racially
discriminated against one former and three current employees who
have filed a federal lawsuit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal response to the suit, Coca-Cola said Wednesday that
its actions toward the four African-American plaintiffs ``were in
no way motivated by race ... but instead were based solely on
legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will be in federal court in Atlanta today to argue
whether the soft drink company should be allowed to discuss the
merits of the case with its employees, since some of the
communications could reach African-Americans who might become
members of a class action.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company has employed 23 defenses to try to
rebut allegations of systematic discrimination against blacks in
pay, promotions, performance evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
include another 1,500 salaried U.S. black employees in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola said the plaintiffs ``have failed to plead a
proper class action and the named plaintiffs' claims are not
legally or factually proper for class-action treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story will decide whether to grant
class-action status. That decision could take anywhere from a few
months to two years, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In its lengthy response, the company said the lawsuit did not
fairly describe salaries at Coca-Cola. The company, however, did
not specifically provide statistics to refute some of the figures
provided by the plaintiffs. For example, the suit alleges that
there was a $26,830 gap in median pay between blacks and whites in
1998 at Coca-Cola's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Robert Baskin said a more detailed response to
the allegations will be made during the course of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's filing is a first step in the process that will show
that the Coca-Cola Co. does not tolerate discrimination,'' Baskin
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the pay for one of the plaintiffs, Linda
Ingram, was below the salary range for her position as an
information systems analyst. But the company denied that it was the
result of any discrimination or illegal action.
</P>
<P>
   The other plaintiffs are administrative assistant Motisola
Malikha Abdallah, security officer Gregory Allen Clark and former
director Kimberly Gray Orton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Coca-Cola and the plaintiffs will argue
before Story today whether a court rule prohibits the company from
writing memos, e-mails or other communications to employees who
might be potential class action members.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in the aftermath of the suit filing, Coca-Cola
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M. Douglas Ivester sent two
e-mails to workers to defend the company's employment and personnel
policies. In one message, Ivester alleged the lawsuit had
``significant errors of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers contend federal court rules for the
Northern District of Georgia prohibit this kind of communication
with potential members of a class action.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in federal court late Wednesday, the plaintiffs'
attorneys say they have no blanket objection to communication
between the company and employees ``at this juncture.'' They
contend, however, that Coca-Cola should make clear in messages that
officers are giving only company views. They say Coca-Cola should
also tell employees they may contact the plaintiffs' attorneys
about the complainants' position.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also asks that the court limit communications to
employees such as African-Americans who could become members of a
class alleging discriminatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys ask that Ivester send out a ``corrective
notice'' following up on his recent e-mails on the case.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Coca-Cola defends its rights to communicate with
employees, saying the other side's lawyers are engaging in ``legal
maneuvering.''
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed last Friday, Coca-Cola said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The relief plaintiffs seek would impose an unconstitutional
prior restraint on Coca-Cola's right to free speech, require
Coca-Cola to segregate and discriminate against its own employees
_the very employees plaintiffs seek to represent _ and punish
Coca-Cola for having African-American employees in positions of
significant authority.''

 &HT;    In bid to grow larger, Cox scouts smaller markets
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In its quest to grow larger, Cox Communications has
shifted the focus of its acquisition strategy from cable TV systems
in big metro areas to those in smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is twofold. For one, there aren't many big systems
available. And the few up for sale are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest in mid-market opportunities is a combination of
price and what's available,'' said Jim Robbins, Cox Communications'
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications' strategic shift is evident in the
Atlanta-based company's latest purchase. The company announced
Wednesday that it would pay $4 billion in cash and stock to buy TCA
Cable TV, based in Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   TCA has 883,000 subscribers in systems in small- to mid-sized
towns across Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   What Cox Communications likes about TCA's systems is that, while
small, they are well-clustered. Indeed, TCA has almost completed
integrating its systems into one digital system that can
efficiently provide new services such as high-speed access to the
Internet and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said that TCA's management team, which would remain in
place, would help his company identify other small to midsized
systems that might be good buys for Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that Cox Communications would remain cautious
about purchases. ``We'd screen for quality and management,'' said
Robbins. ``Our interest is only in companies with a level of
quality and strategy similar to our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications traditionally has placed a big emphasis on
customer service. It also has been an industry leader in rolling
out the new services enabled by digital technology. Many of its
systems are now offering high-speed access to the Internet, local
telephone service and the sharp images of digital television.
</P>
<P>
   TCA was looking to do the same thing within its small systems
but began to feel it lacked both the engineering expertise and
capital to upgrade quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a cable TV company in the country that
didn't step back and look itself after the AT&AMP;T deal,'' said Fred
Nickols, TCA's president and chief executive. He was referring to
AT&AMP;T's tentative purchase of MediaOne for $62 million, making it
the largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   What Nickols saw was his company could not quickly offer local
telephone service. ``Cox Communications will bring us an expertise
we are lacking in the telephone area,'' he said. ``We can now do in
one year what would have taken us up to three years.''

 &HT;    Delta pilots lower 777 pay demand
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pilots union at Delta Air Lines cut its pay demand
to fly the new Boeing 777, saying the move will test management's
``willingness to come to an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association's new proposal seeks about
$287,000 a year for a 777 captain, based on an hourly rate of $319
and a standard 75-hour work month.
</P>
<P>
   That's down 8 percent from an initial demand of $346 an hour, or
nearly $312,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still well above Delta's last offer of $239 an hour, or
about $215,000 a year before overtime and other add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   The union made its proposal in a negotiating session this week,
spokesman Andy Deane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate reaction from company negotiators was to offer a
counter at the same rate as their (previous) offer,'' Deane said.
``This was not the movement we hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   While Delta did not sweeten its pay proposal, the company said
it offered work rule improvements and remains hopeful of an
agreement ``as soon as possible.'' More talks are set for next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The pay dispute has cast doubt on Delta's plans for the giant
777, a premier international jet already flown by several of the
Atlanta-based airline's rivals. ALPA has said it will invoke its
right to refuse to fly the plane on Nov. 1 if a pay agreement isn't
ratified by then.
</P>
<P>
   Delta now has two 777s in service, but canceled four future
orders last month, citing the risk that the fleet might be
grounded. It also said five deliveries scheduled for later this
year are in jeopardy, depending on the progress of talks. The
airline says an agreement must be in place by midsummer so it can
confidently add the planes to its fall and winter schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the 777 pay issue will set the tone for new
contract talks that start this fall, in which rates and work rules
for all pilots and aircraft will be on the table.

 &HT;    Resignation of Treasury chief brings small blip
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market shrugged off news Wednesday that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is resigning, with the Dow Jones
industrial average recouping most of the 213 points it lost in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished down 25.78 points at 11,000.37, but the broader
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 0.6 percent to set a record at
1,364. The Nasdaq composite finished up 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction on Wall Street was attributed partly to the
uncertainty about economic policy under Rubin's deputy and
designated successor, Lawrence Summers. The news also provided an
excuse to sell for investors already worried about the market's
historically high level, said money manager Phillip M. Larkins of
Legacy South in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason for the early stumble may have been due to
Rubin's relationship with Wall Street. Rubin is not only a Wall
Street alumnus _ he headed the Goldman Sachs investment banking
firm _ but like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is well
respected there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin is probably the only person who could take Greenspan's
job without upsetting the market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director
of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The market's subsequent rebound came after investors had time to
reflect on three things, Larkins suggested:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin had indicated many times he would like to step down in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think people came to a conclusion that the worst
of the global turmoil is behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's been fairly well assumed that Larry Summers would
replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see him go, but the market was anticipating it,''
Larkins added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot that has happened on his watch, and most of
it has been good,'' noted economist Mark Vitner of Charlotte,
N.C.-based First Union bank. He cited the federal budget surplus
and Rubin's handling of international financial crises, first in
Mexico and then in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very protective. He was very, very determined that
financial crisis overseas would not leak back to the United
States,'' Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Summers has been the Treasury secretary's
``right-hand man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to represent that much of a change,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of viewing the news negatively, as the market did
initially, a closer look might lead to a more optimistic outlook,
Vitner said, echoing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may come to the conclusion that Rubin thought the world
economy is in good enough shape that he could step off the stage,''
Vitner said.

 &HT;    Lycos saves a part of doomed deal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the end, the Lycos deal was worth more dead than
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Web directory site Lycos and Barry Diller's USA Networks
officially bailed out of their complicated and controversial merger
agreement Wednesday, but Lycos hung on to the all-important
cross-media advertising and promotion pieces of the deal deemed so
crucial to a Web site's success.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock was up $9.12 1/2 to $107.50 after Lycos Chief
Executive Officer Bob Davis officially announced the deal was
kaput. It seems that stockholders and investors didn't like the
idea of their highflying Internet stocks being dragged down to
earth by Barry Diller's traditional companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal did make sense,'' says Forrester Research analyst
Chris Charron. ``At some point the market has to understand that
long-term strategic value is not necessarily provided by pure
Internet plays. They are clearly punishing companies for online and
offline alliances and rewarding online-only alliances like Yahoo!,
GeoCities and the NBC deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, the fact that a major shareholder
torpedoed the deal, and the delay and uncertainty over the last
four months, has put Lycos in a tough position in the portal race.
The portal space is moving too fast to move in limbo for six
months. They should have cut the cord a bit sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to say this deal was doomed from the start. As
Davis pointed out in February when the merger was first announced,
the money and assets of the USA Network seemed too good to pass up.
Diller, who has always been something of a maverick and a
visionary, clearly saw the potential of the Internet and Lycos in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, currently ranked the most-visited portal site on the Web
by Media Metrix, has also been gradually acquiring companies such
as Wired Digital and the Tripod community Web site in an effort to
assemble the Web's most popular and profitable hat trick: content,
community and commerce. The plan was working well before Diller
dangled the golden carrot of electronic commerce infrastructure and
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would have done well to stick to his original plans. He
admits now that nobody _ not Diller and certainly not David
Wetherell, who heads CMGI, Lycos' largest shareholder _ understood
how the market would respond to the deal. Although there is
speculation about serious disagreements between Davis and Wetherell
about the direction Lycos should take, Davis is reluctant to say
Wetherell was the one who killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock plunged 26 percent when the deal was announced. As
dazzling as the deal and Diller's reputation and clout as a media
visionary are, the stone-cold fact is that Web valuations sink
faster than you can say ``Titanic'' when you attach them to a
real-world venture such as Diller's cable enterprises. Why? Because
alone, Lycos can move up with the rising Internet bubble in the
market. But it would be buried within the organizational chart of
Diller's outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's acknowledgment that he was an Internet speculator
probably didn't do much to warm the hearts of Lycos shareholders
either.
</P>
<P>
   Davis stressed that future plans for the company were to put the
ill-fated USA Networks deal behind them and concentrate on growth
through acquisition instead of billion-dollar mergers with
companies that may not want to stick around when the going gets
rough.
</P>
<P>
   Diller was conspicuously and uncharacteristically silent
Wednesday, but his remark to the Jupiter Internet conference last
March, ``Who told me to come in here and muck everything up?''
seems oddly prophetic now.

 &HT;    Sears to sell large appliances online beginning today
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a significant move to beat other retailers to the
Web, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will start online sales today of
refrigerators, freezers and other large appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Six major brands of appliances will be for sale at www.sears.com
this afternoon, after Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur Martinez
addresses shareholders at the company's annual meeting today at the
Apparel Mart in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears has moved aggressively with
its Internet strategy as one way to regain market share lost to
discounters and fast-growing retailers such as Home Depot and
Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse. Atlanta-based Home Depot plans
to start selling products online this year but is still working out
pricing and shipping issues. And it's still deciding which products
are best suited for the Web. Lowe's sells some tools online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a significant advantage in our infrastructure,''
Martinez said in an interview Wednesday. ``In home delivery alone,
we make 4 million to 5 million deliveries a day. We've got the
people and the trucks on the road already.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears already sells Craftsman tools and appliance parts online.
Later this year, customers will be able to schedule deliveries,
repairs and installation on the Web site as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is trying a number of initiatives to revitalize the
company. The retailer's turnaround stumbled in 1998 as apparel
sales slowed in the second half of the year. Revenue of $41.32
billion was flat, and earnings were hurt by losses from the sale of
its Western Auto stores and its HomeLife furniture chain.
</P>
<P>
   In apparel, Martinez is cutting prices on basic items,
eliminating marginal lines and trying to send a more focused
fashion message to customers. In other areas, Sears is taking on
Home Depot and other housing-related retailers as it scales back
its so-called softer side and beefs up traditional strengths in
home goods.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said the company is back on track with growth plans for
the Sears Hardware Stores, a neighborhood format that will compete
directly with the new Villager's Hardware concept by Home Depot.
Sears has digested its 1996 acquisition of the Orchard Supply
Hardware chain in California and will open up to 30 hardware stores
this year. It plans to end 1999 with 290 hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pick up the pace in 2000 and the following year. I'd
like to get to a point where we're building 60 to 75 stores a
year,'' Martinez said. Home Depot will open its first hardware
store next month in East Brunswick, N.J. Home Depot is not a threat
to Sears' hardware stores because Home Depot typically takes a
cautious approach with new concepts, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a 300-store lead on them, which we intend to
extend,'' Martinez said. ``We'll be marching across the country at
a rapid rate with a proven concept while they're testing a few.''
The likely threat is to independent hardware stores as large chains
like Sears and Home Depot roll out smaller formats.
</P>
<P>
   Sears also is treading in territory that Home Depot has staked
out as well. Last year, Sears launched a home interior superstore
in Denver dubbed the Great Indoors, a distant cousin to Home
Depot's Expo Design Center. This year Sears will open its second
Great Indoors in Scottsdale, Ariz., and will start building another
in Dallas. A fourth store is on tap, and Sears may expand its
growth plans for the concept later this year, Martinez said. Home
Depot operates eight Expos and plans to have 200 in the next five
to seven years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the chief
architect of the Clinton administration economic policy during one
of the strongest periods of American prosperity in decades as well
as economic turmoil abroad, announced Wednesday that he was
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he would nominate as Rubin's successor
Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary of the Treasury. His
selection was intended, White House officials said, as a clear
signal to the markets that there would be continuity in both
economic policy and the management of a fragile global economic
system.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, a former Harvard professor, has served as the
day-to-day manager of a succession of international financial
crises that have rocked the global economy over the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market dropped 200 points when word circulated
Wednesday morning that Rubin's departure was imminent, the Dow
Jones average closed the day down only 25.78 points.
</P>
<P>
   A fiscal conservative who managed to move the Democratic Party
toward a new embrace of free markets, Rubin was almost universally
praised on Wall Street, Capitol Hill and in many foreign financial
centers as a stabilizing influence on the financial markets and on
the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world's emerging markets, particularly in Asia, the
view is quite different. When the Asian crisis hit in 1997, many
people there protested the Rubin-Summers brew of high interest
rates and major cuts in government spending that were the
prerequisite for American-backed aid from the International
Monetary Fund. Those policies, many in Asia argued, led to high
unemployment and a more severe recession from which a number of
countries are still struggling to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some economists contend that the Treasury Department's
prescription of rapid globalization of markets may have carried the
seeds of many of the difficulties in emerging markets in Asia and
elsewhere because they proceeded too fast without adequate
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Summers _ and many economists _ argue that the free
movement of capital encourages growth and that the formula for
recovery is working. Indeed, two of the nations, Thailand and South
Korea, have bounced back rapidly. But Indonesia and Russia remain
mired in economic chaos, which they blame on Washington's unbridled
market philosophy and which Washington blames on their own
political instability.
</P>
<P>
   At home, though, Rubin has been viewed as an anchor for the
White House. Time and again the president's populist political
advisers clashed with Rubin on tax policy and matters of budgetary
discipline. Clinton acknowledged Wednesday that whatever
credibility he had with Wall Street and fiscal conservatives he
owed largely to Rubin and his economic philosophy of budgetary
restraint, which helped fuel the market's astounding rise.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee
who frequently clashed with Rubin on tax cuts and other issues,
said, ``Of all the officials in the Clinton administration, he has
had more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any
other official. He will certainly be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin's advice usually won the day in administration
policy debates, he remained insulated from the president's
political travails and personal scandals. Often, from his office in
the Treasury, he would gesture out the window at the East Wing of
the White House and talk about the chaos ``over there,'' making it
clear that he intended to keep his distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a remarkable experience but I was ready to go,
ready to return to New York,'' Rubin said late Wednesday afternoon,
in the dining room behind his office.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation comes as the stock market is at an all-time high
and global financial turmoil appears to have waned, though perhaps
only temporarily. Rubin, one senior White House official joked at
the Rose Garden ceremony where Clinton lauded him, ``made his
fortune selling at the top of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   He was never one of the president's confidantes, and freely said
so. But he enjoyed enormous freedom within the administration _
including the responsibility to navigate the United States through
some of the scariest episodes in recent world financial history.
particularly when the world financial architecture seemed last
September on the brink of seizing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He built a spirit and a belief that we could actually make
this economy what it ought to be for our people,'' Clinton said
Wednesday at a Rose Garden ceremony that turned into a reunion of
former Clinton administration officials who had returned to bid
Rubin farewell. ``That will be his enduring achievement _ along
with the fact that everybody believed as long as he was Secretary
of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen.''

</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had the privilege to serve during a period of
remarkable economic growth and praised the president for helping to
balance the federal budget and understanding the degree to which
global forces were reshaping the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   And in response to the president's oft-repeated remark that
Rubin came to Washington a rich man and would return as a ``member
of the middle class'' he took a mild jab at the president for his
perpetual tardiness. ``I know some wonderful jokes about
punctuality,'' he said at the ceremony, which began 15 minutes
late.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was effusive in his praise of Summers, who many in the
administration had initially regarded as too brash and outspoken to
become Rubin's successor. But those doubts have washed away as
Summers has been groomed for the job, and today the president
called him ``more than ready to steer our nation through the strong
and sometimes turbulent currents of the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he would nominate Stuart Eizenstat to
succeed Summers in the No. 2 post at the Treasury. Eizenstat, who
served in the Carter White House, is now Undersecretary of State
for Economic Affairs and coordinator of the effort to force Swiss
banks and other European institutions that once cooperated with
Nazi Germany to compensate Holocaust victims whose assets were
seized during World War II. Clinton said he would continue to play
that role in his new post.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin came to know Clinton in 1991, and soon signed on as both
an adviser and fund-raiser for the 1992 presidential campaign. His
first post was as head of a newly created institution, the National
Economic Council, which he used to arbitrate among the conflicting
voices in the administration _ and to battle with political
advisers who wanted to spend billions of dollars in new federal
money on a variety of social programs to fulfill campaign promises.
Rubin insisted that deficit reduction must come first, provoking a
fierce struggle for the president's mind that he ultimately won.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a campaign adviser, warned in early 1993 that
Rubin's conservative fiscal approach might reduce the deficit and
win the respect of Wall Street, but it would be politically
devastating for Clinton among traditional Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin was right, but I was right, too,'' Begala said
Wednesday. The economy soared _ and the Democrats lost control of
the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a standing joke between us,'' Begala said. ``He was
just a lot happier about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, Rubin became Treasury secretary _ and was
immediately propelled into a crisis. The Mexican peso collapsed,
and many feared an economic disaster there would spill over
America's southern border and perhaps inflame the rest of Latin
America. Congress refused to back a bailout, so Rubin persuaded the
president to act on his own authority, ultimately lending $12
billion to Mexico from an obscure exchange-rate fund under the
Treasury's control. It was a high-risk gamble that ultimately paid
off; Mexico has largely recovered, and its reforms, part of the
deal, helped inoculate it from the financial earthquake to come.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's dominance of the Mexico debate accelerated the shift of
foreign policy-making to the Treasury from the State Department. In
some ways that transition seemed natural in a post-Cold War world
driven as much by the rapid movement of capital as by the
traditional balance of military power. But it led to many internal
conflicts, in places as far-ranging as Indonesia and Russia, where
America's diplomatic interests and its economic interests often
diverged.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was cautious about committing American funds, perhaps too
cautious in the case of Thailand, the first Asian country hit by
what became known as the ``Asian contagion.'' To this day, Thais
chafe at the fact that the Treasury refused to come to their aid.
There were constant arguments over how to help Russia, and how
fiercely to publicly criticize a longtime ally, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In all these arguments the Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright, often seemed to steer clear of entanglements with Rubin _
perhaps calculating that she would not win. But some State
Department officials argue that the Treasury's growing powers led
to a bias toward a market-driven foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's domestic economic performance will also be part of
his legacy, resulting both from his early demand for fiscal caution
and from extraordinary good luck. When Clinton took office,
domestic unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the nation's budget
deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones industrial average
was below 4,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment now stands at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a
budget surplus estimated at $79 billion this year and the market
recently topped 11,000 for the first time, creating a huge pool of
new wealth for tens of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In part Rubin's power emanated from an uncanny ability to
disarm, matched with an unexpected talent for political
manipulation. After the shutdown of the Government in 1995, he
spent months fencing with a Republican majority that threatened not
to increase the debt limit _ the Treasury's authority to borrow.
For a while it seemed as if the United States might actually
default on some debt payments, a prospect Rubin deftly put on the
shoulders of the Republicans. They backed down.
</P>
<P>
   There were constant struggles over taxes, with Rubin trying to
limit both Republicans in Congress and members of the White House
who wanted instead to concentrate on eliminating the budget deficit
and paying down the national debt. Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of
the House, noted today that ``Secretary Rubin and I disagreed on
many things, mainly the importance tax cuts play in keeping our
economy growing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``we also agreed on many things, and he
generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of the
Clinton-Gore Administration in check.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's biggest challenge was to grapple with the forces of
the global economy and the risks that posed to the United States
and the markets that were his world. His strategizing on this
subject often came at a weekly breakfast and occasional dinner with
Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon Rubin recalled one of those dinners, in
December 1997, when South Korea appeared on the verge of default
and many wondered whether its collapse would damage much of Japan
and the rest of Asia. ``It was one of the scariest moments,'' Rubin
said, describing how a plan was put together to get the world's
major banks to keep South Korea whole.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, never particularly effusive about anything, said of
Rubin Wednesday, ``He has been one of the most effective
secretaries of the Treasury in this nation's history.'' And he
praised Summers as ``a person of extraordinary talent and judgment,
who will continue the important work Bob Rubin initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 60, came to know Clinton in 1991, and soon signed on as
both an adviser and fund-raiser for the 1992 presidential campaign.
His first post was as head of a newly created institution, the
National Economic Council, which he used to arbitrate among the

<P>
   ``It became a standing joke between us,'' Begala said. ``We were
both right. He was just a lot happier about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, in the wake of that election, Rubin became
Treasury Secretary _ and was immediately propelled into a crisis.

there would spill over America's southern border and perhaps
inflame the rest of Latin America. Congress refused to back a

</P>
<P>
   Rubin's dominance of the Mexico debate accelerated the shift of
vast swaths of foreign policy-making to the Treasury from the State
Department. In some ways that transition seemed natural in a
post-Cold War world driven as much by the rapid movement of capital
as by the traditional balance of military power. But it led to many
internal conflicts, in places as far-ranging as Indonesia and

argue that Rubin was too cautious in containing the power of
markets after the Asian crisis.

new wealth for tens of millions of Americans. But in private, Rubin
often noted that most American investors had never experienced
market drops like the one that seared him in the early 1970s, and
wondered aloud how they might react when the crunch comes.
</P>
<P>
   In part Rubin's power emanated from an uncanny ability to

U.N. WEATHER AGENCY CHIEF'S RE-ELECTION OPPOSED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A contentious campaign is under way over who will head
the U.N. agency that tries to predict global weather disasters,
with accusations of mismanagement and cronyism surrounding the
current secretary-general's bid to secure another term.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin Olu Patrick Obasi, 65, of Nigeria is seeking a new
four-year term at the agency, the World Meteorological
Organization, which he has headed for 16 years. For the first time
since his 1984 election, he has opposition: Manuel B. Dengo, 53, a
Costa Rican diplomat and hydrologist, and Gordon A. McBean, 55, who
heads Canada's weather services.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from the 185 member countries are meeting in Geneva to
select a leader on Friday for the agency, known as the
authoritative voice on the ozone layer, climate change and major
weather phenomena such as El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that some delegates say was intended to spare Obasi
some embarrassment, the delegates agreed during a testy,
closed-door debate to allow the candidates to present their visions
for the agency but the men will not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potentially embarrassing issues concern severe staff
morale problems and accusations of hiring cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Obasi denies any cronyism. ``I believe I have been very fair,''
he said, pointing out that ``there are only 28 African staff
members.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponents simply say that it is time for a change. ``There
needs to be better weather services and better predictions'' to
contend with the increasing number of weather disasters, McBean
said. Dengo advocates reaching out to the public sector to help
boost the flagging finances of the agency, which has a $90 million
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The United States opposes Obasi's re-election and supported a
resolution, approved by delegates last week, to limit the
secretary-general to three terms. But that does not take effect
until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Obasi says that serving four more years, a 20-year tenure, would
be no big deal, and points to his predecessor, who served 24 years,
leaving only when he was defeated for a seventh term, and, to the
recently retired head of the World Intellectual Property
Organization, who had 24 years in office.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Lawrence Summers gives a speech these days, he
softens up the audience by facetiously suggesting that he sought
advice about what to say from the two men who have served as his
mentors over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin said to be cautious,'' Summers says, referring to the
legendary self-control of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, whom he
was nominated to succeed Wednesday. ``And Alan Greenspan,'' he
adds, invoking the name of the Fed chairman who is Summers'
frequent opponent on the tennis courts, ``said to be opaque.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came to Washington six years ago, Lawrence Henry Summers
was neither cautious nor opaque.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived with a reputation for brilliance _ the youngest
scholar ever to be granted tenure at Harvard, at 28 _ and an equal
reputation for intolerance of those he considered slow to grasp the
dynamics of an unforgiving global economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a category into which Summers placed many Washington
politicians, most Japanese and European finance ministers and more
than a few of his colleagues in the Clinton administration. And it
regularly got him in trouble, whether the issue was saving Mexico,
stabilizing Russia or rewriting the laws governing inheritance
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last year or two, a new Larry Summers has emerged _
one who has tamed his sharp-edged wit, who regularly solicits key
congressmen and senators for their advice, who now occasionally
acknowledges errors of political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the home stretch of his training for the most
visible and vital job in managing the world economy, he has become,
one close associate at the Treasury said recently, ``more
Rubin-esqe.'' A few weeks ago, during a particularly contentious
argument at the White House over how to handle the politically
explosive issue of China's efforts to join the World Trade
Organization, Summers surprised several administration officials by
prefacing his arguments with a version of Rubin's oft-used,
self-effacing phrase, ``It's just one man's opinion, but. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Summers still has plenty of critics in Washington _
environmentalists who remain suspicious of him after a bitter clash
when he was chief economist of the World Bank, bruised State
Department hands who clashed with him on how to deal with Japan and
Russia, Asian leaders who have termed him a bully and economists
who argue that he helped promote the free flow of capital in
markets around the world _ and then blamed the countries that
couldn't handle the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But even his harshest critics say the scope and depth of his
economic understanding is astounding, to the point that he once
pleaded with a reporter that he would like to be described in the
newspapers as anything except the ``the brilliant but acerbic Larry
Summers.'' And now, at 44, the man who grew up in a family of
renowned economists will have roughly 18 months to demonstrate his
talents at the helm of the most successful U.S. economy in
generations.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, he will go down in history as the relief pitcher
who helped save the one legacy that a scandal-ridden president is
likely to boast about in his memoirs. If markets crash and
economies collapse, both Summers' grasp of the new forces of the
global economy and his newly developed diplomatic skills will face
their greatest test.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, people would have questioned whether Larry
had the gravitas to match his incredible talents, whether he could
be less of an academic and more of a Washington player,'' one of
Summers' close friends, Daniel Tarullo, who left the White House
last year, said Wednesday. ``You don't hear that kind of thing
anymore. He has learned Bob's greatest capacity: To be sure about
some things, and to be aware of what he is not sure of, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sipped a cup of coffee in his private dining room at the
Treasury late Wednesday afternoon, Rubin was asked whether Summers
could calm the markets on a calamitous day, as Rubin himself did
from the steps of the Treasury after a 500-point drop in the Dow in
October 1997, during the early days of the Asian crisis. He thought
about the question for a moment and then said that ``in the last
year or so _ maybe the last couple of years _ Larry has developed a
great deal of credibility.'' The markets, he said, ``are now
comfortable with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin and Summers are clearly not comfortable about the
markets. Summers cringes these days when he he hears the
confident-sounding tone of Wall Street executives as they talk
about a Dow that could reach 15,000 or more and refer to the
problems of Japan and the emerging markets in the past tense.
Summers nowadays warns, with no apologies to Franklin D. Roosevelt,
``We have nothing to fear except the lack of fear itself.''

   Following are excerpts from remarks made Wednesday by President
Clinton, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers at a news conference in Washington to
announce Rubin's resignation and the nomination of Summers to
succeed him:
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT CLINTON: Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury
secretary, insisted that the United States pay its debt and
practice fiscal prudence. That then-controversial proposal gave the
new nation a chance to grow into the powerhouse it is today. Bob
has been acclaimed as the most effective Treasury Secretary since
Alexander Hamilton, and I believe that acclaim is well deserved. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   He has upheld the highest traditions of the office, he has
merged old-fashioned fiscal conservatism with new ideas to help all
Americans benefit from the new economy and maintain and enhance
America's leadership in the world economy. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I would like to say that more than any other single citizen, Bob
Rubin deserves the credit for building all the teams we've had,
with all the members. . . . He brought it all together, he got us
to work as a team, he worked for a consensus, he was always honest
with me in presenting this agreement and he built a spirit and a
belief that we could actually make this economy what it ought to be
for our people.
</P>
<P>
   That will be his enduring achievement, along with the fact that
everybody believed as long as he was Secretary of the Treasury
nothing bad could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT RUBIN: It has been an enormous privilege for me to have
the opportunity to take my 26 years of experience in the private
sector and to bring them to deal with the issues of the country and
to succeed my friend Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury.
Coming to Washington from Wall Street has given me a new
appreciation of the diversity of views in our country and the
enormous diversity of life experiences in this large country. It
has also given me a greatly deepened and broadened understanding of
many issues and how our Government works. . . .
</P>
<P>
   But this almost six and a half years has been all consuming, and
I think it is time for me to go home to New York and to do whatever
I'm going to do next. In doing so, I am absolutely confident that
this Administration will not miss a beat with respect to the
economic issues. . . .
</P>
<P>
   LAWRENCE SUMMERS: This is not an easy act to follow. Mr.
President, I am deeply honored by your intention to select me to
follow Secretary Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. . . . It has
been an immense privilege for more than six years to work with you,
Vice President Gore and the entire economic team that you, and
working with Bob, built. In the first months in office you put in
place a core economic strategy built on fiscal discipline and
macroeconomic stability, on support for open markets, all around
the world and on investments in all of our people so that all have
an opportunity to share in the prosperity that we can build.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that strategy has paid off. In the lowest
unemployment and inflation in a generation, in fast growth in
American standards of living, the restoration of American economic
leadership and the longest peacetime economic expansion in the
history of our nation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's been my great privilege to work closely with Bob as he has
addressed issues that range widely from international financial
crises to better service at the IRS, from eliminating the budget
deficit to assuring that every American has the right kind of
access to capital. From insuring the strength of our financial
institutions to meeting key law-enforcement challenges like
protecting our borders. In these areas and so many others, the
right course has been set and the challenge is to carry on.

NBC DENIES ITS PARENT COMPANY INFLUENCED DELETION OF SCENES FROM
MOVIE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Idaho, Colo.)   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC removed references to the transportation of nuclear waste
from a television movie it will broadcast this Sunday night, citing
inaccuracies in the depiction of how nuclear waste is handled.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard H. Bryan of Nevada accused the network
Wednesday of caving in to pressure from lobbyists for nuclear power
companies. Bryan, a Democrat, said he had only circumstantial
evidence that NBC had been so influenced, but he pointed to the
fact that NBC's parent company, General Electric, has significant
interests in the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said General Electric had no input in their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``Atomic Train,'' centers on a train traveling from
Idaho to Colorado, which loses its brakes and threatens the city of
Denver because of a nuclear bomb that has been secretly put on
board.
</P>
<P>
   That much of the plot is unaffected. But the film also
repeatedly made reference to a cargo of nuclear waste products. NBC
ordered all mentions of nuclear waste in the film dialogue
overdubbed so that the words are now ``hazardous waste.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC immediately removed all the promotions for the film, which
had carried the inference that the events in the film were based in
reality. NBC had also sent out news releases, which cited
supposedly real instances of nuclear waste being transported on
trains in Western states.
</P>
<P>
   The network insisted that a disclaimer be added to the beginning
of the film and at every long commercial break telling viewers that
what they are seeing is a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn P. Weinman, the executive vice president of content
policy for NBC, said that she made the decision to change the film.
``We had not vetted this film as though it were fact-based,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was apparently a disconnect between the way the movie
was promoted and what had been intended to be an old-fashioned
thriller.'' She said NBC's promotion department had been trying to
``generate heat'' about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   NBC sought out the advice of several scientists, Ms. Weinman
said, who told the network ``nuclear waste is never shipped by
train.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan cited a bill currently before Congress, which would
ship 77,000 metric tons of waste through 43 states, some by highway
and some by rail. The waste is intended for a depository in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE is a member of the Nuclear Energy Institute,'' Bryan said.
``And they own NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Energy Institute is the main lobbying organization
for the nuclear power industry.

SEATTLE FILM FESTIVAL HAS KEPT ITS UNIQUENESS OVER THE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This year's Seattle International Film Festival, which
kicks off on Thursday night, is being billed as the silver
anniversary edition _ and SIFF '99 will be celebrating a quarter
century of itself throughout its crowded, 25-day schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But, as all regular festivalgoers know, it's actually not the
25th at all. It's the 24th. The running gag is that back in 1988,
when the time came to have a 13th edition, the festival powers
decided to skip that unlucky number and, like an elevator, move
directly from the 12th to the 14th floor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter how we do the math, this year's Seattle
International Film Festival is geared up for nostalgia, with
revivals of its greatest hits, a special silver anniversary
souvenir booklet and, no doubt, much teary-eyed looking back over
the spring movie classic's extraordinary run.
</P>
<P>
   And, for me, the tongue-in-cheek playfulness with which the
decision to skip the 13th was made is somehow wonderfully
appropriate for a festival that has always taken itself seriously,
but never too seriously: it has steadfastly embraced both the
idealism and the fun of movies.
</P>
<P>
   No other film festival in the world has better kept the faith of
the golden age in which it was born: the great, post-``Easy
Rider,'' pre-``Star Wars'' period of the '70s when a generation
embraced the religion, art and glamour of cinema as at no time
before or since.
</P>
<P>
   The SIFF story actually begins in 1974, when two young members
of that generation _ Dan Ireland and Darryl Macdonald _ brashly
waltzed into town from Canada, leased the old Moore Theater,
painted it in an Egyptian motif, and reopened it as the
Moore-Egyptian: Seattle's first ``movie-palace art house.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the staid Seattle movie community of the time thought
``the boys'' would last long, especially when they impulsively
decided to host, with no municipal support, a festival of films
``that normally wouldn't be found outside the city limits of New
York, L.A. or San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   When that first festival was finally ready to go in 1975 _ a
two-week, 26-feature lineup, opening with ``The Lost Honor of
Katharina Blum'' _ Ireland had a hard time convincing the Seattle
press that it wasn't a joke. ``We're hoping people will realize
we're serious,'' he told the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   But that first SIFF was an immediate hit, and for the second
edition in 1976, the bar was raised to 19 days and 30 films. For
the third edition, the lineup was 20 days and nearly 50 films. The
fourth SIFF was 28 days and 83 movies and it hasn't stopped growing
since.
</P>
<P>
   The late '70s were an amazing time for foreign films and, within
five years, the fledgling festival made a national name for itself
as an innovative showcase for New German Cinema, New Australian
Cinema and particularly New Dutch Cinema, which it single-handedly
popularized in America.
</P>
<P>
   It also developed an unusually loyal following by making SIFF a
``high-touch'' festival that brought festivalgoers up close and
personal with visiting filmmakers, offered free matinee series,
added screenings of sold-out films to accommodate its fans... you
name it.
</P>
<P>
   And it developed a joyful, campy character all its own. When
actor Harry Dean Stanton canceled his in-person tribute, it held a
``Tribute Without Harry Dean Stanton.'' If Cannes had its Palm d'Or
and Berlin its Golden Bear, Seattle would have its Golden Space
Needle.
</P>
<P>
   When the festival couldn't lure a Diane Keaton or Jane Fonda to
Seattle in the late '70s, it made a Seattle star out of Monique van
de Ven, ``The Marilyn Monroe of Holland.'' During its first five
years, that magical Dutch actress and her films were invariably the
festival's biggest draw.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s brought some tough new challenges. The number of film
festivals had grown like Topsy, the better foreign films were
suddenly hard to snag, and the video revolution was making it
possible for people to have a film festival in their own home any
time they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Also in that decade, Ireland _ the boundlessly enthusiastic
public relations genius of the fest founders _ left Seattle to
pursue a career as an agent, producer and director in Hollywood.
Thus, in subsequent years, the spiraling SIFF problems fell into
the lap of one man, Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a special identity in the brave new movie world of
the '80s, Macdonald decided _ wisely, it turned out _ to go for
volume, to be no less than the biggest film festival in America.
And to support such a massive event, he had to expand his venues
and draw an audience from many demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, he put together an extraordinary moviegoing
coalition of Capitol Hill gays, suburban young professionals,
dedicated film buffs, hip college students and various ethnic and
national communities; and each spring he simply overwhelmed the
city with celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to give Macdonald too much credit for the
survival of SIFF and its explosion in the '80s _ the sheer
administrative skill with which he met the funding and logistical
nightmares of importing 100-plus films and dozens of temperamental
filmmakers each year from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, he's consistently managed to find the hottest
new European filmmaker, the most promising new Asian film, a
pristine print of some delicious Hollywood silent classic, some
unexpected movie star to drop by, some world-class director to
tribute, some new feature or twist to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   As he maintained an iron grip over the festival, Macdonald often
made enemies, and his staff came and went, often bitterly. But even
the most bitter of them will grudgingly admit that he's proven
himself to be a true visionary and one of the world's great film
festival organizers.
</P>
<P>
   A staffer who unhappily left the festival in 1994 told me,
``Darryl is not the easiest man to work with, but there's just no
disputing his dedication to the festival, his willingness to make
any personal or financial sacrifice to maintain its quality, or his
skill.... He's a master politician.''
</P>
<P>
   In the later '90s, Macdonald's skill and vision would be sorely
tested. With most foreign film industries in steady decline and the
new Hollywood openly hostile to festivals, he's had to increasingly
rely on the booming American Independent Cinema to fill his slots,
and many of its films have been of marginal quality.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, his old coalition of festivalgoers began to
crumble, as much of the straight audience began to feel the
festival was ``too gay,'' the older audience felt it was ``too
young,'' and the mid-'90s generation of college students showed
little interest in non-Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Macdonald was harshly ctiticized by this (at the
time) grumpy and sensory-overloaded film critic who was worn down
by insipid indies and _ longing for the days when the festival
showed 20 good foreign films _ called the just-concluded 24th
festival the nadir of the event.
</P>
<P>
   But Macdonald has bounced back with a festival that is not only
the biggest ever (206 features) but potentially one of its best: a
festival with major Hollywood films, 12 fewer American indies,
countless auspicious foreign films, tributes, special features and
reminders of its glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the '90s, the cloudy moviegoing climate also seems
to be improving for SIFF. Hollywood is suddenly more
festival-friendly, foreign-film industries are on the rebound
everywhere, and the new college generation seems to have discovered
the marvels of the art cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Every indication is that the Seattle International Film Festival
will survive its pressing financial and demographic problems and
retain its special character well into the new millennium. I
certainly hope so. A Seattle moviegoing future without it is simply
unimaginable.

   BALTIMORE _ A full but fragile field of 14 horses was entered
Wednesday in the Preakness, including two fillies from Bob
Baffert's barn who were promptly installed as second and third
choices to Menifee, who missed winning the Kentucky Derby by a
neck.
</P>
<P>
   The field was fragile because one of the fillies,
Silverbulletday, drew the No. 14 post position on the far outside,
and it seemed likely that Baffert might decide to run her instead
in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for fillies on Friday, the day
before the Preakness. The filly, who has won 10 of her 11 starts,
has drawn the No. 1 slot for the Black-Eyed Susan. Her stablemate,
Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby, drew the seventh spot for
the Preakness and was considered certain to start.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness will be run Saturday at Pimlico Race Course with
such a wide-open field that Charismatic, the long shot who won the
Derby at odds of 31-1, could command no better odds than 6-1,
making him fourth choice in the early betting line. But Charismatic
will start from the No. 6 gate, prompting his trainer, D. Wayne
Lukas, to say, ``We're in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who has won five of his seven starts with two seconds,
got the fourth pick in the process and his trainer, Elliott Walden,
cheerfully took the fifth hole in the gate, a decided improvement
over the No. 18 he got for the Derby. ``The 18th spot in the Derby
didn't help,'' Walden said. ``But then, Charismatic came out of No.
16 and won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness, at a mile and three-sixteenths, is one-sixteenth
of a mile shorter than the Derby and five-sixteenths shorter than
the Belmont Stakes, which may explain why it has drawn more fillies
than any other Triple Crown race: 51. Also, the most winners: four.

CONAGRA ENLISTING IN THE MARCH TOWARD A LEANER FOOD INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Conagra Inc., one of the world's largest food
companies, said late Wednesday that it would lay off up to 8.4
percent of its work force, or about 7,000 employees, and close
dozens of production, distribution and storage sites as part of an
effort to reduce costs and bolster lackluster earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which sells everything from Butterball turkeys and
Wesson cooking oil to Swiss Miss chocolate drink mix and Peter Pan
peanut butter, is the latest food giant to announce a major
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, food companies have posted weak earnings and
have largely missed a stock market boom because of slowing demand
from Asia, tough price competition at home and, in many cases,
inefficient operations.
</P>
<P>
   These problems have led to similar cutbacks at H.J. Heinz Co.,
Kellogg Co. and Sara Lee Corp. Now, Conagra, which had sales of
almost $24 billion last year, says it too is moving aggressively to
cut costs and reconfigure a company that has long been wedded to a
decentralized operating structure. Although it plans to keep its 80
divisions, it intends to require more cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a conglomeration of a lot of companies that have long
operated as islands,'' said Bruce Rohde, the chief executive at
Conagra, which is based in Omaha. ``We've never operated as a team,
but now we're going to operate as a team. We're going to be 11
people with a playbook rather than 11 people with 11 playbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts largely praised the announcement but said
Conagra would have to prove that it could effectively lower its
costs and then find a way to increase its sales at a time when many
food companies are experiencing flat sales growth and low profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only be a positive,'' said Tim Ramey at Deutsche Bank
Securities. ``They can accomplish the belt tightening, but can they
grow the business? I think the market's going to take a
wait-and-see attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Conagra announced the revamping shortly after the stock market
closed. Its shares gained 18.75 cents Wednesday, to $24.8125, on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1997, shares of Conagra and other large food
companies have been trading in narrow ranges because of weak
earnings growth and even weaker sales growth, largely because food
prices have been flat at supermarkets and elsewhere. As a result,
Conagra has finally been forced to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else in the industry, they are recognizing that
to get more growth, you have to be more efficient and then try to
stimulate growth,'' said Nomi Ghez, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
``The question from here is more often the success of the
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Conagra said the changes would begin next month. It did not
indicate which operations it would close, but it did say that it
would eventually save about $600 million a year by shutting at
least 15 production plants and 70 storage, distribution and
processing sites and by exiting 20 small noncore businesses. Half
of that money, Rohde said, will go to earnings and the other half
will be used to spur sales growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company also said that because of the revamping, pretax
profit margins (which Rohde acknowledged were well below that of
other food companies) were expected to grow 50 percent, to about
6.5 percent, in the next three years, and that it expected earnings
per share to grow by about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the restructuring, which is called Operation
Overdrive, would result in a charge against earnings of about $810
million that would be spread over the next three years. It said it
would pursue further restructuring efforts over the next two years
that would produce an additional $400 million charge against
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said,
however, that many Wall Street analysts had been urging the company
in recent years to divest itself of several unprofitable businesses
or to consider spinning them off. And so while the announcement
Wednesday was positive in terms of cutting costs, he said some
analysts were still worried that the food giant, which has more
than 80,000 employees worldwide, was too large to operate
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think they're trying to juggle a lot of balls in the
air,'' McMillin said. ``Now they're saying we're going to juggle
many balls with fewer hands. I think the applause on Wall Street
would have been greater if there had been divestiture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts remain concerned about such underperforming
businesses as refrigerated foods and meats, including pork, beef,
chicken and turkey processing.
</P>
<P>
   But Rohde said in an interview that his focus was on creating
more teamwork and that executive pay at Conagra would be tied to
the success of the team approach.
</P>
<P>
   As for Conagra's divesting itself of the meat division or any
other large core business, Rohde said: ``It's always easy to pick
the cylinder that isn't working and say jettison it. We're in good
businesses.''

SENATE REJECTS BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: subs 7th graph to add details of other amendments; 2nd take
is new)  
(rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday narrowly defeated a
Democratic measure that would have tightened regulations on the
sale of firearms at gun shows, a clear illustration of lawmakers'
limited appetite for gun control even in the aftermath of the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, senators approved a rival Republican measure that would
create a voluntary system for unlicensed dealers at gun shows to
conduct background checks on their customers. Under current law,
only licensed gun dealers are obliged to do so, and while the
Democratic proposal would have changed that, the Republican
alternative does not. It was a major setback for gun control
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures were put forward as amendments to a broader
juvenile justice bill whose fate has yet to be decided, and the
votes split largely along party lines, with the Republican majority
electing the voluntary measure and the Democratic minority
preferring the mandatory one. The National Rifle Association
lobbied heavily in support of the Republican position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the NRA lives in here,'' grumbled Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., as she left the Senate floor after the votes.
``I find it extraordinarily discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that their measure took into account the rights
of the law-abiding citizens who represent the majority of
participants at gun shows, while the Democrats' amendment was
unduly meddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called the Democrats' amendment ``too
costly, too burdensome and too bureaucratic. We all know this is a
much more complex problem than guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had considered their gun show measure to be the single
item in a package of 10 Democratic gun control amendments, from
requiring child safety locks on handguns to raising the minimum age
for handgun ownership to 21 from 18, with the best chance for
garnering enough bipartisan support to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Its failure created serious doubt that any of the rest of their
proposals on gun control would succeed, and it suggested that the
political ground on gun control had not shifted all that much since
the 15 deaths at Columbine High School three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have put forward a few modest gun control proposals
that, like the voluntary measure they passed Wednesday, are clearly
intended to deflect any criticism that they are soft on guns and
too cozy with the NRA. But gun control advocates said the
Democrats' amendments, which are themselves quite limited in scope,
are more substantive and potentially effective.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the shootings at Columbine, Republicans have fixed
their attention not on guns but on the cultural realities that may
be influencing violent behavior among children.
</P>
<P>
   That focus was reflected Wednesday in the passage of a
Republican amendment to the juvenile justice bill that would
authorize federal studies into the marketing of violent imagery to
youth and encourage the makers of movies, video games and other
entertainments to enter into voluntary codes of conduct. Democrats,
too, supported the measure, which passed unanimously, 98-0.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Republican leaders could have used parliamentary tactics
to block Democratic gun control amendments, they did not, a sign
that they were indeed sensitive to the potentially shifting tides
of public opinion about gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In another tiny concession, Republican leaders agreed, without a
full vote by the Senate, to add to the juvenile justice bill an
amendment by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, that authorized a
federal study into the gun industry's marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of that bill, aimed at reducing crime among children,
creates about $1 billion in federal grants to toughen enforcement
of juvenile crime while also, to a lesser extent, enhancing
programs and efforts to prevent it and help troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Of the scores of suggested amendments the bill has attracted,
the Democratic gun control measures were guaranteed not only to be
the most contentious, but also to be the best measure of any
fluctuation in the political temperature on Capitol Hill, where
most Republicans and a number of Democrats have long resisted new
gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' gun show amendment, whose chief sponsor was Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., would have made background checks of all
buyers at gun shows mandatory. It also would have broadened the
definition of a gun show and imposed new regulations on the
promoters of shows.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for it on the Senate floor, Lautenberg asked, ``When
will the public's rage finally reach into this place?''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the claim by Republicans that his amendment trampled
on people's rights. ``There's a freedom that overrides all the
others, and that's the freedom to live,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But his amendment was defeated by a vote of 51-47. While six
Republicans broke party ranks to support Lautenberg's amendment,
two Democrats opposed it and another two Democrats were absent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican alternative, whose chief sponsor was Sen. Larry
Craig of Idaho, passed by a vote of 53 to 45. Three Republicans
broke party ranks to oppose it, while one Democrat supported it and
two were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and other Republicans who spoke in support of his
amendment said that the country was already awash in gun
regulations that were not being sufficiently enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rememember, there are 40,000 gun laws in America today _ city
laws, county laws, state laws,'' Craig said. ``Forty thousand,'' he
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   He also disputed Democrats' characterization of gun shows as
places that, because they were liberated from some of the
regulations governing stores, attracted criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five million people are clandestine criminals going to gun
bazaars across the nation?'' Craig asked, referring to annual gun
show attendance in this country. ``I doubt that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had supported Lautenberg's amendment,
which mirrored one of its own proposals. So did gun control
advocates, who said that the fine print in Craig's amendment
actually relaxed some gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``It's a bad day for the
American people, as well as for the Senate.''

`JOAN OF ARC' ROLE SUITS FORMER `DOOGIE HOWSER' STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was more than one moment during the filming
of ``Joan of Arc,'' the CBS miniseries, Neil Patrick Harris knew,
as Tom Petty says, that it's good to be king. That was because
Harris played France's dauphin, the heir to the throne, who later
became King Charles VII with the help of the Maid of Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so great playing the king because you were treated so
well,'' says Harris. ``And it was strange being just an actor on
the movie, but as you're playing a scene, to have everyone in such
awe of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than awe. During the coronation scene filmed at a
large cathedral in Prague in the Czech Republic, Harris was
outfitted in a huge cape and crown. When the ceremony ended, he
turned and faced the massive crowd, including Joan and the knights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all these trumpet players lifted their trumpets and there
were hundreds of extras cheering,'' says Harris. And I got to sort
of grandly march down the aisle and nod to Joan. It was so surreal
to be in that foreign country, in that cathedral with all these
authentic-looking extras all cheering me being king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the ego rush, it sort of felt authentic at that moment
because we weren't on a sound stage pretending it was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a long way from ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' the hit series
in which he played a 16-year-old doctor who went through the usual
teen dilemmas along with life-and-death situations. But that's a
long way from his native New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says he's proud of the fact that his parents didn't push
him into a career. He got his break when he was discovered at an
actor's workshop in his home state and won a role in the 1988 film
``Clara's Heart,'' starring Whoopi Goldberg. He then moved on to
``Doogie Howser,'' which ran on ABC from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harris starred on stage in the West Coast production of
``Rent,'' as well as having a key role in Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi
spectacular ``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the restless 25-year-old still is jumping from one
medium to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a short attention span,'' he quips. But more seriously,
he says he's trying to be as diverse as he can. ``I think that the
big key, at least for me, for longevity is doing quality work but
doing totally different kinds so you can't get pigeon-holed.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he's filming ``The Next Best Thing'' in Los Angeles
with Madonna and Rupert Everett. Harris describes the film,
directed by John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``Marathon
Man,'' ``Cold Comfort Farm''), as a tragicomedy about gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he shone on stage at the Ahmanson Theatre in ``Sweeney
Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheim musical, alongside a powerful cast
that included Kelsey Grammer, Christine Baranski and Davis Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   And by Monday he'll know if the comedy pilot he did for NBC,
``Stark Raving Mad,'' in which he plays a book editor who is
assigned to baby-sit a Stephen King-type horror writer played by
Tony Shalhoub, is picked up for next season. It's being produced by
Steven Levitan, who is behind ``Just Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater is good for your soul, but you're paid little money
and you work your ass off and few people see it,'' says Harris.
``In movies, you don't work much at all and you get paid a little
more money, and you get prestige because you work with famous
people. And in TV, you do a medium amount of work and get paid an
exorbitant amount of money, but you have to deal with the
repercussions of everyone watching you every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did enjoy filming ``Joan of Arc'' despite the fact that
the old castles were ``like refrigerators,'' and everybody spent
their time between scenes huddled around heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The handsomely mounted miniseries boasts an impressive cast,
including Leelee Sobieski, Peter O'Toole, Maximilian Schell, Peter
Strauss, Jacqueline Bisset, Powers Boothe, Olympia Dukakis and
Robert Loggia.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says working with O'Toole, who plays the dauphin's
spiritual adviser, was fun. ``He's so knowledgeable. You can't have
mindless small talk with him or he'll see right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dauphin, who lived from 1403-1461, Harris plays a rather
enigmatic, foppish figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disowned, essentially, so he has this rather severe
form of narcissism knowing he should be the man who rules the
country but that he has no means of accomplishing it. So, he's
constantly game-playing and conniving and trying to pass the time
until something will happen that will allow him to rule. Then Joan
(Sobieski) comes along, and he thinks it's the perfect ruse.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charles does meet Joan, it's behind closed doors. No one
knows what Joan said to the dauphin. She was supposed to reveal
something from God. Whatever it was, he came out of the meeting and
announced she was indeed the legendary Maid who would bring the
different kingdoms of France together as one nation. Whether
Charles really believed her, no one knows. Harris says they left
the scene ambiguous so viewers can make up their own minds.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's played a king and a doctor, what else does Harris
want to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll end up directing in the long term. There's a lot
more to do and a lot less scrutiny. It's not so much about how you
look but how you perform,'' says Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else? ``Join the Cirque du Soleil,'' he says. ``I want
to be an acrobat. I'm a little past my prime, but I'm working on my
backbends.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Do you think he's kidding? &UR; !end! &QL;

 &HT;    Big Tobacco down, but not out, RJR declares
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Executives told RJR Nabisco shareholders
Wednesday that the company's beleaguered tobacco business
anticipates better times, despite legal threats, declining
cigarette consumption and stiffening competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to be as resilient and competitive as possible in
this new environment,'' said R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Chief
Executive Andrew Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Reynolds will become an independent, publicly traded
company following its spin-off by parent RJR.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first time since 1970 that Reynolds has traded on
the New York Stock Exchange. Its headquarters will be in
Winston-Salem, the company's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, RJR said it had completed the sale of Reynolds'
international division to Japan Tobacco Inc. for $7.8 billion.
After taxes, an estimated $6 billion in proceeds will be used to
slash RJR's $6.5 billion in debt left over from the high-stakes
1989 leveraged buyout of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover fight, played out partly in Atlanta, where RJR was
based at the time, saddled the company with $30 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, RJR has been burdened by annual debt
payments of $700 million to $800 million a year, money that
otherwise would have been reinvested in the company, RJR Chief
Executive Steven Goldstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has also suffered from the threat of mounting
health-related lawsuits against Big Tobacco and the growing
strength of Philip Morris, the nation's biggest cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the industry has been squeezed by declining
consumption, which Schindler said could be as low as 8.5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's $206 billion national tobacco settlement spared the
major tobacco companies from potentially devastating lawsuits by
states' attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies still are vulnerable to suits by individual
smokers and their relatives. But Goldstone said the slashing of
Reynolds' debt will improve the company's odds of surviving a court
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that Reynolds is doing quite well, as is
the industry, in this litigation,'' Goldstone told more than 200
shareholders attending RJR's last annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-smoking advocates accused RJR of failing to take
sufficient steps to curb youth smoking and to stop the illegal
smuggling of cigarettes. But Melrose Stocks, a retired
Winston-Salem schoolteacher whose deceased husband had worked for
Reynolds for 31 years, defended the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a shame,'' she said to loud applause, ``that no
one has attacked the alcohol industry with the same amount of vigor
that the tobacco has been attacked with.

 &HT;    UPS expands aviation electronics program
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service is renaming and expanding its
aviation electronics subsidiary, II Morrow, which makes navigation
and communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary will be called UPS Aviation Technologies, and
financial and management muscle will be added to boost its presence
in the avionics industry, UPS said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't apply the UPS name lightly,'' said Tom Weidemeyer,
president of UPS Airlines, in announcing the change Wednesday at
the Aircraft Electronic Association convention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS Aviation Technologies plans to triple its business over
the next three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weidemeyer said the push is part of UPS's belief in investing in
high-tech enterprises related to its core businesses _ in this
case, aviation.
</P>
<P>
   UPS acquired Salem, Ore.,-based II Morrow in 1986 to design and
build mobile communications and tracking gear, including the
hand-held devices used by drivers to collect package information.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes a range of avionics equipment, including Apollo
navigation units for small aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's biggest recent project has been the development of a
next-generation collision-avoidance system for large jets. The
system was recently certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration and is undergoing tests on UPS and other cargo
airline jets.
</P>
<P>
   UPS and other carriers are pushing the new system, based on
global positioning satellite technology, as a cheaper but more
capable alternative to TCAS, or Traffic alert and Collision
Avoidance Systems, now required on passenger aircraft.

<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Tom Ze had just moved into a new apartment,
and he apologized to a visitor for the disarray. The room he uses
for a home recording studio was a jumble of cords, guitars,
microphones and old recording equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Boxes awaited unpacking in the hallways; walls were bare. But
the books were already on the shelves in neat rows: fiction and
history and philosophy from Brazilian and Portuguese authors
alongside Faulkner and Nero Wolfe mysteries by Rex Stout. ``Of
course the books came out first,'' said Ze's wife and sometime
translator, Neusa.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Brazil, where leading songwriters routinely cite
concepts from anthropology and pay homage to avant-garde poets, Ze,
62, comes across as a man who's passionate about ideas. A
conversation wandered from his childhood in Irara, a poor rural
town in Bahia in northeastern Brazil, to his education in
contemporary classical composition at the University of Bahia's
school of music, to his tour with the band Tortoise (which comes to
Irving Plaza in Manhattan on Wednesday) to the Council of Trent, in
the mid-16th century.
</P>
<P>
   While purifying Catholic doctrine, the council banished musical
elements considered lascivious or impure; it set out to define
correct compositional practice for all of Europe. ``It was more
important than the most important composers in Western music,'' Ze
contended.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Trent wouldn't have approved of Ze's songs, which
are terse little musical contraptions. Drawing at whim from the
great reservoir of Brazilian rhythms and melodies and from his own
instinct for angularity and dissonance, Ze assembles meticulous but
aberrant patterns of rhythm and counterpoint: steely webs of
guitars, percussion and voice.
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics move from tenderness to sarcastic satire to word
games; one song, ``Sem a Letra `A,''' considers what the world
would lose without the letter A, including ``amor.'' The songs are
sly, prickly and ingenious, and they rarely last more than three
minutes because Ze is determined not to bore anyone, especially
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate tedium,'' he said. ``To be a composer is to have
courage. And I don't understand how a composer dares to make a
living through music simply by repeating things that have been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a commercial attitude, as Ze could testify. In
Brazil, Ze, whose original name was Antonio Jose Santana Martins,
had his moment of pop glory in the 1960s, when he and a coterie of
fellow musicians from the state of Bahia _ including Caetano
Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and the band Os Mutantes _
transformed Brazilian pop with a movement they called Tropicalia.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Brazilian traditions and imported rock, the Tropicalists
celebrated the collision of tradition and modernity. Ze's
contribution to ``Tropicalia,'' the movement's 1968 manifesto of an
album, was ``Parque Industrial,'' which put lines from the
Brazilian national anthem alongside advertising jingles and the
English-language refrain ``made in Brazil.'' That same year, he won
a televised song contest with the sardonic ``Sao Sao Paulo, Meu
Amor.''
</P>
<P>
   But his dry voice and smart, playful, unsentimental music
weren't appreciated by a mass public. Nor was his continuing urge
to experiment. By the late 1970s, he was using household appliances
in his arrangements, playing an instrument that triggered assorted
blenders and vacuum cleaners with a keyboard made of doorbells. His
audience dwindled; his recording contract ended in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Ze played for college audiences and scraped by; in the late
1970s, he worked for an advertising agency. ``That was when we
could afford to eat in restaurants sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, David Byrne of the Talking Heads was browsing in a Rio
de Janeiro record store and picked up a copy of Ze's 1976 album,
``Estudando o Samba'' (``Studying the Samba''). Delighted and
startled by the music, Byrne tracked down Ze. Byrne's label, Luaka
Bop, issued a compilation, ``The Best of Tom Ze,'' in 1990,
followed by new albums in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Luaka Bop has just released ``Postmodern Platos,'' an EP of
remixes of Ze's songs by John McEntire of the Chicago instrumental
band Tortoise, the neo-psychedelic band the High Llamas, Sean
Lennon, the disk jockey Amon Tobin and other Tom Ze fans. The
acclaim from abroad has helped Ze find a new Brazilian audience
too.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ze begins a United States tour, backed by Tortoise
along with the regular guitarist from his Brazilian band. In some
ways, it's an incongruous match; Ze's songs are quick and
intricate, while Tortoise's music ambles along. But Ze is a
Tortoise fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't make songs that just follow section A with section
B,'' he said. ``They go divagating, as if you were floating lightly
in the clouds. It's like a musical survey, with a mathematics that
turns algebra around.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tortoise, meanwhile, is learning the convolutions of Ze's songs.
``Most of the tunes are pretty standard in that verse-chorus-verse
sense,'' McEntire said. ``But there are lots of little things,
little rhythmic twists and turns that make you say, `How'd they do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ze described his method of composing as ``embarrassingly
simple.'' He has recordings of samba and baiao rhythms in three
different tempos; above them he works out patterns on upper strings
of his guitar, mimicking the cavaquinho, the miniature guitar that
accompanies sambas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a surgeon that opens a belly, that's how I live with
samba,'' he said. ``I have this intimacy, this cohabitation with
samba. I try to find a phrase that repeats, an ostinato, that
decays or degenerates the rhythm of the samba. I try to create a
very consistent counterpoint with the phrases of the cavaquinho,
and when this counterpoint satisfies me, it has a peculiarity _ it
permits me to almost escape tonality. ``The cavaquinhos are like
two walls topped by a ceiling. And this ceiling, to get the
structure to stand upright, must have interesting elements and also
must have a subject to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Ze stood his visitor's Portuguese dictionary on
end, parallel to a box of low-calorie sweetener; those were the
cavaquinhos. Then he balanced a knife across the tops: the melody.
``The melody is a cradle that makes the words have more meaning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ze described his music as an extended misunderstanding.
``In truth, I am a composer of only one piece,'' he said. ``I try
to repeat a song I listened to as a child, the song of the
washerwomen in Irara. That was the first music I heard. But every
time I make the attempt to write it, I keep making mistakes, so I
keep trying again. And I keep finding something that moves the
atomic nucleus of my desire to make music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ze delivered that explanation with a touch of irony, but as in
many of his songs, there was sincerity behind the wit. ``They say
that Faulkner's writing speaks about the loss of an Edenic world,''
he said. ``I lost a world just like his, the world of my
grandparents in the country, a world of justice and ethics. I'm
trying to revive this world all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ze doesn't usually listen to other people's music. ``If you look
to the newspaper and to radio and to television, you become
crazy,'' he said. ``Because every day something is happening in
music in the world, and something is taking your attention. And if
you stay in your small room with your small problem, sometimes it
is more important, because you can contribute to the music of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape of creation is a place where you're deeply
alone,'' Ze said. ``A person who's creating has to throw out
everything that he knows and everything that he's seen. So I have
to throw out serialism and tonality, throw out bossa nova and so
on, Tropicalismo, sambas, rock, blues and folkloric music. I have
to reach that lonely place where, if I'm able to reach a syllable,
I'm in the genesis again. That is loneliness, but I can't say that
it would be called pain. On the contrary, I see it with much joy.
</P>

   ``I've gotten used to going into that room of emptiness,'' he
continued. ``From time to time the room is full of water, and I'm
like a fish arriving at the shore. I'm an animal that decided not
to develop my wings but to develop my legs. And when the room is
full of fire, that's not a problem because I become a salamander.
And I could think of an apocalypse, like in the Bible, or remember
the folkloric dances of my youth, where I saw these fires in the
distance. But they lit up my heart, too.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Strange things happen in a state legislative
session when the governor becomes his party's front-runner in the
next presidential election. Everything is refracted through the
national prism, which may be why a hate crimes bill named in honor
of the black man who was dragged to death by whites in East Texas
has unexpectedly emerged as one of the most emotional flash points
of the current session.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said that Republicans loyal to Gov. George W.
Bush were attempting to bottle up the bill, the James Byrd Jr. Act,
to kill it in committee. That way, it would not land on Bush's desk
and force him to either support it, and alienate right-wing
Republicans who object to the inclusion of protections for gays and
lesbians, or veto it and offer Democrats a juicy issue to batter
him with in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all being driven by emotion, not logic,'' said Sen.
Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat who is sponsoring the hate
crimes legislation. ``And when I say emotion, I mean politics. The
Republicans are worried that if they pass the bill and if the
governor signs it, the religious right, the ultra-right, will seek
political retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Republicans say it is the Democrats who are
playing politics with the bill, trying to find an issue in Austin
that they can use against Bush in the presidential election. And
what better than painting him as a politician who is not solidly
against hate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's surprising for everyone that this bill has turned
into a political football, but it's the Democrats who have chosen
to make this a divisive issue for us,'' said Sen. Florence Shapiro,
a Plano Republican. ``I believe they are trying to hurt the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening in January of the 140-day session of the Texas
legislature, the last before the 2000 presidential campaign,
everyone had their list of pending bills that were considered most
likely to dominate the session's debate _ Bush's proposed $2
billion in tax cuts, utility deregulation, parental notification
prior to abortions for teen-agers, a pilot program of school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded hate crimes legislation was on nobody's list.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush's proposed tax cuts are likely to become the
dominant issue of the session before its close on May 31, it is the
hate crimes bill that has stirred the most passionate debate in
Austin in recent weeks. This is partly because the brutal death of
Byrd has given the issue added momentum this year. But politicians
in both parties, while blaming members of the other party for the
situation, acknowledge that it is largely the prospect of a Bush
presidential campaign that has pushed the issue to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overdramatic standoff over the hate-crimes bill has little
to do with reality or the bill's content, yet it's coming to
dominate the legislative session,'' said a lead editorial in
Wednesday's Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has already passed the state House. A vote in the
Senate Criminal Justice Committee, the body charged with deciding
whether to forward the bill to the full senate, was postponed after
several hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations Wednesday night
during which members haggled over new language that might make the
bill agreeable to committee Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A new vote is set for Thursday, whether the new language can be
worked out or not, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, there is no assurance that the bill would pass the
senate. And if it fails in the committee, supporters say they have
several more tactics to bring it up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to give up,'' Ellis said, though he denied that
he was trying to find a political advantage for national Democrats
in 2000. ``I've been trying to pass this bill since 1990, that's
why I'm doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to say whether he favors the bill, only that
he would consider it if it lands on his desk. Nor has the governor
or members of his staff been drawn into the discussion of the
issue's ancillary political implications, even as far as
speculating whether Democrats are attempting to seize on the issue
as a fertile one to use against the governor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the natural tendency sometimes is to magnify an issue
by bringing in the issue of the governor's national aspirations,''
said Karen Hughes, the governor's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   But there is, at the very least, ``a widely help perception in
the capitol that the governor does not want this bill to reach his
desk,'' said Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, an El Paso Democrat. ``And in
politics, the perception is the reality.''

</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have charged that high-ranking state Republicans
have been working, behind the scenes, to scuttle the hate-crimes
bill, including perhaps even the governor and his staff. Not true,
Hughes said. And Shapiro said that she had not received a single
call from the governor or anyone on his staff on the subject,
though hers was one of the critical votes on the senate committee
looking at the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ellis said he is inclined to believe Bush has not pushed to
kill the bill _ ``I think I can take my governor at his word,'' he
said _ but he is not so sure that other Republicans in Austin have
decided that it would be best for the party and their governor for
the issue to quietly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a fund-raising visit to Austin last week,
met with members of the Byrd family and called on legislators to
pass the hate-crimes bill. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is seeking
the Democratic presidential nomination, has also weighed in,
calling at least one Republican legislator and urging her to
support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted when he called,'' Shapiro said. ``I
couldn't imagine why he would ever make the call. I'm afraid I was
rather cool to him, I thought someone was pulling my leg. Then I
realized that the call was coming on the same day the president was
in town and met with the Byrd family. I think this really is
pressure form the Democrat side to turn this into a potential
national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's office issued a statement Wednesday urging the Texas
legislature to pass the hate-crimes bill, and a spokesman said he
had called Shapiro at the request of Texas Rep. Senfronia Thompson,
a Houston Democrat who sponsored the bill in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Texas already has a five-year-old hate-crimes law, though it
does not specify which groups _ minorities, gays, women, etc. _ are
covered. Opponents of the current bill say it is unnecessary, that
the existing law is satisfactory, that it has even been
strengthened in recent legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis and others have been trying for the last five
legislative sessions to pass a bill that does specify groups who
might be targets of hate crimes. In past sessions, the debate has
usually been over the inclusion of sexual orientation among the
hate categories. This time, though, that has not emerged as an
issue, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the other senators during the hearing on this bill that
I was glad, at least, that we had progressed to a point in Texas
where opponents of the bill do not feel able to say out loud the
real reason that they oppose it,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of
Texas who specializes in presidential politics, agrees that the
governor's national role has had a tendency ``to elevate certain
issues like this that otherwise would not have gotten as much
attention.'' But he thinks there is something a little deeper at
work, too, that the Democrats may have found a way to highlight a
certain predilection in the governor toward playing his cards close
to his vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People smell a reluctance in the governor to be smoked out,''
Buchanan said, especially on controversial, hot-button issues.
``And they see something like this as significant for that
reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of more interest, he said, is that years of bipartisan
cooperation in the legislature _ something that the governor has
often pointed to with pride and sometimes taken partial credit for
_ appeared to be fraying in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to pass the bill in the house was largely along part
lines, and the breakdown in the senate committee appeared to be
breaking in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the very heart of Bush's national appeal, that
he's just what the doctor ordered for Republicans trying to get
over Gingrich and Company,'' Buchanan said.

   MIAMI _ The families of four American churchwomen who were
murdered while on mission in El Salvador more than 18 years ago
have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against two senior Salvadoran
military officers who are now retired and living in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed Tuesday, says both officers were
responsible for the torture, rape and murder of the three nuns and
a church lay worker in 1980, an incident that sparked international
outrage and led to furious debate in the United States about the
wisdom of its support of the Salvadoran government.
</P>
<P>
   The four women, Maura Clarke, Jean Donovan, Ita C. Ford and
Dorothy Kazel, were detained on the night of December 2, 1980, at a
military checkpoint near the international airport in San Salvador.
The next day, their bodies, with bullet holes in the head and signs
of physical and sexual assault, were discovered along a back road
by local peasants.
</P>
<P>
   The murders occurred at a time when the Salvadoran security
forces, and allied death squads, were engaged in a brutal campaign
of torture and killings against real and perceived sympathizers of
the country's guerrilla groups. The targets included religious
leaders and others who were critical of the army's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the women decided to file the lawsuit, which
seeks unspecified damages, after they learned last year that the
two defendants, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, El Salvador's defense
minister at the time, and Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, then
a colonel who was director general of the National Guard, were
living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of deepening American involvement in the
civil war, the killings led the Carter administration to halt aid
to El Salvador briefly. Assistance resumed, however, when U.S
officials decided that the Salvadoran government was doing
everything in its power to investigate the crimes. During the civil
conflict, which began in 1979 and lasted about a dozen years,
American assistance to El Salvador grew to about $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, five members of the national guard were convicted of
the murders and sentenced to 30 years in prison. For years, both
the U.S. and Salvadoran governments maintained that the guardsmen
bore sole responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, four of the guardsmen broke their silence and
admitted to a group of American human rights lawyers that they had
killed the churchwomen, acting on orders given to them by their
superiors. They later repeated the admission to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guardsmen did not mention Garcia or Vides by name,
the lawsuit charges that, as commanding officers, both men were in
a position to know about the murders before they were committed and
both tried to cover up the involvement of senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the specific accounts of the abduction and murder, it is
clear that the women were obviously targeted,'' said Robert Weiner,
with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which is assisting the
lawyers for the families of the churchwomen. ``We had every
indication that there was some sort of reporting being disseminated
throughout the intelligence channel before the killing. These two
men headed the intelligence network.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, denied the accusations
contained in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am far removed from any likelihood of having had knowledte,
much less, been involved, in the act,'' he said. ``This case has
taken on a dimension, I don't know if it's personal or political.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia added that those who had killed the nuns were trying to
create a rift btween El Salvador and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vides, who lives in Palm Coast, about 25 miles north of Daytona
Beach, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges contained in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal
court in West Palm Beach, are consistent with accusations made over
the years by human rights organizations, most notably, by a 1993
U.N. Truth Commission report. Last year, the United States released
declassified documents that indicated that both Garcia and U.S.
officials believed that the murders had been committed at the
behest of other senior officers, including Vides, who received two
Legion of Merit awards from President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lingering suspicions, the two generals were granted
resident visas to the United States in November 1989. Robert G.
Kerrigan, the lawyer for the families, said the statute of
limitations for filing the lawsuit would expire 10 years from that
time.
</P>
<P>
   After their confession last year, two of the four guardsmen, as
well as their commanding sergeant, were released on parole for good
behavior. The Salvadoran government said that it does not plan to
investigate the case any further. The State Department has said
that issue of whether or not the five guardsmen acted alone has not
yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   To the families of the churchwomen, the U.S. government's
attitude, which they say flies in the face of mounting evidence, is
reason enough to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought the suit to expose these people and to bring
pressure on our government to expel these people,'' said William
Ford, Ita Ford's older brother. `'This country has no place being a
retirement place for murderers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern said that he and Rep. Joseph Moakley, a
fellow Massachusetts Democrat who investigated the murders of six
Jesuit priests and two other people in 1989 in El Salvador, planned
to ask the Clinton administration to release all documents
pertaining to the case so that the plaintiffs in the suit can use
it during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the lawsuit, McGovern said he hoped it would send a
message to other people who are accused of atrocities and who seek
a safe haven in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on the United States government for allowing this to
happen,'' he said.

<P>
   It is painfully clear now to the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs
that the eighth-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves are worthy of NBA
playoff competition.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-71 upset by the Wolves on Tuesday at the Alamodome showed
the Spurs just how tough their first-round opponent can be.
</P>
<P>
   With the best-of-five series even at one game each entering
tonight's Game 3 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, San Antonio
must win at least one of the two games at Minnesota to avoid a
shocking early exit from postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gut check for us,'' said San Antonio point guard
Avery Johnson. ``I kept telling the team that Minnesota played hard
to get to the playoffs, just like us. They are NBA players, and
they can win if we don't put out a maximum effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to win there, and it will be a good test for us.
I'm looking forward to see how we respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Center David Robinson said the team needs to respond by
realizing Minnesota put out a better effort than the Spurs in Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything better than we did,'' Robinson said.
``They were better in every aspect of the game. We didn't shoot
well, we didn't rebound, we didn't go after loose balls, and we
didn't defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``After watching what happened to Utah (a Game 2 loss at home to
Sacramento), I thought we would have been sharp. I don't understand
why we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio missed all eight 3-point shots it attempted in Game
2. Guard Mario Elie, who has been the team's top outside threat,
made only two of his 12 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I let the team down, and I blame myself for a lot of
what went wrong,'' Elie said. ``I had a lot of open looks and
couldn't put the shot down. When Tim (Duncan) and David are being
double-teamed, we have to make those shots. I also missed a couple
of defensive assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Minnesota's success Tuesday was forward Kevin
Garnett, who had 23 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. The battle
between Garnett and Duncan, two of the league's premier players,
has been the focus of attention in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Duncan is really good, and I'm not taking anything away
from him,'' Garnett said. ``But I'm pretty good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The two had words in Game 1 when Duncan scored 26 points, but
Garnett took Round 2 by scoring 10 fourth-quarter points Tuesday to
hold off a San Antonio comeback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both good players,'' Duncan said. ``We're both going to
go out there and compete and do the best we can for our teams, but
that's where it ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie said Garnett set the tone of the game early Tuesday when he
was called twice for goaltending in the first quarter. It gave the
Spurs two baskets, but Elie said it paid off for the Wolves in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garnett established a presence right away,'' Elie said.
``Later he got a block on one of my shots right on the glass. The
ref was standing right there and didn't call it. But Kevin Garnett
is a marquee player, and I'm just Mario Elie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves also showed they would get physical when center
Dean Garrett was called for a flagrant foul as he clotheslined
Johnson when Johnson drove in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avery had been driving to the hole in the first game, and
nobody had really stopped him,'' Garrett said. ``I didn't intend to
hurt him, and Avery knows that. We live two minutes from each other
(in Sugar Land). But these are the playoffs, and I don't want to go
home yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves feel confident entering tonight's game because they
are 18-7 at home this year, including three consecutive victories
and nine wins in the past 11 games at the Target Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs had the best road record in the NBA this season at
16-9, winning three in a row away from home to close out the
regular season and five of the last six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost our confidence,'' Elie said. ``We play well on
the road. I've been in these situations before, even in a Game 7.
We'll be back.''

SENATORS CONDEMN DELAY IN SEARCHING OF SCIENTIST'S COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators told the top Energy Department lawyer on
Wednesday that they were baffled and appalled at the long delay in
authorizing a search of the work computer of a scientist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory suspected of spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen.
Frank Murkowksi, R-Alaska, said at a hearing that the episode was
``a classic case of bureaucratic bungling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke's 130-year-old secret is more secure than our nuclear
weapons research,'' Murkowksi said. A Democrat on the committee,
Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, said the failure to
quickly search the computer ``still angers me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposedly everybody was watching, and in reality no one was
watching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's general counsel, Mary Anne Sullivan, told the
committee she agreed that the legal and bureaucratic obstacles to
the search ``produced an unfortunate result.'' She noted that
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced tighter security
measures on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan said the department had twice offered to search the
computer but had backed off because of concerns that an espionage
investigation might be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Requests by the FBI for permission to obtain a search warrant
for the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, were rebuffed twice in 1997 by the
Justice Department. It was not until March of this year, after
obtaining Lee's consent, that investigators examined his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they discovered then that Lee had improperly
transferred huge amounts of classified nuclear secrets into an
unsecure system and then tried to delete them in February, two days
after he failed a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   No information has surfaced to suggest that the delay in
searching Lee's computer harmed national security. Lee has not been
charged with any crime, and his lawyer says his client did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulties of gaining access to a computer at a
government-owned weapons laboratory prompted senators to complain
on Wednesday about how security concerns could be improperly
subordinated to privacy protections or the demands of espionage
investigations, most of which never result in prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan and her aides said the Energy Department may search
someone's computer if there is a reasonable basis to suspect
work-related misconduct. But a search in a criminal case requires a
higher standard, probable cause that a crime has been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Energy Department may forgo its right to search _ as
it did in the case of Lee _ if it fears that a defendant may
legally challenge the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This legal caution can create a dilemma in which no one is
charged with a crime, yet national security may be harmed because
no one does a search.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, in the same closed hearing room, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence heard from Attorney General Janet
Reno on many of the same issues. Afterward, the committee's vice
chairman, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said that most committee members
believed that the Justice Department should have approved the FBI's
request for warrants to search the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the
attorney general ``defends what happened but doesn't know what
happened.''

   How outraged should the Chinese be about NATO's bombing mistake
this week? Reading  &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR; ' ``All Too Human''
(Little, Brown; $27.95),  &UR; Eric Umansky  &LR; came upon the former
Clinton aide's description of the president's reaction to the
killing of six American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia. ``When
people kill us,'' said Clinton, ``they should be killed in greater
numbers. I believe in killing people who try to hurt you.''

GEORGE TALKS WITH GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- He may not be a quick fix for the Galaxy's scoring
problems, but coach Sigi Schmid met with former UCLA All-American
Seth George on Wednesday and said he hopes to have the talented
striker in training camp this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy drafted George in the second round (13th overall) of
the 1999 Major League Soccer college draft, even though they knew
he was heading to Europe to test his skills.
</P>
<P>
   George signed a temporary contract with 1860 Munich of the
German Bundesliga. He had been training there since January but
recently returned to his Mission Viejo home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll get some progress on that today,'' said
Schmid, who admits he's had conversations with George since he
returned. ``If (his signing) happens today he will be here
tomorrow. If it gets resolved tomorrow, then he'll be here the next
day. We're very, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy General Manager Sergio Del Prado was cautiously
optimistic about signing George. However, George could be invited
to work out as soon as today as a non-roster player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get him here,'' Del Prado said. ``Seth had the
opportunity to use an option with his German club but chose not to.
At this point, we are finding out if there are any transfer fees or
any other obstacles out there before signing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Sigi would like to get him here as soon as possible to
see how he fits with the team, but we'll just have to wait at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   George finished third in the voting for the college soccer
Player of the Year award last fall. He led the Bruins in all
offensive categories, scoring 15 goals and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation since Schmid replaced Octavio
Zambrano last month that George would return to play for his former
college coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, George led the Bruins to their third national title
under Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talented player,'' Schmid said. ``But at this point I
better keep things quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   George would be a welcome addition to a Los Angeles team that
has scored only five goals in eight games. Still, the Galaxy is
continuing to look at other strikers in an attempt to bolster their
front line.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy public relations coordinator Luis Garcia confirmed that
the team is inviting strikers Alejandro Sequiera and Mickey Trotman
to training camp next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sequiera, formerly of Tampa Bay and a Costa Rica native, could
replace seldom used El Salvadoran Jaime Caicedo as the Galaxy's
fourth foreign player.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman, released by Dallas, has shown signs of becoming a
talented scorer in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he likes Caicedo, but carrying him is more of a
burden than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talented player, but he's only 18,'' said Schmid.
``When you're only allowed four foreign players, it's important
that all those foreign players are making an impact on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to attribute the Galaxy's success last season to
Welton and Cobi Jones. Jones led the team in scoring with 19 goals
and 13 assists. Welton finished second with 17 goals and 11
assists.
</P>
<P>
   One can just as easily attribute the team's 4-4 start to the
same duo. Welton is scoreless this season and Jones has just one
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're more disappointed than anybody,'' Schmid said.
``I'm sure Cobi and Welton would like to have more goals at this
point. Welton had two good chances and Cobi had one very good
chance last week against Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles lost, 2-1, scoring on a beautiful Danny Pena
one-touch volley from 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it seemed those chances were falling for them and
it's our job to continue to get them looks,'' Schmid said. ``We did
shooting yesterday and this afternoon. You just have to get those
two feeling confident in front of the goal and that's what we're
working on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ever the gambler, President Boris Yeltsin abruptly
fired Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov on Wednesday, pushing Russia
to the brink of a fresh political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's latest government shakeup _ his third in 15 months _
comes on the eve of the what promises to be a stormy and emotional
debate on his impeachment in the Russian parliament on Thursday,
with the outcome of a vote scheduled for Saturday increasingly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the danger of his being removed from office is slight,
Yeltsin _ weakened by poor health and isolated politically - has
already succeeded in throwing Russia's future into uncertainty,
jeopardizing a pending package of badly need foreign credits and
increasing the chances of early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised statement Wednesday, the 68-year-old president
said he had taken the ``difficult decision'' because Primakov,
whose coalition cabinet included Communist ministers, had failed to
pull Russia out of its economic crisis by putting too much emphasis
on political consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premier's caution, his readiness to take only those
measures that get maximum approval and support are now beginning to
cause damage,'' said Yeltsin, whose face looked pallid and puffy,
and whose speech was labored. ``The time of soothing talk is over,
the turn of vigorous action has long come.''
</P>
<P>
   To replace Primakov, a former foreign minister appointed eight
months ago as a compromise candidate, Yeltsin named Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin, a Yeltsin loyalist and a veteran of
Russia's security services whose own views on Russia's troubled
economic reforms are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Russian parliament's rebellious mood, Stepashin's
confirmation is by no means assured. Liberal deputies hold him
accountable for his role in the bloody Chechen war, while
Communists, overlooking his law and order credentials, might vote
him down as a Yeltsin appointee. His rejection would open the
possibility for Yeltsin to make his next surprise move _ a
disbanding of the lower house, followed by early parliamentary
elections, perhaps by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, as head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB, was one of the main architects of Russia's
disastrous separatist war in the Chechen republic. In 1995, he was
one of several officials fired for his role in a failed attempt to
free hostages seized by Chechen rebels in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the president's decision to fire a government that
had their support, Yeltsin's Communist opposition Wednesday called
for an emergency meeting of the parliament's upper house to review
Primakov's dismissal, and ordered its supporters out onto the
streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's sudden announcement topped a week of steady
speculation about Primakov's coming fall from power. Yeltsin, in
recent appearances, has seemed to go out of his way to snub his
prime minister. In private, the president's aides described
Primakov as an unreconstructed Communist, who if left in office,
would slowly lead the country back to its authoritarian past.
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections now due in December, and his own
presidential term expiring in the summer of 2000, Yeltsin, Russia's
first democratically elected president, is concerned about the
survival of a legacy that includes the introduction of a fledgling
market economy, freedom of the press and the return of Russia to
the circle of Western democracies, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's mounting irritation with Primakov has also
been linked to his apparent frustration over the prime minister's
independence, popularity and above all, his close ties to the
Communists. Primakov may have signed his government's death warrant
Tuesday night when he once again reassured his left-wing allies
that he would resign rather than accept the dismissal of his top
Communist deputies, Yuri Maslyukov and Gennadi Kulik.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, a Middle East expert and former intelligence chief who
once served as a top diplomatic adviser to Soviet leaders, was
widely credited with calming Russia's political turbulence after he
took office last fall. Ever the cautious diplomat, he avoided any
grand schemes for economic recovery but managed to avoid the
hyperinflation, and total economic disaster that many experts had
predicted for Russia after last August's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to opinion polls, Primakov soon emerged as Russia's
most trusted politician, even as economic statistics showed a
steady rise in the number of Russians living below poverty levels.
In a recent poll by the Center for International Sociological
Studies of 4,730 russians, 82 percent credited Primakov with
stabilizing the political situation in the country, while 77
percent approved of his domestic policies. But the same poll showed
only 40 percent in favor of Primakov's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
   At a farewell meeting with his cabinet Wednesday, Primakov said
his team had nothing to be ashamed of, listing his government's
success at paying back debts to pensioners, and at preventing the
collapse of the currency. After packing up his office, Primakov,
69, spent the evening watching a European soccer championship at a
Moscow stadium.

 &HT;    For game designers, expo a chance to soar - or crash
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Video game makers from and around the world will
convene here today with their eyes on the future and their heads
filled with visions of the most hallowed of toy shrines: The
holiday shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3 to those in the
business), in Los Angeles through the weekend, is the event for
video game makers, ranging from the smallest of design companies to
the biggest of conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their size, their hopes are the same _ to be among
the hottest of games this holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   But before that happens, game designers such as Origin Systems
Inc., Digital Anvil Inc. and Blue Byte Software _ all in town from
Austin, Texas, for the trade show _ have to face an even tougher
audience: The media, industry executives and some hard-core gamers
who via the Internet could pronounce a game D.O.A. just minutes
after it leaves the show floor.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes at E3, a digital playground where speed, hype and
killer graphics (both figurative and literal) can generate buzz for
the lucky companies that deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   This year's expo comes at a time when Austin's gaming community
is getting more notice than ever, and Austin will be
well-represented in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas companies are expected to unveil some of the most
anticipated games at the expo, and a few local companies are
planning some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing this year reflects the growing Austin game
community, much of it centering around Origin Systems, the veteran
Austin software company owned by Electronic Arts Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Origin, which produces the popular Ultima and Wing Commander
series of games, will be part of a large presence by Electronic
Arts. But it also plans to debuting its latest project _ Ultima:
Ascension, Ultima creator Richard Garriott's long awaited
single-player game.
</P>
<P>
   David Swofford, a spokesman for Origin, said Austin's gaming
community is growing quickly, and was born from the area's
connections to art and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created a good mix for the interactive entertainment
community,'' Swofford said. ``That's one of the reasons Garriott
game down here in the '80s. There's tons of creativity in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Origin, which employs about 200 workers in Austin, has also
worked with other Austin game companies including Digital Anvil,
the game company formed by former Origin executive Chris Roberts.
Roberts, who piloted the ``Wing Commander'' game series for Origin,
co-wrote and directed a film version of ``Wing Commander'' that was
released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' company plans to debut three games at E3, to be
published by Microsoft Corp., and the expo will be the company's
unofficial coming out party after more than a year of quiet work on
the games.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Davies, president of Digital Anvil, said the reasons his
company decided to open up shop in Austin are the same reasons many
are attracted to move here _ quality of life and a talent pool of
creative workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming is very much like movies _ there are high production
values,'' Davies said. ``Austin is a very heavy center for artistic
talent, both in music and for visual artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Origin and Digital Anvil's high-profile projects have created a
buzz for Austin's game industry, said Vince Broady, editorial
director of GameSpot, an online gaming magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Austin community is well-regarded in the PC/videogame
industry, as is Texas in general,'' Broady said via e-mail. ``I
think its general atmosphere, proximity to UT and freethinking
reputation make it a natural incubator for game software
development, and I think it will only get bigger over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of gaming and the abundance of computer-savvy
residents (throw a rock in a University of Texas computer lab and
you'll hit an ``Quake II'' deathmatcher) has also attracted new
game companies to the area. In the past few years, Iguana Software,
owned by Acclaim Entertainment, has started designing games _
including ``South Park,'' ``Turok: Dinosaur Hunter'' and ``All Star
Baseball 2000'' _ for the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64
console systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bootprint Software, a division of GT Interactive, has also set
up shop in Austin. Bootprint has yet to release any games, but has
actively been recruiting programmers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Austin has also made a believer out of European game developer
Blue Byte Software. Based in Germany, the company has all but made
Austin its base of operations. Thomas Hertzler, chief executive of
Blue Byte, said the company has found the Austin office keeps the
company closer to U.S. gaming trends.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing its latest game recently, ``Settlers 3,'' the
company plans to make a big splash at E3 by revising a game
classic. The company is expected to announce today that it is
working with the creators of the arcade game ``Dragon's Lair,'' to
release a new version called ``Dragon's Lair 3D'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   Don Bluth, the legendary artist who designed ``Dragon's Lair,''
will be at the company's booth alongside the designers of the
company's other new title, ``Shadowpact.''
</P>
<P>
   For every new kid on the gaming block, however, there are others
that don't make it in the industry. Austin's Crack.com, for
instance, was busily working on a game called ``Golgotha'' before
it went out of business last year.
</P>
<P>
   But game watchers like Broady say they think the game community
in Austin, led by the larger design companies, will continue to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I hope so,'' San Francisco-based Broady said. ``I
need an excuse to come down and get some decent Tex-Mex.''

 MOSCOW: Moscow stadium. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Primakov repeatedly denied any presidential ambitions,
his name inevitably surfaced as a plausible candidate to succeed
Yeltsin next year. But without the authority that comes with power,
it is not clear whether Primakov, who suffers from a back ailment,
will pursue a political career of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian economy crippled by debt, corruption and
mismanagement, Primakov's lack of any economic program become more
and more of a liability. ``Last fall, Primakov did a great thing
when he managed to stabilize the situation,'' said Mikhail Berger,
editor of the newspaper Sevodnya in a radio interview Wednesday.
``Brakes are an important part of any car. You cannot drive a car
without brakes. But if you apply the brakes all the time, it is no
longer a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian politicians _ including Moscow Mayor Yuri
luzhkov, the leading presidential candidate _ had recently stepped
up their criticism of Primakov, accusing him of marking time as
economic stagnation set in. But the timing of his dismissal _ on
the eve of a highly charged impeachment debate _ was greeted with
almost universal dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Grigori Yavlinky, leader of Yabloko, Russia's largest liberal
party, compared Yeltsin's move to a chess player who overturns the
chessboard, throwing the pieces, and his opponents, into disarray.
``It is a typical radical move,'' said Yavlinsky who was the first
to float Primakov's nomination during Russia's last political
crisis which followed Yeltsin's dismissal of the short-lived
government Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky had harsh words for Primakov's economic performance
but he was even more pessimisstic about the prospects for the
Russian economy during the coming period of political instability.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov called Primakov's firing ``unjust and unjustified,''
while several regional governors lamented the onset of another
period of political inactivity, as a new government puts together a
new team and new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fully functioning government, the Russian parliament
is unlikely to give prompt approval to a package of politically
unpopular measures set by the International Monetary Fund as
conditions for the staggered delivery of an $4.5 billion credit,
earmarked for payment on Russia's outstanding IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's political disarray has also raised concerns about
Moscow's ability to follow through on its diplomatic initiatives in
the search for peace in Kosovo. At a press conference Wednesday
held jointly with U.S. assistant secretary of state Strobe Talbott,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special Balkans enovy, admitted that
frequent changes in government ``create certain problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the biggest concern is over a potential
constitutional clash that could develop if the parliament's lower
house votes on Saturday to start impeachment, and subsequently,
votes to reject Stepashin's nomination as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian constitution, drafted by the Yeltsin Kremlin and
adopted in 1993, gives the parliament's lower house three chances
to approve the president's nominee for prime minister. If the
nomination fails on the third try, the president is obligated to
disband the parliament and set early elections.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same constitution forbids the president from
disbanding the parliament once an impeachement vote is taken. If
both events take place, then Russia could face another
constitutional clash like the one that led to the street violence
and shelling of the old parliament by army tanks in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five charges brought against Yeltsin in the indictment
pending in parliament, only one _ accusing him of waging of an
illegal war in the breakaway region of Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 _
has a chance of collecting the 300 votes needed for passage in the
450-seat lower chamber. The difference will be made up by members
of Yavlinsky's Yabloko faction which on this charge alone, is
prepared to join the Communist-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Before a russian president can be ousted from office, the
impeachment charge must be cleared by both the Constitutional Court
and the Supreme Court, and finally must be approved by the Council
of Federation, the parliament's upper house. The process could take
months, and could be easily tripped up by legalities at any step.
</P>
<P>
   A successful impeachment vote Saturday would deliver another
devastating blow to Yeltsin's dwindling authority. In recent
months, he has already seen his once-assured support in the Council
of Federation _ made up of regional governors and legislative
leaders _ chipped away in a battle over the Kremlin's efforts to
force Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argued that Yeltsin's gamble may pay off, with the
restoration of a balance of power between the presidency and the
parliament. ``Tthe president suddenly realized that the price being
paid for Primakov's support in the Duma was too high,'' said Vitaly
Tretyakov, editor of the Independent Newspaper, a Moscow daily.
``He realized that in this triangle two is company, but three is a
crowd, and he was the odd man out. He couldn't bear it, and fired
Primakov to restore the balance.''

KINGS ANNOUNCE AFFILIATE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might not seem as pressing a matter as the still-vacant
coaching position, but the Kings' organization took a significant
step forward Wednesday with the announcement of a two-year
affiliation agreement with the Lowell (Mass.) Lock Monsters of the
American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will send 12 prospects to Lowell next season and 18
the year after, and will hire the Lock Monsters' coaching staff. It
means that after two years of piecemeal arrangements with other AHL
teams, the Kings will have complete control over how their
prospects are developed and what style of hockey they will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will make the transition easier for players coming
up (to the Kings),'' General Manager Dave Taylor said. ``We'd like
to establish a winning organization at both levels. When both teams
are playing the same style, it's easier for players to come up and
down. The best example of this is what New Jersey does with their
team in Albany (N.Y.), and Buffalo has been very effective with
their affiliate in Rochester. Calgary and Montreal for many years
groomed players at the AHL level to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who returned to Los Angeles earlier this week after
attending the World Championships in Oslo, Norway, said it is
likely the Kings will continue their limited affiliation with the
Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL for at least one more year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell affiliation is the first move in what promises to be
a busy summer for Taylor. High on the agenda is the hiring of a
coach to replace Larry Robinson, who was fired on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing new there,'' Taylor said. ``I've been
in Europe and I haven't interviewed anyone yet. I haven't asked any
teams for permission (to interview their coaches). I have a list
and a number of teams I want to talk to. In the next few weeks,
we'll be moving forward with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also faces a deadline to sign 1997 draft choices Matt
Zultek (left wing/center) and defenseman Richard Seeley. If they
are not signed by June 1, they go back into this year's draft, on
June 26 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to sign them,'' Taylor said. ``But it has to be
within reason or what we think is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he expects to speak with Zultek's agent, Larry
Kelly, this weekend at the Memorial Cup (Canadian junior hockey's
championship tournament) in Ottawa. Taylor also said he will speak
with Kelly about defenseman Aki Berg, who played in Finland this
season after he and the Kings could not reach contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched (Berg) play a couple of times (at the World
Championships),'' Taylor said. ``I didn't speak with him. We'd like
to sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also said he is preparing to make a contract proposal to
24-year-old Finnish defenseman Jere Karalahti, a 1993 draftee who
is close to being ready to play in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels he's ready for the opportunity,'' Taylor
said. ``The question will be his skating.''

 &HT;    Nintendo gets help with game player
 &HT;    By Staff and Wire reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nintendo is enlisting help from IBM and the consumer
electronics giant Matsushita to create the technology for its
next-generation video game player, which will be packed with
greater computing power to deliver crisper and more animated
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Wednesday follows similar deals among other
game makers in recent months as the industry moves toward adding
more functions to game players such as Internet hookups and
improved sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gaming machine is no longer going to be just a gaming
machine,'' said Ryan Brock, an analyst at Access Media
International in New York. ``Nintendo and others are creating
platforms that will allow Internet access, information to be stored
and maybe even word processing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new alliance, IBM will make a custom computer chip for
Nintendo's new console based on its PowerPC processor, which is
currently used to power Apple's Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-person IBM Microelectronics design team split between
Austin and Burlington, Vt., worked on the chip project, which was
code-named ``Gekko.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few details are available on the new processor, which
will run at 400 megahertz. Its design includes some modifications
for high-performance graphics processing. The chip will be paired
with an advanced graphics acceleration chip designed by ArtX Inc.
of Palo Alto, Calif., a leading 3D graphics technology company.
</P>
<P>
   It will be manufactured by IBM in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Chekib Akrout, IBM's manager for the Gekko chip, said the
project was among the more exciting chip design projects in his
17-year career at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bleeding-edge technology,'' Akrout said. ``The
exciting thing is working with this kind of technology for a video
game console.'' In the computer industry, ``bleeding edge'' means
ahead of the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   The pact between IBM and Nintendo is valued at about $1 billion.
The companies also plan to explore the use of IBM technology in
other Nintendo products as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new video game player _ which is being called Dolphin _
would supersede the Nintendo 64, the current top-line offering from
Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Matsushita will make digital video disc drives for the
new Nintendo game machine. The DVD format is new for Nintendo,
which has used specialized cartridges in previous versions of its
game players. The cartridges, which are more expensive than CD-ROMs
or DVDs, were a major reason why many game developers have
abandoned Nintendo in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo became the last of the three major video-game companies
to unveil plans for its next generation system. Sega already
released its new Dreamcast player in Japan and plans a U.S. launch
in September, while Sony is expected to release its PlayStation II
in Japan this year and in the United States by Christmas 2000. All
three are vying for a piece of the $6 billion video game player
market.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nintendo system is expected to go on sale worldwide at
the end of 2000 in time for the holiday shopping season. The
company did not release the anticipated retail price of the player.
</P>

NEW YORK GOVERNOR MOVES TO ELIMINATE NEW YORK CITY COMMUTER TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders
promised unexpectedly Wednesday to eliminate a 33-year-old income
tax for many suburban residents who hold jobs in New York City,
disregarding Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's contention that those workers
should help shoulder the cost of police and other city services.
</P>
<P>
   The move would deprive the city of at least $210 million
annually, and represents a striking attempt by lawmakers to appeal
to suburban voters, a crucial constituency in the balance of power
in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Nassau and Westchester Counties, the tax has long
been one more aggravation of the commuter lifestyle, as resented as
clogged highways and delayed trains. It has also stoked tensions
between suburban officials and their city counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800,000 people pay the tax, which the state collects for
the city and which ranges from .45 percent of taxable earnings, for
most of those covered, or $180 annually on $40,000 of net income.
The proposed repeal would immediately affect only those who live in
New York state, about 58 percent of the people who pay the tax. But
the proposed measure stipulates that if it is overturned in court
on the ground that it discriminates against out-of-state residents,
then the tax will be eliminated for everyone. The city would as a
result lose another $150 million, bringing the total cost of the
repeal to $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was not on lawmakers' agendas until earlier this month,
when it arose suddenly in the maneuvering over a special election
for a state Senate seat in Rockland and Orange Counties, northwest
of the city. The two major contenders proposed repealing the tax, a
politically popular move in the district, and both Republican and
Democratic legislative leaders responded in an effort to bolster
their standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commuters feel that they pay enough in all kinds of
taxes,'' said Assemblyman Samuel Colman, a Rockland Democrat, who
argued that the city could handily afford the tax cut because it
has a $2 billion surplus. .
</P>
<P>
   The politics could linger even after the tax is gone: if
Giuliani runs for the U.S. Senate next year, he could come under
attack in suburban areas for backing the tax. One of Giuliani's
potential rivals for the Republican nomination, U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio of Long Island, quickly issued a statement Wednesday night
praising the proposed repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been a vocal proponent of cutting city taxes, but
has often asserted that city officials should have the right to
choose which taxes are lowered, not Albany, which has the final say
over most local levies. Speaking Wednesday afternoon, Giuliani
assailed the Legislature for seeking to end the commuter tax,
saying that if anything, it should be higher. He noted that city
residents pay a far higher local income tax, roughly 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the political realities, it can't be increased even
to a level that would be considered maybe somewhat more equitable
in light of the services,'' Giuliani said of the commuter tax.
``Commuters to the city are very important, I value them as much as
I do in many ways residents. They make a tremendous contribution to
the city. But in fact, the city has to have extra services as a
result of that, extra fire services, extra police services, extra
medical services.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pataki announced Wednesday night that he would sign the
legislation if it is approved by the Legislature as expected next
week, Giuliani's spokeswoman said he would sue the state to retain
the tax. The spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said pointedly that the
mayor would not change his position because of a possible U.S.
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should think that because of politics, the mayor would
abandon New York City,'' Ms. Mindel said.

OFFICER TESTIFIES AGAINST HIS PEERS IN BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first police officer to come forward with major
information about the Abner Louima case provided a vivid account
Wednesday of the scene at a Brooklyn station house, testifying that
one of the officers on trial emerged, agitated and brandishing a
stick, from a restroom area where prosecutors say Louima was
brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing as one of the prosecution's most important witnesses,
Detective Eric Turetzky said Louima's pants were ``down below his
knees'' as Officer Justin Volpe, his uniform in disarray and
holding a stick nearly three feet long, escorted Louima from the
restroom area of the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, where
Turetzky was an officer at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe took Louima to a holding cell, and ``frowning and hunched
over,'' walked by other officers and began swinging the stick
``like it was a sword and hitting it against the wall,'' Turetzky
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just holding the stick and displaying it to us, waving
it in the air and banging it against the wall,'' Turetzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said that Turetzky broke what they feared
would be a blue wall of silence by being the first to come forward
with significant information against the officers suspected of
being involved in the August 1997 incident.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers are accused of violating Louima's civil rights by
beating him in a police car. Two of them _ Volpe and Charles
Schwarz _ are also accused of torturing Louima, a 32-year-old
Haitian immigrant, in the restroom by ramming the stick into his
rectum and then his mouth, inflicting severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky's statements Wednesday ended a day of testimony that
included the wrap-up of questioning of Louima, and the appearance
on the stand of a cousin of Louima who was at the scene outside a
Flatbush nightclub where Louima was arrested following a street
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Turetzky said that Volpe did not speak to him
or to other officers after he came by waving the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was very unusual,'' because normally Volpe was
``very outgoing and usually, like, the center of attention,''
Turetzky, 28, said in brisk, steady tones in federal court in
Brooklyn, as Volpe and the other officer on trial watched him,
expressionless, from the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky said he soon afterward saw Volpe walked back toward the
restroom and toward some unused cells near it, and that when Volpe
returned, he no longer had the stick, which Turetzky described as
part of a broken broom or mop handle, dark green or blue.
</P>
<P>
   The stick has not been found. Prosecutors say Volpe used it to
tear Louima's rectum and rupture his bladder, and that Louima
required two months in the hospital and three operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turetzky was not inside the restroom when Volpe
allegedly attacked Louima with the stick while Schwarz allegedly
held him down, his account places both officers with Louima around
the time of the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky also gave major testimony incriminating Schwarz, who,
like Volpe, denies that he took part in any assault on Louima in
the station house restroom or, as the prosecution also charges, in
a police car.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky said that he had seen Schwarz leading Louima to the
restroom area not long before he saw Volpe taking Louima away from
there.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at time Schwarz was taking Louima toward the
restroom area, Louima appeared to be bleeding from his lip and
possibly from a second facial cut, and his pants were already
``down below his knees,'' where they had fallen while Schwarz had
searched him at the station house's main desk.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Louima's hands were cuffed behind him, Turetzky said
that Schwarz was raising the prisoner's ``rear-cuffed'' hands so
that Louima's arms were behind him in what Turetzky described as
``chicken wing fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Louima was tiptoeing and being shuffled along,'' the
witness told the jury under questioning by one of the prosecutors,
Loretta E. Lynch, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution says that the two other officers on trial,
Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, joined Volpe and Schwarz in beating
Louima in the patrol car between his arrest outside the nightclub
and the time he was brought into the 70th Precinct station house.
The prosecutors say that the officers mistakenly thought that
Louima had punched Volpe during the melee.
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, is also on trial, charged with
trying to cover up the beating in the police car. The officers and
the sergeant all say that the charges against them are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the late hour when Ms. Lynch ended her questioning of
Turetzky, Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, had time for
relatively few questions as he began his cross examination.
Kornberg suggested that Turetzky had been motivated by ambition to
give his account, noting that he had recently been promoted to
detective after only four years on the police force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among other police officers expected to testify as witnesses are
Officer Mark Schofield, who has reportedly told investigators that
on the morning of the alleged attack, he had lent Volpe a pair of
gloves that were returned to him soiled.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of his two and a half days on the witness
stand, Louima was cross-examined by Wiese's lawyer, Joseph
Tacopina, and Bellomo's, John Patten. They brought up various
discrepancies in the accounts Louima has given to federal and state
investigators since his encounter with the officers, and Patten
suggested that Louima had continued lying to investigators even as
he tried to undo a major lie that he has admitted to.
</P>
<P>
   The lie, he testified last week, had been his statement that
during the alleged attack, one of the officers had told him, ``It's
Giuliani time!''
</P>
<P>
   When he acknowledged the lie while on the witness stand last
week, he said the statement had not been made and that he had been
advised to say it by a supporter. But Wednesday Patten asked Louima
if he was aware that the supporter ``denies he told you about
`Giuliani time.' '' Louima repeated that the man had given him the
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Louima's cousin, Yves Nicholas, testified that he, not Louima,
had punched Volpe during the street brawl that began the chain of
events, saying he acted because he believed Volpe had pushed Louima
to the ground and was arresting him without justification.

LOEWEN GROUP REPORTS 77 PERCENT DROP IN PROFITS FOR FIRST QUARTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., La., Canada)   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Loewen Group Inc., North America's second-largest
funeral home and cemetery operator, reported a 77 percent drop in
first-quarter profit Wednesday and warned that without an
improvement its creditors may force the sale or reorganization of
the company under United States or Canadian bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing extreme difficulties with our highly leveraged
balance sheet and the resulting negative cash flow, which is
impeding our ability to improve the operations of our company,''
John Lacy, chairman of the Burnaby, British Columbia based company,
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Reading that sort of language, investment analysts said the
probability of bankruptcy had increased. ``They're letting the
Street know that they're contemplating a bankruptcy filing,'' said
Debbie Anne Downey, a bond analyst at Miller Tabak Hirsch &AMP; Co. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have new management and they've made some changes,'' she
said. If the second-quarter performance improves, she said,
``there's a slim chance they can renegotiate with their
bondholders.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next two quarters are historically not very strong in
the funeral business, said Bill Burns, an analyst at Johnson Rice &AMP;
Co. in New Orleans, ``so their cash flow is probably not going to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   While some assets have been sold to begin paying off $2.3
billion in debt, Burns said, he thought it would be difficult for
the company to raise cash that way.
</P>
<P>
   A critical date for Loewen Group is Sept. 15, when $300 million
in notes must be refinanced. The way the business is going now,
Burns said, Loewen will likely seek bankruptcy protection before
then.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen operates more than 1,100 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries
and does almost 90 percent of its business in the United States.
Its breakup has been considered a possibility since last September
when the founder, Ray Loewen, was removed as president and chief
executive at the insistence of impatient bankers and institutional
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation increased when Lacy became chairman in January. He
is well known in Canada for patching up and selling companies, in
whole or in parts, having done that previously with Scotts
Hospitality, a restaurant chain, WIC Western International
Communications, a broadcaster, and Oshawa Group, a food retailer.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of 1999, Loewen earned $7 million or 6
cents a share, down from $30 million or 38 cents a year earlier.
Revenue totaled $311 million, unchanged. Last year the company lost
$599 million.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen first warned of the possibility it would seek bankruptcy
in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington last month, saying ``there is no guarantee that it can
continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in Loewen is remarkable for a company that was
routinely described by investment analysts just a few years ago as
having nowhere to go but up. Demographics and an aging population
were on its side. Like its rival, the No. 1 Service Corp.
International of Houston, Loewen was expanding quickly by buying up
small family owned funeral homes. Its stock, which once traded at
more than $40 a share, is now worth $1 because of a series of
missteps. In 1995, a small Mississippi funeral parlor operator won
a breach of contract lawsuit against Loewen and a jury awarded the
plaintiff $500 million. Although the figure was cut to $175 million
in a settlement, Loewen's stock tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Service Corp. offered $3.1 billion to buy Loewen at a
handsome premium. But Loewen rejected the offer and plunged the
company into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Last November the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce seized 10
million of Loewen's shares as collateral for a $145 million loan.
The bank is now the largest single shareholder, with 13.6 percent
stake.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Lakers'starters outscored the Rockets' starters 81-36 Tuesday
night. That's ugly.
</P>
<P>
   But take away Charles Barkley's nice if inconsequential second
half, and the best the Rockets' starters would have done against
even the cross-town Astros on Tuesday night would have been a tie _
19-19.
</P>
<P>
   And that's hideous.
</P>
<P>
   That's why what might be in order now as the Rockets look
themselves in the mirror and face elimination is a complete
makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Change it all. Change it head to toe. Change the makeup of this
team. Take off a little here, redo this. Add that. And don't forget
the implants _ heart implants, that is.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you have to do when things get this hideous. That's
how desperate you have to be when you get this sick and embarrassed
over what you've paraded in front of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were ready to play,'' Rockets forward Scottie
Pippen said. ``I don't know why, but we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets need a change, and they need it fast _ one of those
Oprah or Jenny Jones kinds of makeovers, where some tepid and
homely person ducks backstage at the beginning of the show and
moments later emerges looking gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   But where to begin?
</P>
<P>
   Game 1's ugliness in this Lakers series was limited mostly to
the final few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 was like looking at some nasty morphed image of Don
King's hair, Elvis Costello's glasses, Karl Malden's nose, John
Elway's teeth and Dom DeLuise's chins.
</P>
<P>
   The individual parts were ugly, sure. But looking at it
collectively, you practically had to shade your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to change, and don't think Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich isn't considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Through 50 mostly mediocre regular-season games, Tomjanovich was
subtle and discriminating with how he handled the new-look Rockets.
He defended Pippen's troublesome adjustment to life as a Rocket,
even changing things regularly to better accommodate the former
Bulls star.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich brought the entire team along slowly and patiently,
considering the lack of a training camp and so many new faces. But
these are drastic times, and that means drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the rookies, Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley,
with Brent Price and Sam Mack in the starting lineup might be the
most obvious move.
</P>
<P>
   The kids have a future, all right. But they've struggled
mightily in this series, while Price and Mack have showed veterans'
guile. They combined for 38 points and six assists Tuesday night,
most of the work coming in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're here for,'' Mack said. ``We're the veterans.
We've been in these situations before.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tomjanovich of the possible change: ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Mack and Price should find themselves on the floor
much earlier in today's Game 3 and likely hang around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this ugly mess, perhaps the Rockets finally have
realized something otherwise unfathomable. Hakeem Olajuwon needs
help.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, speaking candidly and showing all the class that has
made him an NBA warrior, admitted as much in the quiet Rockets
locker room Tuesday night. He's overmatched by Lakers monster
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been our strength strength inside,'' Olajuwon said.
``But he is too big. Against San Antonio or Minnesota, we play this
game and we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   But against O'Neal, Olajuwon has been pushed deep into the lane
on several occasions, often to the point that his head is directly
under the basket and he's forced to foul like just another Stanley
Roberts. Tuesday night, O'Neal touched the ball on the low post on
13 of the Lakers' first 17 possessions. They scored on nine of
those possessions, including two off of Olajuwon fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad matchup for us,'' Olajuwon said. ``He creates so
many possibilities with his size advantage. We have to change how
we defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, most of all, the Rockets have to get the ball out
of Pippen's hands when they're bringing it upcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has long demanded that the offense run through him. But
let's look at how this Rockets offense has performed against the
Lakers. While Pippen has gone 5-for-20 from the field, the offense
has stagnated to near playoff death.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to be patient. It's too late to coddle Scottie,
be patient with the rookies and hope Olajuwon can match O'Neal
bucket for bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to win or go home,'' Olajuwon said. ``We have run
out of excuses. We just have to get better.''

EX-LOTUS MANAGER ALLEGES SEXUAL BIAS   BY EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A former manager at Lotus Development Corp. alleges in
a complaint that she and other women were discriminated against by
the company's president, Jeffrey Papows, and his executive
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by the former executive, Arlene Greene, is among
three ongoing sexual-bias cases against the software company
pending before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus denies the charges, although it acknowledges that it
disciplined a manager in response to one of the cases. The filings
provide details about the company's response to the sexual
harassment complaints and, in Greene's case, raise questions about
Papows' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Greene alleges that before he became chief
executive, Papows bragged about missing the company's mandatory
diversity training programs. He also allegedly maintained a ``long
term intimate relationship'' with his secretary and top aide,
Sharon Ricci, the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   Empowered by that relationship, Ricci ``repeatedly targets
female employees such that they either leave `voluntarily' as a
result of the harassment'' or are discharged, according to Greene's
complaint, which was filed on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that Ricci exerted influence within the
Cambridge company ``to a degree far in excess of her qualifications
and job responsibility'' and that ``Mr. Papows apparently defers to
Ms. Ricci.''
</P>
<P>
   The MCAD has not ruled on any of the three complaints and Lotus
has yet to file its response to the agency. Company spokesman Bryan
Simmons said that Green's case ``has no merit'' and said that
neither Papows, Ricci or a third executive cited in Greene's
complaint would respond to questions.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that many top Lotus officers are women, including its
chief finanicial officer and its general counsel, Simmons said,
``The message here is it doesn't seem that Jeff Papows has trouble
working with women.'' He said the number of sexual-bias cases
pending against the company with the MCAD is not unsual considering
that Lotus has 4,000 employees in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In their filings, Greene and two other women allege they were
removed from their jobs after they complained about their
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's complaint was first reported Wednesday by The Wall
Street Journal. Greene has previously declined to comment about her
allegations. She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints are likely to increase scrutiny of Papows, who
has made no specific responses to an earlier Journal article
suggesting he may have fabricated details of his military service
record and educational background.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, now 52, joined Lotus in 1987 as a senior database
development manager. She says in her filing she was wrongfully
terminated last October, supposedly as part of a layoff.
</P>
<P>
   But instead her job was assigned to a younger woman who was less
qualified. Green also claims that she was subjected to
discriminatory treatment ``including being shunned'' by her direct
supervisor, Joseph McLaughlin, who was also named in her complaint.
His actions, Greene claims, were in keeping with the company's
practice of ``targeting female employees'' during a round of
layoffs last August and October.
</P>
<P>
   Greene says further that in February she made her concerns known
to Lotus' parent organization, IBM Corp., where its senior vice
president of human resources, William Matson, told her in March
that it would take no remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   Matson did not return a telephone message and an IBM spokesman
declined to comment, citing the pending complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Another case involving a former employee is that of B.L. Supeno,
who worked for the company about a year until her temporary
position was eliminated at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to her complaint, Supeno charges the mid-level manager
who supervised most of her work in the Organizer Group subjected
her to ``a series and pattern of sexual harassment.'' The manager,
Peter Forkes, routinely used sexually offensive language and wasn't
disciplined by other managers even after she complained, Supeno's
filing states.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response, Lotus concedes that in 1997 Forkes joked
about ``the best place to put a tattoo on a woman's body,'' and
posted a sign on his office door, partly in Greek, reading that
``The Spermologist is in.'' In addition, Lotus says, Forkes sent
around around a sexually-explicit e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus says Forkes was reprimanded that year for the actions and
told that he would be disciplined if there were another similar
occurence. Forkes, who still works at Lotus, declined to comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to its filing, Lotus says further that Supeno also
sent ``crude and sexual e-mails'' herself, which ``strongly
undercuts her claim that she found this (Forkes') behavior to be
unwelcome sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The third sexual-discrimination case involves a woman, Darlene
Hulteen, who says she was terminated in April because of a
complaint she filed with the MCAD at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Hulteen, formerly a programmer-analyst at the company's
Information Systems Web Solutions Group, charges she wasn't given
challenging work assignments because of her gender and age, 48,
while two younger men hired at the same time were given more
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a second complaint to the MCAD, Hulteen wrote she was
terminated ``in retaliation for filing a complaint so they could
get another individual for my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Her experience suggests the company's efforts at diversity
training aren't effective, Hulteen says. ``They preach something
only in order to say it in a legal sense,'' she said. ``There's
definitely a discrepancy between the image and the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus declined to discuss the specifics of Hulteen's complaint.
Simmons, the spokesman, would say that ``We've always recognized
that maintianing a healthy, diverse workplace is hard work and it's
a job that's never done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that our work toward that goal has been more visible
than other companies but we've never taken the posture that we are
superior to other companies in our efforts or our results.''

CHINESE RAGE AT U.S. IS SIGN OF DEEPER ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Most ordinary people in China have a double-barreled
view of the United States, filtered by sharply competing emotions:
admiration and suspicion, hope and fear, love and hate.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful surge of anti-American sentiment was unleashed after
last week's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, sending
rocks, bottles and slogans at the U.S. Embassy here. The protests
grew to become the largest anti-foreign demonstrations since the
Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Led by students, fanned by a government eager to take advantage
of nationalist emotion, the demonstrations reflected a society-wide
resentment toward the United States that feeds on China's mixture
of wounded pride, desire for influence commensurate with its size
and shame at its nagging poverty and intractable politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since China began its reform program, many
Chinese people have openly cited American democracy, wealth and
technology as models they want to follow. Yet during those same
years, and long beforehand, the same people have harbored grave
suspicions about the United States, often seeing anti-China
conspiracies and often taking deep offense at what they regard as
signs of disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   Students, businessmen and government employees agree that the
surge of anti-Americanism is more than just an emotional reaction
to the killing of three Chinese citizens in the bombing. Instead,
it represents an attempt to rally national pride, set off by a
widespread belief that the embassy bombing was an intentional
effort by the United States to cow China into submission for not
supporting NATO's campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very old and traditional nation,'' said Wang Yizheng,
a 44-year-old government employee. ``If you do not show us respect,
we will hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Wang seems to have a drastically divided position
toward the United States. He is proud that his 18-year-old daughter
led her classmates in a demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy, and
yet he seemed equally proud that she plans to apply to study in the
United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   Is that not hypocritical?
</P>
<P>
   Wang was not fazed by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will tell you they are demonstrating to send a message
to America,'' he said. ``In reality, they are demonstrating to feel
good, to respect themselves. Going to America to study, I don't see
any contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run news media, rarely so in tune with popular
opinion on a strident political issue, has encouraged general
outrage at the United States, rather than urging calm. The most
sensitive and effective heartstring the news media seem able to
pull is the issue of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people cannot be bullied,'' People's Daily wrote in an
editorial that was published Wednesday. ``China is a sovereign
country and its dignity is not easily infringed upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pungent symbol of China's wildly fluctuating
views of the United States is President Clinton, who was lionized
before and after his visit here last year. Clinton was admired in
part for his support of an engagement policy toward China against
stiff opposition from Congress, but also, many Chinese say, for his
good looks. In several popular books that appeared last year,
Clinton was roundly praised by Chinese historians as one of the
greatest American presidents ever.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton is being likened to Hitler, denounced by
protesters as a fascist and an imperialist. This turnaround appears
to have less to do with Clinton personally than it does with his
role as the commander in chief in a military action that ordinary
Chinese generally see as unjustified and misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the seeds for this week's explosion of public outrage
were sown in recent weeks by NATO's bombing campaign. Unable to see
what direct benefit the United States can gain from opposing
Serbian aggression in Kosovo, many Chinese seem convinced that the
United States has broader military aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is acting like an arrogant bully,'' said Mou Jianmin,
a former reporter for the New China News Agency who now runs a
computer company. ``I've been talking with many friends about it,
and we are asking: What is America's real aim? Is it really to
protect Kosovars? Or is it to strengthen NATO? Or is it really a
way to get at Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   Though China's news media have offered carefully filtered
accounts of the war, reporting that the sufferings of the Kosovo
Albanians had largely been caused by NATO bombing, Mou insisted
that China's limited news media were not a major factor in shaping
the resentment and anger many people now feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some Westerners think we are only acting this way
because we have limited information, but that's ridiculous,'' Mou
said. ``We feel very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprising aspects of the demonstrations was the way
some students chanted ``Long Live Chairman Mao!'' during the
demonstrations. The authorities have a deeply ambivalent attitude
toward Mao, fully repudiating his fanatical politics while praising
his dominant role in modern Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to students trying to rally national pride, Mao represents
the Communist Party leader with the most courage and flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mao was the only Chinese leader who really dared to stand up
to anyone,'' said Han Weiping, an economics student from People's
University. ``He was afraid of no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to directly criticize today's leadership, Han chose
instead to praise Mao.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying that Mao was great,'' he said. ``He was very
anti-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few Americans in Beijing have been the victims of
violence, many who have witnessed demonstrations were challenged or
threatened by boisterous crowds. Many gave false nationalities when
asked where they were from or to taxi drivers who refused to take
American passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so little to scratch the surface and bring out
xenophobia in this country,'' said a Chinese businesswoman who has
lived in the United States. ``I feel it, too. It's my first
impulse, before I stop and think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any highly emotional political issue, it is entirely
unpredictable where the current surge in anti-Americanism will
lead. Yet this businesswoman said she fears that the sentiment is
so deeply felt and so widely spread that it will have an
immeasurable effect on the role of foreign businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Xun, perhaps China's best-known essayist of the 20th century,
once wrote that in a country that was isolated for centuries, that
suffered at the hands of foreign aggressors, and that carried a
deep sense of its own lost greatness and of envy for modern powers,
it may be unavoidable that many ordinary Chinese people have
trouble seeing foreigners evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look up to foreigners as gods, or down at them as animals,
but never equally, as people.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin's decision to step aside as Treasury Secretary was
responsibly timed in that the major crises in the world now are not
primarily economic. Nonetheless, he will be missed, in part because
he anchored a changing cast of Cabinet and White House officials.
The U.S. economy _ and those of many other countries _ might be in
far worse shape had not his expertise and calm determination helped
steer the Clinton administration's economic policies for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin deserves a significant part of the credit for putting the
government on a course to balance the federal budget, and he will
be remembered as perhaps the most influential member of the Cabinet
at a time that economic issues came to rival security concerns in
determining U.S. relations with other countries. He can also take
pride that it has been more than eight years since the last U.S.
recession ended.
</P>
<P>
   The understanding of markets that Rubin gained in a career as a
bond trader proved to be invaluable in a world coming to grips with
the growing reach of markets and the billions of dollars in capital
that can be moved from one market to another by traders interested
more in quick profits than long-term development.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a former co-chairman of the investment bank Goldman,
Sachs, was chairman of President Clinton's National Economic
Council until he was chosen as Treasury secretary in late 1994,
shortly before the Mexican crisis erupted as that country's
currency fell sharply. It was Rubin who put together a rescue
package that enabled Mexico to come through the crisis and also
kept that crisis from infecting the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part of the rescue _ that investors who had unwisely
lent money to Mexico emerged unscathed _ came back to haunt the
world by encouraging investors to make ill-considered investments
in other countries. That contributed to the Asian crisis that
erupted in 1997, but investors who thought such lending was
risk-free learned otherwise when no bailout materialized after
Russia defaulted on its debts last summer.
</P>
<P>
   While there was criticism of the way the International Monetary
Fund, with Rubin's approval, handled the Asian crisis by forcing
countries to raise interest rates and bring on recessions, the fact
is that most of Asia is on the mend and those policies now appear
to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary named to succeed Rubin,
is an outstanding if sometimes undiplomatic economist who is well
qualified and deserves prompt confirmation.

NOT that it happened very often. But you know how Michael Jordan
would have responded if he'd made that costly turnover in the final
7.6 seconds of the playoff opener against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Clear the decks at the Great Western Forum. Sound the alarms.
You would have had incoming for Game 2. And plenty of collateral
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would have taken advantage of the slightest opening in
the defense and blasted his way like dynamite through a rock face
to create the ones that weren't there. He would have forced the
action. He would have imposed his will on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen took two shots in the first quarter. The Phantom
Menace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have walked so quickly to the brink of elimination,
yet in the three-plus months since his heralded arrival in a
stretch limousine with police escort, Pippen has inched no closer
to understanding his role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``You've been watching all year.
Maybe you can tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   I can tell him this. Jordan or Larry Bird or Magic Johnson would
never have felt the need to ask a columnist for such clarification.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that has been the problem all along. That we have been
blinded by Pippen's glittering collection of NBA championship
jewelry earned in his years with the Bulls and Jordan and expected
him to do too much upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen came to Houston with the papers as one of the NBA's 50
greatest players but without a pedigree as the horse who can pull
the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we chose to overlook that in all of those Chicago title
runs, it was Jordan, John Paxson, Toni Kukoc and Steve Kerr who
stepped up to make those memorable game-winning plays. Not Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we forgot that when Jordan was off chasing curveballs
for the 1993-94 season and most of '94-95, the Bulls did not
advance to the NBA Finals, and the most memorable image of Pippen
was his petulant refusal to get off the bench for the last 1.8
seconds of a playoff game against the Knicks. Now, his Game 1 shot
at Charles Barkley is a bookend of non-responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets expected a leader. What they have gotten is a
fragile ego who would prefer simply to kick in the chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   What Pippen and his other former Chicago teammates _ Kerr and
Luc Longley _ have discovered is that life outside of Jordan's
shadow can earn you a bigger paycheck. But it comes at a higher
price.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's stock has plummeted like Pippen's in a season-long soap
opera of ambivalence and discontent.
</P>
<P>
   When he complained about the Rockets' offense, every
accommodation was made for him. Pippen has been allowed to bring
the ball upcourt and start the offensive sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system where the coach is very flexible,'' said
Hakeem Olajuwon. ``You are free to do whatever you want. You can't
say you need to get somebody more opportunities, more touches. He
has the ball in his hands. He has the ability to create. We welcome
that. We want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often Pippen has shirked that responsibility, offering up an
enigmatic smile and cool facade when what the Rockets have wanted
and needed is fire and passion. Or at least a championship
veteran's understanding of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Game 2, he still maintained that Barkley's foul on
Shaquille O'Neal with 28.4 seconds left in the opener was not a
smart play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make them work the clock down and they score, we still
get the last shot,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but the score is then tied and the Rockets must score to
avoid an overtime on the Lakers' court, where Olajuwon has five
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, uh, yeah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, with the Rockets ahead by one point, if Pippen had
held the ball on the perimeter, he could then have lofted a shot to
beat the 24-second clock that did not have to go in to be
effective. If it bounced high off the rim, most, if not all, of the
final four seconds could have run out by the time LA got to the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. Jordan, Bird, Magic or Barkley would have seen it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Following Game 2, Pippen said his 0-for-7, three-point night was
a result of hard labor at both ends of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chasing Glen Rice all over the court on defense,'' he
said, ``and then the Lakers are cross-matching and having Kobe
(Bryant) make me work real hard just to get the ball up the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Cuttino Mobley could handle that duty?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather do it,'' Pippen said. ``I'm taller, and I'm a
veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. He wants it both ways. The money but not the
burden. The acclaim but not the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have to do,'' said Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this would be a good time to start.

 &HT;    Liam Neeson, larger than life
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given his recent statements that he was retiring from
film because it had become a directors' medium that treated actors
like puppets, one could easily assume that Liam Neeson was
referring to ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' in
which the Irish stage actor and Academy Award nominee plays Jedi
Knight Qui-Gon Jinn opposite a host of computer-generated
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Neeson might have been referring to ``The
Haunting,'' an effects-driven summer horror movie from ``Speed''
director Jan De Bont, in which he plays a psychic researcher who
invites a team of people to investigate a New England mansion
possessed by supernatural powers. Both films are a far cry from the
historical and human drama of ``Les Miserables,'' ``Michael
Collins,'' ``Rob Roy'' and ``Schindler's List,'' which earned him
an Oscar nomination for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a sheep herder in Tibet, that's the real
reason,'' Neeson joked during an interview Sunday at the Regency
Hotel. He was kidding, too, when he told several publications that
he was going to retire from making movies. ``It was something said
in jest and anger that snowballed,'' Neeson said. ``It's a long,
boring story, but it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``The Phantom Menace,'' opening Wednesday, and
``The Haunting,'' due July 23, the tall, ruggedly handsome actor
will be seen this summer in ``Gun Shy,'' in which he plays a drug
enforcement agent who has lost his nerve. He is preparing to
co-star with his wife of five years, Natasha Richardson, in an
adaptation of Patrick McGrath's novel, ``Asylum.'' Then he plans to
take a hiatus from film to concentrate on the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, it's feast or famine, so sometimes I find
myself doing a series of films back-to-back,'' Neeson explained.
``And it comes a point, you think, I really need the injection of a
live audience to do something where you start at 8 o'clock and you
finish at 10:30 and you're in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old Northern Ireland native made his professional
stage debut in 1976 at the Lyric Player's Theatre in Belfast,
having supported himself as a boxer and forklift driver for the
Guinness brewery. He was discovered playing Lennie in ``Of Mice and
Men'' at Dublin's Abbey Theatre by film director John Boorman and
cast as Gawain in the 1981 Arthurian epic, ``Excalibur.''
Supporting roles in such films as ``The Bounty,'' ``Suspect'' and
``The Dead Pool'' followed, before his first starring role as the
disfigured protagonist of Sam Raimi's cartoonish 1990 thriller,
``Darkman.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson's breakthrough came after director Steven Spielberg saw
his acclaimed 1992 Broadway debut in ``Anna Christie'' and cast the
actor as Austrian industrialist Oskar Schindler in his Academy
Award-winning Holocaust drama, ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   The strapping yet soft-spoken Neeson said his penchant for
playing larger-than-life heroic figures is happenstance. He
describes his latest such role, the sage but rebellious Qui-Gon
Jinn, as a cross between Alan Ladd in ``Shane,'' Takashi Shimura in
``The Seven Samurai'' and ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. ``I'm
not the kind of actor who needs to know what (the character) had
for breakfast last Tuesday,'' Neeson said. ``The backstory for me
was Episode 4, the first Stars Wars, believing in that world and
believing in Sir Alec Guinness' personification of an older Jedi.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson sought out the role because of Lucas, who he's admired
since 1973's ``American Graffiti.'' Through a representative, he
sent out feelers to see if the director might be interested in him.
``Not because necessarily I was a huge, mega-Star Wars fan,'' he
said. ``I just really wanted to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas originally envisioned Qui-Gon as a much older character to
be played by an American actor, but was impressed with Neeson's
skills and presence. ``I'm always looking first and foremost for
very accomplished actors, people who are extremely talented and
know their craft very well,'' Lucas said. ``And then next I'm
looking for people who have the stature and, more importantly, the
demeanor of the characters. Liam just seemed ... born to play that
role. He's very quiet; he's very big; he's very powerful; but he's
very contemplative.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's physicality was important for his fierce lightsaber
battles with ``The Phantom Menace's'' villain, Darth Maul, played
by martial arts expert Ray Park. Neeson previously crossed swords
in ``Excalibur'' and ``Rob Roy.'' ``I love doing that stuff,'' he
said. One complicated fight sequence took nearly a month to film,
with Neeson, Park and Ewan McGregor, who plays young Obi-Wan
Kenobi, dueling, leaping and somersaulting across three sets.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger challenge was interacting with digital characters who
were added to scenes during post-production. ``Acting for me is
about reacting, so it's very, very difficult,'' Neeson said. ``It's
hard to act with something that isn't there, and yet there is a
technique to it. My main consideration was I didn't want to be like
those early, early science-fiction films where you would see the
hero with a glassy-eyed stare trying to fight some huge ant.
Subconsciously as an audience member you say, well that guy's not
looking at anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' features nearly 2,000 special-effects
shots _ more than three times the 500 used in ``Titanic.'' As for
his other summer special-effects movie, Neeson said, ```The
Haunting' is a dawdle compared to this.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does the pop adventure of ``Star Wars: Episode 1''
compare to films that depend more on character-driven performances
than, well, puppets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at the end of the day you have to _ be it acting with
Jar Jar Binks (in `The Phantom Menace') or Aidan Quinn in `Michael
Collins' or something, there's something you still have to convey
and share,'' Neeson said. ``Be it, `Where's the nearest space
craft? Let's get out of here,' to whatever. It's the actor's job to
convey whatever it is _ in that scene, in that genre. Don't take it
lightly and ... try never to overplay it.

ECONOMIC SCENE: MANEUVERING MINIMUM WAGE BANDWAGON CAREFULLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress will almost certainly raise the minimum wage this year,
probably to $6.15 an hour from $5.15, phased in over two to three
years. Democrats, as always, are in full support. So, too, are at
least 20 moderate House Republicans anxious about next year's
election. But whatever the political attraction, does a higher
minimum wage make economic sense?
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of economists say yes, though there is reason
for Congress to move cautiously, perhaps even creatively.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose for raising the minimum wage is to make it
possible for all full-time workers to earn enough to lift their
families out of poverty. The current minimum wage falls short. By
2000, according to calculations by Isaac Shapiro of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, the combination of earnings at $5.15
an hour, $3,600 in food stamps and the earned income tax credit _ a
provision of the tax code that has the Treasury send a check of up
to $3,880 to low-wage workers _ would bring the annual income of a
family of four to about $16,100: $1,400 short of the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   But at a wage of $6.15, the family would fall short by about
only $450.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, like Prof. David Neumark of Michigan State, say further
increases in the minimum wage would make some low-wage workers too
expensive to hire. Teen-agers are especially vulnerable. Neumark
concludes, ``the net effect of minimum wages is an increase in the
proportion of poor families.'' Other critics say that the minimum
wage showers help on the wrong people, for example, teen-agers from
wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   But most studies show that none of these problems loom large.
Based on widely accepted estimates, a $6.15 minimum wage would
likely take jobs away from fewer than 64,000 of the 3.3 million
teen-agers now working. Very few adults would lose work. Jared
Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute,
challenges the argument that the benefits of the minimum wage go to
nonneedy families.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the beneficiaries of minimum wage
increases in 1996 and 1997 were adults, about half of whom worked
full time and typically accounted for more than half of their
families' earnings. The 20 percent lowest-paid workers reaped about
35 percent of the benefits of the wage increase even though they
accounted for only 5 percent of total earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Many economist who concede that a higher minimum wage would not
destroy many jobs oppose raising it because, they argue, there is a
better way to help low-wage workers: increase the tax credit.
Because the credit does not hit employers, it does not strip
workers of jobs. But the problem with this argument, many other
economists point out, is that the tax credit has its own problem.
To control the cost of the credit, it is phased out as family
income rises above $12,500. The credit is scaled back by 21 cents
for every extra dollar the family earns. The claw-back operates
like an extra 21 percent tax on additional earnings. The most
effective antipoverty program, Bernstein says, ``would artfully
combine the tax credit and minimum wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is reason to proceed with caution. In the next few
years, women who have exhausted benefits under the 1996 welfare law
will be forced to enter the labor force. These women, many of whom
will have poor or nonexistent work records, will be pressed to find
jobs. Making employers pay an extra dollar an hour will not help.
There is, then, reason for Congress to consider permitting
employers to pay $5.15 for recent welfare recipients for, say, the
first six months or so.
</P>
<P>
   Congress might even venture a bit further. Small companies are
dropping health insurance for their workers. To reverse the trend,
Congress might consider permitting companies to apply some of the
money they spend on health benefits toward their obligation under
the minimum wage bill. There are problems with this approach _
young workers are likely to prefer higher wages to health insurance
_ but it could also help ease a pressing and growing social
problem. &QL;

 &HT;    Series ride into the sunset
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's goodbye _ and perhaps good riddance _ to
four long-running TV series as the season comes to an end this
month.
</P>
<P>
   All were distinctive and popular in their prime, but the years
have seen ratings and freshness fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nanny,'' which ended its six-season run Wednesday, fell
the farthest, winding up with nasal Fran Drescher married to her
boss and giving birth to twins. The swan song was light years away
from the show's original concept, contrasting the blue-blood,
English-born Broadway producer and his blue-collar, live-in baby
sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You,'' which started out seven seasons ago as a
romantic comedy about newlyweds Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie (Helen
Hunt), lost its edge with the birth of baby Mabel at the end of the
'97 season. ``Home Improvement,'' a family sitcom based on Tim
Allen's pseudo-macho standup routine, has stayed on so long the
cute kids have turned into semi-adults.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``Melrose Place,'' the definitive sexy sudser that helped
nail Fox's reputation as a hip, young network, remained true to its
original mission. But in its seven-year run, the show has seen
every imaginable coupling, uncoupling and betrayal. Not even Aaron
Spelling, the king of soapy melodrama, could further heighten
Heather Locklear's vixen stature.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is inevitable. Perhaps so is fatigue. Nothing lasts
forever, certainly not TV characters or the actors who play them.
</P>
<P>
   But even when long-running series grow weary, they often do
better in the ratings than new shows, which have increasingly high
mortality rates. So far this season, there hasn't been a single
break-out hit on any commercial network. Established series are
extremely important to the health of a network. That's why some are
encouraged to stay on far past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mad About You' has been a tremendous source of pride,'' said
Bob Levy, vice president of prime-time series for NBC. ``And
besides making us proud, it has pulled enormous weight on our
schedule. It's been in six time periods in seven years. After a
slow start, it has performed well for us wherever it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You'' was the cornerstone of two of NBC's
``Must-See'' nights: Thursday and Tuesday. Its success helped
launch ``Friends'' and hastened the demise of ABC's ``Roseanne.''
Until Mabel arrived, ``Mad About You'' was a sophisticated comedy
that had all the right ingredients to attract a large and
demographically desirable audience.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the key to turning a good series into a long-running
series?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew that we'd have a lot more legendary shows,'' Levy
said with a chuckle. ``I think largely it's the alchemy of various
factors: the right concept, the right stars, excellent writing and
directing. Nobody can really predict it or control it.''
</P>
<P>
   When a series does click, it forms a bond with viewers that
keeps them coming back week after week. With ``Mad About You,'' it
was the romance, the humor and viewers' ability to relate to the
characters. Memories of the better, early years will be recalled in
the hour-long finale, which airs May 24 at 8 p.m. and will have a
flash-forward with Janeane Garofalo playing a grown-up Mabel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' was an instant hit when it came along eight
years ago. Tim Allen's wacky cave man standup was the basis for the
domestic sitcom that was crafted to suit his talent, and it became
one of the few family comedies that remained focused on the parents
instead of the children. The middle son, played by Jonathan Taylor
Thomas, became something of a teen heartthrob, but Allen and
Patricia Richardson (who played wife Jill) were the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taping that final episode was extremely emotional,'' said
executive producer Bruce Ferber. ``The show meant more to Tim than
anybody else because it was his life. Pat and Tim had a
relationship that was like a real marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute finale, which airs May 25 at 7 p.m., includes a
half-hour of highlights, a half-hour episode in which Tim quits his
cable TV show, ``Tool Time,'' and Jill is offered a teaching job in
Indiana, and a half-hour of bloopers. In the last segment, the
actors chat with the audience and each other about their memories
of the show. Everybody except Thomas, who was invited back but
declined, is on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the end of an era,'' Ferber said. ```Home
Improvement' is the last comedy about a functional family that's
been given a prime slot on a major network.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. ``The Hughleys'' is about a nuclear family,
and other families are bound to arrive in the fall. The family
sitcom has been declared dead many times but always resurrects
itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of ``Home Improvement'' is a big loss to ABC. Of the
four long-running series departing this month, ``Home Improvement''
leaves with the healthiest ratings, frequently appearing in the
Nielsen Top 20. There's no question it was a franchise show for
ABC, successfully anchoring Tuesday nights through much of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Tim's decision to quit,'' Ferber said. ``He wanted to
go out on top. And creatively, we'd been every place we needed to
go. ... History is going to be kind to this show. It captured the
male-female conflict in the country, the differences between men
and women and how we continue to try to get along. It was a show
about something, and that was a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the departing series has been as controversial or
influential as ``Melrose Place,'' created by long-time fluffmeister
Aaron Spelling (``Dynasty,'' ``Charlie's Angels''). Young viewers
flocked to ``Melrose'' by the millions, laughing at its outrageous
sexiness and imitating its fashion and hairstyles. Amanda's
short-skirted, long-jacketed suit (worn with cleavage instead of a
blouse) became the ``power suit'' of the '90s and a forerunner of
Ally McBeal's micro-mini outfits of today. The young actors
regularly pop up in the pages of People and In Style magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has definitely been a signature show for this network,''
said Craig Erwich, vice president of drama programming at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   A lightning rod for criticism, too. Older viewers and critics of
the medium decried the wanton sexual escapades that are a regular
part of each episode. Bed-hopping was a phrase that could
accurately be used to describe just about every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organically, that was part of the show,'' Erwich said. ``When
you have stories about young, beautiful people, certainly there
will be a sexual energy. Doing something steamy, sexy and
distinctive is never discouraged here. It was the first prime-time
soap to wrest the crown away from the older, monied worlds of
`Dynasty,' `Dallas' and `Falcon Crest' and give it to younger
people. It took an established genre, which had been on its last
legs, and breathed new life into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on May 24 at 7 p.m., ``Melrose'' will have its last gasp.
Not surprisingly, Fox is mum on details. A tersely worded press
release says it will be ``an explosive ending, complete with a
wedding and a funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is there a natural life expectancy to any series? Probably.
With all the choices available to viewers today, it's harder and
harder to grab and keep an audience and equally hard to keep them
interested.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the four series bowing out this month, the
creativity and growth of earlier years is gone. Although we'll miss
some of the characters, it's time for them to go.

BRILLIANT DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT SHARES SOAR ON OWNERSHIP NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street gave its blessing Wednesday to
3-year-old Brilliant Digital Entertainment, the software developer
with the gimmick of offering movies that have hundreds of
plot-twist choices.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of long-suffering Brilliant rocketed 35 percent, gaining
$1.75 to $6.75 on volume of over 1 million shares -- nearly 10
times the 30-day average. The run-up came after Woodland Hills,
Calif.-based Brilliant announced that a quintet of high-profile
investors, including Prince Ahmad Bin Khalid Al Saud, have bought
18 percent of the company for $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased at the recognition Brilliant is receiving for
our technology and digital content library,'' said Mark Dyne,
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. ``This new
investment package, together with valuable experience brought to
the company by these individuals, will help us advance our growth
strategy for delivering next-generation entertainment over the
Internet and other broadcast mediums and to proceed with planned
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are Tim Helfet, president and chief executive
officer of Rysher Entertainment; Martin Schuermann, U.S.
representative of European producer CLT-UFA; Brent Cohen, formerly
president of Packard Bell NEC; and Barry Baeres, president of
German media group Intertainment Aktiengesellschaft.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant, which began selling its digitally animated Multipath
Movies in December, did not disclose how much each investor has
acquired but the prince has been given the right to a seat on its
board of directors. The prince, a member of Saudi Arabia's royal
family, previously held a controlling stake in Harvey Entertainment
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which signed a variety of significant distribution
and content partnerships, also announced Wednesday a
revenue-sharing pact with Home Benelux, a European joint-venture of
Internet-cable specialist Home Network. It reiterated an
announcement that it is in talks for an acquisition of an
undisclosed entity.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant performed respectably on Wall Street after it went
public in November 1996 with a $10 million offering at $5 a share,
as the stock topped $9 in less than a year. But investors began
losing patience after Packard Bell NEC decided to not install the
movies on its lower-cost personal computers and the issue descended
under $2 during the latter part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have apparently regained confidence in the long-term
promise of the company. The stock price gain came despite Brilliant
announcing a first-quarter loss of $1.89 million on revenues of
just $206,000. That followed a loss of $9.43 million on revenues of
$431,000 for all of 1998.

EDITORIAL: REVOLVING PRIME MINISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin has given new meaning to an old Kremlin post, the
disposable prime minister. Yevgeny Primakov is the latest,
dismissed Wednesday ostensibly for failing to revive the economy.
The actual reason is doubtless more byzantine. Like Yeltsin's
previous decapitations, the removal of Primakov and his cabinet
leaves Moscow's domestic and foreign policies in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could scarcely be worse. The Russian economy is still
staggering, but Primakov had at least restored a measure of
political stability in Moscow and recently gained agreement from
the International Monetary Fund to resume limited lending to
Russia. The Russian government has also been trying to put together
a peace agreement to end the war in Yugoslavia, a role that may now
be diminished because of infighting in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's labored appearance on Russian television to announce
his decision could only have added to the common perception among
Russians that their president is enfeebled and increasingly out of
touch with the country's urgent interests.
</P>
<P>
   The political machinations of the Yeltsin court have come to
rival the intrigue that flourished under the czars. Yeltsin is
under constant attack from Communist politicians, who use every
stratagem including possible impeachment to bring him down. Leaders
like Primakov and Viktor Chernomyrdin, another former prime
minister, are anointed, sacrificed, rehabilitated and again
discharged. All the while the people's needs are ignored. This is
no way to manage a modern state with more than 10,000 nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said he was acting in defense of democracy and economic
reform. If so, the most charitable interpretation is that he
removed Primakov, no champion of reform, before he could establish
himself as the leading candidate to succeed Yeltsin. A less
generous assessment is that Yeltsin once again acted impulsively to
preserve his own power by ousting an increasingly popular and
independent prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the dismissal relates to a planned impeachment vote in
the Duma this weekend is unclear, though it seems likely Yeltsin's
decision will arm his opponents. The charges against Yeltsin,
compiled by the Communists, would seem bizarre almost anywhere
else. Among other things, he is accused of instigating the collapse
of the Soviet Union, which of course he did and for which the world
is eternally grateful. Before he can be ousted, the upper house of
parliament will have to approve the action by a two-thirds vote,
which is considered unlikely but not inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, Yeltsin's new choice for
prime minister, has spent his life in internal security jobs, not
exactly a breeding ground for democracy. In the turbulent world of
Kremlin politics, he may never be confirmed by the Duma. If he is,
he can probably look forward to being dismissed by Yeltsin someday.
That is, if Yeltsin is still president. &QL;

EDITORIAL: IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, MAYBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Space experts are scratching their heads over a paralyzing
series of rocket failures that have disrupted both military and
civilian launches. In the last nine months there have been six
serious failures of American rockets that have destroyed or
nullified some $3.5 billion worth of intelligence, imaging and
communications satellites. Four of the failures occurred in the
past five weeks. This is the most serious launching crisis since
the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and other rocket
failures in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At first impression, there appears to be no common thread in the
accidents. The string of failures may simply be a run of bad luck
with no long-range significance. Or it may signify far deeper
problems, ranging from sloppy quality control to poorly written
software to design errors or manufacturing defects. One worrisome
possibility is that the launching industry is suffering from a
shortage of experienced engineers and technicians at a time that it
is under great pressure to fly more rockets more cheaply to keep
pace with foreign competitors. ``It's manufacturing and quality
control,'' one private expert contended. ``Not a lot of this is
real rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   High-level reviews by the military and the aerospace industry
may find an answer to the puzzle. Meanwhile it is sobering to
realize that, even now, more than 40 years into the space age,
launchings remain a risky and unforgiving business. Those hoping to
be rocketed into space by commercial entrepreneurs, or who consider
rockets a dandy way to dispose of nuclear and toxic wastes in
space, might take note.

 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forty years ago, decades before stretch limousines
choked the Bowery, discharging luminaries lured to the Bowery Bar,
long before it was remotely hip to live on the Lower East Side,
much less Skid Row, Kate Millett moved to what she dubs the
``street of sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother first visited me, she stepped out of the cab,
over the bluejeaned hippies and the drunks passed out on the
sidewalk and wept,'' Ms. Millett, the feminist author and artist,
recalled recently, her gray, shoulder-length hair brushing her face
as she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millett sat in a wooden chair in the kitchen of her second
Bowery residence, a 2,400-square-foot loft the city moved her to 26
years ago after her previous rental was condemned. The massive
fifth floor apartment is where she lives; her art studio, also
2,400 square feet and awash in white, is two floors down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millett was chain-smoking Marlboros. ``I adore where I
live,'' she said, lighting up. ``I love nesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't? She rents both lofts from the city for the
impossible sum of $500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Millett, 64, may find herself in a new dwelling soon.
The building at 295 Bowery, also home to two other artists, a
curator and two children, is scheduled to be razed and its tenants
relocated because the city wants to tear it down to make room for
an urban renewal project that has been in the works since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Having slowly acquired chunks of property during the last 25
years over a large swath of the Lower East Side, the city is
finally poised to select a developer at the end of the summer for
the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Project, which would cover three
and a half acres. The project would include 450 market- rate
apartments, 150 low-income dwellings and a 30,000-square-foot
community center with a gymnasium and a pool.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ms. Millett and the other residents are not
moving without a fight. Having failed to win landmark status for
the 136-year-old building _ which has quite a storied history, in a
sordid sort of way _ the tenants are looking into gaining
historic-district designation for the entire length of the Bowery,
from Confucius Plaza at its south to Cooper Square at its
northernmost end. And they have submitted to the city an
alternative development plan that would spare 295 Bowery. In
addition, the city also has yet to find replacement housing for
them, a process that could drag on.
</P>
<P>
   That the city's ambitious plans may hinge on, or at the least be
inconvenienced by, 295 Bowery could be viewed as either curious or
fitting, given the transformation of the thoroughfare and the small
building itself.
</P>
<P>
   The building had been a hotel during the Civil War, catering to
returning soldiers. By the 1890s it was a brothel and a dive where
it is said that a half-dozen destitute courtesans drank carbolic
acid and died. John McGurk, the owner of the saloon on the ground
floor, then capitalized on the notoriety of the place by renaming
it McGurk's Suicide Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Later, beginning in World War I and continuing into the 1950s
and early '60s, it was a flophouse for Skid Row veterans. In the
mid-'60s it was converted into artists' studios.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this colorful past, the city's Landmarks Preservation
Commission denied landmark status to the building, finding that it
did not have sufficient historical, cultural or architectural
merit.
</P>
<P>
   But the neighborhood is a far cry from what it was when Ms.
Millett and her neighbors first moved in. Real estate there is
ablaze. The area is dripping with funky shops, restaurants and
night spots, and the price of apartment rentals rivals that of
other Manhattan neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   So the loft-dwellers of 295 Bowery are not evoking much
sympathy. Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, who represents the area, said
the building's tenants knew when they moved in that they would one
day have to vacate because the property was part of a project born
28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to see this proposal fall flat because of a few
people,'' Ms. Freed said. ``They put a lot of money in their lofts,
but they knew it was not their property.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, the building looks like any other dowdy
tenement, with its faded brick facade and a touch of graffiti. But
inside, the rambling lofts have been transformed by their artists
in residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, it was dark and dirty, with no windows in
the front, just openings covered with tins; no bathroom except for
a toilet, no heat and no kitchen,'' said Ms. Millett, whose living
quarters now are filled with three Franklin stoves, a wealth of
antiques, and shelves upon shelves of books.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Preservation Department says it will relocate the
tenants, but exactly where is not yet known. The city is obligated
to move the residents into comparable space, and a statement
released by the housing agency says the new dwelling must be
``decent, safe and sanitary.'' But it is not required that the rent
remain the same, nor that the apartment be in the same condition.
Tenants, the statement said, can get rental assistance if they meet
eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millett's downstairs neighbor and longtime friend, Sophie
Keir, denied that she and her neighbors knew that the building
would one day be leveled. Ms. Millett moved in after her former
residence on the Bowery was razed. ``Why would they put her in a
building that was going to be demolished, too?'' asked Ms. Keir, a
sculptor and furniture maker who has lived for 20 years in the
second-floor loft.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She added that artist Michael Bakaty _ who lives on the fourth
floor with his wife, Yvonne Muranushi, and two young sons, Zoli, 5,
and Kaz, 2 _ was living in the building 30 years ago when it was
privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakatys, who pay $300 a month for rent, have erected a
warren of rooms in their apartment. ``I love this place,'' said Ms.
Muranushi, a curator. ``Both my children were born here with a
midwife right there on the sofa.''
</P>
<P>
   But the HPD says the Cooper Square project is moving forward. It
will issue a request for proposals sometime this spring and expects
to have a developer chosen by the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, 400 households were relocated temporarily or
permanently because of the urban renewal plan, said Valerio
Orselli, a member of the Cooper Square Committee, an arm of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Orselli said that five years ago the tenants of 295 Bowery were
shown alternative spaces at 267 Bowery, which they rejected.
Residents say they were shown the space with a flashlight because
there was no electricity. ``We asked to see it in daylight,'' Ms.
Millett said. ``That never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Orselli said the city planned to renovate 267 Bowery. ``We were
going to put in solid wood floors, windows, everything,'' he said.
Other artists have since purchased it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the city will also demolish commercially
occupied buildings at 291, 293 and 311 Bowery. That worries Sam
Kahn, a co-owner of Stanton Trading Corporation, a restaurant
supply company. ``There's no good end to this for us,'' said Kahn,
whose business occupies 291 and 293 Bowery and the ground floor of
the loft building. ``We're in something of a pickle.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing committee of Community Board 3 passed a motion that
any proposals for new construction should contain space for Stanton
Trading, which has been on the Bowery for 40 years, Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Ms. Keir presented her own proposal to the
community board. Under her plan, the 600 apartments planned by the
urban renewal project would be built, but 295 Bowery would be
spared. The board unanimously passed a resolution urging the
housing department to examine the plan as a possible alternative
when proposals flow in. Ms. Keir has also presented the plan
directly to the housing department.
</P>
<P>
   And the residents are still researching the street's unsavory
past, hoping to be designated a historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate not to have a Bowery address,'' said Ms. Millett.
``It's the street of truth, so to speak.''

EDITORIAL: COMMUTER TAX GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, New York's politicians outdo themselves
with acts of destructive one-upmanship. It is happening again, as
the state legislature moves toward repealing the New York City tax
imposed on commuters, blowing a deep hole in the city's finances.
The repeal of the tax is to be rammed through Albany next week
because both Republicans and Democrats think it will help them win
a heated state Senate contest in Rockland County. Democrats are
also eager to embarrass Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. They want Giuliani,
a Republican, to beg to keep the tax on the very suburbanites whose
support he will be seeking in his campaign for United States
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter tax, enacted in 1966 and raised in 1971, is paid by
nearly 750,000 people who work in the city but live outside it.
Since these workers benefit enormously from the city's police,
fire, sanitation and transportation services, it is only logical
for them to shoulder part of the burden of paying for them. The tax
is only about an eighth of the income tax that city residents pay,
and it has remained stable while city taxes have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says he opposed repealing the commuter tax, but he has
been slow to mount a full-scale attack. This, however, is no time
to let political niceties stand in the way of the city's interests.
If the commuter tax is repealed for everyone, it would cost the
city $360 million in revenues. If it is repealed only for residents
of the New York suburbs, it would cost $208 million. A partial
repeal would also be challenged as discriminating against New
Jersey and Connecticut residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state Senate took the initiative on
the tax, and plans to pass it next week. Joseph Bruno, the Senate
majority leader, supports Giuliani's Senate campaign and may think
he is doing the mayor a favor by handing out a bonus to
suburbanites. Giuliani must say ``no thanks'' and threaten a legal
challenge to the legislature's acting in defiance of the city
council. He should also make his opposition clear to the
Democratic-controlled assembly and to Gov. George Pataki, who no
doubt is amused at the mayor's political predicament but should
still side with him in opposing the repeal. Everyone in this battle
right now is playing games. But if the tax is canceled, New York
City will be in trouble. &QL;

 &HT;    Original R2-D2 actor is `on a roll'
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kenny Baker is a singular anomaly in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   An internationally known movie star, he's yet to utter a line of
dialogue in his best-known role.
</P>
<P>
   His character's one-word name is an icon of pop culture _ like
Cher or Sting _ but few know what he looks like out of costume.
</P>
<P>
   And although he stands just 3-foot-8, he's a giant in movie
history.
</P>
<P>
   R2D2.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Baker goes for another spin in the ``Star Wars'' whirlpool
next week when the latest movie in the science-fiction serial,
``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' opens in the United States on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker spent 12 weeks reprising his role in ``Menace'' as the
chirping, beeping sidekick to Anthony Daniels' C-3PO character. The
two were the only characters carried over to the ``prequel'' from
the original three movies. (His favorite was the second in the
series, ``The Empire Strikes Back.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the same R2 unit we used the last time,'' Baker said
by phone from his home in Manchester, England. ``It even had the
same boots inside that I wore for stability in the first three
movies. I half thought there would still be scorpions from the last
time we shot in the Tunisian desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the desert. Director George Lucas shot action scenes for
``Menace'' in the same Tunisian desert seen in the opening
sequences for ``Star Wars'' in 1976. Temperatures in the 120s.
Wicked sand storms that wrecked entire movie sets. And the
aforementioned critters. All of which is all fine if you're a young
man.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker is 64 now. He's highly claustrophobic, battles asthma
and had difficulty dealing with temperatures that went as high as
127. Doesn't help that his R2D2 costume is only 3-feet, 10-inches
tall and has no cooling system and just a small hole at the bottom
to let in air.
</P>
<P>
   And as acting gigs go, R2D2 is no Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't move very far. I wobble it around and look one way or
another, or react to dialogue, look from left to right, that sort
of thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it was an exciting feeling to be in same kind of film,
with the same sort of sets and some familiar people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After finding stardom with ``Star Wars,'' Baker went on to
perform in such films as ``Time Bandits,'' ``The Elephant Man'' and
``Amadeus.'' A lull hit after the last ``Star Wars'' film, ``Return
of the Jedi,'' but these days his schedule is filled.
</P>
<P>
   He is represented by a Florida-based talent agency that books
him to appear at science fiction conventions around the country,
along with several other minor ``Star Wars'' characters. For four
years, he's played arguably the most lovable dwarf of all time,
Dopey, in a London stage play. And he has a few other gigs lined up
before he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often say, I'm the luckiest dwarf in Europe,'' he said. ``My
house is paid for, I've got a Rolls Royce. There are two more `Star
Wars' movies to do, another in Sweden and a show in London that
could lead to other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really on a roll at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   R2D2 Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   You don't get to talk to R2D2 eery day. So we asked Kenny Baker
a few questions we were curious about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ever pop a wheelie in the R2D2 robot?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm very rarely in the mobile shots. No, the robot that moves
falls over occasionally. Hits a stone or goes into a ditch. All my
model does is wobble and turn it's head.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is furrier, Chewbacca or George Lucas?
</P>
<P>
   A: George has only got it on his face, as far as I know. Chewie
is much hairier. Peter Mayhew, who plays Chewbacca, is quite hairy
himself, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who would win in a fight: Darth Vader or the new meanie,
Darth Maul?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. I wasn't there for battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about a fight between Chewbacca and, say, Boba Fett?
</P>
<P>
   A: Boba Fett's the bounty hunter. He's quite popular. He's got
this power pack on his back and armor and it's a quite attractive
costume. Jeremy Bullock, the guy inside, is very likeable and
speaks very clear English. He and I do quite well on these
conventions we appear at. Who would win, though? Chewie is a little
bit slow and thinks a lot slower. I'd have to give it to Boba Fett.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ever get the urge to knock Anthony Daniels over when he says
something snotty as C-3PO?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've knocked him over a few times by accident, but he's more
inclined to knock me over. I'm not sure if it's on purpose but I
suspect not. He has quite a lot of dialogue, but when he looks at
me, nothing really happens. I don't move quite at all in relation
to dialogue. Anthony has been pretty pissed off at me on occasion.
As an actor, how do react to a robot? I can't raise an eyebrow or
do things normal actors would do. He must get pretty frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You played a cuddly, furry Ewok in the third film. Ever go
out in public dressed like that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The costumes at the time were a pain to work with. Very
uncomfortable. Very hot. I vowed never to be an Ewok again.

   LOS ANGELES _ The visitors' locker room at the Great Western
Forum was almost empty when Charles Barkley made his way back from
the shower to his corner. A small boy waited and almost whispered
his request for the Air Jordans that Barkley gives away after every
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I already gave them away tonight,'' Barkley said.
``Come back Monday after we kick their butts in Houston, and
they're yours. I'll see you on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   But returning the series to Los Angeles will take more than
Barkley's unsinkable confidence and unwavering bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a half-hour earlier, when he was surrounded by media
members searching for answers to explain the Rockets' 2-0 hole in
their best-of-five series with the Lakers, Barkley said he would
not dissect his team.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to. The Lakers already had. Tonight, back home
but facing elimination, the Rockets find out what is inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's all heart,'' Rockets backup center Antoine Carr
said. ``All the X's and O's don't mean anything unless you go out
there and give it your all. If you think, `I'm a pretty boy, I'm
going to get pub,' you need to sit your butt down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first year with this team. We have a lot of new
players. I don't know if they have the mentality. I know a few of
us do, but I'm not sure about everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of that mentality among the Rockets remains uncertain
at a time when it is needed most. After doing almost everything
they could to blow the home-court advantage down the stretch of the
regular season, they're paying for it immediately in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to step up in the final eight seconds Sunday, they fell
down. With a chance to even the series Tuesday, they were routed
from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Now facing elimination, they insist they have the fortitude to
come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the experience of a team that knows what it's like to
be in the playoffs,'' Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon said. ``We're
down 2-0; it doesn't mean it's over. We can't believe it's over.
The playoffs are not just the skill; it's the mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the position realistically, they held serve. The
pressure is on us to take care of the home-court advantage to stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the team character is tested.''
</P>
<P>
   One defeat away from ending their season, the Rockets cannot
even lean on their once-remarkable history when pushed to the
brink. The Rockets are 11-4 in elimination games under coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. But they have lost three of their past four
elimination games since the championship years.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone into a 2-0 hole 15 previous times, winning the
series twice. In best-of-five series they have been in a 2-0 hole
three times, losing all three, including twice to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past doesn't have anything to do with the present,''
Barkley said. ``We have to play well tomorrow and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   But one can learn from the past, and Barkley did bring the 1993
Suns back from a 2-0 hole, which was made deeper because the Suns
took that perilous situation to Los Angeles before sweeping the
next three games to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nerve-racking when your back is against the wall,''
Barkley said. ``You can't worry about it. You just have to go out
there and play, and play well. You don't have any room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they had to do. Now we have to do what we have
to do. The pressure is always on the home team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, the Rockets said, is striking the balance between panic
and intensity, urgency and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're backed into a corner,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We've got to
pull really close together. We're going home. They've held serve.
We've got to get our confidence back. We can't get into a
depression. They've played very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't panic. You have to come out with a sense of urgency.
It can't be desperation. It can't be panic.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Rockets have characterized the Lakers'
2-0 start, including their magnificent performance Tuesday, as
little more than taking care of their home court. The Lakers played
so well, they said, that the Rockets couldn't be fooled into
believing themselves outmatched.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made 45 of 83 shots (54.2 percent) Tuesday, with a
remarkable 10 of 18 on 3-pointers, burning the Rockets for the
double-team attention they had to pay Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal was
at his best, finishing with 28 points, nine rebounds, seven assists
and five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they shoot the ball like that, crown them NBA champs,''
Rockets forward Scottie Pippen said. ``You have to respect the fact
we have to double down on Shaq. Somebody is going to be open. They
made us pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than them shooting the heck out of the ball, we feel
good about what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen added, however, that one change he believes the Rockets
will need is more offense from him. Pippen was 0-for-7 and made
three first-half free throws Tuesday. In four games this season in
the Great Western Forum, Pippen has made 15 of 56 shots.
</P>
<P>
   But in the one regular-season meeting with the Lakers at Compaq
Center, Pippen made eight of 15 shots and led the Rockets with 26
points in a 22-point win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know last night was not the type of game I would like to
have,'' Pippen said. ``I came out to try to be aggressive and get
us going early. But if you're taking the ball out of the basket
every time down the court, it's hard to make a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give this team more offense. I have to be more
aggressive offensively. I don't want to force shots, but it may
come down to that. I have to be more aggressive and get more
opportunities for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he would continue to consider changes in
schemes or strategies that could help. But few seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   Of Pippen's offensive troubles, Tomjanovich said, ``I don't
think you put it on one person. I'm not putting it on him at all.
Collectively, we have to get into our game. When we're into our
game, we have balance out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With few changes likely, the Rockets have focused on a mindset,
an attitude and confidence. They have pointed to Game 1 _ when they
played well, could have won and insist they should have won. And
they will hope the return to their home court will give them
another chance to test themselves on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're playing a different team,'' Rockets guard
Brent Price said. ``We know what they do. We've gone over the X's
and O's. We know how we're supposed to rotate. We know what all the
tendencies are. We know all those things. All of it now is about
what's inside. We've got to come out clawing and fighting and
scratching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find out what we're made of. Who knows? I don't
think we can really tell until Thursday night.''
</P>
<P>
   A dissection will provide such answers, especially for a
franchise that not long ago celebrated its heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go in there and concede,'' forward Othella Harrington
said, ``or we can have some guts and play our hearts out.''

WEALTH OF OPTIONS CONCERNS PGA TOUR BOSS
</HEADLINE>
 By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said Wednesday
he has concerns about several factors that threaten to limit
widespread participation of elite players at future tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Finchem said, are the emergence of the World Golf
Championships, the proliferation of appearance fees awarded PGA
Tour stars to compete in European Tour events and the creation of
more special events similar to the Aug. 2 exhibition match between
David Duval and Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval, the game's top-ranked players, are scheduled to
compete for a $1.5 million purse on a Monday night as part of
prime-time programming on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things we have to monitor,'' Finchem said. ``I feel
good about where we are. But if things start going in the other
direction, we'll have to make some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   On a case-by-case basis, Finchem dealt with all three topics:
</P>
<P>
   If another World Golf Championship event is added to the tour
calendar before 2002, its purse will not count as official earnings
on the PGA Tour money list, Finchem said. The tour added three WGC
events to the 1999 calendar, each with a $5 million purse and the
potential to drain the quality of fields at tournaments played in
surrounding weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we need to take a deep breath, let the public
enjoy these events and see if we need to make adjustments in a year
or two,'' Finchem said. ``If we do, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Five elite tour players _ Tiger Woods, Nick Price, Mark O'Meara,
Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik _ will accept six-figure appearance
fees next week to compete at a European Tour event in Germany
rather than play at the MasterCard Colonial. Each player had to
receive a conflicting-event waiver from the PGA Tour to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carefully monitor the number of releases. But once in a
while, we still have a blip on the screen generated by big
appearance money,'' Finchem said. ``I think this is an isolated
incident. If things get too bad (in the future), we won't grant
releases beyond a certain number.''
</P>
<P>
   Although sanctioned by the tour, Finchem predicted future
special events like the Duval-Woods exhibition will be few and far
between during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing that doesn't make a lot of sense to do
a lot,'' Finchem said. ``Do we want to set up made-for-TV matches
during the official earnings season on a regular basis? I don't
think so. But this is a unique set of circumstances. It's a match
people want to see and we're thinking it will promote the game to a
wider viewing audience.'' nn

TENTATIVE ACCORD REACHED ON EMERGENCY MILITARY SPENDING BILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Calif., Fla., Ill., Kan., Miss., Nev., Okla., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring their leaders' wishes to hold down
spending, congressional negotiators tentatively agreed Wednesday on
a $11.6 billion emergency bill to finance the fighting in
Yugoslavia and pay for a myriad of Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a game of political poker that began with President Clinton's
bid for $6 billion for the bombing in the Balkans, the House-Senate
conference committee was far from showing its hole cards.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, committee members had not agreed on how
to pay for the emergency bill, or whether to rid it of amendments
and riders favoring special interests. The negotiations continued
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   After days of intense bargaining, Democratic senators still
sought billions in farm aid and school safety programs. Republican
senators wanted hundreds of millions for mining, gas, oil, fishing
and other business interests _ not everyone's definition of an
emergency, as Democrats pointed out. Conservatives remained furious
that most of the $13 billion on the table would come out of the
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Other emergency spending measures, for Central American and
Caribbean countries hit last year by hurricanes, seemed likely to
grow to include $500 million for disaster victims in this country,
including Oklahomans and Kansans, who lost so much last week in
tornadoes, and about $400 million more for American farmers hurt by
falling food prices.
</P>
<P>
   That would bring the total emergency package headed for the
House and Senate to more than $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The chief negotiators, Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska and Rep. C.W.
``Bill'' Young of Florida, both Appropriations Committee chairmen,
read and then tossed aside pleas from the majority leader, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the speaker, Rep. J. Dennis Hastert
of Illinois, to hold the military spending to $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, the head of the
House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, briefly argued about the
meaning of the $11 billion figure in the leaders' letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven billion is a ceiling, not a floor,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis responded, ``It was a floor.''
</P>
<P>
   That set the tone for the conference, which veered Wednesday
from deadly serious to nearly madcap.
</P>
<P>
   Proceedings halted for nearly an hour as Stevens and his fellow
Alaska Republican, Sen. Frank Murkowski, argued for a measure aimed
at keeping the Glacier Bay National Park open to commercial
fishermen. Young said the House would block the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also took time to discuss Stevens' proposed $3
million program to help Alaskan reindeer ranchers protect their
herds. ``You can call it my Santa Claus amendment, if you want,''
the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments ground on over another amendment, sponsored by the
Republican senators from Kansas, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts,
that would let natural-gas producers avoid repaying $235 million in
penalties and interest they owe to overcharged consumers in 23
states _ ``a straight special-interests versus public-interest
issue,'' said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat
on the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some members wondered aloud what such provisions were doing in
an emergency spending bill to help finance NATO's air war. ``The
question of whether it's a emergency or not is in the eye of the
beholder,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   But the conference did tentatively agree on the biggest item
before it: how much money to add to the military spending measure,
which was originally intended for this country's share of the air
war.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Lewis, the chief appropriators, agreed on $11.55
billion, or $5.5 billion more than Clinton requested. They added
$2.25 billion for military operations and maintenance, $1.84
billion for a military pay increase, $300 million for aircraft,
$475 million for construction at overseas bases, $250 million for
missiles and munitions, $200 million for the Coast Guard and $100
million for military recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   They also added $46 million to Clinton's request for assistance
to war refugees from Kosovo, bringing the total to $678 million.
</P>
<P>
   The conferees have also agreed to spend $687 million for the
Caribbean and Central American hurricane victims and $100 million
to shore up Jordan's role in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest stumbling blocks remained. Moderate
Republicans need to persuade conservatives to pay for the package
with money from the Social Security surplus. House members need to
keep twisting Senators' arms to persuade them to drop amendments
benefiting home states and pet interests.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that happened, Obey said, the bill would resemble ``not a
Christmas tree, but a Christmas tree farm.''

BRILLIANT DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT SHARES SOAR ON OWNERSHIP NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street gave its blessing Wednesday to
3-year-old Brilliant Digital Entertainment, the software developer
with the gimmick of offering movies that have hundreds of
plot-twist choices.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of long-suffering Brilliant rocketed 35 percent, gaining
$1.75 to $6.75 on volume of over 1 million shares -- nearly 10
times the 30-day average. The run-up came after Woodland Hills,
Calif.-based Brilliant announced that a quintet of high-profile
investors, including Prince Ahmad Bin Khalid Al Saud, have bought
18 percent of the company for $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased at the recognition Brilliant is receiving for
our technology and digital content library,'' said Mark Dyne,
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. ``This new
investment package, together with valuable experience brought to
the company by these individuals, will help us advance our growth
strategy for delivering next-generation entertainment over the
Internet and other broadcast mediums and to proceed with planned
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are Tim Helfet, president and chief executive
officer of Rysher Entertainment; Martin Schuermann, U.S.
representative of European producer CLT-UFA; Brent Cohen, formerly
president of Packard Bell NEC; and Barry Baeres, president of
German media group Intertainment Aktiengesellschaft.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant, which began selling its digitally animated Multipath
Movies in December, did not disclose how much each investor has
acquired but the prince has been given the right to a seat on its
board of directors. The prince, a member of Saudi Arabia's royal
family, previously held a controlling stake in Harvey Entertainment
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which signed a variety of significant distribution
and content partnerships, also announced Wednesday a
revenue-sharing pact with Home Benelux, a European joint-venture of
Internet-cable specialist Home Network. It reiterated an
announcement that it is in talks for an acquisition of an
undisclosed entity.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant performed respectably on Wall Street after it went
public in November 1996 with a $10 million offering at $5 a share,
as the stock topped $9 in less than a year. But investors began
losing patience after Packard Bell NEC decided to not install the
movies on its lower-cost personal computers and the issue descended
under $2 during the latter part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have apparently regained confidence in the long-term
promise of the company. The stock price gain came despite Brilliant
announcing a first-quarter loss of $1.89 million on revenues of
just $206,000. That followed a loss of $9.43 million on revenues of
$431,000 for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said filings prior to Wednesday's deal show Dyne and
Kevin Bermeister each holding 8.5 percent stakes. Packard Bell NEC
has warrants amounting to an 8 percent stake while Insiger Group of
Ireland owns 12.8 percent and Sega Ozisoft of Australia owns 8
percent.

BRYANT FRUSTRATES PIPPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kobe Bryant, impetuous youth that he is, waits for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the NBA, which he entered at age 18. Not for
responsibility, which he embraced when he took the final shots, as
a rookie, in the Lakers' 1997 playoff loss to Utah. Not for a
starting job, which he forcibly took this season at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that Bryant demanded to guard
the great Scottie Pippen in the Lakers' playoff series with the
Houston Rockets. Bryant knows what he wants, and more often than
not, he gets it.
</P>
<P>
   That trait is serving him and his team well at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are up two games to none in this best-of-five series,
and at the core of their success is stifling defense. And at the
core of that defense is Bryant, shutting down one of the 50
greatest players in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what,'' said Lakers veteran Derek Harper, ``that's
the key to the series. What he's done in this series against
(Pippen). Because he's truly taken Scottie out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In two games, Pippen has made 5 of 20 field goals, is averaging
8.5 points and 3.0 turnovers and has been almost invisible on the
court. That's a far cry from his 18.1-point career average in 11
postseasons, during which he won six championships with Michael
Jordan's Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   To be certain, Pippen is a less active part of the Rockets
offense than he was in Chicago. But there's no mistaking that
Bryant is blossoming as a defender at the expense of one of his
role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that Pippen was the second-best player in the
world, because of everything that he brings to the table and how he
does it,'' said Bryant, who grew up watching the 12-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, too, that Bryant patterned much of his own defensive
style on what he observed in Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always admired him for his defensive effort,'' he said.
``Everybody always talked about Mike (Jordan) and how great he was.
Pippen, to me, was always the key to the team, because of all the
little things that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's admiration of Pippen, and the desire to challenge
himself against the best, led him to strike a deal with coach Kurt
Rambis. Two weeks ago, late in a Lakers rout of Portland, Bryant
wanted to get back in the game. Rambis said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's fine, man. You give me Scottie,' '' Bryant
said. ``So it was a nice little tradeoff. I was more than happy to
sit on the bench for the remainder of that game.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Rambis could only laugh. The conversation did take
place, but the coaches had already decided Bryant would get the
assignment, switching with Glen Rice, who shifted to covering the
shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kobe can be a defensive stopper for our team,'' Rambis
said. ``I think he's done a pretty good job on Pippen, I think he's
putting a maximum effort into it, I think he's taking the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rambis is quick to point out that Houston's
offense is going through Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt about Bryant's ability now to dominate
both ends of the court. He entered the league in 1996 as a flashy
18-year-old with ankle-breaking moves and made-for-SportsCenter
dunks. Always the student, Bryant has not settled for being a
20-point scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, drafted the same year as Bryant, noticed his
dedication to defense starting in last year's playoffs. At the
time, Pippen was shutting down Indiana Pacers point guard Mark
Jackson, and it was the talk of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something that Kobe took notice to,'' Fisher said,
``and I believe he started to really want to become a better
defender, not necessarily because of that, but I believe he saw how
a guy like Scottie Pippen, at his size, could affect a game
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bryant started asking to guard Lakers point guards in
practice to hone his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Then on opening night this season, inserted out of necessity
into the starting lineup against Houston, Bryant took on Pippen,
and the world saw the first indication that Bryant was no
one-dimensional star. He outscored Pippen 25-10 and held him to
4-of-18 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant had a long ways to go as an NBA defender, which was
clear when he moved to shooting guard at midseason and struggled to
slow the likes of Cleveland's Wesley Person and Philadelphia's
Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   So he listened to veterans like Harper, he learned, he worked.
And improved immeasurably by season's end, finishing with 1.44
steals per game, fourth best among the league's top off-guards.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, veteran of 16 seasons and twice named to the
all-defensive second team, said Bryant has the ability _ and the
desire _ to be a first-teamer. Rambis agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``Kobe has taken all of the
constructive criticism that we've been giving him all year long and
used it. He wants to be the best basketball player possible. . . .
But he, like our team, hasn't even begun to play his best
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he'd like to have a reputation like Jordan's, as a
complete player, though he realizes his offensive pyrotechnics will
prevent most people from recognizing his defense. For now, he's
just soaking up the moment, relishing every trip up the court
against Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, it's challenging. Plus you learn a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And all the more satisfying because of who he's shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying to you,'' he said, ``if I said it didn't taste
good.''

FOR CAL RIPKEN, THE LAST HURDLE IS THE TOUGHEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, John Elway . . . Cal Ripken?
</P>
<P>
   No, Ripken said, he is not ready to join those other great
athletes in retirement, but their retirement has caught his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be faced with retirement; you're going to be
faced with the same issue,'' the baseball member of that renowned
quartet said. ``It'd be great to sit down with those guys and
compare notes about some of the feelings you had leading up to it.
Ultimately what helped them make their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 38 and saddled with a chronic back condition that
put him on the disabled list for the first time in his 18-year
career, Ripken may be forced to make his decision sooner rather
than later. But now is not the time, he said. Now is the time to
find out what a physically and mentally healthy Ripken can do for
the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by a two-game minor-league rehabilitation assignment,
Ripken stands poised to begin playing in the major leagues again.
He will rejoin the Orioles in Texas, eager to show the skeptics
that the Cal Ripken they saw in his first eight games of the
season, the one who batted .179 and made five errors, is not the
one they will see from here on.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the popular feeling in baseball circles is that
Ripken is nearing the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what you're picking up, everybody thinks he's just about
done,'' said one general manager, who like the others asked for
their assessment spoke on the condition that they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's on his last legs,'' another major league
executive said. ``As a productive player I don't think he has
anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no 38-year-old player can perform the way he did as a
young man, and another general manager warned that Ripken has been
written off before and ``he's come back and played well.'' He
remains strong-willed, determined and focused, and he may be able
to get by on his experience and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ripken faces a significant physical hurdle. His condition
has been diagnosed as stenosis, or narrowing, of the spinal canal.
The pain that became the most disabling injury of his career
stemmed from a bone spur growing in the canal and irritating the
spinal cord. If the problem recurs, Ripken could need surgery,
which could end his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the injury is thrown in there and you're faced with that,
then all of a sudden your future becomes a little bit more
uncertain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has the rest of the season to see how he progresses
physically, and determine if he wants to or can continue playing.
The Orioles don't have that luxury. They have two months to make a
critical decision. Ripken's contract has an option for next season
at a $6.3 million salary, and the Orioles must act on the option no
later than the All-Star Game, which is July 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have Ryan Minor, their third baseman of the future,
waiting, but if they exercise the option rather than pay Ripken a
$2.5 million buyout, the Orioles, in effect, will commit themselves
not only to pay Ripken's salary but also to play him next season.
Some general managers believe they will exercise the option, but
only with the idea of paying Ripken for past services. However, no
talks have been held on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't gotten into that,'' Frank Wren, the Orioles'
general manager, said Tuesday. ``That will be a big decision, one
we're not going to take lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ripken's mind, retirement talk is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on a fair evaluation of my skills and my health prior to
the season, I thought I could count on a couple years,'' he said
one day last week, sitting in the dugout at Camden Yards. ``You
don't know until you actually do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring Ripken suffered a double blow in a short
period. His father, Cal Sr., died of lung cancer, and he had the
back injury. The combination, he said, contributed to his poor
performance in the early games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to arm yourself with your tools and go out there and
find out,'' he said, discussing the ability that might remain.
``Then you'll know yourself. You're being judged in front of all
these people, but nobody can make that judgment except you. A lot
of people have opinions. They think you should do it; they think
you shouldn't do it. But you're the one who has the expertise, and
you're the one who will ultimately make the judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken indicated that his chances of reaching 3,000 hits _ only
21 players have done it _ will not influence his decision. A
routine season would easily have catapulted him onto that plateau,
but in mid-May having only 5 hits of the 122 he needed does not a
routine season make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers I look at now are pretty remarkable in my own
judgment,'' he said. ``I say I did all that and I'm still playing?
So I'm very satisfied with what has gone on. I've never had that
feeling that I had to get to 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, he added, will end up where they end up, and he
won't look back with regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran into a lot of players toward the end of their careers
and I would ask do you have any regrets,'' Ripken said. ``Most of
them said I wish I would have taken care of myself better, I wish I
had played more, I wish I had taken it more seriously. Those are
the three things I definitely will not say when I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly does not need that credential to be elected to the
Hall of Fame. Another number, 2,632, will be recommendation enough.
That was the record number of games he played consecutively, of
course; it is the streak for which he will be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was proud of the streak, Ripken said: ``I'm proud of
what the streak symbolizes. Nobody can win a game by himself. You
rely on your teammates. The thing about playing every single day is
your teammates can count on you to be there. I feel extremely proud
that my teammates can count on me to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   How much longer they will be able to do that is the question of
the moment. When Ripken talked about Jordan, Gretzky and Elway, he
said he did not feel sad for them, that their careers were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sad for me, for the people that watch them,'' he said.
``I've thoroughly enjoyed watching them play. They've been able to
live their lives as full in their sports as they can. Everybody
should be envious of that. It's sad for the people who enjoyed
their talent and won't be able to see them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he feel flattered if, after he retires, people told him
they were sad? ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``What that would mean is
you did your hard work, your dedication, your perseverance, your
passion for the sport and you made an impression and somebody liked
watching you do what you do. That is one of the highest forms of
flattery.''  &QL;

ETHICS LAPSES AT DUKE HALT DOZENS OF HUMAN EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS with SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Dozens of human experiments at Duke University
came to a halt Wednesday, surprising many members of the medical
staff as they arrived on a warm and flowering spring morning at the
huge medical center here.
</P>
<P>
   Duke on Tuesday became the third major research institution in
six months to have its research halted because of failure to meet
federal ethical rules. And Wednesday, the Office for Protection
from Research Risks, the agency that suspended the research,
expressed concern about another experiment last summer in which a
volunteer was injured.
</P>
<P>
   In that experiment, a volunteer briefly lost consciousness
during a space walk simulation at the university, prompting NASA,
which paid for the research, to suspend the study for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent ethics review, a copy of which was provided to The
New York Times by NASA, raised serious questions about whether the
study subjects were adequately informed of the risks. ``We
investigated the protocols, procedures and we took corrective
actions,'' said Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, NASA's associate
administrator in charge of life sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. John Faletta, a pediatrician and chief of
the institutional review board that oversees the safety and ethics
of each human experiment proposed at Duke, said he did not know
that the volunteer's injury was supposed to have been reported to
the Office for Protection from Research Risks.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's director, Dr. Gary Ellis, said Wednesday that
the reporting is required and described the omission as ``a serious
breach.'' Ellis said he had not been aware of it when the shutdown
was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of revelation is consistent with the picture of
human subjects protection at Duke University Medical Center that
OPRR has pieced together through the last five months,'' Ellis
said. His office's decision to suspend Duke's federal license to
conduct medical research is only the fourth such move by the
government in nearly a decade. While Ellis cited a wide variety of
oversight lapses in experiments on human subjects, Duke officials
have characterized the problems as mostly administrative.
</P>
<P>
   The violations at Duke come at a time when there is a huge
increase in the number of experiments that need to be monitored, at
the same time universities are under strong budget pressure. As a
result, many universities have found themselves without the proper
manpower to thoroughly review each of the hundreds to thousands of
experiments conducted every year.
</P>
<P>
   In American research with human subjects, studies are proposed
by scientists and reviewed for safety and ethics at the university
or medical center by an institutional review board. The work of the
review boards is guided by federal regulations that define what
risks human may be subjected to and what kind of consent must be
obtained from the subjects, and what factors the boards must
consider in approving experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Protection from Research Risks is the federal
watchdog agency that checks up on human experiments and oversees
work of the review boards. But it has the equivalent of only three
investigators to cover the tens of thousands of experiments in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   At Duke alone, some 2,000 clinical experiments are being
conducted. Wednesday, all experiments stopped accepting new
patients, and each of the 2,000 experiments was being reviewed to
determine whether it should be halted altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said that all experiments should be halted
unless they were giving significant therapeutic benefits to
patients during the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Snyderman, the chief operating officer of the Duke
University Medical Center, said he did not yet know just how many
experiments would be stopped temporarily. Instead, he was working
to try to get the federal order reversed. He is to meet Thursday in
Maryland with officials of the the federal protection office.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman said he would present a report to the office that
hoped would get the suspension lifted. He said the report would say
that the medical center was moving quickly to meet all the
potential violations of federal ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman said the problems cited at Duke are not just paperwork
or housekeeping. ``There was a serious misunderstanding on our part
of what they wanted and how fast they wanted us to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and NASA officials emphasized Wednesday that the injury
during the space simulation experiment was not connected to the
government shutdown. But Ellis said that, in his mind, it ``raises
a concern about the possible nonreporting of other unanticipated
problems at the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured man, who suffered a severe case of decompression
sickness, known as the bends, was in his 30s; his identity was not
disclosed. He signed up for a research experiment at the Center for
Hyperbaric Medicine and Environmental Physiology, an arm of the
Duke medical center.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which is also being conducted at two other
medical centers, one in Houston and another in Canada, is designed
to determine how much oxygen an astronaut would have to breathe
prior to taking a space walk, according to Dr. Richard Vann, the
principal investigator of the study at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Vann said the study subject had been
inside a hypobaric chamber, designed to simulate a space suit, for
two hours at a pressure equivalent to 30,000 feet above sea level
when he began to experience numbness and tingling in his legs. The
researchers took the man out of the chamber and treated him with
pure oxygen and he improved, but after the treatment he became
``briefly semiconscious,'' Vann said. He was treated again, and
then hospitalized overnight for observation, and has fully
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Decompression sickness occurs when nitrogen bubbles enter the
tissue and the bloodstream, causing a number of different symptoms,
usually mild joint pain., ``This was atypical in that he had
symptoms in his brain,'' Vann said. He said experts did not know
what caused the reaction, but that it was reported immediately to
the Duke Institutional Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Vann described the incident as an ``unusually serious incident
of decompression,'' and said it was rare and unexpected. After it
occurred, NASA decided to stop the experiments at all three centers
and conduct a review of the study. In the report, a panel of
ethicists raised ``very serious'' concerns about the research,
including questions about whether it was adequately reviewed before
it began and whether the subjects were properly informed of the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The study resumed in January, with new informed consent forms
and additional physical screening, including lung function tests,
for the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said the investigation at Duke began last year when he and
and his staff began talking about the institutional review boards
at the 15 research universities that receive the most federal
money. Typically, these panels have frequent contact with Ellis'
agency, which oversees them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the staff, can you vouch for these 15?'' he said,
adding, ``In 14 of the 15 institutions, the staff had had regular
contact.'' The fifteenth was Duke.
</P>
<P>
   So investigators scheduled a site visit for last December. They
cited a litany of problems, from questions about whether a quorum
was present when the panel passed judgment on medical experiments
to an apparent conflict of interest: one of the members voting on
the ethics of research was the Duke official responsible for
securing the grant money paying for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also found that, despite special requirements
to protect children involved in research, there was no evidence
that the review board had given any special consideration to
studies involving youngsters. And they found that the review panel
members were overwhelmed with work.
</P>
<P>
   The research protection agency asked Duke to take a number of
steps to correct the problems. But, Ellis said, ``their plans and
progress were simply inadequate,'' and so he decided to shut down
all federally-sponsored research programs at the university.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the collision between federal investigators and
the Duke research system, Faletta, the head of the Duke IRB and the
person who worked most with OPRR since the investigation began in
December, 1998, said he believed that the sense of urgency to
correct the problems at Duke did not hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably guilty of not being as articulate as I should
have been to the top administration at Duke; in pointing out the
need for change here,'' he said. His attempts to alert top
management at Duke went astray, because ``they were clearly not
attended to, and were not attended to because, I suspect, of
competing priorities.''

 &HT;    Braves fall to ex-teammate, drop second series in row
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It came in a different setting _ wind-blown on
the California coast _ but this was a familiar foe.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock joined Paul Byrd and Jason Schmidt as ex-Braves to
beat their former team this season. Brock pitched 5.1 scoreless
innings in a 5-1 Giants win on Wednesday, struck out a career-high
six batters and brought the Braves' record against starters who are
former teammates to 3-4 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(San Francisco manager Dusty Baker) told me not to get too
excited, not to try to do anything I couldn't do,'' said Brock, who
was a question mark to start after battling the stomach flu on
Tuesday. ``Just pitch my game and that's what I tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock frustrated the Braves because he allowed eight baserunners
but none scored. Atlanta had seven hits off Brock and his fellow
Giant pitchers and drew eight walks, but left 13 runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little bit of a sneaky fastball,'' said Braves
second baseman Bret Boone, whose career-long 14-game hitting streak
ended with an 0-for-3 day, including two strikeouts against Brock.
``Not that hard but he got some misses. He must have been doing
something right. He held us to what four hits? We've got to get
back to playing the way we were playing. We're in a little bit of a
lull.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have lost back-to-back series, after starting this
road trip without a series loss on the season. This was first time
they'd lost a series to the Giants since July of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brock spent most of six years pitching as a starter in the
Braves' minor-league organization but never made a lasting
impression on the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody made a big deal about it, but I'm more excited about
being in this rotation every fifth day,'' Brock said. ``I don't
have any problems with that team. They just didn't have any spots
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock gave up back-to-back walks to open the game but made his
statement for the game by striking out the heart of the Atlanta
order to end the inning. Ryan Klesko prevented a second shutout of
the season _ and second in four days _ with a solo homer in the
eighth inning.

 &HT;    Adjusting hitting stance aids C. Jones
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chipper Jones' performance Tuesday night was
significant in a couple of ways. First, it was his hit that started
the Braves' 12th-inning rally and his run that scored on the
ensuing single from Andruw Jones to give the Braves their 9-8
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it was confirmation that some of the adjustments he made
in his swing in batting practice before Tuesday's game were paying
off. Jones, who had been struggling from the left side, said his
front leg had been collapsing, causing him to hit weak ground
balls. So with a little work in the cage, Jones was back out making
good contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was encouraging,'' said Jones, who finished the game with
two hits, two runs scored and one RBI. ``I hit the ball hard five
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He also decided to wear clear glasses _ as many of the Giants do
_ to help battle the wind. Jones, Andruw Jones and Brian Jordan all
wore them on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Monday night) it was unbearable, trying to hit Robb Nen with
your eyes watering,'' Jones said. ``It's a tremendous disadvantage
to have the wind blowing in your eyes when you're trying to focus
on something 60 feet away for 10 seconds. That's why you see guys
stepping out (of the batter's box) all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Double dose
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that this umpiring crew and the Braves are
not seeing eye to eye.
</P>
<P>
   Both manager Bobby Cox and Jordan spent the better part of
Tuesday night's game in the clubhouse _ Cox was ejected in the
first inning for throwing up his arms in reaction to a balk call.
He still was upset over a strike call on a checked swing. Jordan
was ejected four innings later after a confrontation with home
plate umpire Bruce Dreckman.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had been thrown out in the fifth inning on Monday night for
arguing a call on the basepaths. Cox has seen only six of the first
21 innings of the first two games of this series. He'll pay the
National League several hundred dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged it off Wednesday morning and promised to keep quiet
in the dugout for Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty warm in here, boys,'' Cox said laughing, as his
coaches complained about Tuesday night's wind and cold.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jordan's third ejection of his career. He said he was
upset because Dreckman stared him down a half-inning after his
complaint over a strike call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd made a little comment to him and it's over,'' Jordan said.
``Then I'm going out on the field, and he's staring me down. That's
(showing me) disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   O. Perez after the fact
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Odalis Perez's nine-day layoff between starts did not
play a factor in his poor outing Tuesday night, when he gave up six
runs in the first inning to become the first Braves starter to do
that since Steve Avery in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls down the middle, location _ he got hit,'' Cox said.
``Just like their guy.'' The Giants' Shawn Estes gave up four runs
in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has had two poor starts in L.A. and San Francisco after
getting skipped in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do my best; I was keeping the ball up, and
they were hitting it,'' said Perez, whose ERA climbed from 3.70 to
5.46. ``Ten days without pitching, it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was rescued by some good relief pitching; the bullpen
pitched 8 1/3 innings and gave up one run. Rudy Seanez walked in
the only run, and later said the windy conditions bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get a good release point (on my breaking ball),''
Seanez said. ``But after that, instead of being down, we were fired
up, that we still had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Speier pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings; Mike Remlinger
was charged with the one run on his two walks; Kevin McGlinchy
pitched three scoreless innings, and John Rocker dominated in the
11th and 12th to pick up his second victory.
</P>
<P>
   Matos debut
</P>
<P>
   Pascual Matos, called up as a backup catcher in Javy Lopez's
absence, made his major-league debut on Tuesday night as a pinch
hitter to lead off the 11th inning and struck out against Felix
Rodriguez. ``I felt OK in that situation,'' Matos said. ``I was a
little nervous. . . . I was looking for a slider, and he threw me a
fastball.

 &HT;    Leagues ending with flourish
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Manchester United drew a step closer to its fifth
English Premier League title of the 1990s in a scoreless draw with
lowly Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday, but also left the door open _
albeit slightly _ for defending champion Arsenal to reclaim the
crown.
</P>
<P>
   United picked up a point to go to 76 on the season, one more
than Arsenal, which stumbled in a 1-0 loss to Leeds on Tuesday. The
Red Devils can clinch with a win at home Sunday in the season
finale against Tottenham Hotspur. The best-case scenario for
Arsenal is to beat Aston Villa at home and hope for a United loss
or tie. Wednesday's result also relegates Blackburn, the 1995
champion, into the first division next season.
</P>
<P>
   The top five leagues in Europe are winding down with a flourish.
Bayern Munich wrapped up its 15th Bundesliga title Sunday and
Barcelona is closing in on the Primera Division crown in Spain, but
competition for Champions' League spots in both countries is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Lazio and AC Milan continue their winning ways, with
only a point separating them at the top of Serie A with two games
to go. Lazio has the tougher schedule, in league and out. After
playing at Fiorentina on Saturday, the Rome club meets Mallorca
next Wednesday in the Cup Winners' Cup final in Birmingham,
England. AC Milan has no such distractions, being out of Europe,
and on Saturday hosts relegated Empoli.
</P>
<P>
   Mallorca jumped into second place in Spain last weekend but must
play all three teams chasing it for automatic Champions' League
qualification _ Celta Vigo, Valencia and Real Madrid. Hertha
Berlin, Borussia Dortmund and FC Kaiserslautern are in contention
for the last two places from Germany after Bayer Leverkusen nailed
down second.
</P>
<P>
   Olympique Marseille can concentrate on its French first-division
title hopes after losing 3-0 to Parma on Wednesday in the finals of
the UEFA Cup in Moscow. Hernan Crespo and Paolo Vanoli scored
within 10 minutes of each other in the first half, and Enrico
Chiesa got a goal 10 minutes after halftime. Marseille, which
trails Girondins Bordeaux by a point with two weeks left in the
season, will get back four regulars who sat out the UEFA final
because of suspensions. Parma won its second UEFA Cup title in four
years; it was the eighth time an Italian team has won the
competition in the last 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   England: $1 million for Keegan
</P>
<P>
   Interim England manager Kevin Keegan, who initially said he
would remain loyal to second-division Fulham, is ready to sign a
deal with the Football Association worth an estimated $1 million a
year. Fulham president Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrod's
department store, reportedly will be seeking $816,000 in
compensation. ... Bradford City qualified for the English Premier
League with a 3-2 win Sunday over the Wolverhampton Wanderers and
will be returning to the top flight for the first time since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Inter Milan president resigns
</P>
<P>
   Inter Milan President Massimo Moratti, who has a 70 percent
stake in the club, resigned last week. Even though Moratti has gone
through four managers this season, Inter did not qualify for
Europe. Watch for a major roster overhaul with the exception of
Ronaldo, who said he wants to stay. ... Juventus midfielder
Zinedine Zidane underwent season-ending knee surgery Wednesday and
will miss France's next two Euro 2000 qualifying matches. He is
expected to return fully by August.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Playoffs begin
</P>
<P>
   A goal by Carlos Hermosillo on Sunday sent Necaxa into the
Mexican Torneo Verano playoffs that begin later this week. Necaxa,
which tied Tigres 1-1, joins Cruz Azul, Guadalajara, America,
Morelia, Atlas and either Santos or UAG in chasing favored Toluca,
which has the league's top goal-scorers. Jose Manuel Abundis and
Jose Saturnino Cardozo each collected 14 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Africa: 2006 bids withdrawn
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has followed Ghana and Egypt in pulling out of the
bidding for the 2006 World Cup to improve South Africa's chances,
but Morocco will stay in the hunt. FIFA boss Sepp Blatter favors
sending the event to Africa for the first time. England, Germany
and Brazil also have submitted bids. A decision will be made early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Stadium unveiling on tape
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest events in the young history of Major League
Soccer won't be seen on live television because of the Stanley Cup
playoffs. ESPN2 has bumped its airing of Saturday night's
Columbus-New England game, which marks the opening of the Columbus
Crew Stadium, to an 11 p.m. tape-delay slot. The stadium is the
first major facility built specifically for soccer in the United
States in 77 years. ... The Crew will be missing U.S. national team
striker Brian McBride, who is out three to six weeks with a
fractured cheekbone. ... Kansas City, which won its first game of
the season last week, has scored just four goals. Two of them have
come from defender Alexi Lalas, an unlikely scoring source if there
ever was one.

PROSECUTION WITNESS PIERCES `BLUE WALL OF SILENCE'
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prosecutors called their next witness. Detective
Eric S. Turetzky entered the courtroom, an FBI agent at his side,
and nodded at the five defendants, all fellow New York City police
officers, who knew that what he was about to say might help send
them to prison for years.
</P>
<P>
   They did not return the greeting.
</P>
<P>
   The primary defendant, Officer Justin A. Volpe, the man accused
of thrusting a stick into the rectum of a handcuffed suspect,
smirked and shook his head as Turetzky raised his hand and swore to
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky, 28, a thin, angular man with a narrow face, protruding
ears and a long mustache, had a pen neatly tucked away in his shirt
pocket. As he began his testimony, his responses were clear, crisp,
confident _ all business, all routine.
</P>
<P>
   But within 30 minutes, it was clear that Turetzky's appearance
Wednesday was more than just an electric moment in a sensational
case. It also marked a historic chapter for a Police Department
with a long record of ostracizing and mistreating officers who
report wrongdoing by their brethren.
</P>
<P>
   To his friends and family, Turetzky walked into the federal
court in Brooklyn to strike a blow against the ``blue wall of
silence.'' To them, he is an honest officer who could not close his
eyes to Abner Louima's pain and suffering, who felt compelled to
tell 12 jurors that Volpe walked through the 70th Precinct station
house after the alleged assault waving a broken stick ``like it was
a sword.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very proud of him,'' his grandmother, Anne
Rosenblum, 75, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support him for his courage and his honesty,'' said Sgt.
Eric Finkelstein, president of Shomrim, a society of Jewish police
officers to which Turetzky belongs. ``He told what he saw, and
that's what he's supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the defendants and their lawyers, Turetzky is an
opportunistic careerist. Marvyn M. Kornberg, a lawyer for Volpe,
made this clear as he began his cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detective Turetzky,'' Kornberg said, his voice loaded with
sarcasm. ``You have a gold shield now, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   And how quickly, Kornberg asked, was he promoted to detective
after he cooperated with Internal Affairs? ``Eighteen months.''
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokeswoman disputed any suggestion that
Turetzky's promotion was linked to his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Officer Cheryl Cox, said Turetzky was
transferred from his patrol job in the 70th Precinct to a position
in the Internal Affairs Bureau soon after the alleged assault in
August 1997. Under department rules, Cox said, Turetzky was
automatically entitled to his promotion, in March, after completing
18 months as an Internal Affairs investigator. He has not received
any commendations or disciplinary complaints since transferring,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Turetzky did not respond to requests for comment made
through his family, his friend, Finkelstein, said the detective
never coveted a job in Internal Affairs but was sent there to
protect ``the integrity'' of the Louima investigation. Indeed, in
the weeks after Turetzky first emerged as a witness, he was placed
under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's doing the police work he's wanted to
do,'' Finkelstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The detective's friends and relatives said they did not know of
any reprisals against him.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, though, it appeared unlikely that Turetzky would
escape this case unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Kornberg suggested to jurors that assignments
to Internal Affairs were reserved for officers of demonstrated
skill, experience and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about integrity,'' Kornberg said, starting a series
of questions about an incident early in Turetzky's career in which
he took a police motor scooter without authorization and then
crashed it. The detective acknowledged that he had failed to
mention this incident to his superiors in Internal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   This followed an even more troubling admission. The night Louima
was arrested outside a Brooklyn nightclub, Turetzky was among the
police officers sent to control the unruly club crowd. At one
point, the detective testified, a woman refused his order to move
on. Laughing, she told him that he would never arrest her because
she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The detective recalled his ``foolish'' response: ``Arrest you?
I'll kick you in the stomach. Just move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers did not get a chance before day's end to
question Turetzky about this remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's your hero cop _ threatening to kick a pregnant woman
in the stomach,'' said Robert Volpe, the defendant's father.

DAVIS TO LEAVE UCLA FOR NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What was possible six months ago and probable two
months ago became official Wednesday, when UCLA sophomore guard
Baron Davis declared himself eligible for next month's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has always been a dream,'' Davis said. ``One of my
dreams was to win a national championship. It hurts my heart to
leave that behind, but the NBA's there, and it's calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his grandmother, Lela Nicholson, his sister, Lissa
Davis, and Bruins coach Steve Lavin, Davis told a large gathering
inside UCLA's Morgan Center that he struggled with the decision
until early this week.
</P>
<P>
   However, sources close to Davis said the unofficial decision
came months ago, in midseason, with his surgically reconstructed
left knee the only possible obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Davis came through with a dazzling stretch run that culminated
against Washington in the home finale, when he waved goodbye to the
crowd in the final seconds. He was named third-team All-American,
averaged 15.9 points and 5.1 assists, and delighted NBA scouts with
his energy, athleticism and skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus among the (NBA) people I talked to was Baron
could go as high as second (in the draft) and probably no lower
than sixth,'' Lavin said. ``I wouldn't want to be the general
manager that passes on him.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be a top-five pick next month, he'll become a millionaire
this summer, and he could land in Los Angeles. Both the Clippers
(through the draft) and the Lakers (through a trade) want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play for the Clips,'' he said. ``You all can get
tickets, you all can be at the games. As long as I'm there (in the
NBA), it doesn't matter where.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' departure leaves the sophomore-dominated Bruins with a
difficult schedule _ DePaul, Purdue, Gonzaga, Syracuse, North
Carolina _ and no proven point guard. Juniors Earl Watson and Ryan
Bailey will run the club, but neither has Davis' size and skill.
They're best-suited to a half-court attack, not the frenetic,
94-foot chaos Davis orchestrated last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' decision was no surprise to his teammates, who were
hoping for a return but anticipating a goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron had to do what was best for Baron, and the timing was
right,'' Bruins forward Sean Farnham said. ``If you can be a
lottery pick, the money's too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: The Bruins are close to signing Spencer
Gloger, a wing player from Santa Margarita High School.
</P>
<P>
   They also have emerged as a finalist for Artesia High forward
Jason Kapono, who was on campus Wednesday and attended Davis' press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two transfers, Duke center/forward Chris Burgess
and Oklahoma forward Ryan Humphrey, are considering UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our recruiting emphasis is on frontcourt depth and
shooters to complement our inside players,'' Lavin said.

ETHICS LAPSES AT DUKE HALT DOZENS OF HUMAN EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for shift in emphasis, replacing original 2nd graf with 3 new
grafs, for details on the halting of experiments previously in
original 11th and 12 grafs, which are now removed) (bl) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS with SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Dozens of human experiments at Duke University
came to a halt Wednesday, surprising many members of the medical
staff as they arrived on a warm and flowering spring morning at the
huge medical center here.
</P>
<P>
   Duke on Tuesday became the third major research institution in
six months to have its federally financed research halted because
of failure to meet federal ethical rules. Most of the medical
center's 2,000 experiments involving humans r is federally
financed. The center voluntarily halted enrollment in privately
financed research. Each of the 2,000 experiments are to be reviewed
by the medical center and federal investigators to see if patients
currently enrolled in both types of experiments should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said all experiments should be halted
unless they were currently giving significant therapeutic benefits
to patients. Although the announcements were made Tuesday, many
staff members did not learn of them until Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Thursday, the Office for Protection from
Research Risks, the agency that suspended the research, expressed
concern about another experiment last summer in which a volunteer
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   In that experiment, a volunteer briefly lost consciousness
during a space walk simulation at the university, prompting NASA,
which paid for the research, to suspend the study for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent ethics review, a copy of which was provided to The
New York Times by NASA, raised serious questions about whether the
study subjects were adequately informed of the risks. ``We
investigated the protocols, procedures and we took corrective
actions,'' said Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, NASA's associate
administrator in charge of life sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. John Faletta, a pediatrician and chief of
the institutional review board that oversees the safety and ethics
of each human experiment proposed at Duke, said he did not know
that the volunteer's injury was supposed to have been reported to
the Office for Protection from Research Risks.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's director, Dr. Gary Ellis, said Wednesday that
the reporting is required and described the omission as ``a serious
breach.'' Ellis said he had not been aware of it when the shutdown
was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of revelation is consistent with the picture of
human subjects protection at Duke University Medical Center that
OPRR has pieced together through the last five months,'' Ellis
said. His office's decision to suspend Duke's federal license to
conduct medical research is only the fourth such move by the
government in nearly a decade. While Ellis cited a wide variety of
oversight lapses in experiments on human subjects, Duke officials
have characterized the problems as mostly administrative.
</P>
<P>
   The violations at Duke come at a time when there is a huge
increase in the number of experiments that need to be monitored, at
the same time universities are under strong budget pressure. As a
result, many universities have found themselves without the proper
manpower to thoroughly review each of the hundreds to thousands of
experiments conducted every year.
</P>
<P>
   In American research with human subjects, studies are proposed
by scientists and reviewed for safety and ethics at the university
or medical center by an institutional review board. The work of the
review boards is guided by federal regulations that define what
risks human may be subjected to and what kind of consent must be
obtained from the subjects, and what factors the boards must
consider in approving experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Protection from Research Risks is the federal
watchdog agency that checks up on human experiments and oversees
work of the review boards. But it has the equivalent of only three
investigators to cover the tens of thousands of experiments in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Snyderman, the chief operating officer of the Duke
University Medical Center, said he did not yet know just how many
experiments would be stopped temporarily. Instead, he was working
to try to get the federal order reversed. He is to meet Thursday in
Maryland with officials of the the federal protection office.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman said he would present a report to the office that
hoped would get the suspension lifted. He said the report would say
that the medical center was moving quickly to meet all the
potential violations of federal ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Snyderman said the problems cited at Duke are not just paperwork
or housekeeping. ``There was a serious misunderstanding on our part
of what they wanted and how fast they wanted us to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and NASA officials emphasized Wednesday that the injury
during the space simulation experiment was not connected to the
government shutdown. But Ellis said that, in his mind, it ``raises
a concern about the possible nonreporting of other unanticipated
problems at the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured man, who suffered a severe case of decompression
sickness, known as the bends, was in his 30s; his identity was not
disclosed. He signed up for a research experiment at the Center for
Hyperbaric Medicine and Environmental Physiology, an arm of the
Duke medical center.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which is also being conducted at two other
medical centers, one in Houston and another in Canada, is designed
to determine how much oxygen an astronaut would have to breathe
prior to taking a space walk, according to Dr. Richard Vann, the
principal investigator of the study at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Vann said the study subject had been
inside a hypobaric chamber, designed to simulate a space suit, for
two hours at a pressure equivalent to 30,000 feet above sea level
when he began to experience numbness and tingling in his legs. The
researchers took the man out of the chamber and treated him with
pure oxygen and he improved, but after the treatment he became
``briefly semiconscious,'' Vann said. He was treated again, and
then hospitalized overnight for observation, and has fully
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Decompression sickness occurs when nitrogen bubbles enter the
tissue and the bloodstream, causing a number of different symptoms,
usually mild joint pain., ``This was atypical in that he had
symptoms in his brain,'' Vann said. He said experts did not know
what caused the reaction, but that it was reported immediately to
the Duke Institutional Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Vann described the incident as an ``unusually serious incident
of decompression,'' and said it was rare and unexpected. After it
occurred, NASA decided to stop the experiments at all three centers
and conduct a review of the study. In the report, a panel of
ethicists raised ``very serious'' concerns about the research,
including questions about whether it was adequately reviewed before
it began and whether the subjects were properly informed of the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The study resumed in January, with new informed consent forms
and additional physical screening, including lung function tests,
for the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said the investigation at Duke began last year when he and
and his staff began talking about the institutional review boards
at the 15 research universities that receive the most federal
money. Typically, these panels have frequent contact with Ellis'
agency, which oversees them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the staff, can you vouch for these 15?'' he said,
adding, ``In 14 of the 15 institutions, the staff had had regular
contact.'' The fifteenth was Duke.
</P>
<P>
   So investigators scheduled a site visit for last December. They
cited a litany of problems, from questions about whether a quorum
was present when the panel passed judgment on medical experiments
to an apparent conflict of interest: one of the members voting on
the ethics of research was the Duke official responsible for
securing the grant money paying for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also found that, despite special requirements
to protect children involved in research, there was no evidence
that the review board had given any special consideration to
studies involving youngsters. And they found that the review panel
members were overwhelmed with work.
</P>
<P>
   The research protection agency asked Duke to take a number of
steps to correct the problems. But, Ellis said, ``their plans and
progress were simply inadequate,'' and so he decided to shut down
all federally-sponsored research programs at the university.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the collision between federal investigators and
the Duke research system, Faletta, the head of the Duke IRB and the
person who worked most with OPRR since the investigation began in
December, 1998, said he believed that the sense of urgency to
correct the problems at Duke did not hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably guilty of not being as articulate as I should
have been to the top administration at Duke; in pointing out the
need for change here,'' he said. His attempts to alert top
management at Duke went astray, because ``they were clearly not
attended to, and were not attended to because, I suspect, of
competing priorities.''

OFFICER TESTIFIES AGAINST HIS PEERS IN BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS lede to reflect that defense has questioned Turetzky's
honesty.) 
 (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first police officer said to have come forward
with information about the Abner Louima case provided a vivid
account Wednesday of the scene at a Brooklyn station house,
testifying that one of the officers on trial emerged, agitated and
brandishing a stick, from a restroom area where prosecutors say
Louima was brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing as one of the prosecution's most important witnesses,
Detective Eric Turetzky said Louima's pants were ``down below his
knees'' as Officer Justin Volpe, his uniform in disarray and
holding a stick nearly three feet long, escorted Louima from the
restroom area of the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, where
Turetzky was an officer at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe took Louima to a holding cell, and ``frowning and hunched
over,'' walked by other officers and began swinging the stick
``like it was a sword and hitting it against the wall,'' Turetzky
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just holding the stick and displaying it to us, waving
it in the air and banging it against the wall,'' Turetzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said that Turetzky broke what they feared
would be a blue wall of silence by being the first to come forward
with significant information against the officers suspected of
being involved in the August 1997 incident.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers are accused of violating Louima's civil rights by
beating him in a police car. Two of them _ Volpe and Charles
Schwarz _ are also accused of torturing Louima, a 32-year-old
Haitian immigrant, in the restroom by ramming the stick into his
rectum and then his mouth, inflicting severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky's statements Wednesday ended a day of testimony that
included the wrap-up of questioning of Louima, and the appearance
on the stand of a cousin of Louima who was at the scene outside a
Flatbush nightclub where Louima was arrested in a street brawl.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Turetzky said that Volpe did not speak to him
or to other officers after he came by waving the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was very unusual,'' because normally Volpe was
``very outgoing and usually, like, the center of attention,''
Turetzky, 28, said in brisk, steady tones in federal court in
Brooklyn, as Volpe and the other officer on trial watched him,
expressionless, from the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Turetzky said, he saw Volpe walked back toward
the restroom and toward some unused cells near it, and that when
Volpe returned, he no longer had the stick, which Turetzky
described as part of a broken broom or mop handle, dark green or
blue.
</P>
<P>
   The stick has not been found. Prosecutors say Volpe used it to
tear Louima's rectum and rupture his bladder, and that Louima
required two months in the hospital and three operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turetzky was not inside the restroom when Volpe
allegedly attacked Louima with the stick while Schwarz allegedly
held him down, his account places both officers with Louima around
the time of the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky also gave major testimony incriminating Schwarz, who,
like Volpe, denies that he took part in any assault on Louima in
the station house restroom or, as the prosecution also charges, in
a police car.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky said that he had seen Schwarz leading Louima to the
restroom area not long before he saw Volpe taking Louima away from
there.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at the time Schwarz was taking Louima toward the
restroom area, Louima appeared to be bleeding from his lip and
possibly from a second facial cut, and his pants were already
``down below his knees,'' where they had fallen while Schwarz had
searched him at the station house's main desk.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Louima's hands were cuffed behind him, Turetzky said
that Schwarz was raising the prisoner's ``rear-cuffed'' hands so
that Louima's arms were behind him in what Turetzky described as
``chicken wing fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Louima was tiptoeing and being shuffled along,'' the
witness told the jury under questioning by one of the prosecutors,
Loretta E. Lynch, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution says that the two other officers on trial,
Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, joined Volpe and Schwarz in beating
Louima in the patrol car between his arrest outside the nightclub
and the time he was brought into the 70th Precinct station house.
The prosecutors say that the officers mistakenly thought that
Louima had punched Volpe during the melee.
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, is also on trial, charged with
trying to cover up the alleged beating in the police car. The
officers and the sergeant all say that the charges against them are
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the late hour when Ms. Lynch ended her questioning of
Turetzky, Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, had time for
relatively few questions as he began his cross examination.
Kornberg suggested that Turetzky had been motivated by ambition to
give his account, noting that he had recently been promoted to
detective after only four years on the police force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among other police officers expected to testify as witnesses are
Officer Mark Schofield, who has reportedly told investigators that
on the morning of the alleged attack, he had lent Volpe a pair of
gloves that were returned to him soiled.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of his two and a half days on the witness
stand, Louima was cross-examined by Wiese's lawyer, Joseph
Tacopina, and Bellomo's, John Patten. They brought up various
discrepancies in the accounts Louima has given to federal and state
investigators since his encounter with the officers, and Patten
suggested that Louima had continued lying to investigators even as
he tried to undo a major lie that he has admitted to.
</P>
<P>
   The lie, he testified last week, had been his statement that
during the alleged attack, one of the officers had told him, ``It's
Giuliani time!''
</P>
<P>
   When he acknowledged the lie while on the witness stand last
week, he said the statement had not been made and that he had been
advised to say it by a supporter. But Wednesday Patten asked Louima
if he was aware that the supporter ``denies he told you about
`Giuliani time.' '' Louima repeated that the man had given him the
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Louima's cousin, Yves Nicholas, testified that he, not Louima,
had punched Volpe during the street brawl that began the chain of
events, saying he acted because he believed Volpe had pushed Louima
to the ground and was arresting him without justification.

WITH BETTE MIDLER'S AID, A RESCUE FOR GARDENS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day before the Giuliani administration was to
auction off city-owned lots that had been transformed into
community gardens, performer Bette Midler had her private
conservation organization agree to buy dozens of the less desirable
parcels, providing the final funding to preserve all 112 gardens
that were set for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-hour announcement ended a long-running dispute between
city officials who said the parcels were ripe for sale and
residents who viewed themselves as gardeners tending to verdant
oases in neighborhoods of concrete and steel. But the fate of more
than 600 other lots that were not part of the auction remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the $1.2 million purchase of 51 lots by the New
York Restoration Project _ arranged by a singer and actress better
known for her engaging flamboyance than for her diplomatic skills _
provided a vital piece in the city's negotiations with
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The offer cleared the way for another conservation group, the
Trust for Public Land, to buy the rest of the 112 parcels for $3
million, a figure that included an additional $1 million from Ms.
Midler's organization.
</P>
<P>
   According to the deal, the two organizations are to work out
plans to turn over the properties to the community groups that tend
to the gardens. If the properties are ever used for anything other
than gardens, ownership would revert to the city, said Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine, who helped in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' Ms. Midler said in a statement. ``This is a
joyous occasion and means that these gardens will stay in
perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for everybody,'' Levine said. ``The city gets
market value for these properties, which will go into the general
treasury to be used to enhance other city services. The gardens
will remain gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreements end, at least for now, what had become a daunting
public relations challenge for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his
aides, who were faced with demonstrations and acts of civil
disobedience by protesters often wearing colorful garb. No matter
how principled their stand, city officials learned, it can be
difficult to remain dignified when faced with an adversary dressed
as a sunflower or a ladybug or a tomato plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the central issue was not frivolous to any of the involved
parties. The administration contended that the city lots were
provided to neighborhoods two decades ago as part of a temporary
agreement, but should now be used for housing or economic
development or put up for sale. If the gardeners were interested,
the officials said, they could make a bid. But the
environmentalists saw the gardens as havens of green, often in the
city's poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the auction _ characterized by gardeners as
an act of aggression _ would not have taken place Wednesday anyway.
A judge in Brooklyn temporarily barred the auction, after lawyers
for several environmental groups and the state attorney general's
office had argued that the city had flouted various local and state
regulations in putting the properties up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   City officials had hoped that the purchase agreements would make
moot several lawsuits that have been filed by more than two dozen
environmental organizations and neighborhood groups seeking to
block the city's sale of the lots. In fact, the city initially
sought to make the sale to the Trust for Public Land contingent on
the end to the lawsuits, even though the trust was not a part of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the environmental groups vowed to continue their
legal battles, saying that they were concerned with the fate of
several hundred other community gardens throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was never a question of only saving a few
gardens,'' said Leslie Lowe, the executive director of the New York
City Environmental Justice Alliance. ``The issue is the city's lack
of policy on open space equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the gardens that were to be auctioned were in
neighborhoods of color,'' Ms. Lowe contended.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kassel, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense
Council who presented some of the environmentalists' arguments,
agreed that there were outstanding issues, and said ``We are going
to wait and see the details'' of the proposed sales ``before we pop
any champagne.''

COLUMN: ONE CLIENT NO ONE WANTS TO DEFEND: THE LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL, NY-LOUIMA-SCENE) 
 (nk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Abner Louima case has inspired diverse emotions,
but there is one feeling shared by New Yorkers of every race, class
and political persuasion. We all cringe at the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers defending the police officers charged with
brutalizing Louima suggested to the jury that Louima's internal
injuries resulted from homosexual sex, but they studiously avoided
giving Louima, a married father of two, a chance to address that
claim on the stand this week. Their other questions to him were so
aggressively boorish that they were repeatedly admonished by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   They further burnished their profession's image by accusing
Louima's former lawyers of inventing the lie he once told about a
police officer's telling him, during the alleged attack, that it
was ``Giuliani time.'' Completing the courtroom spectacle were
Louima's current lawyers, whose previous tactics in defense of O.J.
Simpson appalled so many people, and who are now rewarded with a
chance to make millions from Louima's civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is surprised by anything lawyers do. The
public expects even less of lawyers than of journalists. In a
Gallup/CNN/USA poll last October, only 14 percent of Americans gave
lawyers high marks for honesty and ethical standards, which ranked
them below every other category except insurance salesmen,
advertising practitioners and car salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers don't have such miserable reputations in other
countries, and they weren't always so reviled in the United States
either. Two decades ago, a Gallup poll rated them more honest than
most other professionals. What's changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``The public resents the money and power that lawyers have
gained,'' said Scott Turow, the criminal lawyer and best-selling
writer whose next novel is about a corrupt litigator. ``People now
march into the courtroom to resolve ethical and moral conflicts
that used to be decided in churches and schools and communities.
Cases like Louima's become forums for resolving social problems,
and when people are unhappy with the outcome, they blame the
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter K. Olson, a senior fellow at the Center for Legal Policy
at the Manhattan Institute, has analyzed several common hypotheses
for lawyers' unpopularity, starting with what he calls the dentist
theory: because lawyers are required to deal with disputes and
other unhappy situations, people associate lawyers, like dentists,
with pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the dentist theory is that dentists actually
aren't that unpopular,'' said Olson, the author of ``The Litigation
Explosion'' (1991). ``They do much better than lawyers in polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hypothesis is what Olson calls the bartender theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers say they have to behave badly because their clients
demand it,'' he said. ``According to this theory, criticizing
lawyers for the ugly tactics in the Simpson or the Louima cases is
like blaming a bartender for serving drinks to customers who are
falling off their stools. If he didn't do it, they'd just take
their business to another bar.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some truth to this theory, Olson believes, but it
doesn't explain the rising public anger with lawyers. He attributes
that anger chiefly to laws and procedures adopted since 1970 that
give lawyers new chances to sue and new weapons in court. President
Clinton's outrage at the questions he was forced to answer during
Paula Jones' sexual harassment case has been shared by countless
other Americans affected by new laws and liberalized discovery
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers have more power than ever to ruin your life,'' Olson
said. ``They can come up with the most fantastic excuses to sue.
They can make outrageous charges in court without worrying about
libel. They can bankrupt you with endless motions and depositions
and demands for files. There's no constraint on their
viciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in most other industrialized countries are constrained
by rules forcing the loser of a case to pay the other side's
expenses. America's lawyers have fought off attempts to impose a
loser-pays policy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you think of any other occupation with that kind of
immunity for mistakes?'' Olson said. ``If you're a lawyer, you can
cost someone a fortune and ruin their reputation and cause them
sleepless nights for five years. Then, when they finally prove they
never did anything wrong, you don't owe them anything. You can just
stroll away to look for someone else to pick on.''

SMART FINISH FOR USC'S KIPPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Few successful students use phrases like ``the
lowest moment in my life'' to describe their senior year of
college.
</P>
<P>
   But for Alaina Kipps, her senior season at USC took a disastrous
turn last September, when she landed awkwardly on a volleyball
court in Wisconsin and tore ligaments in her left knee.
</P>
<P>
   All of Kipps' plans for a wonderful conclusion to her college
career ended in a split-second. Eight months later, she still feels
some soreness in her knee, and bitterness over the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been injured before, not even my ankles,'' Kipps
said. ``I was depressed for all of the fall semester and a good
part of the spring semester.''
</P>
<P>
   But what began sadly is ending on a much higher note, as Kipps
was named USC valedictorian, the first female athlete in the
history of the university to win the honor. In 1981, Craig Furniss,
an All-American water polo player, was the first athlete named
valedictorian.
</P>
<P>
   Kipps, a psychobiology major, will deliver a speech during USC's
commencement ceremonies Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The honor is the culmination of a perfect four-year academic
record _ she never earned anything other than an A and graduates
with a 4.0 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come into USC thinking I could do that,'' Kipps said.
``But the stakes started to rise and I started to feel I could do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Kipps won the school's top academic honor
surprised some of those around her, because she rarely discusses
personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so subtle,'' said Lisa Love, the former USC women's
volleyball coach. ``A lot of people found out recently she did
this, or did that. She's close to the vest. You really don't know
that stuff about Alaina.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as the fact she has played the French horn since fifth
grade and was a member of USC's concert band. Or that she won a
fellowship last summer at an HIV research center for mothers and
children, where she explored ways to improve compliance levels for
HIV children reluctant to take their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Or that she has been accepted to Harvard Medical School, where
she will start in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my family, the way you show your love is how hard you
work,'' Kipps said. ``We're driven to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, David, is a lung doctor while her uncle, Thomas, is
a genetic medicine researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all workaholics,'' Kipps said.
</P>
<P>
   Love knew she had an unusual athlete when she read the essay
Kipps wrote on her USC application. The topic was solving global
dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I read that, I told people, `I think she's going to win
a Nobel Prize,''' Love said. ``Everything she's done is not for
her, it's so she can extend it to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kipps is not only smart, she's outspoken. During her freshman
year, USC president Steven Sample lectured athletes following an
academic scandal involving students who rarely attended a
particular class but still received passing grades.
</P>
<P>
   Kipps went back to her apartment and wrote Sample a stern note,
informing him that not all athletes were questionable students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know there were people in the athletic
department who wanted to be in school and in honors classes,''
Kipps said. ``People outside athletics have no idea how much time
we spend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Love enjoyed Kipps' sharp mind, because she always had plenty of
questions and didn't hesitate to ask them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was delightful to coach with that kind of inquiry,'' Love
said. ``It's an exchange. She's contributing. She's not
attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Except when it came to volleyball. A 6-foot-3 middle blocker,
Kipps set a USC record her junior season with 151 block assists.
She ranks fourth all-time at USC with 172 total blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As subtle as she is with accomplishments, she is not a subtle
player,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what made her knee injury even more devastating. She was
a team captain, and USC's hopes for a national championship
vanished when Kipps went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple weeks, I could cry any part of the day,''
Kipps said. ``I'd be walking on the crutches on campus and it would
hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not even close when Kipps considers if she would exchange
being valedictorian with a healthy volleyball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give this up in a second to play one or two more
Pac-10 matches,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Kipps' injury was just as critical to her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practices for a while were like training in a morgue,'' Love
said. ``My heart sank. It took the team at least a couple weeks to
recover. There was a hole in the team's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the injury, Kipps could have redshirted this season
and played next year. But she is ready to go to Harvard and become
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to move on,'' Kipps said.

OXFORD HEALTH'S TURNAROUND IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year on the turnaround track, Oxford Health Plans has
backed away from the brink of bankruptcy by shedding thousands of
loss-making members and raising the premiums paid by the customers
who remained. But the big managed care company is still reporting a
substantial cash-flow loss on operations and still struggling with
the dysfunctional computer systems that nearly sank the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not out of the woods yet,'' said Arun Kumar, a
health-care analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Payson, Oxford's upbeat chief executive, promises
shareholders profits later this year, after operating losses in the
first six months. With the sale of its New York Medicaid business,
the company reported a small profit. But even Payson, who was named
chairman Wednesday, says the makeover is still a ``work in
progress'' on several important fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Oxford has to fix its computer systems, which still
don't talk to each other and require expensive human intervention
to match clients' claims with the three-year-old ``new'' system
that tracks everything else. The stakes are enormous: the danger of
``mistakenly mispricing premiums,'' was the worst case example
cited by Payson, 51, in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another hazard could be overpaying some bills. Oxford is still
trying to recover more than $100 million of the $276 million it
advanced to hospitals and doctors in the dark days of 1997 when it
completely lost control of its accounts. Payson said Oxford
intended to improve its existing information systems, rather than
start over or contract out the work. It has added 140 software
``enhancements'' this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The health maintenence organization raised its premiums 9.8
percent, on average, for the big employers whose year started Jan.
1. It seeks similar increases from small businesses and
individuals, helped by an industrywide upswing in rates. But
consultants say Oxford's rates are already above its competitors,
reflecting the costs of dealing with its huge network of more than
45,000 doctors and 200 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has to walk a tightrope, raising rates to cover costs and
profits without becoming too expensive and losing customers.
Membership has dropped by 400,000 to 1.69 million from 2.1 million
in the 12 months ended March 31. That was both good news and bad
news, financially. Most of the attrition was in its unprofitable
Medicaid and Medicare business plus 50,000 nongovernmental
customers spread thin in states Oxford no longer serves. But the
company also lost 100,000 members in its core business in New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, costs are a moving target. ``Most managed care
companies' costs are growing 5 percent or 6 percent,'' said Kenneth
C. Abramowitz, an HMO specialist at Sanford C. Bernstein. ``If you
are raising premiums 10 percent, you're in pretty good shape. But
you have to make sure costs for hospitals, physicians and drugs are
growing only 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   All the HMOs are engaged in tough negotiations with the
hospitals. Payson said some hospitals had agreed to work more
closely with Oxford on deciding when a patient is ready to be
discharged. ``We are not all exactly of one mind frame,'' he said.
Hospital officials say there has been a steep increase in the
number of denials of payment by Oxford and other big managed care
companies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As for the doctors, Oxford is in arbitration with 14
associations of New York physicians, headed by the New York County
Medical Society, on complaints about late or inadequate payments.
The state insurance department has fined Oxford twice for late
payments under a new law.
</P>
<P>
   Payson said Oxford had made ``extraordinary progress'' in paying
doctors and hospitals promptly. ``With 70,000 claims a day, it is
easy to have difficulty with certain categories,'' he said.
Payson's progress reports have helped revive Oxford's share price,
and that has been good for him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford slipped 3.125 cents a share Wednesday to $20.96875, but
that is more than triple its low of $6.81 last August. When he
accepted a four-year contract a year ago, he invested $10 million
at $15.52 per share, when the market price was over $18. Last
August, when the stock hit bottom, Payson began buying again _ two
million shares at $6 to $8 each.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Oxford awarded him two million options, which
can be exercised at $15.52 each and one million more at $6.0625.

NYC UNIONS FIND VOICE IN MARCH BY CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one of this city's biggest labor rallies in
decades, tens of thousands of union members marched past City Hall
on Wednesday to demand that the city and state spend part of their
budget surpluses on higher wages and on programs that help working
families, like education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The rally sought to signal Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov.
George Pataki _ at a time that both appear to be showing interest
in higher office _ that they will have a huge fight on their hands
if they do not revamp their budgets more to labor's liking.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, held on Broadway, 150 yards west of City
Hall, also sought to send a strong message that New York's labor
movement is alive, newly vocal and united after years of disarray
and an embarrassing corruption scandal at District Council 37, the
city's largest municipal union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is just a beginning,'' said Denis Hughes, the new
president of the State AFL-CIO. ``We are going to mobilize this
movement like never before. We are going to be in the streets like
never before. We are going to be on the phones like never before.
They're going to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the demonstration, which sometimes resembled a pep
rally, aimed to show union members _ and not just politicians _ how
strong labor can be. Officials with the New York City Central Labor
Council, the umbrella group representing all the city's unions,
estimated that 50,000 union members participated, while the Police
Department put the figure at 25,000 to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders and the police both said it was hard to count
the crowd because thousands of workers were still marching toward
the rally at 6 p.m., as thousands of others were leaving for the
subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see today not as the culmination of our effort, but
as the beginning of a movement,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of
the city's largest union, a 150,000-member grouping of health-care
workers known as 1199. ``We have to be about the business of
changing the political agenda in New York so that the working
people and families of our state come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and foot soldiers alike complained that city workers had
made considerable sacrifices, like taking a two-year pay freeze.
But now that the city has a $2 billion budget surplus and the state
a $3 billion surplus, they said, the workers should share in the
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Loudspeakers lined Broadway from Park Row to Canal Street, and
for more than 90 minutes union members inched south, often 10
abreast, slowed by a maze of metal police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of teachers wore blue T-shirts reading, ``All Roads
Lead to a Fair Share for Working Families.'' Signs carried an array
of messages: ``Zeros won't feed my kids,'' ``Fed up, Stand up,''
and Pataki ``cuts $2.1 billion out of health care to pay for tax
cuts for billionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said the rally had the broadest support of any New
York City labor demonstration in at least 15 years, since it
brought together police officers _ who rarely demonstrate with
other unions _ teachers, construction workers, bridge painters,
nurses' aides, correction officers, transit workers and the
120,000-member District Council 37.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker said the mayor and governor should use
their budget surpluses not for tax cuts for the rich but instead
for better wages for government workers and for programs that help
middle-class families. Several labor leaders, as well as several
Democratic politicians at the rally, asserted that the city and
state should not be stingy with government workers after they
sacrificed to help create the budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McLaughlin, the president of the Central Labor Council,
insisted that the rally should put forth a positive agenda and not
attack the mayor or governor. But other leaders ignored those pleas
and lambasted both men, saying that the mayor and governor should
reconsider proposed cuts in projected education spending and that
Pataki should rescind contemplated health-care cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the 95,000-member United
Federation of Teachers, said: ``Mr. Mayor and Mr. Governor, don't
talk to us about budget cuts and tax cuts and work-force cuts. We
heard enough of that when times were bad. But times aren't bad
anymore. So what's your excuse now? It's time to give our families
their fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news briefing Wednesday, Giuliani insisted that the city
should give raises only if unions agree in return to do extra work
or increase productivity in some other way. He said it was wrong
for elected leaders to give things away to unions without getting
anything. ``The age and the day of the giveaway should be over,''
he said.

HOUSE PASSES BILL LIMITING YEAR 2000 LIABILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voting largely along party lines, the House of
Representatives approved legislation Wednesday that would limit
lawsuits arising from year 2000 computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, companies responsible for computer breakdowns
that occur when the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000, could not be
assessed punitive damages greater than $250,000 or three times the
financial damages, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   Among other limits, class-action lawsuits would be restricted;
officers and directors of companies would be protected from
liability in many instances; businesses would be allowed 90 days to
solve a problem after it was detected before a suit could be
brought, and defendants would be liable only for their
proportionate share of the responsibility when a computer problem
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the legislation by a vote of 236 to 190.
Supporting it were 208 Republicans and 28 Democrats; nine
Republicans, 180 Democrats and one Independent voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is unlikely to become law in this form. A companion
measure is stalled in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to
overcome a Democratic filibuster. And President Clinton has vowed
to veto any measure along the lines of the one the House passed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's action keeps the issue alive while all sides
work for a compromise. Two of the president's top advisers _ Bruce
Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel, and Gene Sperling,
director of the National Economic Counsel _ sent a letter to
congressional leaders this week reiterating the president's threat
to veto the pending legislation but expressing hope for a
compromise on what is called the Y2K issue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from automated systems' longtime reliance on
the last two digits of a year. At the turn of the century, some
computers may break down because they read the year 2000 as 1900;
the cost could be considerable to individuals and companies relying
on these computers.
</P>
<P>
   The political obstacles to compromise are formidable. The year
2000 battle is the latest in a continuing lobbying war between
commercial interests and trial lawyers _ a fight that carries
considerable political weight since businesses are the largest
republican contributors, and trial lawyers are among the Democrats'
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the House floor reflected that division. Rep. Dick
Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, compared trial
lawyers to ``a bunch of vultures eating off the carcasses'' and
said Congress had the responsibility to ``stop the needless,
senseless confrontation that is designed to line their pockets over
someone's misfortune.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., said the bill's
supporters wanted ``blanket immunity for those who fail to act
responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that it was important that businesses spend
money to find and fix computer bugs, rather than conserve their
money to fight lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 lawsuits have already been filed, the bill's
proponents said. Without legal limits, the Republicans maintained,
litigation costs concerning year 2000 glitches could reach as much
as $1 trillion _ more than litigation over asbestos, tobacco,
breast implants and toxic waste combined. They did not say how they
arrived at that estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce of the United States,
the National Association of Manufacturers and the National
Federation of Independent Business have put this bill at the top of
their agenda and have spent millions of dollars lobbying and
advertising on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats responded that the Republican bill was a stalking
horse for sweeping changes in tort laws. Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader, said the other side was most
interested in ``something that will dismantle protections for
consumers and small businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also argued that limiting lawsuits would remove the
incentives for businesses to correct problems before they
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Trade unions and consumer groups have lobbied against setting
limits.

COLORADO MAN IS SUSPECTED OF PLANNING MOSQUE ATTACK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A 39-year-old man who the police say intended to
``incinerate'' Colorado's largest mosque, was arrested Wednesday
after fleeing the site in a car loaded with bomb-making materials,
four guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an enemy against the Islamic nation, and I was going to
take care of business,'' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office
quoted the man, Jack M. Modig, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Modig has expressed support for the far-right,
anti-government philosophy espoused by the Freemen group in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Modig tried to ram three police cruisers during
a seven-mile chase from the suburban mosque to his rooming house in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When taken into custody, Modig was dressed all in black _
``black T-shirt, black trouser and black combat boots,'' according
to a press release from the sheriff's office. In his car, he had a
black ski mask and black military-style clothing _ a vest and a
coat, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the mosque, Talib Syed, said the mosque, which
is called the Islamic Center and is located southeast of Denver,
drew about 500 people every Friday for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Modig was charged with possession of explosive devices, carrying
concealed weapons, eluding a police vehicle and three counts of
attempted vehicular assault. He is being held on $500,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The police said a search of Modig's car turned up two
semi-automatic pistols, a shotgun, a rifle, two machetes, a
survival knife and ample ammunition for all the firearms, as well
as bomb-making materials including three 10-gallon cans filled with
gasoline, bleach, electrical tape, flares, batteries, electrical
wiring and ``cheese cloth for fuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief, based on our investigation, that he was
going to incinerate the Islamic Center,'' Capt. Phil Spence, the
sheriff's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office said Modig had a history of contacts with
law-enforcement agencies in Colorado. In 1992, he volunteered to be
an informant in four homicide investigations in western Colorado.
Last summer, he was ``escorted'' out of the State Capitol after he
tried to contact Bill Owens, who was then state treasurer. Last
fall, Owens was elected governor. Three months ago, Modig was
charged with driving under the influence and possession of narcotic
equipment in Gilpin County, 30 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, Modig was one of the first of about 150
Coloradans who signed a petition supporting the formation of a
``common law court'' in northern Colorado. The political movement
for these unofficial courts reached its apex the following summer
with the siege of the Freemen's compound in northern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver area has experienced several nativist attacks on
immigrant Muslims and the mosque in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In separate attacks over the last 18 months, gangs have killed
two immigrant men who prayed at the mosque. The police labeled the
killings hate crimes.

REED HANGS TOUGH AND METS' BATTERS HELP CHASE THOMSON TO THE
MINORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The pitching line was not particularly pretty. Nor was
the bruise above Rick Reed's right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed on Wednesday became the Mets' first starting pitcher in
four games to allow fewer than eight earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Mets scored six runs in the first two innings
off John Thomson, a pitcher who was optioned to the minor leagues
after the game, the four runs in five innings that Reed was charged
with were hardly enough for the Colorado Rockies to catch the Mets
in a 10-5 victory at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, their second in the last eight games, enabled the
Mets to avert a three-game sweep at the most dangerous park to
pitch in in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   It was also good enough for Reed to pick up his third victory in
four decisions, coming only three days after he had surrendered
eight runs in one and two-thirds innings of an 11-6 loss in Arizona
on Sunday, the outing that led to the string of eight-run starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always hurts when you lose,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, sometimes even when you win.
</P>
<P>
   Reed took a second-inning line drive just above his right
hamstring. He recovered in time not only to throw out Angel
Echevarria at first base, but also to pitch five solid innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae also took one for the team, running face-first into
a portion of the fence in right-center field in the fifth inning
while hanging on to Todd Helton's blast. McRae played three more
innings before leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, both Reed and Manager Bobby Valentine credited
McRae's amazing catch, which saved a run, with helping to save the
game, even though the score was 10-2 after the drive resulted in a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The question was, who hurt more, Reed or McRae?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably him,'' Reed said. ``He ate half that pad on the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick,'' McRae countered. ``He got bruised. I don't have
bruises.''
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Mets have a lot of bruises. Bobby Bonilla and
Rickey Henderson are on the disabled list, and the Mets (19-15)
announced Wednesday that Bobby Jones would take an extra day of
rest and next pitch on Monday, not Sunday, because of a tender
right elbow. Orel Hershiser gets the start Sunday instead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones allowed eight earned runs on Tuesday night, as the Mets
dropped their third straight game. After their starters had allowed
33 runs in 241/3 innings over the first five games of this
nine-game trip _ 33 runs in 181/3 innings, excluding Masato
Yoshii's six scoreless innings last Saturday _ the Mets were
looking for a lift from Reed on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when the Mets scored three runs in the first inning on
a run-scoring single by Mike Piazza and a two-out, two-run double
by Robin Ventura. It helped even more when they scored three runs
in the second on a two-run double by Edgardo Alfonzo and a
run-scoring double by Piazza to give Reed a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno, who had four hits, scored in the first and second
innings and scored three runs in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reed pitched well enough and long enough to take a 10-1 lead
into the fifth inning, when he allowed three runs, the last two on
Dante Bichette's home run, his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a really good day,'' Valentine said of his
right-hander. ``Pitching lines here are really difficult to
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed agreed. ``Under the circumstances, I thought I pitched
pretty good,'' he said. ``It seems like every start I have they
give me a lead to work with, which to me is awesome, especially
here. This is a place where you can't score enough runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said: ``He was aggressive. He got touched for a couple of
home runs, but that happens here. It was a great game, actually.
I've seen some games here I just can't describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed found it difficult to describe the pain he felt when
Echevarria's liner smacked his right buttock where it meets the
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby asked me if the ball was OK,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hina, the Mets' trainer, said: ``All Rick said to me was:
`Get away, Fred. There ain't nothing you can do.' I said, `I know,
but at least I can give you a few minutes to let the sting wear off
a little bit.' And then Rick said, `I think that one's going to
leave a mark.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could afford a couple of laughs as they made their way
to Philadelphia for a three-game series that starts Friday night.
They had driven in runs early, and received enough pitching, to win
for only the second time in six games on this trip.

PIPPEN IS WORN DOWN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Relaxing before practice Wednesday at Pauley
Pavilion, the Houston Rockets did not look any different than they
did in Game 1 of this first-round series against the Lakers.
Scottie Pippen's hair was cropped just as closely. Hakeem
Olajuwon's smile was just as easy, and Charles Barkley's pate was
just as shiny. No gray, all glisten.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime before Game 2, the Rockets got old. They got very
old very quickly. At least, that's how they played in a 110-98
defeat Tuesday that gave the Lakers a 2-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those nights,'' Pippen said. ``We didn't have
the right focus.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to age faster than Pippen, who responded to his
last-second turnover in Game 1 with an invisible performance in
Game 2. In 37 minutes Tuesday, Pippen scored three points, all on
free throws. The six-time champion and future Hall of Famer did not
make a basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I pressing? Not at all,'' Pippen said. ``I haven't even
attempted to press. I just need to get myself involved. I'm very
disappointed in my play personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has never been a prolific scorer and he doesn't need be
for Houston to win Game 3 tonight in the Compaq Center. But he must
be the Rockets' defensive stopper and their playmaker, a
double-whammy that would strain legs much younger than his.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, the 33-year-old Pippen is chasing Glen Rice through
a maze of screens. The next, he's trying to direct the offense
while fending off Kobe Bryant's pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe meets me at halfcourt, then I have to chase Rice,''
Pippen said. ``I've been carrying a lot of minutes. It takes its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wearing on me. The defense affects my offense: having to
guard Rice, run to him in transition, then Kobe jumps on me. It's
making me use a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Lakers hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Smother Pippen with pressure and responsibilities, they believe,
and the Rockets will crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our game plan,'' Rice said. ``We want to keep
Scottie busy all the time. If you give him some rest, he'll kill
you. He'll give you more offense and be more active on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen tried to get involved in Game 2, driving to the basket
several times in the first quarter. But his plan evaporated under
the Lakers' brilliance. In fact, nothing worked _ not for Pippen
and not for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon cannot guard Shaquille O'Neal man-to-man, so the
Rockets must double-team in the low post. That leaves a shooter
open. Usually, it's point guard Derek Fisher, who has made 8 of 12
3-pointers in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where else to turn,'' Pippen said. ``We try to
take it out of Shaq's hands and we try to limit Rice, and Fisher
steps up. He's had a hell of a series.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pippen could not recall a comparable circumstance with
the Bulls, Olajuwon and Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich survived
several elimination games during their charges to NBA titles in
1994 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't panic,'' Tomjanovich said. ``You have to play with a
sense of urgency, but it can't be desperation. It can't be panic.''
</P>
<P>
   With little preparation time, the Rockets can't make drastic
changes. Offensively, they'll continue to force-feed Barkley and
Olajuwon in the low post. Defensively, they'll continue to
double-team O'Neal and hope the Lakers _ who were 17 of 31 from
3-point range at the Forum _ don't shoot as well on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't shoot as well in our building,'' Pippen said. ``If
they (do), then crown them NBA champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although frustrated with his own play, Pippen noted (correctly)
he's not the only reason for Houston's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, 36, was his old self in Game 1, scoring 22 points. But
he lacked energy and authority in Game 2 and was helpless against
O'Neal, who outscored his hero 28-8. Barkley, 36, also played well
in Game 1, with 25 points. But in the decisive first half of Game
2, he made one basket.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than building on their inspired performance Sunday, the
Rockets seemed exhausted from it. Now they are gasping for breath,
lunging for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where our team character will be tested,'' Olajuwon
said. ``If we win, the pressure shifts to both teams, because they
don't want to play a Game 5. But now, the pressure is on us.''

LAKERS MIGHT GET EXTRA REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With their dominant Game 2 victory over the Houston
Rockets, the Lakers did more Tuesday than just boost their
confidence and take control of the best-of-five series. They got a
potential jump on their second-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Lakers want to assume anything, but if they can
knock out the Rockets tonight, they'll assure themselves a trip
home and a few extra days to prepare for the winner of the
Minnesota-San Antonio series.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves evened that series at 1-1 on Tuesday, forcing
at least a fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do get a chance to wrap the series up (tonight), and the
T-Wolves and Spurs go a couple games more, I don't necessarily like
that many days in between games,'' Derek Fisher said, ``but I like
the fact we'll be able to practice and concentrate on what we have
to do to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Lakers have benefited from regular practice
sessions the last few weeks _ something they didn't have all year _
the extra days would be valuable, coach Kurt Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to have a breather,'' he said, ``but the
antithesis of that is you get too much time off, and guys get a
little complacent. We're definitely gonna try and take advantage of
our situation, but this series in my mind is far from being over.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper said the Lakers know they can't get too
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you, the team we played (Tuesday) night won't be
in Houston (tonight). It won't be the same team. They've had time
to soak it up and lay in the mess that they put out there (Tuesday)
night.... It would shock me if (tonight's) game isn't a closer,
tougher type of a basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers are confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can beat them,'' Harper said. ``I really feel like
we're a better basketball team, the way we're playing right now,
than a lot of teams out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant was suffering from a possible virus
Wednesday but said he'll be OK tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm getting a little sick,'' Bryant said, his voice
hoarse. ``I had a little stomach virus (Tuesday) night. I was a
little slow.... I'll be fine.''

MAN ADMITS SLAYING NEW JERSEY POLICEWOMAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The fourth man taken into custody in the
turbulent investigation into the shooting death of a policewoman
last month pleaded guilty Wednesday to the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Condell Woodson, 25, also pleaded guilty to robbery and weapons
possession charges. Sentencing was set for June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The plea was an abrupt conclusion to the case, which has
provoked a tangle of lawsuits and state and federal investigations
stemming from the alleged beating of the first man arrested, who
turned out to be innocent, and the death of another man taken in
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said off the record that Woodson had confessed to
relatives that he had shot Officer Joyce Anne Carnegie when she
stopped him on the street in Orange in connection with a robbery
investigation. The investigators also said that a 9-millimeter
pistol used in the shooting belonged to Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Krakora, one of Woodson's lawyers, said that the plea
agreement would probably result in a sentence of life in prison
without the possibility of parole. Without that plea agreement, he
said, Woodson would ``inevitably'' have faced the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the plea, Essex County Prosecutor
Patricia A. Hurt said the plea agreement ``mandates'' that Woodson
will not be eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty, Woodson told Judge Betty Lester that his gun
had gone off accidentally when Carnegie stopped him and tried to
arrest him for a spate of robberies around downtown Orange. Police
investigators said at the time that Carnegie was shot in the
abdomen and the head in the confrontation and had not had a chance
to draw her weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, the son of a career military man, grew up on military
bases in New Jersey, Hawaii and Virginia. He was an honor student
and gifted athlete at Orange High School. But in later years he
struggled to hold jobs and was convicted of a variety of drug,
weapons, robbery and assault charges. In recent years he lived in
Cordele, Ga., and last year was sentenced to three months in a
Georgia boot camp for robbery and assault.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he returned to Orange, where his mother lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the hunt for the killer, investigators first arrested
Terrance Everett, 24, and held him for six days before concluding
that he was innocent. Everett, who suffered bruises and a black eye
when he was arrested, has said he plans to sue the law enforcement
agencies and the town.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Earl Faison, 27, was picked up because he bore a
resemblance to descriptions of Carnegie's killer. He died while in
police custody, and his family, too, is preparing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies are investigating both arrests.
</P>
<P>
   James Coker, 29, was also picked up during the investigation. He
was subsequently cleared of any involvement in Carnegie's shooting.

POLLIN SELLING CAPITALS AND SHARE OF THE WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abe Pollin, who poured millions of dollars into
sports franchises that usually let him down by season's end,
announced Wednesday that he was selling outright his hockey team,
the Washington Capitals, and a minority interest in his other
holdings, which include the Washington Wizards basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The price was not disclosed _ ``We never talk about money,''
Pollin said at a news conference _ but it appeared that a
partnership that will make the purchase was investing $200 million
now with more to come in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin, who is 75, said that both his health and personal
finances were in good shape but that his two sons had told him they
did not want to follow him into the sports business. The recent
basketball lockout did not affect his decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal member of the partnership that is making the
purchase, Ted Leonsis, is a billionaire Internet executive and
sports buff who has a full-size basketball court at his house.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was making the investment, Leonsis said: ``Because
I can. I love competition. I went to Georgetown University. I was a
Hoya.'' He is a sports fan from Brooklyn who used to root for the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis is an executive at America Online, but he said that
there would not be any connection between his sports and computer
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin and his wife, Irene, have been known in Washington for
their community activity and he said that the sale would allow them
more time _ and more money _ for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided to spend a little less time with sports and
more with folks less fortunate than I am,'' Pollin said at the news
conference, which was held on the Wizards' practice court in the
MCI Center, an arena he built two years ago with $200 million of
his own money in downtown Washington. His immediate concerns, he
said, were a major campaign by Unicef for relief in Kosovo and
helping Washington's homeless.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he was selling now, he answered, ``First, we did
not want a repeat of the mess the Redskins went through with their
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to the disposition of the Washington football
team after the death of its owner, Jack Kent Cooke. The trustees of
the Cooke estate sold the team to one group, only to have the deal
fall apart when it became clear that the owners in the NFL would
not approve the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Pollin nor Leonsis would say how much the
partnership was paying, Leonsis was asked if it was $200 million
and he answered: ``That's a good number.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Leonsis' partners, Jonathan J. Ledecky, confirmed the
$200 million estimate and, after Leonsis had declined to provide
the breakdown of the new partnership, Ledecky suggested that
Leonsis' share was 60 percent, his own 30 percent and that of Dick
Patrick, president of the Capitals, 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin remains the majority partner in Washington Sports, which
owns the Wizards and the MCI Center, and said he hoped to bring
another basketball championship to Washington. He said that he
expected the new partnership to eventually invest enough to obtain
full ownership of his properties _ the two teams, the MCI Center
and Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin's son Robert, a professor of economics at the University
of Massachusetts, Amherst, confirmed later that neither he nor his
brother, Jim, who runs a travel business, wanted to follow Pollin
as the teams' owners.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his father's holdings made economic sense, he
said: ``Yes. He's got a lot of debt, but he's doing OK''

HEINZ WERNER BERENDES, 74, PIONEER IN CARE OF NEWBORNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Heinz Werner Berendes, a pediatrician and medical
epidemiologist for the National Institutes of Health who pioneered
studies of birth-control safety and the care of newborns, died May
6 at the NIH Clinical Center in suburban Maryland. He was 74 and
lived in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development, where he was a senior
investigator. Berendes directed the perinatal research branch and
the groundbreaking Collaborative Perinatal Project, the largest
such effort this country.
</P>
<P>
   The project spawned hundreds of research papers 40 years ago,
and remains an important source of data on pregnancy and child
development. Berendes also led more recent studies for the World
Health Organization and made evaluations intended to improve the
care of expectant mothers and their newborns in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dortmund, Germany, Berendes earned medical doctorates at
the Universities of Goettingen and Munich. He started a career as a
child psychiatrist in Germany but came to this country in 1953 and
later added a master's degree in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the institutes of health in 1960, he was chief of
the perinatal branch from 1960 to 1973 and headed the contraceptive
evaluation branch from then until 1979. He successively held top
positions in contraceptive evaluation, the epidemiology and
biometry research program and, until last year, the Division of
Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he took over the epidemiology and statistics program.
Under his direction, the program grew into a world leader in the
field of reproductive epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he held academic appointments at Howard University
Medical School, Johns Hopkins and George Washington Universities.
He served as a consultant to numerous agencies, published some 120
scientific papers, sat on many committees and task forces and was
on the editorial board of the American Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Berendes is survived by his wife, Dr. Michele Forman; their son
David M., also of Bethesda; a son and daughter by an earlier
marriage, Christoph M., of Washington, and Andrea Harmer, of
Novato, Calif., and two grandchildren.

THE NIGHT THE KNICKS DID EVERYTHING PERFECTLY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley was staring off into the distance as he sat
quietly on the bench. The Heat had imploded at the feet of the
cackling Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a surreal 32-2 run that began at the end of the second
quarter and carried over into the third, the Knicks overwhelmed the
Heat to take Game 3, 97-73, Monday night at Madison Square Garden.
The Heat, which missed its first 17 3-pointers, is on the verge of
elimination as the Knicks took a 2-1 lead in this
three-of-five-game playoff series. Game 4 will be at the Garden on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell led the Knicks with 20 points. Allan Houston
shook off flu symptoms and added 18 while Patrick Ewing chipped in
15. Alonzo Mourning led Miami with 18.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was electric as the game began. The Knicks
matched the crowd's intensity and generated their own craziness as
they ended the first half on a 12-0 run and held a 45-37 lead at
the break. That run extended to 19-0 as the third quarter began and
the Knicks led by 18 points. Incredibly, the Knicks just kept on
coming and took a 63-39 lead with 6:30 left in the third to cap a
mind-blowing 32-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, falling apart at the seams, had scored just one field
goal in 12 minutes until Jamal Mashburn hit a jumper with four
minutes left in the third. The Heat managed to find a couple of
baskets but that was hardly enough as the Knicks overwhelmed them
to take a 73-48 lead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was clicking to absolute perfection for the Knicks.
Although Houston spent most of the day in bed with flu symptoms,
taking Advil and swilling fluids, he shook off his ills and hit
four of seven shots to score a team-leading 11 points in the first
half. And although Ewing was in obvious pain from his sore
Achilles' tendon and was limited in defending against Mourning, who
scored 13 first-half points, he found his groove and scored 9
first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events in this game was a reminder of Game 1. While
the Heat were missing its shots and mired at 30 percent from the
field in the first half, the Knicks were taking apart the Heat's
suddenly soft defense in transition and shooting 50 percent. Often,
those points were coming off long rebounds that came as the Heat
missed 3-point attempts, going 0 for 12 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continued in the second half. The Heat tried to
catch up by hitting 3's instead of pecking at the Knicks from
inside. Two 3-point misses and a turnover later, and the Knicks
were ahead by 52-37, with 10 minutes left in the third. By that
point, the Knicks' run was at 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, it was the Heat that was executing. The Heat
methodically quieted the Garden and went ahead, 11-4, to start the
game before the Knicks livened up and tied the game on a 12-5 run.
Then the tightness and intensity that this series promised began to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   There was Ewing, who was irate at official Mike Mathis, drawing
a technical foul in the first quarter. There was the spindly Marcus
Camby, showing he could physically hold his own against the Heat by
diving on the floor for a loose ball in the second quarter. There
was Sprewell, taking a charge with the bulky Mourning galloping
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever edge on intensity the Heat had in Game 2, the Knicks
were pouring onto the floor for this one. After losing the
rebounding edge in the first 4 minutes of the game, 7-1, the Knicks
began to muscle their way around the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were leaving the Heat open for 3-pointers, Dan
Majerle, Jamal Mashburn and Terry Porter were missing, missing,
missing. With 3 minutes left in the third quarter, the Knicks took
a 3-point miss by Porter. On the possession, Ewing ended up with
the ball and tossed it to an open Sprewell who nailed a 3-pointer
to give the Knicks a 40-37 lead. They were not about to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   That play started the Knicks' 12-0 run to end the half. Two
possessions later, after Camby and Childs dived to the floor for a
loose ball and P.J. Brown was called for the foul, the Garden
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The fans began twirling their orange towels over their heads
like helicopter blades, and the place nearly lifted off its
foundation. They hit new decibel levels when Houston drove through
the lane and into a crowd and hit his runner with 1.4 seconds left
to give the Knicks a 45-37 halftime lead.

   Anna Quindlen will not become the third member of her family to
receive an honorary degree from Villanova University after all.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quindlen, a novelist and former reporter and columnist for
The New York Times, had been invited to be the commencement speaker
and follow in the footsteps of a great-uncle and an uncle. But she
said that she told the president of Villanova, the Rev. Edmund J.
Dobbin, that she was bowing out after opponents of abortion
threatened to protest her appearance by walking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this solely for the sake of the graduates and their
families,'' she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said to Father Dobbin, if I had been asked simply to give
a speech at Villanova, I would still be giving the speech, and he
would not have accepted my withdrawal,'' she said. ``But the
commencement speaker is only a collateral part of graduation. The
most important part is the students. I don't want to do anything
that would disrupt the ceremony for them. You don't want a whole
mess of seniors to walk away thinking, `My graduation was the one
where there was this huge disruption.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Clement, a spokeswoman for Villanova, said that
objections to Ms. Quindlen's appearance had come from ``a small
minority of people,'' including an anti-abortion group on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quindlen said that she had not planned to mention the
abortion issue in her speech. ``It would never occur to me to speak
about reproductive rights at a college commencement,'' she said.
``The nuns always taught me to be appropriate, and I am.''
</P>
<P>
   `MONICA'S STORY': THE THRILL IS GONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica's Story'' has gone the way of all books about scandals
past, like the page turners about the O.J. Simpson case. ``Monica's
Story,'' Andrew Morton's briefly best-selling book about Monica
Lewinsky, has been remaindered.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, St. Martin's Press, hopes to clear out ``maybe
50,000'' hardcover copies and clear the way for 500,000 copies of
the mass market paperback edition to be shipped by August, said
Jamie Brickhouse, a spokesman for St. Martin's.
</P>
<P>
   Remaindering allows bookstores to sell ``Monica's Story'' for
half its $24.95 cover price.
</P>
<P>
   The initial, 350,000-copy printing of ``Monica's Story'' sold
out, Brickhouse said, and another 150,000 copies were sold. It was
No. 1 on the New York Times best seller list for three weeks and
was on the list for six weeks. &UR;  &LR; Wednesday it was No. 4,459 on the
sales list of Amazon.com. Another Clinton-related book, ``All Too
Human'' by George Stephanopoulos, was No. 78.
</P>
<P>
   A PLACE IN THE SUN FOR HUMBLE FINNS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick. When you think of Finland, what comes to mind? Paavo
Nurmi, the Flying Finn, who shattered the world record for the
mile?
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1923. Try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finns are shy, humble people,'' said Paivi Samilham, who works
for Finlandia Vodka and was schmoozing at Studio 54 the other night
in the hope that her country might find a spot in the limelight.
``We are good at producing products, but not too aggressive at
promoting them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Samilham said, Nokia, the world's largest cell
phone company, is Finnish, not Japanese. And Marimekko is Finnish,
not Japanese or Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing push, one of a series of Finnish coming-out
parties, began in December 1997 with five main events, including a
series of concerts of music composed by Jean Sibelius at Lincoln
Center and a retrospective of designer Alvar Aalto at the Museum of
Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, companies didn't want to be identified with any
particular country,'' said Petra Tuomi of the Swedish Consulate.
``They wanted to be global.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to be competitive, we had to change. We want Finland to be
associated with high technology and high design, not just
reindeer.''

NEW CEMENT SYSTEM REINS IN RUNAWAY PLANE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A twin-engine commuter plane that touched down too
close to the end of a runway at Kennedy International Airport was
stopped from plunging into a tidal bay by a prototype ``arresting
system,'' a kind of flypaper for runaway airplanes. Federal
officials said Wednesday that it saved the lives of the people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on Saturday morning marked the first operational
use of the system, installed two years ago after a jumbo jet went
off the end of the same runway, forcing passengers to swim to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually saved lives with this,'' said Jan M. Brecht-Clark,
the deputy director of aviation research at the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an American Eagle flight arriving from Baltimore,
chewed up 248 feet of the arrestor bed, a newly developed,
crushable cement; its wheels were mired to a depth of 2{ feet and
the plane, a SAAB 340 turboprop, stopped about 150 feet short of
Thurston Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the 27 passengers was hurt, suffering a twisted
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other officials said that engineers at the National
Transportation Safety Board said they did not believe the plane
could have stopped without the special system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same spot in February 1984, an SAS Scandinavian Airlines
DC-10 overshot the runway and landed in the frigid water and some
of the 177 passengers had to swim to shore or paddle life rafts
with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same runway, same place, same Thurston Basin and the aircraft
lands and is arrested,'' said a Port Authority spokesman, Bill
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   The SAS accident prompted the FAA to demand that runways have a
1,000-foot overrun area ``where practicable,'' but there is no
space for such an area at Kennedy. That led the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, working with the FAA and private
companies, to develop the system that got its first real test with
the American Eagle flight.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the system, called the Engineered Material
Arresting System, say there are 350 runway ends at busy airports
around the country that cannot meet the 1,000-foot standard. Those
airports do not have to comply with the FAA ruling unless they are
rebuilt or undergo other major construction.
</P>
<P>
   Only two runways have an arresting system now: the one at
Kennedy and one at La Guardia Airport. The Port Authority is
planning at least one more bed at each of its three airports,
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark.
</P>
<P>
   And Minneapolis will install such a system soon, according to
Michael Rioux, of Joseph Del Balzo Associates, a Washington
consulting firm involved in marketing the system.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not yet clear, the plane flew 6,500 feet,
or about a mile and a quarter, beyond the beginning of the runway,
and touched down just 1,900 feet from the runway end, according to
a preliminary analysis. Stopping distance is usually more than
3,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility at the time was a quarter mile.

COOK, WATSON WILL BE PRESSED TO REPEAT VICTORIES IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Their names are inscribed on granite at PGA Tour
stops in Fort Worth-Dallas. But recent history suggests that John
Cook and Tom Watson will be hard-pressed to defend their respective
titles over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No defending champions have repeated at PGA Tour events this
season and none has prevailed at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic since
1980. Cook will attempt to break that streak beginning with
Thursday's opening round at the Four Seasons Resort and Club.
</P>
<P>
   For Watson, reigning champ at next week's MasterCard Colonial,
historical evidence suggests the challenge will be even greater.
Ben Hogan was the last repeat winner in Fort Worth, way back in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   Players cite a variety of reasons why victories by defending
champions are going the way of the persimmon driver on the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   More time demands are placed on the defending champion during
tournament week, for both off-course functions and media
interviews. There is heightened parity among today's players.
Better manicured courses, coupled with advances in equipment, help
level the playing field for all competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget intangibles such as course familiarity, blind
luck and ever-changing weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent pool out here is so deep, you have to have
everything go right just to win once, much less twice,'' said Cook,
41, who shot a closing 65 to win the 1998 Nelson by three strokes.
``You can't have any bad rounds. You can't have any mediocre
rounds. And you still have to have a couple of things go your way.
You're not going to have that happen for you very often. That's
why, every year, it gets that much tougher to win more and more
tournaments out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness the fact that David Duval remains the last person to
successfully defend a PGA Tour title, at the 1998 Michelob
Championship at Kingsmill. None of the four major championships has
seen a repeat winner in nine years, and the PGA Championship has
not had one in the stroke-play era. You have to backtrack to 1937,
when Denny Shute shot down the field for a second consecutive year
in a match-play format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I played, it seemed like that happened everywhere.
But we very seldom get repeaters any more,'' said Byron Nelson, 87.
``There are so many factors that can make a difference that players
can't control. Wind and weather changes can make two strokes worth
of difference in how hard a course plays at different times on the
same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching the right conditions can spell the difference between
repeating a title and abdicating a throne because of increased
parity. For those who question that fields are more tightly bunched
today than a generation ago, consider this finding by Dr. Scott
Berry, a Texas A&AMP;M statistics professor:
</P>
<P>
   After studying 13,792 rounds at 197 major championships
contested between 1935-97, Berry concluded today's elite player has
improved by only one-quarter shot per day from his peer from the
1950s. During the same stretch, however, the median player has
improved by 1.25 shots per day and golfers from the bottom 10
percent of the money list have improved by 2.75 strokes per round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely tough to repeat out here. I've never
successfully defended as a pro,'' said Tiger Woods, a seven-event
winner who won three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles before joining
the PGA Tour in 1996. ``A lot of it depends on where you feel
comfortable. It's tough to win back-to-back if you're not familiar
with the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the Nelson's last repeat champion (1978-80), agreed. But
he considers something else more significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is so cyclical, you've got to strike while the iron
is hot,'' Watson said. ``And there's no rhyme or reason to that. If
it happens during the same week for two consecutive years, you've
got a chance to repeat. If not, you don't.'' nn

MICROSOFT MAKES THREE DEALS IN THREE NATIONS IN ONE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday continued its rapid and
sweeping expansion beyond the personal computer market, making
simultaneous moves on three competitive fronts in as many
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash.-based software company agreed to help Sony
distribute music and videos over the Internet, while at the same
time pursuing a stake in a British cable company and buying a
Swedish software maker.
</P>
<P>
   While Wednesday's agreements indicate Microsoft will be a tough
competitor in the cellular Internet and cable arenas, a move it
made last week indicates it will also cooperate with its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the musical arena, Sony Music Entertainment of New York City,
one of the nation's five largest music companies, said it will use
Microsoft's Windows Media Technologies 4.0 to create and play
copyrighted singles and music videos by Sony's most popular
artists. Due out this summer, Windows Media is a bid by Microsoft
to best a similar product from another Seattle company,
RealNetworks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said its Media software will comply with
portable-device standards being developed by the Secure Digital
Music Initiative, a recording-industry group. Such compliance is
widely viewed as critical to the growth of the market for
copyrighted music that can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The online music market ``is likely to be a billion-dollar
industry'' by the year 2003, up from about $1 million today, said
Mark Hardie, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Britain, Microsoft continued talks to buy up to 30
percent of Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC, which would give it
a stake in each of the three largest cable companies in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement has yet been reached in the deal, which may be
worth as much as $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive as usual, Microsoft this winter agreed to invest
$500 million for a 5 percent stake in the number-one British cable
company, New York-based NTL Inc. Last week, Microsoft agreed to buy
29.9 percent of Telewest Communications PLC, the third major cable
operator in Britain, for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has become a battleground for the sale of the operating
systems within the set-top boxes used with cable television, and
for server software used to host the Internet sites accessible over
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Network Computer Inc., a rival company owned by Oracle Corp. and
America Online Inc., has already made sales to all three British
cable companies, and Microsoft is seeking to dislodge that company.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, Microsoft agreed to buy Sendit AB, a maker of
Internet software for cellular phone networks, for $120 million in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase will give Microsoft access to Internet Cellular
Smart Access, software for browsing the Internet and receiving
e-mail, all from a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   In a cooperative gesture, last week Microsoft officially joined
the Wireless Application Protocol Forum, a move many saw as
effectively heading off a microbrowser war. Microbrowsers _
software for accessing the Internet from devices other than PCs _
are key to accessing the Internet access cell phones, and several
vendors make them.
</P>
<P>
   Many see a time when all wireless phones will be manufactured
with Web browsers included, and few wanted a standards war that
would pit Microsoft, backed by the software developer industry,
against the Wireless Forum, backed by wireless-industry players,
said WCR, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's entry means application developers can write to one
common standard, which will likely kick-start the smart-phone
market, the publication said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding $2 billion each quarter to its $22 billion cash reserve,
Microsoft can afford the kind of spending spree it's been on
lately. In recent weeks, the company has moved quickly to ensure it
holds the same dominant position in cable TV set-top box operating
systems and wireless-phone microbrowsers that it now enjoys in
personal computer operating systems and applications.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Microsoft agreed to invest $5 billion in AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will become the largest U.S. cable TV company after it
completes its acquisition of MediaOne Group Inc., and it has said
it will use Microsoft's CE operating system in as many as 10
million set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Microsoft said it will invest $600 million in wireless
telephone company Nextel Communications Inc., giving it a toehold
in the emerging market for wireless Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Material from Bloomberg News was included in this report.

NEW AD CAMPAIGN HOPES TO BOOST PEPSI'S NEWEST SODA BRAND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be named Storm, but it hasn't had much effect on the
soft-drink landscape.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pepsi-Cola Co. first said it would sell Storm, a
lemon-lime carbonated drink, in a handful of markets nationwide,
many analysts thought the company would be challenging 7-Up and
Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   That was last year. This year, Storm has displayed little, if
any, punch. Sales are too low to make any mark on the national
consumption meter, and brand image is practically nonexistent.
Pepsi, a unit of Pepsico Inc., has not expanded the number of
markets _ Denver, Northern California, and Philadelphia are among
them _ where the drink is sold, even though many analysts and
industry experts expected the company to do so by early this year.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of things happened on the way to Storm's landfall. One
was the company's national introduction of Pepsi One, the diet cola
made with Ace-K, which was completed in October and is thought to
have cost Pepsi about $100 million in marketing and promotion
expenses. Another was the huge marketing effort for Pepsi-Cola,
which culminated in March with the ``Joy of Cola'' theme, replacing
``Generation Next.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Pepsico's spinoff and public offering of its
bottling division, completed at the end of March, which also
secured U.S. distribution rights for 7-Up, made by the rival
Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-Up agreement came about because Cadbury, which also owns
the Dr Pepper brand, insisted on security for 7-Up if the bottler,
now known as Pepsi Bottling Group, was going to continue to
distribute Dr Pepper. The spinoff constituted a change in
ownership, and Cadbury thus had no obligation to continue its
franchise agreements with the bottler, said Bill Pecoriello, an
analyst for Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. Dr Pepper is a perennial
moneymaker for bottlers, while 7-Up's fortunes have been in decline
for years, losing market share to Sprite, which is owned by the
Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, PBG was going to drop 7-Up for Storm, and now
they've agreed to keep 7-Up,'' Pecoriello said. ``It came down to
the leverage Cadbury had with Dr Pepper. The spinoff turned out to
be a fortunate event for 7-Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pepsi is putting some money into advertising in hopes of
creating a personality for Storm that has been lacking so far. The
ads, two television spots created by the BBDO New York unit of BBDO
Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, depict the same 20-something man
in humorously uncomfortable situations. Storm, with its smooth
taste, is supposed to be the antidote to such situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the first commercial, which started running last week, the
lead character, Pete, sits in an executive's office waiting to hear
whether he has landed a job. Next to him is Lisa, clearly waiting
to hear about the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize it is a bit unorthodox, but given that we have only
one position available, I felt compelled to deliver my decision to
both of you, together,'' says the executive, a study in pomposity.
The job goes to Lisa, who throws her arms around her new boss and
shrieks, ``Thank you, Daddy!''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer intones: ``Life isn't always so smooth.
Fortunately, there's a lemon-lime that is.'' The tag line follows,
with ``Make the move to smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   The second spot shows Pete and a girlfriend embracing in an
apartment. The telephone rings, and the answering machine kicks in.
A sultry female voice is heard, saying she wants to come by and
will use her key if necessary. The girlfriend hears this,hisses,
``Creep!'' and whacks Pete in the head on her way out.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the voice is seen next, and she turns out to be the
cleaning lady. ``Pick up your feet,'' she coos, ramming the vacuum
cleaner at Pete, who sarcastically thanks her for coming over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to appeal to 20-somethings and college
kids,'' said Bill Bruce, a creative director at BBDO, who worked on
the ads. ``We wanted to be relevant to them and their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Cassar, another BBDO creative director, said: ``Storm is
the next level of lemon-lime for that user. It's a little more
sophisticated, more grown-up in terms of its taste and the way it
goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi officials insist that Storm is a smoother drink than its
competitors. ``This makes it clear how we are different from Sprite
and 7-Up,'' said David DeCecco, a Pepsi spokesman. ``There's less
carbonation in Storm and a different flavor profile, and this will
make that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Storm is also the only lemon-lime drink that contains caffeine,
in an amount comparable to a cola, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi plans to offer coupons in newspapers and set up
free-sample tables at colleges and music festivals this summer and
fall, DeCecco said. There will also be cans with ``Star Wars''
themes, like other Pepsi products.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the majority of cities where we're testing it, we've
reached our share goals,'' he said. ``In some, we haven't. We are
doing better in convenience and gas station stores than in grocery
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was hoping for ``awareness'' _ the measure of how
well people recognize the name of a new product _ of 60 percent and
got 83 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But is Storm going to intensify, or will it wind up a distant
third like Slice, Pepsi's earlier attempt at a lemon-lime soda?
</P>
<P>
   ``Long term, we'd like this to be our competitor in the
lemon-lime category,'' said Scott Moffitt, senior marketing manager
for Pepsi. ``This is part of the plan, to do a long, extended test.
Our whole effort now is more aggressive than last year, and it's
very much a priority for us.''

 &HT;    Suit filed against ex-generals `to get to bottom' of nuns'
murder
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two former generals from El Salvador now
living in Florida were sued Tuesday over the 1980 murders of three
nuns and a social worker, a case that drew international attention
at the time and raised questions about U.S. support for that
country's government.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in West Palm Beach, says the
murders of the four women were ordered by high-ranking officials in
the Salvadoran military and covered up by its leaders: Jose
Guillermo Garcia, the former defense minister, and Carlos Eugenio
Vides Casanova, the director-general of the Salvadoran National
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   For years the families of the victims believed the killings were
part of a larger campaign to silence ``subversives'' in El
Salvador, particularly church members, who were critical of the
military-led government for human rights abuses during its 12-year
civil war with leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ Sisters Ita Ford, 40, and Maura Clarke, 51, both of
New York; Sister Dorothy Kazel, 42, of Cleveland; and social worker
Jean Donovan, 32, also of Cleveland _ were among the critics. The
women worked at a Catholic refugee center in the Central American
country.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, 1980, they were accosted at a road block by soldiers
who later raped and shot them, leaving their bodies along a dirt
road.
</P>
<P>
   Though five members of the Salvadoran National Guard were
convicted in the killings (three of whom were released from prison
last year), the families still don't believe the case was fully
investigated. They hope to shed more light on it in a West Palm
Beach courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families want to get to the bottom of it,'' said Bob
Kerrigan, a Pensacola attorney who represents the families with
West Palm Beach lawyer Bob Montgomery. ``How far up does this go?''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, reached Wednesday at his Plantation home, said he never
tried to cover up the deaths, but asked the FBI to help in the
investigation that resulted in the five arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they doing this?'' he asked. ``I don't understand the
intention when this was already handled in El Salvador. And it was
already established who was responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The families are seeking damages under the Torture Victim
Protection Act, an 8-year-old federal law that allows victims of
human rights abuses to sue their alleged assailants in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit doesn't say how much money the families are seeking,
but $75,000 is the minimum in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed in Florida because Garcia, 65, and Casanova,
61, now live here. Casanova lives in Palm Coast, near Daytona
Beach. The two were served with the lawsuit simultaneously Tuesday
night so one could not tip off the other.
</P>
<P>
   A second lawsuit was also filed Tuesday against the generals by
West Palm Beach attorney Jim Green. That suit has been sealed, and
Green would not name the plaintiff or discuss the nature of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers had to file the suits by Wednesday, the 10-year
anniversary of Casanova's entry into the United States, Montgomery
said. Lawsuits under the victim protection act are barred after 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   One question the families' lawyers hope to answer is why the two
men were allowed to emigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Casanova could not be reached for comment Wednesday night, but
last year he told a Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter he was not
involved in the killings and knew nothing about them.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of both El Salvador and the United States
maintained for years that the investigation ended with the soldiers
who were convicted. But in 1993, a United Nations commission found
that both Garcia and Casanova tried to cover up the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in the suit could be buoyed by information found
by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based group
that represents the families and asked Kerrigan and Montgomery to
take the case. (Kerrigan and Montgomery were two of the lawyers
hired by Florida in its $13 billion lawsuit against the tobacco
industry.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four of the convicted soldiers told a comittee lawyer
that they were acting on orders from superiors. But their sergeant
who received the order refused to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Documents declassified by the State Department last year show
that Garcia told a U.S. ambassador in 1985 that he suspected a
member of his high comman ordered the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some suspicions,'' Garcia acknowledged Wednesday. ``But
it's one thing to suspect and another to confirm. I had no
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The families have pushed for a deeper investigation in El
Salvador, to no avail. In 1993, the Salvadoran government declared
amnesty for political crimes from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Such difficulties are common for the victims of atrocities, who
must turn to American courts for a semblance of justice, said Patti
Blum, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley
who helped prepare the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 20 such lawsuits have been filed in the United
States against suspected war criminals, and only two have gone to a
jury, Blum said. The suits often are more symbolic than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Garcia and Casanova stands out because they
have established roots in the United States, so they have more at
stake, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he doesn't have any money and wonders whether the
lawsuit is an effort to embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   Blum said such lawsuits are part of a more aggressive effort by
human rights groups to hold suspected criminals responsible for
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Amnesty International established the Center for
Justice and Accountability in San Francisco specifically to pursue
these cases; the group has filed three lawsuits since August.

ABORTION BILL COMPROMISE UP FOR A VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
and KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A long-awaited compromise on a parental-notice
bill for minors seeking abortions, backed by Gov. George W. Bush,
awaited a vote from a key committee late Wednesday while talks on a
hate crimes bill fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   The substitute for Senate Bill 30, the parental notification
bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Florence Shapiro of Plano, was
drafted by Rep. Steve Wolens, a Dallas Democrat who has been little
trusted by anti-abortion forces in the past. It was Wolens' State
Affairs Committee that was expected to approve the bill, which has
been the subject of intensive negotiations for the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wolens delayed the vote first by announcing his
committee would instead take up a complicated electric deregulation
bill, with 80 to 100 amendments on the table. Republican leaders in
the House, the governor's office and activists on both sides of the
abortion debate insisted that an agreement had been reached with
Wolens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with legislators and developed a strong and
sound parental notification bill that the governor supports and
hopes the House will as well,'' said Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations deadlocked last week, Bush's office entered
talks on Mother's Day that were said to have lasted into early
Monday morning. Bush, a front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination, has promised social conservatives in his party that he
would push passage of a parental involvement bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to agree on a hate crimes bill have had less
success. Bush has not said where he stands on the measure, despite
pleas for his backing from the relatives of James Byrd Jr., the
black man in Jasper who was dragged to his death behind a pickup
truck last June.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton also challenged Bush to support the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several hours of closed-door negotiations on the hate
crimes bill Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans failed to forge a
compromise to get the issue to a floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful that after members get a chance to talk some
more and reflect on the discussions that have been had, we can come
to some middle ground Thursday,'' said Senate sponsor Rodney Ellis,
D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would toughen penalties for those convicted of
crimes motivated by prejudice against certain categories of people,
has been stalled in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee because
of Republican opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who is pushing passage of parental notification as its
Senate sponsor, is one of four Republicans on the committee. She
has said her objections to the bill stem from its specified
categories of people who would be protected from hate crimes. She
also has insisted that her opposition is not purely because of
protections for gay citizens.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ellis said the protection of gays is the major sticking
point, and he will not support a bill deleting that language. ``The
second largest category of hate crimes committed in Texas has been
on the basis of sexual orientation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With only 19 days remaining in this legislative session and a
Friday deadline for Senate committees to complete their work,
lawmakers have been scrambling to find ways to pry their bills out
of committee. But Ellis and others said they have offered no deals
on parental notification or other measures to get the hate crimes
bill moving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the substitute parental-notice bill expected to gain
approval from Wolens' committee contains trades neither side fully
likes.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day waiting period was waived for young women brought for
abortions by parents to undergo the procedure, pleasing abortion
rights supporters. In return, anti-abortion forces won their fight
to make sure only a judge could bypass the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad when the only way you can say `I told you so'
is when a young woman ends up badly hurt,'' said Margot Clarke,
spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Austin. ``It just makes you
hurt because it's bad. It's bad law.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, is expected to offer an
amendment to allow other adult family members, psychologists and
psychiatrists to be notified instead of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Marchant, R-Coppell, said the compromise includes an
agreement that Republican leaders will plead with party members to
respect the compromise on the House floor, where he expects it to
land within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very happy with the bill. In fact, if that becomes
the law, it's going to be OK,'' he said. Marchant is a House
Republican leader and sponsor of a similar measure killed last
session.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, said
anti-abortion activists who pushed for the bill are not happy with
the deal struck by their staunchest Republican allies in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have real problems being able to support it,
especially if a deal has been made that we can't amend it on the
floor,'' Price said. He added his group, along with the Christian
Coalition, was told by Republican negotiators that they'd have to
``take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also softens a parent-notice bill that passed the
Senate by allowing relatives, psychologists, psychiatrists and
others to offer moral support and act as advocates for young women
in their dealings with attorneys and judges. It also offers the
doctor stronger defenses against criminal misdemeanor charges that
could result in a maximum year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Price said anti-abortion forces fear the bill's definition of
abortion will make the law ineffective or unconstitutional. He also
perceives it could offer too much protection for doctors from
criminal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose abortion have held high hopes this year that a
parental notice bill would pass, and abortion rights advocates
conceded they would have difficulty stopping it. Even though Texas'
anti-abortion movement has proposed parental involvement bills
since Roe vs. Wade legalized abortion in 1973, the most intense
efforts began in the past six years.

TMS' GOSSAGE BACKS IRL FOR LONG HAUL
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days in the seat of a Harley-Davidson, on the long and
winding road from coast-to-coast, affords a man plenty of time to
think things through.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the 3,100 miles he logged between Fontana, Calif.,
and Trinity, N.C., as a member of Kyle Petty's Charity Ride Across
America last week, Eddie Gossage reached a conclusion about the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League and its fit at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   As advertised, the IRL's Longhorn 500 remains booked for
Saturday night, June 12, at the 1.5-mile racetrack with the
daunting 24-degree banked turns in Fort Worth. Same as it was
before the accident that killed three spectators and injured eight
during the IRL's VisionAire 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Concord, N.C., on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never once been any conversation about not running
that race on June 12,'' said Gossage, TMS' executive vice president
and general manager, dispelling reports the event here was in
jeopardy. ``We race. That's what we do. They're going to run the
Indianapolis 500 on May 30, and the winner and the rest of them
will come to Texas. And we'll go racing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since a three-car crash launched a wheel and
assorted debris over a 15-foot fence and into the Turn 4
grandstands at LMS, the future of open-wheel, oval-track racing has
come into question. Rightly so, because the most recent accident
occurred only nine months after a similar incident killed three
spectators and injured six during a CART FedEx Championship Series
race at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Those are staggering statistics when multiplied by the family
members and friends affected. Count Gossage among those calling for
an accelerated look at how open-wheel race cars traveling in excess
of 220 mph can be made safer for driver and spectator alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling on the IRL to address the cars quickly, and make
some changes there,'' said Gossage, who anticipates the fences at
TMS will be raised approximately 41/2 feet and further extended
over the racing surface before the June event. ``There's no way you
can guarantee total safety at any sporting event, whether it's race
cars, hockey pucks or foul balls. All we can do is everything we
can do to make this place as safe as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's fate at LMS ultimately rests with Bruton Smith, the
founder of Speedway Motorsports Inc., and H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler,
the track's president and Smith's confidant. Some have suggested
that Wheeler _ the sport's promoter extraordinaire _ was so shaken
by the deaths of the fans that he may be leaning toward ending LMS'
association with Tony George's fledgling IRL.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Humpy' has an autonomy that those of us who don't have 25
years in the company don't enjoy,'' Gossage said of his mentor. ``I
can't tell you what `Humpy's' going to do. But I can tell you that
we're going to run Indy cars this year, next year and from there
on. I'll sign a sanctioning agreement tomorrow for another three
years. And we will. Our fans approve of the IRL. It's a great
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hesitation in my mind. I'm in it for the long haul.
I had 3,100 miles to think about it.''
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Nelson takes level look at Winston Cup parity
</P>
<P>
   As NASCAR Winston Cup Series director, Gary Nelson is
responsible for maintaining a level playing field among the
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The job requires thick skin and working knowledge of the wind
tunnel, especially when one of the factories is preparing to debut
new or updated sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, introduction of the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
originally was scheduled for the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor
Speedway on May 30. However, the new Monte Carlo will not appear
until the 2000 season after a round of ``wind tunnel politics''
involving the car's aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson admittedly dabbled in the ``gray area'' of the NASCAR
rulebook en route to 21 victories as a Winston Cup crew chief, and
the 1983 championship with Bobby Allison. But Nelson has been
working the other side of the fence since 1992, his first season as
Winston Cup technical director.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that background _ and his experiences from the
introduction of the ``four-door'' Ford Taurus in 1998 _ Nelson has
maintained a hard-line on the 2000 Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits the racetrack, we want it equal,'' said Nelson,
comparing the Monte Carlo to the competing Taurus and Pontiac Grand
Prix. ``Down the road, we don't want to cut it to get it equal.
Basically, what we're saying is let's do all the development we can
before the car hits the racetrack and know as much as we can about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we learned a lot with the Taurus being a new car,
and being equal when we approved it. Then it got better by the time
three or four races went by, and we had to cut two inches off the
\Rrear\S spoiler to get it equal again. Given that history, we know
that a new-model car gains the most in the first few months. Then
it kind of levels off. Then it becomes an issue of, well, how many
races does that take?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the data collected at the Lockheed-Martin wind
tunnel in Marietta, Ga., in mid-March proved to NASCAR officials
that the current Monte Carlo, Taurus and Grand Prix are aerodynamic
equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to work to make sure the \R2000\S Monte Carlo
will be competitive when it hits the track,'' Nelson said. ``I
think the car is really neat-looking. Dimensionally, it's a work in
progress. When the car is to the point where everybody feels it
will race competitively, then we will approve it and say, `Here's
your templates, go build your cars.' ''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
STUCK AT 236 MPH
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat won the pole position for last year's Indianapolis
500 with a four-lap average speed of 223.503 mph in an
Oldsmobile-powered Dallara. Following preseason tests at the
2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway last month, Boat predicted the
1999 pole-winner will need a four-lap (10-mile) average of 225-plus
mph on May 22. Here are the four-lap qualification records at IMS
during this decade: Year Driver Chassis/engine Speed 1990 Emerson
Fittipaldi Penske/Chevy Indy V-8 225.301 1992 Arie Luyendyk
Lola/Ford-Cosworth V-8 229.127 1992 Roberto Guerrero Lola/Buick V-6
232.482 1996 Davy Jones Lola/Mercedes-Ilmor V-8 232.882 1996 Tony
Stewart Lola/Menard V-6 233.100 1996 Scott Brayton Lola/Menard V-6
233.178 1996 Arie Luyendyk Reynard/Ford-Cosworth V-8 236.986 1996
was the last year for turbocharged engines in the Indy Racing
League. Since 1997, IRL cars have been powered by normally
aspirated, production-based Oldsmobile Aurora and Nissan Infiniti
Indy V-8s.
QUICK HITS
ISC-PENSKE ROLL DICE
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's version of ``Monopoly'' has become more than just a
retro board game.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement announced between International Speedway
Corp., and Penske Motorsports, Inc., on Monday has left us with two
major players in the control of big-time motorsports facilities and
race dates _ the realigned ISC and Speedway Motorsports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the transaction, ISC will operate 10
facilities across the country that play host to 14 of 34 races on
the current NASCAR Winston Cup schedule. SMI chairman Bruton Smith
owns six speedways that are operating with nine Cup dates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill France Jr., the chairman and chief executive officer of
ISC, also is president of NASCAR in his spare time. Tom Thomson, an
analyst with First Union Capital Markets, told The Charlotte
Observer that the size of the new ISC will prompt NASCAR to be
``extremely careful about doing things that might be considered
detrimental to Speedway Motorsports.'' FORMULA ONE DATE SET
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway are anticipating a
crowd of 200,000 fans for the inaugural U.S. Grand Prix at
Indianapolis Formula One race on Sept. 24, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the first F1 race in the United States since 1991
are scheduled to go on sale later this year. Fans interested in
receiving an order form for tickets should send a postcard with
name and address to U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis, P.O. Box
24916, Speedway, In., 46224, or call (800) 822-4639. Forms also may
be obtained by e-mail at tickets &LR; brickyard.com. ALLEN PACKS POWER
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen of Arlington heads into qualifying
for the NHRA's Advance Auto Parts Nationals at Atlanta Dragway this
weekend with plenty of horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta will mark the first race of the year where we will
have our No. 1 and No. 2 race motors up to speed, and our car in
good working order,'' said Allen, driver of The Outlaw Fuel
Additives Pontiac Firebird. ``Finally, we should be able to see
what we're truly capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen and crew chief David Reher advanced to the final of this
race last year before losing against Mark Osborne. INJURED GIRL
IMPROVES
</P>
<P>
   The condition of 9-year-old Haley McGee was upgraded for the
first time _ from critical to serious _ at Carolinas
Medical/Children's Hospital in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday. McGee
suffered brain and lung injuries when struck by flying debris
during the IRL's VisionAire 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway on May 1.
Fans may send cards or toys to McGee in care of the hospital at
1000 Blythe Blvd., Charlotte, N.C., 28203. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get stuck in a rut and never get to do the things
they dream about. I was lucky enough at 25 _ not 45 _ to have my
mid-life crisis.''

PERCIVAL PITCH IS A HOT TOPIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after the incident, players from both teams
were still talking about Troy Percival's pitch that hit the
Yankees' Derek Jeter on the left hand in Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   It happened with one out in the ninth inning, putting the tying
run at the plate with the Nos.3, 4 and 5 hitters due up. That is
precisely why Percival said it was ludicrous for the Yankees to
suggest he hit Jeter on purpose. Particularly when the Angels were
13-19 and desperate for a win.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins and Yankees interim manager Don
Zimmer chatted behind the batting cage before Wednesday's game, and
the subject of the pitch came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought (Percival) did it on purpose,'' Collins
said. ``I don't care what anybody thinks. I know what's going on.
Did he try to come inside? Yes. Did he try to hit him? No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical 0-2 fastball, I came up and in,'' Percival
said. ``I wanted to move him off the plate. He was diving out over
the plate like he always does. I've been throwing those guys inside
all my career _ Jeter, (Paul) O'Neill, (Bernie) Williams. That was
the first time I hit one of them. I have respect for every one of
those guys over there, but if they're going to (complain) about
pitching inside, too bad. I'll go out the next time and I'll pitch
inside again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter glared at Percival after being hit but wouldn't say he was
sure it was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have problems hitting his spots with any other
hitter,'' he said. ``Whether he tried to hit me intentionally or
not, I don't know. But he definitely was coming up and in. If
you're going to throw that hard, you don't go for somebody's
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said he could remember Percival hitting Yankees hitters
``two, three or four times.'' Percival, though, had hit only one
Yankee in his career before Tuesday _ Russ Davis in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Second baseman Randy Velarde was in the starting
lineup Wednesday even though his lower back is still stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel great, but it's not killing me,'' he said. ``I
want to be out there playing. I've taken a year-and-a-half off
already (recovering from elbow surgery).''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, his left ankle still considerably swollen, will
remain as the designated hitter for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the third inning, I can't even stand on it,'' Vaughn said
of playing the field. ``As the DH, I can get off it. Before, it was
causing me to change my stance because it was just fatigued.
Between at-bats now I can do what I've got to do to take pressure
off it.''

   NEW YORK _ Christie's inaugurated the main salesroom in its new
Rockefeller Center home Wednesday night with an auction of 40
Impressionist and 19th-century artworks that was so strong it
surprised even the most seasoned experts.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $65.9 million, well above its $63 million low
estimate. Of the 40 works on offer, only four failed to sell. The
sale surpassed Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and modern art on
Tuesday evening, at which 48 works sold for a total of $55.5
million and 18 failed to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices paid Wednesday night for what were a mixed bag
of paintings, drawings and sculpture had the audience baffled. Some
said the scarcity of top-quality works for sale this season had
buyers scrambling to get what they could.
</P>
<P>
   Others said buyers could have been seduced by the glamor of
Rockefeller Center. Still others speculated that Christopher Burge,
the chairman of Christie's in America and the evening's auctioneer,
exhibited an uncanny talent for gently but effectively coaxing
buyers to keep bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Christopher Burge inspire a willing suspension of
disbelief?'' asked a London dealer, Ivor Braka.
</P>
<P>
   By far the evening's star painting, van Gogh's ``Canal With
Washerwomen'' (or ``La Roubine du Roi'') of 1888, a vividly colored
landscape that captures the spot where the women of Arles did their
laundry. The painting was for sale at Sotheby's in 1984, when it
sold for $1.7 million. Wednesday night the painting was bought by
Joseph Albritton, a Washington collector, for $19.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's took a gamble. Before the sale it had offered a
guarantee (a minimum sum promised to the seller regardless of a
sale's outcome) and estimated it would sell for $20 million. That
was not far off. (Final prices include the auction house's
commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the
rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   That a buyer was bidding for himself in the salesroom was
unusual. While collectors raised paddles in the 1980s, the practice
has disappeared in the less conspicuous '90s, but it was
surprisingly in evidence Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another throwback from the boom years of the '80s was an Asian
man taking pictures of the bidding. (Christie's officials said no
Asians were buyers last night.) And a couple in their 30s, who held
hands during the auction and identified themselves only as from
Venezuela, kissed after each of the two lots they bought.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of works offered Wednesday night were from Japan,
where banks that collected feverishly during the boom of the 1980s
are now in financial distress. Christie's has many paintings owned
by the Lake Co., the Japanese consumer-loan concern that was bought
last year by GE Capital, the financial services arm of General
Electric. Lake sent Christie's about 500 works valued at $250
million that they plan to sell over the next several years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Up for sale Wednesday night was Braque's ``Landscape at
l'Estaque'' (1906), a Fauve landscape that was expected to fetch
$1.5 million to $2 million. It was bought by a telephone bidder
identified only as a European collector for $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lake was also selling Monet's ``Garden of Vetheuil'' (1881),
which sold at Christie's in 1990 for $4.9 million. Wednesday night
it carried an estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. It fetched
$2.7 million and was also bought by a telephone buyer after five
bidders tried to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   This week every sale has been littered with Monets. (Thirteen in
all have been on offer.) Christie's was selling eight, and all but
one sold. Among the best: ``Bridge in Monet's Garden'' (1895-96),
thought to be the first view of his newly constructed Japanese
bridge, had four bidders hopping. Estimated to bring $7 million to
$10 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone buyer for $5.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Another telephone bidder spent $5.2 million for Monet's
``Antibes, Seen From the Salis Gardens'' (1888). It had been
estimated to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million. One of the
sale's casualties, Monet's 1899 view of Charing Cross Bridge in
late afternoon light, was thought to fetch $5 million to $7
million. No buyer was willing to pay $3.8 million.

RUBIN QUITS TREASURY JOB AS DEPUTY TO GET NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who over the
last four years has presided over one of the most remarkable
economic performances in American history, said Wednesday he will
resign in July.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton quickly announced that he will nominate Larry
Summers, a former Harvard University economics professor and the
deputy treasury secretary, to take over the Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   The president also will name Stuart Eizenstat, the
undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural
affairs, to succeed Summers.
</P>
<P>
   A product of Wall Street, Rubin, 60, leaves office as the
nation's 70th treasury secretary as the U.S. economy continues to
churn ahead in the longest economic expansion in peacetime history.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate remains low, inflation is
well-tamed, and the federal government is racking up its first
budget surpluses in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a Rose Garden ceremony, hailed Rubin ``as the most
effective treasury secretary since Alexander Hamilton'' at the
founding of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who along with Rubin
and Summers is credited with keeping the American economic
juggernaut steaming ahead, called Rubin ``one of the most effective
secretaries of the treasury in this nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rubin described his years at the White House as
``all consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is time for me to go home to New York,'' Rubin
said. ``In doing so, I am absolutely confident that this
administration will not miss a beat with respect to the economic
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   When word of Rubin's resignation first broke Wednesday morning,
the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 213 points. But the stock
market quickly rebounded as those early reports were confirmed by
the White House and as investors realized Summers would be
succeeding his longtime boss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow ended the day down 25.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the news was confirmed, the market came back,''
said Bryan Jordan, economics analyst for Banc One Investment
Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``It's really uncertainty that's the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   A former co-chairman and 26-year veteran of the New York
investment banking firm Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Rubin joined the White
House in January 1993 to head the National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he succeeded Texan Lloyd Bentsen as treasury
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin took over just as the Clinton administration had decided
to help bail out Mexico after that country's disastrous peso
devaluation. He would later help steer the country as an economic
and currency crisis would swirl around the world, bludgeoning
economies from Thailand to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Rubin was an advocate for budget discipline,
a strong dollar and U.S. support for the International Monetary
Fund, the world's emergency bailout organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Rubin took over as treasury secretary, the Dow was hovering
around at 3,800 and the dollar was trading for about 84 Japanese
yen. On Wednesday, the market closed above 11,000, with the dollar
trading at nearly 121 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin had made no secret of his desire to leave the
administration and return to New York, where his wife, Judy
Oxenberg Rubin, has continued to live.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed on as the world economic crisis rage and as the
impeachment trial brought official Washington to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many economists viewed Rubin's announcement
Wednesday as an indication the White House believes the economic
and political crises of the last few years have finally stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin ... waited for the moment when at least he saw the
crisis subsiding,'' said David Jones, chief economist for the New
York securities dealer Aubrey G. Lanston. If he wanted to resign
``this is probably the best time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Republican-controlled Capitol Hill, Rubin's resignation was
met with regret.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Rubin ``intelligent and sincere,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, noted: ``Of all
the officials in the Clinton administration, he has had more
credibility with me and, I think, with Congress than any other
official.''
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Houston,
called Rubin ``a strong and sometimes solitary voice within the
Clinton administration for open markets and fiscal discipline,''
while Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, called Rubin ``an exemplary
public servant, the best a country could ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Summers, 44, does not bring market
experience to the job. Instead, Summers hails from academia. In
1983, Summers became the youngest tenured professor in Harvard's
history, and a decade later was named the nation's outstanding
economist under the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1993, Summers served as chief economist at the
World Bank. In April 1993 he joined the Treasury Department as
undersecretary for international affairs. He was named deputy
treasury secretary in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Summers ``as brilliant, able, a critical part of
our economic team during the entire life of this administration,''
while Greenspan described him as ``a person of extraordinary talent
and judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   During the world economic crisis, Summers was frequently the
administration's point man during negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund and the troubled economies around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, however, has gained a reputation for having an abrasive
personality, while Asian leaders during the economic crisis
complained of what they described as a condescending tone, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Summers and Eizenstat _ who has spearheaded the
administrations' efforts to help Holocaust survivors retrieve
assets stolen half a century ago _ will have to be confirmed by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate signaled Wednesday that Summers
would likely face a fairly warm reception on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, will oversee Summers' confirmation, said in a prepared
statement his committee ``has had a good working relationship with
Mr. Summers in his current post,'' while Senate Majority Trent
Lott, R-Miss., noted that since Summers had been through the
confirmation process once already he did not anticipate substantial
problems.

HIGH SCHOOLERS FISH LIKE VETERANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A light touch with the trolling motor inched the
bass boat closer to the shadowy targets only he could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish are up there for one reason, for me to catch 'em,''
said the steely fisherman behind the polarized shades.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence belied the age of the expert. Wise beyond his years,
15-year-old Greg Glogow of Valencia has made thousands of casts
like those taken on a recent Thursday afternoon at Castaic Lagoon.
And with uncanny skill, the Hart High sophomore has landed more
trophy largemouths than most bass anglers his age _ or any age, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I don't even see the fish,'' said Glogow's No.1 fishing
partner, Steve, his dad. ``I'll say, `What are you throwing at? And
he'll reel in the fish and say, `This fish.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glogow's five 10-plus-pound bass have turned the heads of
professional guides and area bass fanatics, and his personal-best
13-pound, 1-ounce bruiser caught at the lagoon in March is a
pending junior world record for boys ages 11 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed with bass fishing. I had a goal to set a world
record,'' explained Glogow, who is on the water twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising words from someone so young. But upon closer
examination, occasionally other high schoolers share an
overwhelming passion for the rod and reel, so much so that they
often think of little else. By the accounts of family, friends and
fellow anglers, it's a healthy infatuation that keeps them out of
trouble, keeps the family together, keeps spawning new anglers and
keeps producing big fish. Call them hot rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says I've got fish on the brain, and that's about it,''
said Steve Greanias, 17, of Granada Hills. The Crespi High senior
has kept a detailed fishing log of weekly trips since 1996, founded
his school's angling club and enjoys helping others hook up nearly
as much as he likes to himself. ``I haven't gone completely
overboard; I'm on the rail.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Glogow and Greanias are destined to be big-shot anglers,
Long Beach's Charlie Shane is going to make sure they play by the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a living out of being on the water,'' said
Shane, 15, a freshman at Lakewood High who fishes weekly in the
summer, preferring to pursue yellowtail, and aspires to be a game
warden. ``I want to keep fish numbers high so we can still catch
them for years to come. Besides, I'd like to be able to fish while
I work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may express concerns over teens becoming so entirely
immersed in one interest, perhaps at the expense of other important
issues, such as family or school.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Greanias' father, Chris, puts it: ``Steve's an excellent
student (honor roll, 3.8 grade point average) and while I think he
could do even better if he dedicated more time to his studies, kids
this age are going to be obsessed with something; I'm glad it's
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, fishing crosses generational lines. It draws the
family closer because it's something we can all do together.''
</P>
<P>
   Glogow's mother, Lisa, echoed the sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased about it. I think that it keeps Greg out of
trouble, off the streets and away from hanging out with the wrong
crowd. I think it's a real clean sport,'' she said. ``I think all
kids need to find something that they are good at, and I think he
has found that something.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the importance of the accomplishments of such
adolescent anglers, the International Game Fish Association added
in 1997 to its record keeping a category for junior world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just as good as an adult record,'' said Doug Blodgett,
records secretary for the IGFA in Dania, Fla. ``It shows that (a
record holder) is a younger person and they can do something as
exceptional, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Greanias has a raging case of fishing pox. He's such a
regular on the Ellie-M charter boat out of Oxnard's Capt. Hook's
Sportfishing that he volunteers to assist other anglers, cleans
fish and scrub the boats, much like a pinhead, or apprentice
deckhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an avid fisherman,'' said Mike Dantona, a manager of Fish
'n Fools tackle shop in Granada Hills. ``He knows the routine as
well as any adult, or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Greanias' largest fish to date is a 25-pound dorado. He caught
and released 45 trout in two hours on Robinson Creek out of
Bridgeport last year, and once in a day boated 20 barracuda and a
like number of sand bass, returning them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure that when I have kids I can take them out
there and they can catch 20 sand bass in a day,'' said Greanias,
who graduates this month and wants to attend Moorpark College next
year and then go on to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic tinkerer who makes lures, bass plugs, rod holders and
gaffs in the garage, his favorite part of fishing may be ensuring
others have as much fun as he does. ``He tends to help other
fishermen and fish less for himself,'' Dantona said. ``There's not
enough people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   With braces on his teeth, baggy pants and a 5-foot-1 frame, the
green-eyed Glogow doesn't fit the image of a bass freak, yet he
eventually wants to fish the professional circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as a little kid, but, I mean, I'm
definitely getting better at it as far as catching big fish,'' said
the understated Glogow. ``In general, yeah, I hold my own.''
</P>
<P>
   His success speaks for itself, with his first behemoth _ 11
pounds, 13 ounces _ coming at age 11. The finicky 13-pounder was a
story in itself. It finally bit on a live waterdog after Glogow
took it upon himself to walk to a nearby tackle shop and buy
6-pound line after realizing the fish was too line shy to approach
the 10-pound monofilament he had on. Dad netted the brute on the
first scoop; ``He knew it was life or death,'' Glogow said.
</P>
<P>
   Castaic carpenter and bass-fishing guide Pat Buckley admires
Glogow's quick learning and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll work on one fish, like that 13-pounder, that most people
would have gave up on,'' said Buckley, whose best bass is a
14-pounder. ``It's a great accomplishment for a guy his age. It
would be a great accomplishment for anybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FROM THE MAN, ER, THE TEEN
</P>
<P>
   Bass-angling phenom Greg Glogow offers five easy tips for
targeting Southland largemouths:
</P>
<P>
   Light line, small baits: Try 6-pound line and a 3-inch plastic
worm, with a size No.5 or 7 split shot secured 24 inches above the
bait.
</P>
<P>
   Sun up, wind down: It's the best combination to improve odds for
success when sight-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Be in tune with the equipment: Make sure the reels drag (and
spool tension for a baitcaster reel) is set according to the type
of bait. If unsure, inquire at a tackle shop.
</P>
<P>
   Have patience: When in an area where fish have been spotted,
stay until you catch one or exhaust your options. Some anglers move
to new spots too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Have a plan and stick to it: There are only so many good hours
of fishing _ mainly from 6 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
_ so don't waste your time changing technique in haphazard fashion.

COMMENTARY: MISSISSIPPI LEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, I decided ..., to delete phrase `which is not
even a town' after Robinsville.) 
 (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNICA COUNTY, Miss. _ I stood beside the cotton field in the
morning quiet of the Delta and listened to the echoes of the
tortured souls from years and decades and centuries past. To enter
Mississippi has always been, in my view, to descend to a lower
place, a world of fanatical race hatred in which blacks were
condemned by whites to a perpetual state of humiliation and often
gruesome suffering.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told that Mississippi is changing. Casino gambling has
flooded some areas with money and jobs and is threatening to lift
at least part of the state into the 20th century. Many of the jobs
have gone to blacks, and many of the gamblers are black. This has
been hailed as great progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go into a casino and sit down and play blackjack,''
said C. Penn Owen Jr., a 63-year-old white man and one of the most
powerful farmers in the Delta, ``I may be sitting next to my _''
This was during an interview in Owen's office. He stopped, looked
up and then started again. ``Very often there are colored people in
this community that I know well,'' he said, ``and it's kind of fun
to mix and mingle.''
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical planter, pulled by a tractor, moved slowly along
the field. Now a yellow plane, a crop duster, came into view,
flying low, and the stillness of the moment was lost. The cotton
field, which belongs to Owen, is in Robinsonville, an
unincorporated area of northern Tunica County, one of the most
rural parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to come here because something strange is going on.
There are only 8,500 people in the entire county, which is spread
over 460 square miles and consists mostly of cotton fields, soybean
farms and vacant land. Most of the people are black, poor and
poorly educated. There is only a tiny handful of children, nearly
all of them black and desperately poor, in the vicinity of
Robinsonville. And yet the movers and shakers at the local, county
and state levels want to build a brand new $8 million elementary
school for 500 pupils in Robinsonville. And only in Robinsonville.
</P>
<P>
   A new school in the middle of nowhere. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Robinsonville is just south of the largest and most successful
cluster of casinos in the state. The entire area is remarkably
empty except for the casinos. Most of the casino workers commute
from other parts of the state and from Memphis, just a few miles
farther north.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the proposed school was sold to the county Board of
Education by none other than Owen. And Owen is planning to build an
upscale residential development that will begin practically on the
school grounds and then fan out in a series of progressively wider
arcs.
</P>
<P>
   He needs the school to serve as a magnet for the upscale
families he wants to draw to his development. Those families will
almost surely be white. Hardly any of the black people in Tunica
County, not even those employed by the casinos, will be able to
afford to buy or rent a home in Owen's development.
</P>
<P>
   For many years a small number of black families have lived in
dreadful shacks on property in Robinsonville that is owned by Owen.
One by one they are being forced out, and as they leave the shacks
are bulldozed and the rubble burned.
</P>
<P>
   Penda Hair, a Washington lawyer who is working with a group of
black Tunica residents who are angry about the plan, put the matter
plainly: ``They are attempting to create an all-white, or virtually
all-white, enclave with its own school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with stiffening opposition, proponents of the
state-of-the-art school are now saying most of its first students
will be black youngsters drawn from miles around, but that white
students will be added as white families move into Robinsonville.
What appears to be happening is grander than the simple creation of
a white enclave. Owen is not the only wealthy plantation owner
(yes, they still call them plantations) who is planning to build in
Robinsonville. There are others, and their goal seems to be nothing
less than the creation of a powerhouse, upscale, incorporated
community _ in other words, a prosperous, largely white town in an
overwhelmingly black county that has always ruthlessly exploited
its majority population.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Mississippi.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: COMMUTER TAX GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 1st graf, 3rd sentence to add heated state Senate
contest in Orange County, as well Rockland.) 
 (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, New York's politicians outdo themselves
with acts of destructive one-upmanship. It is happening again, as
the state legislature moves toward repealing the New York City tax
imposed on commuters, blowing a deep hole in the city's finances.
The repeal of the tax is to be rammed through Albany next week
because both Republicans and Democrats think it will help them win
a heated state Senate contest in Rockland and Orange Counties.
Democrats are also eager to embarrass Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. They
want Giuliani, a Republican, to beg to keep the tax on the very
suburbanites whose support he will be seeking in his campaign for
United States Senate.
</P>

   The commuter tax, enacted in 1966 and raised in 1971, is paid by
nearly 800,000 people who work in the city but live outside it.
Since these workers benefit enormously from the city's police,
fire, sanitation and transportation services, it is only logical
for them to shoulder part of the burden of paying for them. The tax
is only about an eighth of the income tax that city residents pay,
and it has remained stable while city taxes have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says he opposed repealing the commuter tax, but he has
been slow to mount a full-scale attack. This, however, is no time
to let political niceties stand in the way of the city's interests.
If the commuter tax is repealed for everyone, it would cost the
city $360 million in revenues. If it is repealed only for residents
of suburbs in New York state, it would cost $208 million. A partial
repeal would also be challenged as discriminating against New
Jersey and Connecticut residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state Senate took the initiative on
the tax, and plans to pass it next week. Joseph Bruno, the Senate
majority leader, supports Giuliani's Senate campaign and may think
he is doing the mayor a favor by handing out a bonus to
suburbanites. Giuliani must say ``no thanks'' and threaten a legal
challenge to the legislature's acting in defiance of the city
council. He should also make his opposition clear to the
Democratic-controlled assembly and to Gov. George Pataki, who no
doubt is amused at the mayor's political predicament but should
still side with him in opposing the repeal. Everyone in this battle
right now is playing games. But if the tax is canceled, New York
City will be in trouble. &QL;

33 CHARGED IN BANKER'S FRAUDULENT LOAN SCHEME

   NEW YORK _ He was a former loan officer at NatWest with a
master's degree in finance. But federal prosecutors say that Gary
J. Confredo became a sham artist, helping clients who lacked credit
_ including a part-time dancer at Chippendales _ to obtain $20
million in illegal loans from 11 banks.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his own expertise, Confredo arranged to have phony
loan documents prepared and submitted on behalf of his clients, who
owned plumbing and heating companies, an adult bookstore, a law
firm, a dental lab, a caviar bar and a delicatessen, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story on the street,'' said an associate of Confredo's,
according to court records, was that he ``could get a loan for a
homeless person.''
</P>
<P>
   Confredo, 36, was ultimately arrested, and pleaded guilty in
February to five counts, including bank fraud and making false
statements. He is in jail awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said they had
charged 33 others in the scheme, including business owners who had
obtained the illegal loans and three accountants and one lawyer who
assisted in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said that
many of the illegal loans went quickly into default, resulting in
losses to the institutions of $10 million to $15 million. The
defendants had used the money in some cases to pay for such
personal expenses as home improvements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally hundreds of false loan applications were made to New
York area banks,'' Ms. White said, including more than 100
fraudulent applications to Citibank alone.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities Wednesday displayed copies of documents that
they said were altered as part of the scheme. One bank statement,
for example, showed that a photography business in Melville, N.Y.,
had bounced checks and that at the end of May 1997 had a negative
balance of $157, a Federal prosecutor, Jennifer M. Moore, said.
</P>
<P>
   But records show that one of Confredo's associates doctored the
document in a computer, creating a forged version showing no
bounced checks and a positive balance of about $27,000. The owner
eventually was granted a $75,000 loan, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court papers that Confredo shared his
expertise with others, including his ``understanding of how to
abuse the commercial loan process.''
</P>
<P>
   His associates referred to him as ``the Wizard,'' said Kevin
Donovan, of the FBI's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confredo repeatedly boasted to his business associates that
crime pays,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Confredo's lawyer, Howard R. Leader, had no comment Wednesday.
