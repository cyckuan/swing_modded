<HEADLINE> Iraq Dismisses Iran's Statement on POWs as Baseless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today categorically dismissed
the Iranian statements that Tehran no longer holds any Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs), saying the statements are "baseless and
mere repetition of previous allegations" by Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency (INA), a spokesman from
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the International Red Cross has
confirmed the presence of over 20,000 Iraqi POWs in Iran in
addition to some 60,000 missing in action during the 1980-1988
Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
According to an INA report, Iranian general Abdullah Najafi
denied in a statement issued Sunday that Iran was still holding
Iraqi POWs and accused Iraq of non-cooperation in settling the POW
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said Iran has grossly violated agreements
signed by both countries and Geneva conventions in dealing with
the POW issue. Tehran is using this matter for political purposes,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refuted Iranian officials' allegations that Red
Cross representatives had interviewed 10,000 Iraqi POWs who
expressed their desire to stay in Iran as refugees. It is a mere
lie and a distortion of fact, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq has released all the Iranian POWs and
sent them back to Iran under the supervision of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. There are no Iranian POWs in Iraq
apart from those who refused to return and who have informed the
Red Cross of their wish, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The POW issue between Iraq and Iran has remained unsettled and
hampered the normalization of bilateral relations since the end of
the Iraq-Iran war in 1988.

<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that steps would be taken at a G7 summit next
month to promote closer ties between Russia and the world's seven
richest industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue this process of convergence with the
Russian Federation ... I think that further steps will come from
the Lyon summit." said Dini after meeting his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The G7, comprising the United States, Germany, Japan, France,
Canada, Britain and Italy, will meet in the eastern French city of
Lyon on June 27-29. Russia will join the talks on the last day.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he and Primakov had also discussed the peace process
in Bosnia and agreed that a meeting in the northern Italian city
of Florence on June 13-14 will give fresh impetus to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Dini expressed the hope that general elections would be held in
Bosnia no later than September, adding that situation there had
improved since the signing of the Dayton agreement last December
but still left much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also held talks today Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro. He was due to meet the "troika" of the European Union's

<HEADLINE> 1995 Sees 30 Percent More Natural Disasters Than in 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide natural disasters totaled
213 in 1995, 30 percent up from 1994, said the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in an annual
report published today.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's natural disasters, 84 occurred in Asia, followed
by the Americas with 69, an increase of 80 percent over 1994, and
Europe with 31, up 48 percent, said the IFRC in its 1996 World
Disasters Report.
</P>
<P>
Between 1970 and 1994, global disasters excluding wars exceeded
5,000, affecting more than 128 million people each year, including
about 150,000 deaths, and causing annual economic losses estimated
at 500 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among all the disasters, drought, often leading to famine, and
flood are the two most devastating, each affecting well over 50
million people annually.
</P>
<P>
Floods cause the heaviest economic losses, about 183 billion
dollars worldwide every year during 1990-94, followed by high
winds, which resulted in losses of around 179 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Asia is the area hardest hit by natural disasters, in
particular by flood and high winds. From 1970 to 1994, nearly 630
of the 1,446 floods and 683 of the 1,609 high winds occurred in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Africa suffers most from drought, accounting for more than 270
of the global total of about 440 occurring between 1970 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, due to ethnic, religious, territorial and other
disputes, 30 major armed conflicts occurred worldwide, compared to
36 in 1990 and most of them were in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
By early 1996, most of the conflicts in Africa had been ended
or otherwise reduced to a lower level and so had been those in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the disintegration of the Soviet Union
and former Yugoslavia led to conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia, Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
All the conflicts have made millions of refugees and even more
internally displaced persons (INPs). In 1995, refugees totaled
some 15 million, down from over 16 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Africa accounted for more than 5.3 million of them. Among
African nations, Zaire alone hosted a total of 1.3 million
refugees from neighboring countries, while Rwanda was the origin
country of more than 1.5 million refugees.
</P>
<P>
An enormous increase was registered in INPs during the last
decade. The number of displaced people stood at 22 million in
1995, down from a record high of more than 26 million in 1994,
including nearly 12 million in Africa and 1.3 million in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of refugees, displaced people and other
war-affected populations has led to a corresponding increase in
global humanitarian efforts. Between 1990 and 1995, the budget of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees rose from 500 million
dollars to 1.5 billion dollars.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Vice President Godfrey
Miyanda said today the government does not intend to declare a
state of emergency to stop the destructive activities by the
Black Mamba, a secret anti-government group in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on local television, Miyanda said the Zambian
government will not think of declaring a state of emergency
because the situation is under control.
</P>
<P>
The government will do so only if the situation worsens in
the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Black Mamba claimed responsibility for a bomb blast that
caused damages to the State House wall fence two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda appealed to all opposition parties to be non-partisan
over the new constitution because it is a national matter.
</P>
<P>
If individual parties have grievances they needs to air
through proper channels, he added.
</P>
<P>
President of the opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP) Kenneth Kaunda described the new constituIion as " an
apartheid constitution that grades the citizens", vowing to fight
against it.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution bars Kaunda from contesting presidency in
this year's general elections because his parents are Malawians.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Strengthen Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR RE SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Russia have
decided to strengthen their historical relationship by increasing
trade through their National Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
This was resolved here on Tuesday between Dr. David Mwaibula,
President of Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industries and
Agriculture (TCCIA) and the Ambassador of the Russian Federation,
Kenesh Kulmatov.
</P>
<P>
"We want to start effective communication and trade links
between our two chambers so that we may shape up our long time
political relationship into a trading one," the Russian ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
He added such relationship is important at this time because
the two countries have similarities in the on-going structural
adjustment and liberalization of trade affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have very special trade links between investors and
businessmen of our two countries and be able to participate in the
global market together as old friends and partners," he further
said.
</P>
<P>
TCCIA President Mwaibula said the discussions were in a very
preliminary stage but very crucial for Tanzania's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia like Tanzania, has decided to let the
private sector play a big role in the economic development of the
country and thus the two has something in common to discuss.
</P>
<P>
"Our two national chambers are going to organize a business and
investors meeting and discussion so that we may compete fairly and
equally as business partners," Mwaibula explained.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania would take advantage of Russia's technology in
mining, infrastructure, telecommunication and roads which are all
important to the country's economic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mwaibula was elected last Friday to lead a committee which
would prepare modalities for the establishment of trade links
between Tanzania and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Iran Worries about U.S. Relay Station in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today publicly expressed its
concern regarding the construction of a Voice of America Radio
relay station in Kuwait, an official press said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's concern was voiced by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas
Maleki in a report carried in today's Persian-language daily
Iran. He had expressed Iran's concern during his recent visit to
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Maleki said that Iran's political, economic and cultural ties
with Kuwait are close, and that is why Kuwait should not do
anything that would weaken these ties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official asked the Kuwait authorities to take the
necessary steps to alleviate Iran's concern about the
construction of VOA relay.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti authorities try to justify his country's decision
on the construction of the station on the grounds that it would be
involved in the propagation of news and information in the region
and it is not intended to be used against Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian sources, Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
have already voiced similar sentiments while meeting with visit
Kuwait officials in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
There was rumor spreading in Tehran that the United States will
use its relay station in Kuwait to beam special Persian language
programs to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has termed the use of
satellite television as one of the biggest instruments of the
American cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei has openly supported the ban of satellite dish in the
country and repeatedly called on the society to observe the
Islamic value against Western cultural invasion.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Eager to Rejoin World, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The priority of the Yugoslav
policy is the consistent realization of obligations from the peace
accords and full reintegration into the international community,
Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kontic told a press conference that the peace process in the
Balkan region would be secured only on condition that all Dayton
agreement signatories apply the provisions of the peace accords
and the agreement on the Eastern Slavonia region, and that the
international community treats equally all sides involved in the
crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said his country was eager to be reintegrated into the world
community and key international financial institutions to get
financial aid for the devastated economy of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Without a stable economic situation in Yugoslavia, there could
be no stable political situation in the whole Balkan region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia still has a long way to go before it can fully
rejoin the international community and the United Nations although
it has been recognized diplomatically by most European countries.
</P>
<P>
The premier said Belgrade is also ready to have mutual
recognition with other republics of the former Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia has established relations with Macedonia and recognized
Bosnia but has not yet have diplomatic ties with Slovenia and
Croatia due to some disputes over assets division of former
Yugoslavia or territory.
</P>
<P>
Talking about sanctions against Yugoslavia, Kontic said
"although the sanctions have been suspended, Yugoslavia continues
to be surrounded by an outer wall of sanctions which prevents its
participation in international political, financial and trade
organizations," Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has recently been threatened to have international
sanctions reimposed if it did not fully comply with the Dayton
agreement by pressing Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic,
twice indicted as war criminal, to step down and stand on trial in
the Hague international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed in May 1992,
were suspended last November by the U.N. Security Council but
would not be totally lifted until the start of the general
elections in Bosnia in September. Sanctions would be reintroduced
any time if the international community finds that Yugoslavia, one
of the signatories of the Dayton agreement, fails to make its
commitment to the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Kontic warned that no additional conditions and blackmail of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and
Montenegro, are acceptable, especially since all reasons "which
served as an excuse for the imposition of the sanctions in the
first place" have long been overcome.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the Federal government's aim is to get
all forms of sanctions lifted as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is ready to fulfill all economic conditions
necessary for the normalization of relations with world trade and

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account deficit
in April reached 2.21 billion U.S. dollars, the highest monthly
deficit since 1950, according to the Bank of Korea here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure brings the total for the first four months of the
year to 6.56 billion dollars, up 53.6 percent from the same period
last year. The four-month deficit surpassed this year's target of
6.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit in April soared to a record high of
1.51 billion dollars as a result of faster import increase in the
month, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
April's invisible trade, such as insurance, travel and
transport, incurred a deficit of 580 million dollars. The balance
of unrequited transfers, including remittances of school tuition,
was 110 million dollars in the red.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmaker-Elect Indicted for Election Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office today indicted a lawmaker-elect from the main
opposition party National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) without
physical detention on election fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ki-moon, elected from Inchon City, was charged with
electioneering before legally allowed and buying votes by
distributing about 60,000 U.S. dollars to voters during campaign
for the National Assembly elections in April.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the sixth successful candidate in the general elections
who has been indicted for campaign violations.
</P>
<P>
The other five, who were also indicted without physical
detention, include two lawmakers-elect of the ruling New Korea
Party (NKP).
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will soon indict without detention another
lawmaker-elect of the ruling NKP, Kim Il-yoon, who allegedly
distributed some 40,000 U.S. dollars in gifts and money to voters.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Kim will be the seventh and the last
lawmaker-elect to be indicted for election fraud.
</P>
<P>
In April's elections, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim
Young-sam won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the
299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the party later induced opposition and independent
lawmakers-elect to join it to secure 151 seats -- more than half
of the total parliamentary seats.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Casts Ballots in Western Cape Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today walked more than a kilometre from his
official Cape Town residence to a nearby polling station to vote
in the long-delayed local government elections in the Western
Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
After casting his three ballots at the Westerford High
School's polling station, a beaming mandela told the voters that
the poll was a historic day for residents in the Cape Metropole.
</P>
<P>
For the first time they would have the opportunity to elect
people in whom they had confidence instead of being represented
by individuals who had been foisted on them by previous regimes,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's walk from nis residence to the polling station,
which brought the traffic along the route to a complete halt,
caused a headache for his bodyguards as he was mobbed by
autograph seekers and well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
The president then visited a number of polling stations in the
Cape Metropole and said those areas seemed to be running well.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to enthusiastic supporters in the Grabouw area on
Wednesday afternoon, Mandela said he was happy with the way the
elections had gone thus far.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was not so much the result of the election
which ''we all desire to be in favour of our party'', but the
fact that the results of the election would lead to credible and
legitimate representative institutions.
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million registered voters are expected to cast their
ballots on Wednesday in the Western Cape first non-racial local
government elections, which was postponed from November last year
due to the ward boundary disputes among the main political
parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the provincial voting
co-ordination centre, voting was going smoothly in most areas
thus far, although problems were being experienced with voters'
names not appearing on voters rolls.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Western Cape poll would be a
two-horse race for power between the African National Congress
and the National Party, both were confident that they would win
the elections.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Calls For UN Observers in Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- President Paul Diya of Cameroon has
sent a letter to the Security Council of the United Nations,
suggesting that UN observers be stationed on the disputed Bakassi
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion, according to the News Agency of Nigeria today,
is aimed at preventing any renewed confrontation between Cameroon
and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The letter, addressed to the president of the council, was
written to brief the UN body on the mission undertaken by the
leaders of Nigeria and Cameroon between May 9 and May 16.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, Nigeria has accepted in principle the
idea of sending a UN fact-finding mission to the peninsula in
deference to an International Court of Justice order urging the
two countries to lend assistance to a UN mission to Bakassi,
although Nigeria's head of state Sani Abacha preferred a
bilateral solution of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon have clashed repeatedly since 1994 over
the oil-rich peninsula, and Cameroon has twice taken the issue to
the UN as well as to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the two leaders agreed to hold a summit,
to be hosted by Togo, as part of efforts to settle the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Becomes World's Most Competitive Country: WEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore becomes the most
competitive country in the world in 1996, followed by Hong Kong
and New Zealand, said a competitiveness report published today by
the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
The United States comes in the fourth, followed by Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Norway, Canada, Taiwan of China and Malaysia, on the
WEF list of competitiveness -- the ability of a country or region
to achieve sustained high rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10, five are small, open economies practising low
tax rates, with New Zealand being the new star thanks to a decade
of structural and policy reforms, concluded the report which used
new measuring approaches highlighting an economy's institutions
and strategies.
</P>
<P>
"In our meaning, an economy is 'internationally competitive' if
its institutions and policies will support sustained and rapid
economic growth," said U.S. professor Jeffery Sachs, chief advisor
of the report.
</P>
<P>
The WEF said its approach excluded the element of domestic
economic strength while putting in new variables such as the index
of real exchange rate misalignment in assessing a country's
prospects for economic growth in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Eight factors were considered in the new approach: the openness
of economy, the role of government budget and regulation,
development of financial markets, labor market flexibility, the
quality of infrastructure, technology, business management, as
well as the quality of judicial and political institutions.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. falls below the front-runners chiefly
due to its high government spending and taxation, while Japan
stood at 13th mainly as a result of its continuous closure to
international trade and finance as well as fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is further down on the list, Britain
ranks 15th after Denmark. Germany, the economic powerhouse of EU,
comes in 22nd, before France but after Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Like many other EU countries, Germany suffers from the heavy
fiscal burden of social welfare system, government problems and
poor labor market flexibility.
</P>
<P>
China ranks 36th. The report said China enjoys an economic
growth dividend because of its initial low level of income, and
like many of today's reformers including Russia, India and Brazil,
China is still in relatively early stage of achieving competitive
policies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among the developing countries, Thailand comes in the 14th
place on the list, while Chile is the highest ranking developing
country outside Asia, in the 18th place.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the least competitive of all the 49 countries and
regions included in this study based on 155 latest quantitative
and survey data, due to poor performance in almost all factors
concerned.
</P>
<P>
On top of the competitiveness rankings, the WEF report this
year for the first time introduces a market growth index, designed
to help guide investment of companies.
</P>
<P>
It lists the United States, Japan, Germany, China, Britain,
France, Canada, South Korea, India and Taiwan as the world's top
10 most attractive markets.
</P>
<P>
Global Competitiveness Report was first launched by the WEF in
1979. It had since co-worked with the Institute for Management,
Development (IMD) in Lausanne on seven reports. The WEF parted
with the IMD this year for differences over how the report should
evolve.
</P>
<P>
In the IMD's 1996 competitiveness report, the top 15 countries
are: the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Denmark,
Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, New
Zealand, Canada, Chile, Sweden and Finland.

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Hope for NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The three Baltic States of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania have expressed hopes to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU),
according to the Interfax today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued Tuesday after a meeting in the
Lithuanian capital Vilnius, presidents of the three states said
their countries wish to join all European institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the presidents noted that NATO and the EU
should start absorbing Baltic states and East European countries
"simultaneously".
</P>
<P>
The three states, all members of the former Soviet Union,
expressed their hopes at a time when Russia is repeatedly voicing
opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the presidents also discussed issues of
regional economic and trade cooperation and signed a communique on
the building of an artery road across North Europe, simplifying
border-checking procedures and on the strengthening of border
security.

</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia's foreign policy focuses on strengthening the

favourable conditions for the establishment of a common political

utmost effort.
</P>
<P>
Except the problem with the Sudan, Seyoum said, Ethiopia's
relations with neighboring countries have improved. The prevalent
peace in the country could be sustainable only when its neighbors
enjoy the fruit of peace, he added.

<HEADLINE> World Population Totals 5.8 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The world population at
present stands at 5.8 billion, according to the annual report
released today by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF).
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued fall of the growth rate, annual increase
in global population is over 86 million and will remain in the
range until the year 2015, the report says.
</P>
<P>
the urban population is growing faster than world population as
a whole. People living in cities now number 2.6 billion, including
1.7 billion in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Within ten years," the UNPF State of World Population 1996
Report goes on to say, "more than half the people in the world
will be living in cities, 3.3 billion of the 6.59 billion total."
</P>
<P>
Almost all the urban population increase will be in today's
developing nations. They will account for 92.9 percent of a 2.06
billion increase in the global urban population between 1970 and
2020. Migration accounts for some 40 percent of the urban
population growth.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is a major problem for city dwellers. One estimate
suggests that 27.7 percent of the developing world's urban
population lives below official poverty lines.
</P>
<P>
Aging is another problem facing many nations. People over 65
are the most rapidly increasing group in a large number of
countries, the report notes.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Attacks Britain's Beef War Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Commission
President Jacques Santer has condemned Britain's policy of
non-cooperation with the EU as unjustified "hostage-taking".
</P>
<P>
Santer is quoted by the BBC television as saying at a private
meeting of EU commissioners earlier today that he deplored the
actions taken by the British government as having "no place in the
community governed by the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
"The Commission deplores that certain dossiers which are not at
all linked to BSE or mad cow disease are being held hostage. This
attitude is not appropriate in a community based on rule of law,"
he said in a statedment.
</P>
<P>
"The priority should be to establish confidence," he said,
adding that Britain's attitude was "counter-productive."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major declared a non-cooperation
campaign against the EU last Tuesday in a bid to end the
world-wide ban on British beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Britain has escalated its non-cooperation campaign
by sending several senior government ministers to Brussels to
disrupt normal business.
</P>
<P>
British envoys in Brussels have blocked 12 ministerial
decisions, including those decisions it previously supported.
</P>
<P>
Roger Freeman, British minister in charge of the so-called
"beef war cabinet", is reported as telling EU ministers that
British government would continue to block decisions requiring
unanimity until it secured a "framework agreement on a
step-by-step lifting" of the total ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which imposed the global ban on British beef exports on
March 27, has been urging its member states to ease the ban by
allowing Britain to export some beef by-products including
gelatine, tallow and semen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus, chairman of the Broadcasting
Organizations of Non-Aligned Countries (BONAC), has proposed to
set a new policy to enable its members to adapt to the prevailing
international environment in information dissemination.
</P>
<P>
At the 13th meeting of the Inter-Governmental Council for the
Coordination of Information in non-aligned countries (IGC) now
going on in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, Cyprian representative
Nayia Roussou said that the policy would help the member
countries to cope with current developments in politics and
information.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be aimed to "re-position the objectives of
BONAC and re-activate members to the degree that it is desirable
for a substantial and active promotion of the two-way flow of
information", she said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
today.
</P>
<P>
Satellite communication and trans-frontier television are new
realities that have made the call for the two-way flow of
information imperative, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, the only European member of the 13th IGC meeting,
offered to host the 20-member Cooperation Committee which is to
decide the new policy this year.
</P>
<P>
The four-day IGC meeting is scheduled to close in Abuja
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Attacks U.S. over Cuba Trade Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind is to launch a fierce attack upon the United States for
passing the legislation to punish foreign companies, which have
trade links with Cuba, the BBC Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In a speech due to be delivered at U.S. National Press Club in
Washington later today, Rifind is to condemn the Helms-Burton law
as "shorted sighted and damaging".
</P>
<P>
"We do not quarrel with Congress's aims. But we disagree very
strongly with the means they convisage," said Rifind, who is on a
three day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton law passed by the U.S. Congress after
Cuba downed two American private planes, the U.S. government would
penalize those companies, which have trade links with Cuba and
deny executives of those companies entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"No one country should have the right to tell companies in
another country how they should behave in third countries,"
Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the consequences of the law, Rifkind said "they
will cause divisions among allies who should be working together
to combat terrorism. Is it really in America's interests that
potential investors here should be scafed off from creating new
jobs for Americans."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary is to call on the United States
and Britain stick to their free-trading principles and make a
commitment to avoid short-sighted unilateral actions destructive
of free markets.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Continues in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Agriculture
Ministry today expressed fear that the country's forest resources
would come to a crisis unless central and regional woody biomass
inventory strategic planning bodies work in close collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on the woody biomass inventory and
strategic planning project, Vice-Minister of Agriculture,
Getachew Teklemedhin said that close to 112,700 hectares of land
has been
cleared of forest resources every year.
</P>
<P>
If continued unabated, he said, the amount of trees that
would be cleared after 10 years would rise to 153,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Getachew Teklemedhin cited rapid growth of human and livestock
population and burning of forests as the main causes of deforestation.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Calls on Major to Restore Relations with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British businesses Tuesday urged the
government to restore normal relations with the European Union
(EU) as soon as possible because they feared non-cooperation policy
over beef could damage Britain's commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
After Roger Freeman, the public services minister of Britain,
Tuesday voted in Brussels against the EU deregulatory measures
which will ease the burden on small business and the British
government has championed in the past, business associations said
that the government would not be forgiven if business interests
were jeopardised.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Small Business, which represents more than
85,000 small companies in Britain, called on Prime Minister John
Major to "extricate the government from the policy by the end of
the next week".
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said: "The
government has chosen this short-term tactic and it must now be
judged whether it is successful in delivering results. The longer
it takes the more it becomes a cause for concern."
</P>
<P>
The federation said that the non-cooperation policy would be
tolerated in the short term, but not if it started to hurt British
businesses.
</P>
<P>
It would urge the government to end the non-cooperation policy
by the end of next week, when UK ministers hope the EU will lift
the ban on beef derivatives.
</P>
<P>
In recent months the Conservative and Labour parties have been
involved in a tough campaign to win the votes of managers of small
and medium-sized businesses. The number of EU regulations on
business is often seen as one of the biggest concerns of small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The non-cooperation policy with EU has lasted for more than one
week since last Tuesday when Major, amid the beef ban row with the
EU, lost his patience and threatened to disrupt normal EU business
unless rapid progress was made on lifting the global ban on
British beef product exports.

<HEADLINE> United States, Europe to Further Defence Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States has recently
launched an initiative to expand transatlantic defence industry
cooperation in an effort to head off criticism that US defence
market is closed to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kaminiski, the US under-secretary for defence acquistion,
has sent to Britain, Germany, France and Italy a list of more than
20 Pentagon programs which the US is prepared to open to
international partners, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
No formal response has been made by the European countries, but
the British defence procurement minister James Arbuthnot is
expected to discuss the proposed projects during a visit to
Washington later this week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The list include cooperation on developing new command and
control computer system and satellites to produce a "digital
battlefield" with troops and commanders on a single computer
network.
</P>
<P>
There is also the offer of cooperation on several missile
programs, including a cruise missile to be launched from aircraft
and a new medium-range air-combat missile, which Britain, Germany,
Italy and Spain will need to arm the Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
In addition, programs such as upgrading the F-16 fighter and
E-2C radar early warning aircraft are also on the table, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The American offer of increased defence cooperation with
European countries comes as European criticism about unequal
access to defence markets is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
The US defence equipment market is twice the size of that in
western Europe, yet US exports to Europe are at least double that
of European sales into America.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain has come under pressure for its recent
decisions to buy American Lockheed C-130J transport aircraft and
McDonnell Douglas Apache attack helicopters rather than European
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo was reported as
saying during his visit to America earlier this year that Britain
would not be able to resist pressures from Europe if there was not
a "two-way street" in defence goods across the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> No More Bias Against China on Issues Including Child's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador Wu Jinmin Wednesday
called for an end to prejudice against China in his speech following
the approval of China's report at the current meeting of United
Nations Committee on Rights of Child.
</P>
<P>
The world is far from being free of prejudice, he commented on the
two days' expert review of China's report. On many issues including
the rights of child, China has fallen victim of biased propaganda of
some Western media and non-governmental organizations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Seeing is believing, China welcomes the visit by experts with a
view to establish objective and impartial dialogues, said Wu, also
head of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
He added that looking back upon history, any person, if not biased,
will recognize that China has made great progress over past decades in
promoting child's rights.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on the situation of children worldwide issued
by the U.N. Children's Fund this year, China outpaced many other
developing countries in the development of child health, nutrition and
education, Wu said Tuesday when presenting China's report to the
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the report on implementation of Convention on the
Rights of Child, the expert panel also posted questions on the
treatment of girls, care of children in institutions for abandoned
youngsters, orphans or handicapped children and Panchen Lama dispute.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the treatment of girls, Wu said, above all, equality
between the sexes in every aspect of the social life is guaranteed by
legislation and many administrative measures adopted by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also taken to end traditional preferences for boys. A
law also bans technical detection of the sex of fetuses in order to
prevent any deliberate abortion of girls.
</P>
<P>
As for the reported "discrepancy" between the sexes of children
born in China, Wu noted the major factor was that a number of newborn
girls were not registered as showed by surveys.
</P>
<P>
Wu also cited for instance the education of girls in elaborating
the situation of girls in China. He said by 1995, 99.2 percent of girls
enjoyed primary school education, up from only 15 percent in 1949.
In other words, he added, the difference between boys and girls was
only 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu assured the Committee that good treatment were given to children
in welfare institutions, whether for orphans, the handicapped, or for
those with health problems. In addition, special schools were
established to ensure their education.
</P>
<P>
In answering inquiry about the situation of the child cited by the
Dalai Lama as the new Panchen Lama, the Chinese ambassador said the
boy, who had not been seen in public for more than a year, was in good
condition and was living with his parents.
</P>
<P>
The boy was at risk of being kidnapped by Tibetan separatists and
his security had been threatened. He had been put under protection of
the government at the request of his parents, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador reiterated that the Chinese government had
strictly followed the established ritual over the past 200 years in
Tibet in selecting the incarnation boy for the Panchen Lama. Dalai
Lama, however, by declaring a particular boy to be the new Panchen
Lama, disrupted the normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had first become an integral part of China in the 13th
century, he added.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Turkish Foreign Ministers' Meeting Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece today canceled the meeting
between the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers scheduled for June
3 due to "government instability" in the neighboring country
and a worsening of relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement said that Greece had agreed to the
meeting so that the two countries "might find some basis for the
commencement of an effort to de-escalate tension".
</P>
<P>
Theodoros Panagalos of Greece and Emre Gonensay of Turkey
agreed at a recent meeting in Bucharest to hold talks on the
sidelines of a Nato meeting in Berlin on June 3.
</P>
<P>
It was within this framework that diplomatic officials of the
Greek and Turkish foreign ministries met yesterday in Geneva as
personal representatives of the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
"However, the government instability which has arisen in
Turkey has made the continuation of the effort precarious,
precisely due to its nature, since the prospects of the present
government in Turkey are uncler," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government considers that a new meeting between the
foreign ministers in Berlin could not be useful in the present
conjunction and until the conditions have been created for a new
contact between the two countries at this level," the foreign
ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
Today's cancellation of the Berlin meeting follows an incident
Tuesday near the Imia Islets in the eastern Aegean involving a
Greek coastguard vessel and a Turkish patrol boat which "violated
Greek territorial waters."
</P>
<P>
It was the third such incident since the Imia crisis in late
January.
</P>
<P>
Athens Tuesday lodged a protest over the incident which was
rejected by Ankara which claimed that the incident took place in
Turkish territorial waters.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Secures Greece's Support for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Hungarian President Arpad
Goncz said today he had secured Greece's support for his country's
applications for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Goncz told a press conference he was ''pleasantly surprised''
during his high-level talks with Greece's willingness to support
the Hungarian bid, particularly given Athens' concern for the
course of Cyprus' EU accession and over the redistribution of EU
funds to new members, which would be affected by a community
enlargement towards central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Goncz, who arrived in Athens Tuesday for a three-day official
visit, welcomed the imminent commencement of eu accession
negotiations with Cyprus and Malta six months after the completion
of Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), expressing the view that
Hungary could also begin accession negotiations six months after
the IGC.
</P>
<P>
''I believe we have convinced Greece that our EU accession
would bring benefits to both countries,'' Goncz said, adding that
Greece and Hungary, as agricultural nations, would play a
particular role in the EU farming sector.
</P>
<P>
Goncz, who met Tuesday with his Greek counterpart Costis
Stephanopoulos and has held talks with senior government
officials, said ''we had no differences of views'' on the issues
of the Aegean continental shelf and the Cyprus problem. He also
said coinciding views were ascertained on issues pertaining to the
future of Europe.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Reduces Strength of Western Sahara Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday decided to reduce a 288-member U.N. observer mission in
Western Sahara by twenty percent to 233.
</P>
<P>
In approving the resolution unanimously, the council also
decided to renew the mandate of the reduced U.N. Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 30 November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The council's action was prompted by the fact that the required
willingness does not exist to give MINURSO the cooperation needed
for it to resume and complete a long-overdue identification
process, a core issue in holding a free and fair referendum on the
future of the former Spanish colony.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the
government of Morocco and the Polisario Front have had different
opinions on how to identify eligible voters since the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
He thus decided to suspend temporarily the work of the an
U.N. identification commission.
</P>
<P>
While endorsing Boutros-Ghali's decision, the council Urged the
two parties to demonstrate without further delay the political
will, cooperation and flexibility necessary to permit the
resumption and early completion of the identification process.
</P>
<P>
It remined them that if significant progress in not achieved
during the next six months, the council will have to consider
other measures, including possible further reductions in the
strength of MINURSO.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President Ketumile
Masire has contacted his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba to
express concern over the political situation in Zambia, the South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's government recently passed constitutional amendments
to prevent former president Kenneth Kaunda from standing for
the general election slated for October this year.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Masire's permanent secretary Elijah Legwaila
as confirming on Wednesday that the two presidents had talked about
the issue over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
Masire is seeking a meeting of the frontline states including
Zambia to calm the situation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The president is concerned about the situation in Zambia, but
he alone cannot call a meeting of the frontline states," said
Legwaila.
</P>
<P>
"That is up to the chairman, President Rober Mugabe of
Zimbabwe," he added.
</P>
<P>
During Kaunda's reign, Masire in a then unpublicized meeting
persuaded Kaunda to allow multi-party democracy, and thus
enjoying influence in Zambia, Legwaila disclosed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Gojko Klickovic held talks with UNHCR envoy Soren Jens Petersen
today over the implementation of the Dayton peace accord,
particularly the repatriation of refugees and the freedom of
movement.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in Serb stronghold Pale, Klickovic said he
had told Petersen the Serb authority was committed to fully
implement the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted Klickovic as saying that the two
sides had agreed on the need for more time to prepare for the
repatriation of refugees and the freedom of movement in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of about 2 million refugees and displaced
persons has just began and is expected to take at least two years
to complete. Meanwhile, the freedom of movement, stipulated in the
Dayton agreement, has barely taken place in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed Serb premier also said the introduction of
regular bus lines under the guise of freedom of movement is a
breach of the peace accord and the Serb side cannot agree to that.
</P>
<P>
The first bus left Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in
northwestern Bosnia, on Tuesday for Zenica, a Muslim town in
central Bosnia, under the UNHCR organization.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the line was announced 10 days ago by UNHCR head
Sadako Ogata when she was in Bosnia for a visit. She said other
bus lines would also be opened soon between the two entities in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Peres Leads over Netanyahu: Exit Poll Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres is leading over his Likud challenger Benjamin Netanyahu in
today's national elections, said an exit poll released by Israeli
Channel 1 TV.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated Labor Party leader Peres will garner 50.7
percent of the votes, against 49.3 percent for Netanyahu. The
Labor party will get 37 percent against 31 percent for the Likud
party.
</P>
<P>
However, the final results are not expected to come out until
late Friday as staff of the Central Elections Committee are still
busy counting the votes.
</P>
<P>
Peres said after casting his vote this morning at the polling
station in Aveivim School, northern Tel Aviv, that "I think this
is a historic decision. I hope the nation chooses the path to
peace."
</P>
<P>
Peres has pledged to continue the ongoing Israeli-Arab peace
process to realize comprehensive peace in a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Israeli voters elect directly
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The elections are widely regarded as the most fateful in the
48-year history of the Jewish state, which will play an important
role in setting the future course of the nation and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Today's polling proceeded peacefully and smoothly with an
estimated 80 percent turnout of the voters, higher than the 77
percent in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
Police reported only 70 incidents of disruptions and clashes
between party activists which led to half a dozen arrests. Three
people were wounded in the scuffles.
</P>
<P>
However, with the rumors of attempted attacks on Peres by
radical Jews, the security services have tightened the protection
of him.

<HEADLINE> COSATU Calls on Business to Stay Out of Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) today called on business to stay out of the
debate over the restructuring of state assets.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, COSATU said the ongoing
debate over whether the various parties were either ''pro or
anti'' privatisation was a stale one.
</P>
<P>
COSATU said the labor movement had already signed the National
Framework Agreement (NFA) that dealt with the restructuring of
state assets.
</P>
<P>
''The real debate is how to take the NFA debate forward in
restructuring state-owned enterprises,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
COSATU said in terms of the NFA, the union federations, which
were directly involved in restructuring plans, had to place their
options on the table for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The unions would present their final positions on
privatisation to the government on June 16, added the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB) said
on Wednesday it supported the government's revitalised commitment
to privatisation and the restructuring of state assets.
</P>
<P>
SACOB said privatisation was the only sensible route for
generating the capital resources required for the reconstruction
and development program to succeed.
</P>
<P>
South African government's privatisation plans, announced by
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki last year, were strongly opposed by
the organised labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit to Germany last week, President Nelson
Mandela said privatisation was the fundamental policy of the
African National Congress (ANC) and would be implemented as
government policy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to COSATU's resistance to the privatisation, Mandela
said on Monday that he would discuss the issue with COSATU
leadership and ''bring our allies on board''.
</P>
<P>
The relations between business and labor has got worsened
recently as the two sectors clashed over privatisation with
mud-slingling against each other.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and his ANC-led government were to step in the rising
tensions between business and labor in a bid to bring their
relations back on track.
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread concern that the differences between
business and labor over the privatisation would cause serious
damage to the economy and foreign investors' perceptions of South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Polling Stations Close in Israel after Active </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 7,000 polling stations
across Israel closed at 22:00 local time (1900 GMT) today after an
active participation of the Israeli citizens in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Central Elections Committee (CEC) announced this
evening that voters across the country have actively taken part in
the balloting to elect the 14th Knesset (parliament) and a new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Latest polls conducted by Israeli Television gave Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres a slight lead over his challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu ranging from one to two percent. One of the polls said
that Peres led the race 50.7 to 49.3 over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the Israeli history that the voters
directly elect prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The CEC said that the vote counting showed that the turn-out
rate for the elections has reached 60 percent, and might reach
around 80 percent when the counting concludes later.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 3,933,250 eligible voters in Israel and
the polls opened at 7:00 a.m. local time (0400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The CEC also said that compared with the 1992 elections, the
turn-out rate of Israeli Arabs increased 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 58-year-old cab driver, who identified himself as Modhat,
told Xinhua that he supported Peres because he has long been
well-known. He said he does not like Netanyahu because he "makes
things complicated."
</P>
<P>
But his family is divided on the issue -- half of the family
supports Peres and the other half Netanyahu, he said.
</P>
<P>
Modhat is a typical case in point. In Jerusalem today,
supporters of Peres were seen tearing down posters supporting
Netanyahu and replacing them with those championing the incumbent
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Netanyahu just did the same, and the contention
resulted in lots of piles of torn-down posters scattered on the
pavements of some major streets in the city.

<HEADLINE> US Banks Tighten Standards for Consumer Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Concerned over rising loan
delinquencies, U.S. banks are tightening their standards for
consumer loan the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 56 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches of foreign
banks in early May showed that 20 percent of the banks had more
stringent standards for approving new credit card applications
compared with three months ago. And 10 percent had tightened
standards for non-credit card installment loans.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also found that banks' willingness to make consumer
installment loans declined for the first time since 1991, when the
economy was emerging from the recession.
</P>
<P>
"The tightening of lending standards for consumer loans may
reflect, in part, a response to the rise in delinquency rates on
such loans in recent quarters," the Fed report said.
</P>
<P>
"The banks attributed their concern about future delinquency
rates to increased household debt burdens and to a greater
willingness of households to declare bankruptcy," it said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bankers and finance executives predicted recently that a
record 1.1 million Americans would appeal to the U.S. courts for
bankruptcy this year, according to a report by The Wall Street
Journal earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey found that standards for residential mortgages
were little changed, while those for commercial real estate loans
were tightened "by a modest number of respondents."
</P>
<P>
The Fed said demands for household credit increased since its
February survey of senior loan officials. A significant share of
respondents reported stronger demand for residential mortgages and
a smaller proportion noted a pickup in demand for consumer
installment loans.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found little change in lending standards for
business loans to customers of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
Demand for business loans was stronger from small and
medium-sized firms and about unchanged from large firms. Demand
for commercial real estate loans also was little changed.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Commander Meets Bosnian Serb Army Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) ground force commander, British Gen. Michael Walker,
said today that he wanted to bring other parts of Bosnia into
focus apart from the capital Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with Bosnian Serb Army generals in Banja Luka,
the Serb city in northwestern Bosnia, Walker said the meeting had
dealt with several issues important both to the IFOR and the Serb
Army, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Walker decided Tuesday to move his tactics command to the town
of Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Serb Army 1st Krajina Corps, Gen. Momir
Talic, told reporters after the meeting with Walker that he had
asked the IFOR commander to intervene to get the Serb soldiers
detained by the Muslim-Croat federation released.
</P>
<P>
Talic said the release of prisoners of war and the freedom of
movement, stipulated in the Dayton accord, had actually come to a
standstill but the Serb side had determined to deal with these
problems.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the military aspect of the peace accord had
been implemented satisfactorily and he voiced the hope that the
Serb Army and the IFOR would continue their good cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Walker also met with Serb Army air-force commander Gen. Zivomir
Ninkovic today over the reopening of Banja Luka airport for
civilian aviation and guarantees for civilian use of airspace.

<HEADLINE> China to Preserve Hong Kong's Prosperity Pillars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining a capitalist and
prosperous Hong Kong after 1997 is in China's long-term and
overall interests, a senior Chinese official said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Facing a tough task of building a modernized socialist market
economy, China needs enormous capital, advanced management and
experience, and lastest information, explained Lu Ping, director
of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a sound base and bridge to help China meet its
demands in those respects", said Lu at a seminar on Hong Kong's
financial future.
</P>
<P>
Factors that have promoted Hong Kong's economic success, such
as highly-open economic system, freedom of operation, free
movement of personnel, cargo and capital, low tariffs, sound legal
institutions, scare governmental intervention, open and fair
competition, will be preserved in Hong Kong after 1997, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"China's policies on Hong Kong are by no means an expedient
measure, but long-term, which were worked out following a
thorough study of the history and reality of Hong Kong and full
consideration of China's practical needs for sustained economic
development," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"I believe understanding of this point will help disperse doubt
on whether China will change its policies on Hong Kong after 1997
when it resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten or so years, the "one country, two systems"
policy has fueled economic growth in both Hong Kong and the
mainland of China, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland has made dramatic progress in reforms,
opening-up, and economic construction and Hong Kong's economy has
expanded impressively with foreign investment from across the
world swarming into Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
It shows that more and more Hong Kong compatriots and foreign
citizens have agreed with the "one country, two systems" policy,
and they have stronger confidence in Hong Kong's future, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China's booming economy has produced great attractiveness to
the world, and Hong Kong has fully played its role as a bridge
between China and the world with its geographical, personnel and
language advantages, he said.

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for More Action to Combating Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) today
called on the member states of the European Union (EU) to take
more action to help people stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
On Friday's World No-Smoking Day, Padraig Flynn, European
Commissioner for public health matters, said that EU members need
to take more "decisive action" to discourage people from beginning
to smoke and to encourage smokers to stop.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the relentless onslaught of advertising and
promotional measures aimed at recruiting new young smokers.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of seductive advertising, often paradoxically
associated with sporting events, and nicotine addiction
all-to-often serve to over-shadow the dangers to health of
smoking," Flynn said in reference to recent allegations of the
manipulation of nicotine levels by tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner underlined that the EC remains committed to
its proposal for a Council directive to ban tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
He also undertook to investigate claims that the existing TV
tobacco advertising ban is being flouted by tobacco company
sponsorship of televised sports events.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said that the EC will soon present a report on the
application by the member states of a 1989 Council Resolution on
smoking in public places.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grew by 2.3 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy was growing at
an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
slower than an estimated 2.8 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total GDP in the first three months was 6.82 trillion
dollars after adjusting for inflation, compared with a fourth
quarter level of 6.78 trillion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the fourth quarter in the previous year was
merely 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending in the nation, which
accounts for two-thirds of the total economy, shot up at a 3.6
percent annual rate, one-tenth percentage point higher than the
earlier estimate and the fastest increase since the third quarter
of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Business investment, which has been a standout performer for
the past three years, jumped by 12.3 percent, 0.2 percentage point
more than the initial estimate.
</P>
<P>
As most private economists predicted the growth rate was 2.8
percent, the 2.3 percent rate was a surprise to them.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drag on GDP growth in the first quarter was a
decline of 22.2 billion dollars in inventories, which represented
the first time in four years that the level of total inventories
posted a decline.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said a decline in business inventories would set
the stage for faster growth in the future, especially if consumer
sales are rising as manufacturers step up production to meet the
higher demand.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts also believe that even with the rebound in
growth, the U.S. Federal Reserve will remain on the sidelines for
the rest of the year because it does not expect inflationary
pressures to get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
An inflation index tied to the GDP rose just 2.4 percent in the
first quarter, 0.1 percentage point lower than the original
estimate. It left prices rising at a slower pace than the moderate
2.5 percent increase for all of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Feeding Chinese People Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 experts gathered in the
Great Hall of the People here today to discuss ways of feeding a
country with a population of 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that feeding such a big population is a matter
of primary concern for China.
</P>
<P>
The most outstanding problem in this connection, experts said,
is the contradiction between the exploding population and
continuingly decreasing arable land.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the China Association for Promoting
Development of Land Resources, was aimed at answering the call
made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to solve
the grain problem by relying mainly on domestic production.

BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid said today that Iraq will start oil export in mid-June
under an oil-for-food memorandum of understanding signed between
Iraq and the United Nations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, General Rashid said the oil
export will be through Bakr port in the south of the country and
Turkish port of Jihan leading to the Mediterranean sea.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is waiting for arrival of U.N. observers in order to
supervise Iraq's oil export and check the quality of its crude oil.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food
and other supplies, Iraq will export 800,000 barrels of oil per
day, of which 450,000 barrels will flow to the world market
through Turkish port of Jihan and the rest through Bakr port.

<P>
SEOUL -- Two South Korean opposition parties agreed here today
to hold massive outdoor rallies in several big cities net month to
protest the ruling New Korea Party (NKP)'s parliamentary majority
build-up and alleged election rigging.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the main opposition National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) headed by Kim Dae-jung and the
conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD) led by Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The outdoor rallies will be held in five cities including

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Moves Out of "Boom-Bust" Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- For years, the Philippine economy
has suffered from a "boom-bust" cycle called by the country's
leading economists.
</P>
<P>
However, with its sustained economic growth, Finance
Undersecretary Romeo Bernardo indicated today that the country has
moved out of the "boom-bust" cycle and is finally entering a
"boom-boom" cycle.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the continuing surge in overseas workers' remittances
and the brisk turnover in the services sector, the Philippine
economy posted a hefty 6.2 percent growth in the first quarter of
1996 from 5.4 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Socio-economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said that the
economy is on track to hit a target growth rate of between 6.5 and
7.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The continued economic upswing is expected to further boost
individual income, as measured by per capita gross national
product, to 1,350 US dollars in 1998 from 1,090 US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said today
that the Philippine economy is "maturing into a sustained
expansion and has transformed into one that is outward looking and
competitive."
</P>
<P>
The observation was expressed today by a visiting IMF team,
which concluded a two-week review of the country's economic
performance under an extended fund facility program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team also cited the positive changes in the economy,
which include the deregulation of the financial system and oil
sector, the lowering of tariffs and the lifting of import
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF also urged the government to address problems
caused by the debt crisis in the early 1980s, such as the low
salary of government employees and the expansion of social
services, in a bid to check the high-incidence of poverty,
particularly in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Great Prospects for Mainland-HK Scientific Cooperation: Qian Qichen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said in Beijing today that he was optimistic about cooperation
between the mainland and Hong Kong in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a specially invited delegation from Hong Kong and Macao
to the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Association for
Science and Technology which is being held in the capital, Qian
said the mainland has advantages in basic scientific research
while Hong Kong and Macao have comparatively rich experiences in
applying science and technology to the development of productive
forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have always adopted an open policy towards the exchanges
between the two places in this aspect. If combining with their
advantages together, the whole country's scientific and
technological level will be rapidly raised," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There exists broad prospects for such cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian commented on the issue of selecting the Chief Executive of
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). He said
that after comparing the way the Hong Kong Governor was chosen,
with that of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR according to
the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress, the way
for producing the Chief Executive of the SAR was very democratic.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the production of the Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong SAR will be accepted by all sides in Hong Kong,
which will be beneficial to the smooth transfer of power in Hong
Kong", he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR will be
produced by way of consultation or elected by nomination after
consultations by a selection committee composed of 400 local Hong
Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"This needs a process. Therefore there will not exist an issue
that the candidate has been decided internally," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the provisional legislature of the Hong Kong SAR,
Qian said the Provisional Legislative Council will begin its work
effective from July 1, 1997, so that the two legislatures cannot
clash.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Raymond C.T. Ho, leader of the Hong Kong and Macao
delegation to the congress, said that Hong Kong and Macao
scientific and technological workers will try their best to
cooperate with their mainland counterparts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also answered other questions raised
by the visitors.

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Shimon Peres and challenger Binyamin
Netanyahu were locked in a virtual dead heat as final ballots were
counted early today in a fateful election fought over the future
course of the country's peace negotiations with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
-- If President Bill Clinton is wondering how uncomfortable the
summer may be after the resounding Whitewater convictions issued
here this week, he need only consult his calendar for June 17,
when a special Senate committee is scheduled to issue a scathing
report on Whitewater and the White House's handling of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A discovery being announced today could make possible some
strange new modes of reproduction. It allows the cells that make
sperm to be put on ice and grown up in another species many years
later.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- India's new government sought a broad range of support ahead
of a parliamentary vote of confidence it must win by June 12. But
the loose coalition of 13 leftist and regional parties faces a
blizzard of demands from segments of society usually ignored by
political elites. Increased autonomy for states is possible.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Urban Population to Double in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's urban population is
growing at the rate of six percent a year, mainly due to
rural-urban migration, a cabinet minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a population of 10.5 million and 30 percent of
the people live in urban areas. It is estimated that in 10 years,
over 60 percent of the people will be urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister John
Nkomo said one of the challenges of urbanization in Zimbabwe is
the provision of adequate housing and public services with
limited financial resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the water supply situation is also pressurized by the
increase in population.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said there is need for Zimbabwe's cities and towns to
improve their ability to cope with emergencies, adding that fire-
fighting capacities are limited.
</P>
<P>
He cited other challenges for urban authorities as the need
for job creation, efficient refuse removal services, public
transport provision and control of environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israelis Killed, 5 Wounded in Explosion in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed
and five others wounded today in a bombing attack launched by
guerrillas of the Moslem resistance group Hezbollah, or Party of
God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the guerrillas
detonated a first bomb targeting an Israeli convoy comprising
three jeeps on Marjayoun road deeply inside the so-called
"security zone."
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas detonated a second bomb 15 minutes later, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that one nurse of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia and a cameraman of a local television station
were also injured in the blast, which took place at an Israeli
position only one kilometer away from the residence of General
Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli client militia.
</P>
<P>
One vehicle was destroyed by the bombings, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that one group of its fighters ignited
an explosive device at 12:15 p.m. (09:15 GMT) targeting a convoy
of the Israeli military intelligence when it was driving out of
Marjayoun town.
</P>
<P>
All the Israeli soldiers in the convoy were killed or wounded,
the statement noted, adding that the fighters detonated the second
explosive device as the Israeli reinforcements arrived at the
site, causing more casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist militant organization calculated that
in total ten Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent retaliation for the bombing attack, the Israeli
occupation forces in the buffer strip opened fire with
artilleries and heavy machine guns at suspected guerrillas bases
in hills opposite the 15-kilometer wider bordering strip.
</P>
<P>
This was the second attack carried out by Hezbollah guerrillas
at the Israeli occupied enclave since the Israelis began voting in
the national elections Wednesday to decide who, Shimon Peres or
his rightwing challenger Benjamin Netanyahu, will be their next
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a bombing attack at a South Lebanon Army patrol Wednesday
morning, a military vehicle was destroyed and two militiamen were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers were injured in a series of attacks
launched by Hezbollah guerrillas in the broader strip earlier this
month. Since then, a relative calm had been witnessed for some ten
days in south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the
Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 allegedly to guard against cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements. The zone is
routinely patrolled by Israeli troops and South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company Shrugs Off U.S. Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Sherritt International
Corp. has shrugged off a threat by the Clinton administration to
ban its officers from entering the U.S. -- a punishment for doing
business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We are staying the course. It's business as usual," stressed
Patrice Marrin Best, Sherritt's vice-president of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Sherritt Wednesday, the U.S. State
Department accused the Toronto-based natural resources producer of
using Cuban property that belongs to U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the property...was previously expropriated without
compensation by the Cuban government from a U.S. national whose
claim was certified by the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement
Commission," today's Globe and Mail newspaper quoted the letter as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Helms-Burton Act, which was passed in
mid-March after Cuba downed two U.S. civil aircraft in late
February, officers and major shareholders of a company that
"confiscates or traffics" Cuban property claimed by Americans will
be barred from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt owns half of a nickel-cobalt joint venture with the
Cuban government at the eastern end of the island. The mine has
been claimed by a New Orleans-based company, Freeport-McMoRan Inc.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt estimates its Cuban assets are worth some 200 million
U.S. dollars. "We are going great guns in Cuba," Marrin Best said
of the company's Cuban business.
</P>
<P>
"Sherritt has a long-standing commitment to Cuba, one that it
doesn't intend to walk away," she added.
</P>
<P>
"We operate legally in Canada and legally in Cuba," she said.
"Cuba is a sovereign country. It took action that a sovereign
country can, which includes nationalization of property."
</P>
<P>
Canadian International Trade Minister Arthur Eggleton has
reiterated his country's opposition to the anti-Cuba legislation.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at our options," he said in an interview in
Toronto Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt was one of the three companies singled out by the
U.S. State Department Wednesday. The other two are Grupo Domos
of Mexico and Societa Finanziaria Telefonica PA of Italy. Both
are telephone companies operating in Cuba.

state-designated enterprises have the right to produce salt and
only wholesale firms with state licenses are allowed to sell salt.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the price of salt is fixed by the
government and no salt producers and sellers should alter the
price at will.

<P>
The regulations also contain clauses governing the storing and
transportation of salt.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Start Oil Export in Mid-June: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid said today that Iraq will start oil export in mid-June
under an oil-for-food memorandum of understanding signed between
Iraq and the United Nations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, General Rashid said the oil
export will be through Bakr port in the south of the country and
Turkish port of Jihan leading to the Mediterranean sea.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is waiting for arrival of U.N. observers in order to
supervise Iraq's oil export and check the quality of its crude oil.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food
and other supplies, Iraq will export 800,000 barrels of oil per
day, of which 450,000 barrels will flow to the world market
through Turkish port of Jihan and the rest through Bakr port.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that Bakr port has an oil export handling capacity
of 1.03 million barrels per day, which is able to increase to 1.06
million barrels within a few weeks. Oil pipelines in Iraqi
territory, which are full of crude oil, are ready to start pumping
oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that the Iraqi authorities have taken
measures to ensure good telecommunication links for U.N. officials
to exchange information on Iraq's oil export.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Rashid announced that Iraq will attend the
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to be held in Vienna next month. The meeting will
concentrate on the discussion of Iraq's oil export, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about who will buy Iraqi oil, he said
that Iraq will sign oil sale contracts with countries concerned
following the OPEC meeting. He expressed optimism about Iraq oil
production quota in spite of the fact that the issue remains
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Rashid voiced his dissatisfaction with what U.N. has done in
dealing with Iraq's limited oil export and expressed the hope that
the U.N. will conclude its work on Iraq's oil export in two or
three weeks. A U.N. working team will arrive in Baghdad later this
week, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Loses GM Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Government today
admitted that the country had lost an auto project after the
General Motors Corp. (GM) made a decision to locate its 750
million US dollar car manufacturing plant in Thailand instead of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said today,
"losing is part of a contest but this should make you work even
harder on the next."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Philippines was outclassed by Thailand in the
GM's major considerations on its investments -- infrastructure
facility, well-established supplier base and strong domestic
market. "No way we can dispute them," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed GM car manufacturing plant will produce 100,000 to
120,000 units of cars each year, of which 80 percent are geared
for exports. The project is in line with the company's policy to
capture a 10 percent market share in the region by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"There are things that you win, there are things that you lose.
But the thing is you must be part of the contest," Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that what is important is that the
Philippines is now in the same league as the other tiger economies
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Navarro also said that the Philippines has won other US
projects in the past, such as a 525 million US dollar computer
project of Intel Corp. and a semiconductor project of Cyrpess.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A giant lizard which had embarrassed
residents in northeast Tehran was caught by firemen Wednesday
afternoon, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the 50-cm reptile has a long tail, big head and
colored skin which is believed to be dangerously poisonous.
</P>
<P>
The firemen tried to catch the reptile by spraying carbon
dioxide but it did not work because of the rough skin of the
animal.
</P>
<P>
Finally, they wore special gloves, took the lizard by the neck
and carried it to a nearby fire department.
</P>
<P>
The firemen said they had already caught various poisonous
reptiles but the lizard was the first of its kind to have been
caught by them.

<HEADLINE> Macao Basic Law Enters Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Basic Law, the
constitutional law of Macao after 1999, entered the Internet
service from today.
</P>
<P>
Users of the Internet can find the catalog under the title of
Macao, and can choose the Chinese, English or Portuguese version
of the law to read.
</P>
<P>
The system was jointly developed by the Macao Basic Law
Promotion Association (MBLPA), the Macao Computer Association and
the Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM), and an agreement of
cooperation was signed by the three parties today.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the three parties will collaborate
to create a Homepage for Macao Basic Law in the CTM Internet
service on May 30 in order to promote the law in Macao and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Peter Pan, vice-chairman of the MBLPA, said at a ceremony
today that to let more people be familiar with the law via the
Internet service is of course helpful to the stability, prosperity
and development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao in
about three and half years, and it is altogether imperative to
promote the law during the transitional period so that the law can
be properly enacted after 1999.
</P>
<P>
Promulgated in March 1993 by China's National People's
Congress, the law will take effect from December 20, 1999. Over
the past three years, local societies in Macao and departments in
some mainland cities have held various forms of promotion
campaign.

<HEADLINE> China's "Kangaroo" Boy Wins New Lease Of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A badly deformed teenager
described as China's "Kangaroo" Boy has been given a new lease of
life by a medical team in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoming, 16, underwent a seven-hour operation to correct
his badly twisted legs at Shanghai Shibei Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The deformity was so bad that the boy could only manage to
crawl a few inches on his twisted limbs. Now he is expected to
fully recover within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The boy was born with deformed limbs to an ordinary farmer's
family. Gradually his arms twisted to the inside and his legs bent
90 degrees forward, and the back of his lower leg touched down to
the ground, hence the description of a "Kangaroo" boy. He had to
completely depend on his parents to take care of his life.
</P>
<P>
His parents took him to many doctors but they all said that he
needed to have his deformed limbs amputated.
</P>
<P>
They never gave up hope and their patience was rewarded when
they went to Shibei Hospital. Doctor Cao Mingjun, director of
orthopaedics carefully planned a delicate and difficult operation
for the boy. Dr. Cao personally headed a medical team that
performed the operation.
</P>
<P>
The operation recovered the normal shape of the boy's legs,
allowing him to be able to bend 30 degrees backward and it also
corrected his deformed feet.
</P>
<P>
Few sufferers of the rare deformity survive more than a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang not only beat an early death but was lucky enough to
have a successful operation at the age of 16. Doctors are
planning another operation on his arms within three weeks which
will finally enable Zhang Xiaoming to lead a normal and healthy
life.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
when Hezbollah guerrillas launched a bombing attack at a joint
military convoy of the Israeli forces and their client militia in
the so-called "security zone" in southern Lebanon at noon today,
said security sources.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
claimed that five Israeli soldiers and two SLA militiamen were
wounded in the attack, when Hezbollah noted that the same number
of Israelis and militiamen were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut leftist Sawt al-Shaab (Voice of the People) radio
reported that six Israeli soldiers were injured, including two
seriously, in a bomb blast in Marjayoun, and all of them were
transferred by Israeli helicopters to hospital inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
Hezbollah, said that one group of its fighters detonated a bomb on
the Marjayoun road deeply inside the occupied border strip,
targeting a convoy of the Israeli and SLA military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that five Israeli soldiers and two
militiamen were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent retaliation for the bombing attack, the Israeli
occupation forces in the buffer strip shelled Iglim Al-Toffah, a
ridge opposite the Israel's "security zone" which is often used
by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch border-cross attacks, security
sources in southern Lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 artillery shells hit the area in two hours, the
sources added, noting that no casualties were caused in the
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also fired machine guns at suspected
guerrilla bases in the area.
</P>
<P>
This was the second attack carried out by Hezbollah guerrillas
at the Israeli occupied enclave since the Israelis began voting in
the national elections Wednesday to decide who, Shimon Peres or
his rightwing challenger Benjamin Netanyahu, will be their next
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a bombing attack at a SLA patrol Wednesday morning, a
military vehicle was destroyed and two militiamen were killed.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers were injured in a series of attacks
launched by Hezbollah guerrillas in the border strip earlier
this month. Since then, a relative calm had been witnessed
for some 10 days in southern Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

<HEADLINE> CIS Conference on Migration Opens in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international conference
opened here today aiming to resolve the thorny issue of refugees
and migrants within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss a 31-page draft Program of Action
incorporating fundamental human rights and humanitarian
principles, which U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
Sadako Ogata said represents "the first full-scale effort" to
manage human movements of astounding scale and complexity.
</P>
<P>
"Security in the European and Central Asian regions is highly
dependent on the stability in the countries of the CIS," Ogata
said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the conference, U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the conference is "of
critical importance."
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, seven major conflicts in the CIS region
since 1989 have forced more than 3.6 million people to leave their
homes. The 1991 disintegration of the former Soviet Union
triggered further huge movements.
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Union collapsed, between 54-65 million people
were living outside their republics of ethnic origins.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.3 million people, 600,000 of them from conflicting
zones, have felt compelled to return to their "home" country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, over 1.2 million of the so-called "formerly
deported peoples" -- those who were forced to move from the
western region to Central Asia or Siberia in the 1940s -- have
also been on the move.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 600,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes by three biggest ecological disasters -- Chernobyl,
the Aral Sea and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting are representatives from CIS states,
other relevant countries, the UNHCR, the International
Organization for Migration, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and some non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mercenary Army Downgraded in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
FREETOWN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The contract of the South
African expeditionary unit, Executive Outcomes (EO), "has now
been downgraded" by the Serra Leonean government of President
Tejan Kabbah from 3 million dollars a month to 1.2 million, the
influential biweekly "New Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said: "Payment will largely depend on the
performance of the EO to secure vital economic areas and the
country at large."
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Defense officials have declined comment on the
issue but a high ranking government official said, "The EO can
stay until the security of the state reverts to a state of
normalcy."
</P>
<P>
The issue of the continued presence of the mercenary group
has dominated both political discussions and newspapers headlines
here for the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The EO also featured prominently in the peace talks in
Yamousoukro,Cote d'Ivoire, in which the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) called for EO's withdrawal a month ahead of
demobilization and encampment of RUF forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, "members of the RUF have confessed in
Abidjan to senior members of the Sierra Leonean government
delegation that they would easily have taken Freetown but that
their efforts were frustrated by the Executive Outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Solomon Berewa in a press briefing at State
House Wednesday disclosed that out of 28 articles in the proposed
peace agreement, 26 were supported by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Berewa, who was a member of the Sierra Leone government
delegation to the Yamousoukro talks, said, "Only two articles
were the sticking points."
</P>
<P>
He listed them as the RUF insistence that the Executive
Outcomes should leave Sierra Leone a month ahead of
demobilization and encampment of combatants and the establishment
of a commission for national debt, the equivalent to the
existing Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
According to Berewa, both sides had agreed to the formation
of a joint monitoring group involving the Sierra Leone
government, the RUF and representatives of the international
community. But the RUF had taken an ''opposition stance'' on both
issues, Berewa said.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah who was also at the press briefing said,''We
have a contractual agreement with the EO inherited from the
military government.''
</P>
<P>
"It will be irresponsible to cancel it just yet until the
security of the state is assured", the president said.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhou City in Liaoning Province
has become the third port able to handle container liner shipping
in northeast China, after Dalian and Yingkou.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Ministry of Communications and the
China Ocean Shipping Corporation (COSCO), the national flag
carrier, after a recent inspection of the port.
</P>
<P>
This means that containers can be transported from Jinzhou Port
to every country or region that COSCO's liners reach, and vice
versa, local officials told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The port, on the Bohai Sea, is the junction of eight railway
lines and many highways, and is open for navigation all year round.
</P>
<P>
With five berths, the port is expected to handle 6.3 million
tons of cargo this year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The number of berths will increase to 60 at the beginning of
the next century, bringing its handling capacity to more than 30
million tons, they added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the port handles container liners once a week.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that after the business expansion, the port
will play a bigger role in the opening-up and economic growth of
Liaoning, as well as other northeast China areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen expressed his hope today in Beijing that
academic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong should be
further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when he met a delegation from Hong Kong
Scholars Association led by Mr Ching-Fai Ng, a scholar from Hong
Kong Baptist University.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's return to the motherland approaches, Qian said,
academic exchanges between the two sides become more and more
important.
</P>
<P>
Both of them have their own advantage, he noted, adding that
the mainland is superior in theoretical studies and fundamental
sciences, with a large number of talents specializing in education
and technical fields, while Hong Kong is more convenient in
communication with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the advisory organizations of Hong Kong government
after 1997, Qian said the system that allows governmental bodies
to set up the advisory organizations will remain unchanged,
according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the advisory organizations will continue to function
after 1997. It is also an important factor to ensure a smooth
transition and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between Hong Kong and Taiwan after 1997, he
said the unofficial contacts between the two areas will continue
to exist after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Issues including the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), relationship between the
future SAR Chief Executive and its body to be appointed and the
Hong Kong's economy were also discussed at the meeting.

packaging industry in the world. It has also offered an
opportunity for China's packaging industry to learn about advanced
technology and experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
China's packaging industry has enjoyed rapid development in
recent years, he said. Over a decade ago when China began its
reform and open-up drive, the annual output of the industry was
valued merely about 7.2 billion yuan, but it reached 114.5 billion
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The significant growth of the industry both demonstrated and
spurred the development of China's economy as a whole, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Flaum said that the conference, which was held in China for the
first time, was a great success.
</P>
<P>
He noted that WPO would like to strengthen its cooperation with
relevant associations, universities and businesses in China to
help the development of China's packaging industry.

</P>
<P>
As the first step, the UNCC will pay 142 million dollars to
about 57,000 claimants from 61 countries.
</P>

The UNCC said it has paid 13.5 million dollars to 4,000 of the
total 6,000 claims of deaths and serious injuries and the
compensation for the rest 2,000 could be completed soon.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- International shipping companies
were today urged to be alert to the inflow of foreign garbage into
China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Chinese Ministry of Communications said
that shipping companies under its jurisdiction must remain on the
look out for foreign garbage to ensure it is kept out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued a circular on May 22, which requires all
international shipping companies to have a thorough housecleaning
of all the waste paper and discarded materials they have brought
into the country.
</P>
<P>
The circular was issued in response to the discovery that some
developed countries had purposefully shipped discarded and
hazardous materials and garbage to China.
</P>
<P>
This has violated the human rights of the Chinese people, the
circular said.
</P>

The spokesman said that the shipping companies are not allowed

<HEADLINE> Science Progress Key to Agricultural Development: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
said today that in such a big country as China science progress
plays a significant role in boosting its agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made the remark at the
fifth national congress of the China Association for
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
China feeds 22 percent of the world's population with only
seven percent of the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that since the policy of opening up and
reform was initiated in 1979, China has obtained more than 20,000
achievements concerning agricultural science and technology, 6,000
of which have been put into practice.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five percent of the increase in agricultural output has
been achieved through science progress since 1979, as against 25
percent previously, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that China's agriculture is still
plagued by such problems as low integration and modernization
levels, too large a population, decreasing areas of arable land
and insufficient input.
</P>
<P>
This is clearly shown by the fact that 71 percent of the
Chinese people have to be engaged in agriculture to feed a
population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged both Party and government leaders at
various levels to attach great importance to agriculture, and
science and technology and increase investment in this field.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was optimistic about the prospects for China's
agriculture, although, he said, it faces many problems and
challenges.  Endiem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Napoli of Italy crushed Beijing
Guo'An 3-0 in a soccer friendly at the Workers' Stadium here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Napoli, which finished 11th in last year's Italian Serie A,
dominated throughout and just left no room to their Chinese
opponents, who moved desperately on the field.
</P>
<P>
The Italian side, which went down to Dalian Wanda, current
Chinese Soocer League leader, 1-0 on Tuesday, went all out for a
revenge and their efforts paid off as they opened scoring at the
38th minute.
</P>
<P>
Napoli led 1-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The second half seemed to be tougher for the Beijing squad,
which made numerous passing errors.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian side accelerated their rhythm and played better in
the second half, while our team had a big loophole in the
defense." said Jin Zhiyang, head coach of Guo'an.
</P>
<P>
Napoli added two more goals in a span of four minutes, at the
63rd and 67th minute respectively, capitalising on the frail
defense of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that the slow passing speed of his team was another
reason for the failure.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the coach said that his boys had tried their
best. "Napoli is stronger than us. "
</P>
<P>
Guo'an, runner-up in last year's Chinese League, began this
season with a relative slow start. Now it stands fifth in the
overall standings at 10 points out of three wins, one draw and
three defeats.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing squad will tour Italy for a return match in
November.

Initiated in the Sui Dynasty (581-618), the Grand temple on
Mount Nanyue, which is a state scenery zone, attracts two

The largest ancient building group in south China, the temple
used to cover an area of 120,000 square meters in the Song Dynasty
(960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The remaining part of the temple covering 70,000 sq m is in danger
because it has stood unrefurbished for the past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the province has spent some 20 million
yuan to rebuilt some halls and a corridor in the temple.
</P>
<P>
The full refurbishing project is expected to be completed in
seven years.

JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat today issued a hand-written directive
banning all PA officials and PLO Executive Committee members from
commenting on the results of the Israeli elections, JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem reported.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the directive was prompted by the initial
reaction made by PA Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath, who assumed
Shimon Peres had won the premiership in statements published in
today's An-Nahar, an Arabic newspaper in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree did not say when PA officials would be
allowed to comment, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Israel's general elections on Wednesday, Arafat
declared that the PA would not take sides with any prime
ministerial candidate and party. But Palestinian officials
privately expressed their hopes that Peres would win.
</P>
<P>
With 99.9 percent of regular ballots counted early today, Likud
party leader Benjamin Netanyahu had slim lead over Peres in
elections that will determine the course of Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> China Develops High-yielding Hybrid Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a hybrid wheat
that will increase per-hectare yield by 25 percent to 9,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
Experts say results of the past year's experimental growing in
six provinces show that the hybrid wheat, named T 9306, has
demonstrated better adaptability, a resistance to yellow dwarf
disease, and the capacity to withstand hot, dry weather.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Wang Changchun, the hybrid is the first to be
successfully grown at the same time in the two large wheat-growing
areas in China.
</P>
<P>
After its first-year experimental growth period in China's
winter wheat-growing area, the experimental species passed an
official evaluation. In 1994, it was successfully grown in the
Yellow River-Huaihe River dry land wheat-growing area. Both growth
testing areas are in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shanxi,
Hebei, Shaanxi and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The second year of experimental growing, organized by the
Ministry of Agriculture, is still going on now.
</P>
<P>
Three other hybrid species developed by Wang, a senior
agronomist with Tongchuan Suburban Agricultural Technology
Promotion Center in Shaanxi province, also are showing similar
results.
</P>
<P>
Experiments over the past three years show that the average
per-hectare yields of the four species are 25 percent to 28
percent higher than those of the wheat species currently used in
China. These yields account for a rise of 750 kg to 1,050 kg per
hectare.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chi, deputy head of the Shaaxi Provincial Agricultural
Development Office, said that the hybrid wheat species developed
by Wang is a forerunner in the world's advanced wheat hybrid
development.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the only other country to cultivate hybrid
wheat and grow it for small-scale testing.

The agreement was reached by the main opposition National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) headed by Kim Dae-jung and the
conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD) led by Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The outdoor rallies will be held in five cities including
Taegu, Kwangju, Taejon, Inchon and Pusan from June 8 to 29
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil are expected to deliver speeches
at the rallies.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties claimed that the ruling NKP has no
intention of breaking the political deadlock through dialogue even
after a rally was held by them in Seoul on May 26.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties said that the outdoor rally
program can be called off if the ruling camp accepts their
demands: a halt to the recruitment of opposition and independent
lawmakers-elect, an apology for its parliamentary majority
build-up and a commitment to revising the election laws.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition camp said that it will boycott the new
National Assembly, which will open next month, if the ruling camp
does not accept its demands.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139
seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the NKP later induced opposition and independent lawmakers-
elect to join the ruling party to secure 151 seats -- more than
half the total parliamentary seats.

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Authority Welcomes Second Runway Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The agreement signed today by the
British and Chinese sides of the Airport Committee to allow early
construction of a second runway and associated facilities at Hong
Kong's new airport is a boost for the territory, said Wong Po-yan,
chairman of the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the Authority would now move ahead quickly with
the work needed to develop the second runway and complete the
northwest concourse of the passenger terminal building as quickly
and cost-effectively as possible.
</P>
<P>
"This is a boost not just to the aviation and tourism
industries which will benefit directly, but to the economy as a
whole," he said, adding that this commitment will enhance local
and overseas confidence in the new airport as a pre-eminent hub
for international and regional aviation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also give airlines and other business
partners a much greater degree of certainty as regards their own
business planning. This is likely to be reflected in robust
competition for the right to provide goods and services at the
airport, he said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Transportation Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved marked progress
in transporting goods and passengers by joint air, rail, water and
highway networks, a national meeting here was told.
</P>
<P>
Joint highway and waterway transportation has already become a
major method of shipping materials such as coal, mineral ores,
grain and fertilizer across the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 138 million tons of coal was transported thus,
transportation officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last year China shipped 11.08 million standard containers into
and out of the country, of which a large proportion was handled by
joint transportation.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 71.5 percent of the containers handled by
the railways also rely on other ways of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of Chinese and overseas travellers is also
benefiting from joint transportation, especially as more and more
booking offices for such transportation are being opened.
</P>
<P>
As the joint transportation market is fast expanding, China has
already set up over 600 joint transportation companies with 5,000
business outlets at and above the county level.

JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Central Election Committee
said today that it would begin counting the 150,000 special votes
Friday, but may not have final tally until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With all the regular votes counted today, Likud candidate
Benjamin Netanyahu leads Labor Party's Shimon Peres by 50.3 to
49.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Still uncounted are votes of Israelis who could not vote at
polling stations near home. They include soldiers, seamen,
diplomats, hospital patients and prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Following a dramatic change overnight in the preliminary
results, Peres recommended to Labor Party ministers that they
keep silent until final results are published. The Labor leaders
met in Tel Aviv this morning.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu slept in a Tel Aviv hotel and refrained from
speaking to reporters. But Moshe Katsav, a senior Likud official,
said he has no doubt that Netanyahu would be able to form a
coalition in less than the required 45 days. He revealed that
agreements were made with potential coalition partners before the

<HEADLINE> Gansu Develops Business in International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Business companies of northwest
China's Gansu province have widened their horizons from the
domestic to the international market, regarding their future as
being in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
This inland province has seen its companies achieve a great
deal by doing business such as contracting projects, exporting
labor and investing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with abundant facilities and talent, and also rich in
experience, the province has listed contracting projects as its
major money-making business overseas, one official said.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies have contracted 57 projects in 60
countries and areas of Asia, Africa, Europe, South America and
Oceania, which earned 254 million US dollars for the province last
year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Gansu Geo-Engineering Corporation has dug more than 2,200
wells for Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Zambia, to provide drinking water
for both people and animals. The money earned from these projects
has formed 18 million yuan (2.2 million US dollars) worth of fixed
assets for the corporation abroad.
</P>
<P>
Institutes, colleges and universities have made money by
exporting their advanced science and technology to the developing
countries, which helps those countries to develop their own.
</P>
<P>
The Solar Energy Research Institute of Gansu has exported its
solar energy products such as solar cookers, solar heaters and
solar power generators to several countries. It has also trained
nearly 100 technicians for 42 developing countries, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The province has sent more than 7,000 people overseas in the
wake of its booming contracting business.
</P>
<P>
Investment in Eastern Europe and Africa is a growing concern
for the province.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is involved in 16 countries and areas, with 47 companies
and representative offices and a total investment of 20 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Farmers Among Wealthiest of Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The annual income of farmers in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region rose to 1,446
yuan last year, the highest among China's five ethnic autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure is still below the national average, it can
be seen as a major breakthrough for an area which has one-tenth of
the country's impoverished people, a regional government official
says.
</P>
<P>
The historical change came about because of increased
government allocations for agriculture and the greater development
of tropical agriculture in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990-95 period, the region invested 68 million yuan in
opening up waste land, improving soil conditions, and on
irrigation projects, while rural industry recorded rapid growth,
with turnover climbing to 210 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and rural industry have helped more than one
million poor people in Guangxi to have a better life.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation between the
Chinese and British sides on the second runway project of Hong
Kong's new airport is expected to be extended to other large-sized
infrastructural projects, a senior Chinese official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after a plenary meeting of the Airport
Committee of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), Zhao

showed much concern with the second runway project and they have
put forward many good suggestions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Airport Authority was also active toward the

the Xiamen Frontier Inspection Station in accordance with Chinese
law, which stipulates that the airline carrying passengers with no

<HEADLINE> hke - Article: Japan Should Make No Irresponsible Remarks on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan, as a third party, should not
make any irresponsible remarks on the Taiwan issue, a recent
article in the Japanese newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" said.
</P>
<P>
The article, by Professor Motofumi Asai of Meiji University,
said that it is self evident that Japan should not make any
irresponsible remarks on the Taiwan issue, considering that in
history Japan forced China to cede Taiwan and then exerted a
colonial rule over it for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In April 1895, Japan forced China's Qing government (1644 -
1911) into signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki which ceded Taiwan to
Japan. Taiwan was returned to China in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Another reason that Japan should be prudent in its words and
deeds on Taiwan is that the Taiwan issue has a direct bearing on
peace and stability in East Asia and the world as a whole, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security, signed in April
1996 between Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, said that if U.S. troops set off from
Japan when "Taiwan is in trouble," Japan will automatically
provide approval and rear services.
</P>
<P>
If this declaration goes into effect, then a U.S.-China
military confrontation will directly lead to a Japan-China
military confrontation, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is a worst option, the article continued, to "re-position"
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty of September 1951, and turn the
Japan-U.S. security system into one directed at contingency in the
Asia-Pacific region that includes China.
</P>
<P>
Japan "should not blindly follow the United States in its China
policies," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"That the Chinese themselves, including those in Taiwan, will
make their own decisions is the prerequisite to solve the Taiwan
issue, and no third party should make any irresponsible remarks
about it," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The minimum morality of the Japanese is to always remember that
Japan once forced China to cede Taiwan and exercised a colonial
rule over it, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article added that some people harbor ulterior motives by
twisting China's military exercises over the Taiwan Straits in
March into evidence of China "threat" and "expansionism" so as to
instigate mistrust of China.
</P>
<P>
"In considering future-oriented Japan-China relations, the
starting point should be the history of more than 100 years of
Japan-China military confrontations," the article noted. "One of
the major issues in the restoration of diplomatic relations
between the two countries is the Taiwan issue."
</P>
<P>
"We can't look forward to the prospective of Japan-China
friendship if we have as the precondition the Japan-U.S. security
system in which the Taiwan issue may result in a Japan-China
military confrontation," it added.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, there are worsening attitudes toward China which, if
ignored, may cause great risks that Japan-China relations will
land in an irremediable predicament, the article warned.

JINAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- In a move to purify the polluted
Weishanhu Lake, one of the ten biggest fresh water lakes in the
country, Jining City in east China's Shandong province has closed
down 63 small-scale paper mills.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of an effort, which started last year to

<P>
Since the 1980s, the lake has been seriously pollutted,
endangering not only fish and shrimp, but also residents who drink
the water.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has set a deadline for 34 enterprises
that are responsible for 85 percent of the total discharged
pollutants. So far, ten have responded.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 million yuan has been spent on the undertaking,

<P>
GUIYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The ground satellite station of
China's Guizhou International Public Health Satellite Information
Center has contacted the Boston-based Global Life Satellite
Communications Network.
</P>
<P>
The ground satellite station, the first of its kind in China
and in Asia, went into formal operation Tuesday after several
days' trial operation, said Mathiar Strelow, an engineer from the
US Satellite Inc., who was in charge of the installation of the
station.
</P>
<P>
The station can receive more than 100 pieces of the latest
public health and medical technology information from around the
world every day, and exchange with the network data and colored
photographs.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou station is the World Health Organization (WHO)'s
22nd life satellite ground station.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has built such stations in the United States, Canada,
Brazil, Zambia and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Huijun, an expert on filariasis from the Guizhou
Provincial Institute of Parasitic Diseases, said the building of
the No.1 China Life Satellite Ground Station was recommended by
the WHO because of Guizhou's outstanding achievements in the
prevention and treatment of filariasis, and was funded by the
U.S. Satellite Inc. and the International Research and Development
Center.
</P>
<P>
With the installation of this ground station, Zheng said, China
can promote exchanges of information and co-operation for the
treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, parasitosis,
angiocardiopathy and tumors together with international public
health and medical research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese expert also said that the No.1 China station will
provide information to public health and medical organs and
research institutions throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Building Port on Grand Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province is building a major
port on the ancient Grand Canal, now being dredged, as part of its
efforts to improve its inadequate waterway transportation.
</P>
<P>
The port under construction in the Tai'erzhuang District,
Zaozhuang City, which is the southern gateway of the province, has
a designed annual handling capacity of eight million tons, making
it the largest inland river port in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the need to improve waterway
transportation arises from Shandong's growing economic and trade
ties with neighboring Jiangsu and other provinces to the south.
</P>
<P>
Though the Grand Canal linking Beijing with Hangzhou in
Zhejiang Province and built in the Sui Dynasty (581-618),
traverses the Tai'erzhuang District for 37.2 km, modern waterway
transportation declined for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
To date, central and local governments have already injected
millions of yuan (100 yuan equals 12 US dollars) in building
ports, shiplocks and shipyards at Tai'erzhuang.
</P>
<P>
This year a bridge on the Grand Canal, two navigation channels
and a river port development zone are expected to be completed,
enabling 2,000-ton barges to pass.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, May 30 (Xinhua) -- In a close race for the
premiership in the Israeli general elections, what is clear is
that a new Knesset configuration looms with small parties
becoming the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The latest polls, publicized this morning, showed that Prime
Minister Shimen Peres lagged behind Likud Party candidate
Binyamin Netanyahu 49.6 : 50.3 in the race for the premiership. So
far, 99 percent of votes have been counted.
</P>
<P>
It will be a while away before real returns either confirm or
reverse what the polls denote. Nevertheless, the new electorial
system has crushed the large parties and created an entirely new
Knesset set-up.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 21 parties competing for 120 seats in the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Knesset (parliament) elections, as declared
this morning, are as follows: The leftist parties including the
Labor Party and Meretz won 44 seats, the rightist camp comprising
the Likud, Shas and some others netted 43, the religious parties
obtained 14, the centrists got 10 while the Arab parties scooped
nine.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that even if real returns reverse the
Netanyahu's lead and Peres is returned to power, it is also clear
that the coalition of Labor, Meretz and the Arab parties has lost
its minimal block major party. Peres will have to put together a
wholly different coalition.
</P>
<P>
This coalition, if installed, might upset Meretz and leave the
Arab parties out although they made the crucial contribution in
the elections campaign for the incumbent government.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post today said that among the Jewish
population, Peres suffered a big loss. It also said Netanyahu
might have some heavy regrets about violating Likud's disciplines
by supporting the change in the electorial system.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset returns showed that even with the blow the large
parties suffered, Netanyahu would have easily been able to form a
coalition under the old system, should he win.
</P>
<P>
Under the direct election system, any Likud candidate will
begin a prime ministerial race at a huge disadvantage. In a
one-on-one race, the Arab vote is of significance, and it will
always be cast against the Likud.
</P>
<P>
The Likud itself has only 21 members of Knesset (MK), and a
third of the list went to Gesher and Tsomet. In such case, the
Likud will be left impotent.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the precise division of Knesset mandate, it is
evident that the system which was to have eliminated the small
parties and consolidated the large blocs, did precisely the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
The system liberated the special interest groups and the small
ideological factions, their voters no longer had to fear that, by
supporting a small list, they could cause the large bloc to
lose. So it is now possible to vote both for prime minister and
any small party the voter chooses.
</P>
<P>
The liberating effect of the new electorial system has not
only increased the representation of the National Religious Party
and Shas, and brought the New Yisrael Ba'aliya into the Knesset as
a major player, it has propelled the religious parties to an
unprecedented peak.
</P>
<P>
Should Peres win, he will not be able to recreate his current
partnership with Meretz and the Arab parties alone. He will have
no choice but to look for other partners.
</P>
<P>
The Third Way and Yisrael Ba'aliya are at cross purposes with
the Arabs and likely so with Meretz. Should Peres prefer a
coalition with them to one with Meretz and the Arabs, he might
find he needs the religious parties as well. In such a coalition,
it is doubtful that Peres will be as free to pursue his agenda he
has thus far done.
</P>
<P>
If real returns and the soldiers' votes prove that the
pre-elections polls were wrong and Netanyahu wins, he can call on
all the parties outside the present coalition, except the Arabs,
and easily form a government.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of Israel's total of 3,933,250 eligible
voters have cast their votes in the general elections, compared
with a 78-percent average turn-out rate in the past elections.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1992 elections, the turn-out rate of Arabs
increased 10 percent, which mostly support the labor coalition.
</P>
<P>
Vote-counting is still going on with many either supporting
Peres or Netanyahu waiting for the final results. Analysts here,
however, predicted that the prospect for Netanyahu becomes
brighter.
</P>
<P>
Calm prevailed in the general elections except for a minor
incident in which a Labor party member was beaten by a right-wing
group here Wednesday. The authorities concerned are investigating
the incident.

<HEADLINE> China's Jewelry Market Enjoys Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that more than
half of the Chinese citizens with a monthly income exceeding 800
yuan (about 95 US dollars) plan to buy gold or silver jewelry in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
People with a monthly income exceeding 800 yuan account for 20
percent of all the urban residents in major Chinese cities,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in major Chinese cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Dalian, shows that 53.5 percent of the
people quizzed intend to buy at least one piece of gold or silver
jewelry in the next year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that 44.9 percent of the people
surveyed will buy 24-K gold jewelry, topping the 'gold fever'
shopping list in the country.
</P>
<P>
A special report on the endurability of the Chinese people
towards inflation shows that only three percent of the people
living in major cities are "highly confident" about the inflation
proof function of gold and silver jewelry.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that most of China's gold and silver lovers buy
jewelry as fashion, rather than as an edge against inflation.

<HEADLINE> Net Sales of Major Philippine Industries Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Net sales of the Philippines' 21
major industries went up by 13 percent in January this year for a
total of 29 billion pesos (1.16 billion US dollars) from 25.4
billion pesos (1.016 billion US dollars) in January last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Department of Trade and
Industry, electronics sector topped the list with 86 percent
increase or sales value of 3.8 billion pesos (152 million US
dollars) from 2.1 billion pesos (84 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The big jump in sales was attributed to greater demand for
higher value products like integrated circuits used in digital
signal processors.
</P>
<P>
Garments cornered the biggest share in terms of sales value of
6.5 billion pesos (260 million US dollars) or 22 percent increase
of the total sales in 1995. The sales volume, however, grew by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents attributed this to improved world demand
particularly from the United States, Finland, Ireland, Greece,
Great Britain, and from non-quota economies like Hong Kong, Panama
and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Refrigerator Giant to Produce "Green" Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the World Bank presented
827,400 US dollars to Changling (Group) Co., Ltd. for successfully
phasing out the use of ozone-depleting substances from its
production of domestic refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
The company, located in the capital of northwest China's Shanxi
Province, is one of China's leading refrigerator producers. It
first researched work on substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) in the late 1980s. CFCs damage the ozone layer that shields
the earth from the sun's harmful ultra-violet rays.
</P>
<P>
To date, the company has made great progress in the development
of so-called "green refrigerators," and will produce about one million
of them with non-CFC substances next year.
</P>
<P>
About five refrigerator-manufacturing enterprises and one
scientific research institute that studies non-CFC substances have
been presented with the Multinational Fund for the Application of
the Montreal Protocol, which is aimed at completely phasing out
the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances
through non-CFC substances.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Forthcoming Sino-US IPR Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman
reiterated here today that China holds a "serious and earnest
attitude" on the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR)
and does not want to see this issue deliberately made into a
political one.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang made the remark at a press conference here this
afternoon while answering a question about whether it is possible
for China and the United States to reach agreement since the two
sides will re-open their talks on the IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China and the US have conducted a series of
consultations and negotiations on this issue, which are still
going on. The Chinese side holds that negotiations and
consultations constitute the only avenue to the solution for this
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We do adopt a serious and earnest attitude" on the IPR
protection, he said, for this is required by China's reform and
opening program, as well as economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "we have set up an agency in charge of
IPR protection, which carries out supervisions on the
manufacturers of products, and works out specific rules for the
implementation of the relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the protection of IPR has remained an
important issue for all countries in the world and "we do not want
to see this issue deliberately made into a political one."
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the two sides should adopt a positive attitude
towards this subject," he said, adding that the US side should
objectively view the efforts the Chinese side have already made in
this regard."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "it is our hope that the US side would show a
realistic attitude and sincerity during the coming round of
consultations, so that the talks will head towards progress."
</P>
<P>
If sanctions are imposed, not only problems cannot be solved
but, on the contrary, the problems will be made more complicated,
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> EC Hits Back Against British Beef War Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
launched a fierce counter-strike Wednesday against Britain's
blocking tactics in the beef war, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
After EC President Jacques Santer accused Britain of
"hostage-taking" in its policy of non-cooperation earlier
Wednesday, Brussels announced three measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Compensation to farmers for falling beef prices, which hands
more cash to German and French farmers than to British farmers
whose herds have been most affected.
</P>
<P>
-- A 40 percent reduction in the British and other European
Union fishing fleets, over and above cuts that have already proved
too difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
-- The British government must provide information on test
results that showed leading brands of baby milk contain chemicals
that could impair fertility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister John Major was urged by
Euro-sceptic parliamentarians not to surrender under such pressure.
</P>
<P>
Roger Freeman, the minister co-ordinating Britain's
non-cooperation strategy, said that the government was calm,
resolute and determined.

<HEADLINE> Silence Club In Bustling Metropolis (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Sunday morning they converged on the club from each every
direction of the city, chatting with each other, reading
newspapers, discussing current affairs, or learning laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
They divided themselves into several groups, undertaking
different jobs such as preparing tea, cleaning, and maintaining
orders.
</P>
<P>
A travel group composed of 50 deaf people of the club paid a
visit to the Longshe Mountain in Songjiang County of suburban
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The deaf and dumb people, who seldom traveled outside the city,
were very excited about the journey. They tried their best to
climb to the mountain top, even Qiu Huibao, a 72-year-old lady,
conquered the mountain.
</P>
<P>
The deaf like the club very much, because they get more from
the club. Thanks to help from the club, some have saved their
marriages, some have improved family relations, some have made new
friends, some even captured business opportunities found in the
club.
</P>
<P>
"The deaf are a special group," said Xiu Guangming, one
of the sponsors of the club, "Although the government have
assigned them jobs in the social welfare ventures, providing them
with basic life guarantees, they can't communicate with normal
people in a proper way because of their physical defects."
</P>
<P>
"The feeling of isolation exacerbated especially when they are
retired, they are eager to find a place where they can use sign
language to communicate with other people. The club was set up in
such a context, and it gradually gained more and more attention
from the society, " he added.
</P>
<P>
And the deaf also expressed their care towards the society
through the club. During one of the activities held by the club,
they donated 919 yuan (111 US dollars) to the Hope Project, hoping
to assist some child drop-outs by their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It is a second home to us, because when we enter the silence
club, we leave behind us a world of silence," said Mao Weizu, the
old deaf-mute.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Tighten Foreign Exchange Outflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will tighten control on
the outflow of foreign currency in invisible trade to check the
ever-increasing current-account deficit, according to the Finance
and Economy Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The government feels the need to contain burgeoning invisible
trade deficit, which amounted to 1.67 billion U.S. dollars for the
first four months of this year, or 40.6 percent of the current-
account deficit for the period, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Invisible trade receipts in the four-month period only
increased 9.7 percent over the same period last year to 7.36
billion dollars, but payments jumped 18 percent to 90.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
To stem the "reckless" outflow of foreign exchange, the Bank of
Korea, the country's central bank, will investigate all overseas
foreign exchange "gift" remittances. The bank will work with the
National Tax Administration (NTA) to trace the source of such
remittances for taxation purposes if necessary.
</P>
<P>
These remittances are currently reported to the NTA by foreign
exchange banks that sell currency for such remittances.
</P>
<P>
Emigrating families must now have a tax office examine the
source of their emigration funds before converting these money
into foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, all payments overseas must now be reported to
the NTA for fund-source checking. At present, the NTA receives
such payment reports on a selective basis.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government has been rather
indifferent about the need to control the outflow of foreign
currency, since it has been busy working to liberalize the foreign
exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwait Strongly Attacks Gaddafi's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 30 (Xinhua) -- For the past two days, Kuwaiti
government officials and media have strongly attacked Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi's remarks that they described as an
"infringement on Kuwaiti independence and sovereignty and harmful
to the relations between Kuwait and Libya."
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the Libyan leader who was on a state visit
to Egypt, was reportedly addressing a gathering of Cairo
University professors and students on the campus that the right
meaning for any country's independence is its ability to defend
itself and hence "Kuwait does not deserve independence and should
be a part of Iraq or Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait immediately reacted to his remarks with Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad issuing a
statement through the official Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) that
Gaddafi's remarks was "irresponsible and harmful to relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi's remarks was an "infringement on Kuwait's independence
and sovereignty and contrary to the principles governing the
relations between Kuwait and Libya," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following Al-Ahmadi's statement, Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry
summoned Libyan Charge D'Affaires Idriss Dahmani Boudib to a
meeting with Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Soleiman
Majed Al-Shaahin.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaahin told Boudib that "Kuwait was dismayed and denounced
Colonel Gaddafi's remarks."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has summoned its own diplomatic mission head
in Tripoli, Khaled Al-Dweilah, back home for consultations.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kuwaiti National Assembly Speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun
voiced so far the strongest utterance responding to the Libyan
leader's "attack against Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun told KUNA that reaction to Gaddafi's statements
"should not be dealt with through routine diplomatic measures,
but through a decisive and firm action that should reach either
to freezing relations or severing them altogether with the Libyan
regime."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, several Arabic newspapers carried articles
and commentaries in front-page strongly criticizing Gaddafi for his
"irresponsible remarks."
</P>
<P>
In an apparently ironical and ridiculous tone, the daily
Al-Amba (News) said in a commentary that "Gaddafi's remarks are
really bad when he "tries to teach us the meaning of independence,
the price of which we had paid from our martyrs and the suffering
of our detainees in the jails of the vicious Iraqi regime" as
the remarks "clearly reflects the bad times we live in."
</P>
<P>
Another daily Al-Seyassah ridiculed Gaddafi remarks saying
"what elements could possibly offer criteria for an evaluation of
Gaddafi's lecture -- egg, shampoo, America, Britain, or Kuwait's
sovereignty?"
</P>
<P>
It said that "Gaddafi was not acting as a president of an
independent state or a revolution leader, but as a comedian on
stage, as the audience was wondering what the man was talking
about."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was occupied by the Iraqi troops and lost its
independence in 1990 only to be liberated by the allied forces
led by the United States eight month later in February, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The remembrance of the sufferings and humiliation caused by
the roaring rolling Iraqi tanks and the sky-reaching inflames set
on its oil wells on which the Kuwaiti economy was relied has
been deeply inscribed on the mind of the kuwaiti people.
</P>
<P>
Still to be all recovered from the sufferings, especially from
the psychological term, Kuwait is very sensitive to the
independent issue which might remind them of the dark days six
year ago, diplomats here said, adding that Kuwait's strong
reaction is very understandable.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, Libya stood on the side of Iraq
expressing sympathy with the country. Kuwait reduced its mission
in Tripoli after the war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the new developments may cause the
cold relationship between the two countries come down to a new
low.

<HEADLINE> Ambitious Young Man Tries to Change Fishermen's Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Three years ago Zhao Renchuan, a
college graduate, decided to quit his job and become a
fisherman. Now he owns five fishing companies with total fixed
assets worth over eight million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional image of fishermen should be changed," said
Zhao. "We modern fishermen should rely more on science and
technology."
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Hangzhou University, Zhao worked in the education
sector for six years, then he took what his relatives and friends
regarded as an incredibly risky step: abandoning his "iron rice
bowl".
</P>
<P>
Alone, he arrived at the beach near Dongmen Village, Jiangxia
Township, in east China's Zhejiang Province, and there he set up
his first company, cultivating fish and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Zhao managed to contact provincial marine research institutes
and established close partnerships with them.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Zhao persuaded 18 experts, fishermen and directors of
factories, to co-operate with him, and they set up a comprehensive
seawater aquaculture firm to cultivate rare marine products.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years Zhao has returned more than one million
yuan to research institutes which had helped his work in the form
of donations and loans, explaining that "only when they are backed
by science and technology can modern fishermen break away from the
poverty-stricken hard life of their ancestors."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Press Concerned with Israeli Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The current Israeli elections
became the front-page stories in today's Beirut newspapers, which
all expressed deep concern over the results and impact on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the Israeli elections, Beirut's
largest-circulated An-Nahar daily said that "what the Israelis
say is not only a referendum on the peace in Israel, but also on
the model of the peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily did not see fundamental difference
between the two main rival parties in the Israeli elections,
Prime Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party, and Benjamin
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
"It is right that the two parties are different, not on the
peace, but on the conduct of the negotiations and the cost of the
peace, or on what Israel should give to the Arab and how," the
newspaper said in its front-page editorial.
</P>
<P>
"But they have the same principled stands, that are the
security before the peace and the persistence in naturalizing
relations with every Arab countries before signing peace
agreements with them, or as a condition for the signature," the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Another Beirut's popular newspaper, the leftist Safir, noted
that "a split in the Israeli ranks" on determining the course of
the peace with Arab countries was shown in the preliminary results
of the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
"The split is so fiery and vertical that the Israeli society
seems to divided into two conflicting fronts which will
difficultly become compatible," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Ad-Diyar daily made a comparison between the
Israeli Labor Party and the Likud Party, and ironically pointed
out that the two parties "perform practically the contrary of
their slogans."
</P>
<P>
"The Likud, despite its slogans opposed to the negotiations
with the Arab on the occupied lands, signed the first peace
accord with the biggest Arab country in the Middle East," a
reference to the peace agreement the Jewish state signed with
Egypt at Camp David in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Party, since its establishment, have always
committed massacres against the Arab, the last of which was
those in southern Lebanon last month," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It believed that if Likud scores a success in the
elections, it could not realize the "complete security" and
the "complete peace" with the Arab neighbors without returning
Golan Heights to Syria and leaving the border strip in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Christian-owned rightwing Nida Al-Watan daily noted that
the current Israeli elections have exposed that "the Israeli
community has not matured to accept the idea of peace with
the Arab."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the Israeli community was becoming
"more and more radical" with the evidence that the margin of
votes between the two competing parties, which used to be 20
points in favor of the Labor Party in last February, had
narrowed to such an extent that they became equal one day
before the elections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Beirut Press Concerned with Israeli Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The current Israeli elections
became the front-page stories in today's Beirut newspapers, which
all expressed deep concern over the results and impact on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the Israeli elections, Beirut's
largest-circulated An-Nahar daily said that "what the Israelis
say is not only a referendum on the peace in Israel, but also on
the model of the peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily did not see fundamental difference
between the two main rival parties in the Israeli elections,
Prime Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party, and Benjamin
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
"It is right that the two parties are different, not on the
peace, but on the conduct of the negotiations and the cost of the
peace, or on what Israel should give to the Arab and how," the
newspaper said in its front-page editorial.
</P>
<P>
"But they have the same principled stands, that are the
security before the peace and the persistence in naturalizing
relations with every Arab countries before signing peace
agreements with them, or as a condition for the signature," the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Another Beirut's popular newspaper, the leftist Safir, noted
that "a split in the Israeli ranks" on determining the course of
the peace with Arab countries was shown in the preliminary results
of the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
"The split is so fiery and vertical that the Israeli society
seems to divided into two conflicting fronts which will
difficultly become compatible," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Ad-Diyar daily made a comparison between the
Israeli Labor Party and the Likud Party, and ironically pointed
out that the two parties "perform practically the contrary of
their slogans."
</P>
<P>
"The Likud, despite its slogans opposed to the negotiations
with the Arab on the occupied lands, signed the first peace
accord with the biggest Arab country in the Middle East," a
reference to the peace agreement the Jewish state signed with
Egypt at Camp David in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Party, since its establishment, have always
committed massacres against the Arab, the last of which was
those in southern Lebanon last month," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It believed that if Likud scores a success in the
elections, it could not realize the "complete security" and
the "complete peace" with the Arab neighbors without returning
Golan Heights to Syria and leaving the border strip in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Christian-owned rightwing Nida Al-Watan daily noted that
the current Israeli elections have exposed that "the Israeli
community has not matured to accept the idea of peace with
the Arab."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the Israeli community was becoming
"more and more radical" with the evidence that the margin of
votes between the two competing parties, which used to be 20
points in favor of the Labor Party in last February, had
narrowed to such an extent that they became equal one day
before the elections.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Leads in Rolling Back Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has taken the lead in the country in desert
reduction by shrinking its desert area by 40,000 ha, compared with
1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the provincial government
show that the desert land within the autonomous region covers
1.256 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Over several years the region has invested 300 million yuan in
a dozen irrigation projects and 300 km of water channels.
</P>
<P>
Trees have been planted on both sides of the Yellow River,
which, like a green Great Wall, split the desert between the north
and south.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the desert area within the autonomous region
has been shrinking at an annual rate of 3,600 ha.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Border Talks Not Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian and Vietnamese
governments have failed to agree on which country should have
jurisdiction over a stretch of fertile land along their common
border, according to a local newspaper "Cambodia Daily" report
today referring to a high-level meeting last week between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We disagree on what the current situation is at the border,"
Secretary of State at the Interior Ministry Ho Sok said yesterday,
adding that the results of the talks at the May 20-24 meeting in
Hanoi was not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the 100-hectare area in Svay Ring province flared
in January when First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
accused Vietnam of shifting border markers 300-400 meters into
Cambodia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The prince labeled this shifting as an invasion and accused
Vietnam of violating a joint declaration signed between Cambodia
and Vietnam on January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was the most difficult point of discussion, said Long Phol,
the Foreign Ministry's Director of Legal Affairs and Consular
Department, who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Last week's border talks were the first between the two nations
since Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet visited Phnom Penh in April,
during which he discussed a structure with which to address the
border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that last week's talks was not encouraging, a
compromise must eventually be reached, Ho Sok said.

<HEADLINE> Express Delivery Firms Cashes in on Time of Shanghai Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's largest city
are spending more money in record time with the mushrooming of 230
express delivery companies here.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, express delivery was a novel business
undertaken by the municipal post and telecommunications bureau,
but was rarely used by the public.
</P>
<P>
Now that people have quickened their pace in daily life and work,
time is more valuable, and more and more express delivery companies
are appearing.
</P>
<P>
These companies are state-run enterprises, joint ventures, and
private businesses, each striving for a better position in the
fledgling market.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 deliverymen on speedy motorcycles are vying with
traditional postmen, and now the state employees can no longer
leisurely roam the streets. Some of them are forced to give up
their bicycles and take part in market competition.
</P>
<P>
However, state-run post offices have the advantage of a larger
workforce and a more complete delivery network.
</P>
<P>
Competition is fierce, as express delivery values speed and
reputation. Observers say the market will be monopolized by powerful
companies, while smaller ones will be forced out.
</P>
<P>
This year, the competition becomes more intense, as many
express companies now will deliver anything a client demands --
not just emergency documents.

GUANGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Quarantine stations in south
China's Guangdong Province have launched a campaign against mad
cow beef, intercepting and capturing beef cattle imported from
Britain and other areas that have reported the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The "China Environmental News" reported May 26 that as many as

<HEADLINE> China Upgrades Production of Children's Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Large state-owned enterprises and
Sino-foreign joint ventures are major manufacturers of
high-quality children's food in China, according to a survey
conducted by the State Bureau of Technological Supervision on the
eve of International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered four categories of children's food,
including biscuits, candy, instant noodles, ice cream and lactic
acid products produced by 138 enterprises across the country.
</P>
<P>
The 13 enterprises named as producing high-quality products are
all large state-owned enterprises and joint ventures, with the
latter accounting for more than half of the total number.
</P>
<P>
The survey has shown that the product quality of these
enterprises is markedly higher than that of medium- and
small-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The key to the high quality of their products lies in their
strict management. They have adopted advanced foreign recipes and
automated production. All the production processes are sealed
against pollution. Besides, the managers of these enterprises have
a strong awareness of the importance of product quality.
</P>
<P>
There are 350 million children under the age of 16 in China,
accounting for 18.5 percent of the total population of children in
the world. China's huge potential market for children's food has
long been attracting large amounts of foreign investment, which
have established a large number of joint ventures in China since
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture has helped domestic enterprises to adopt
advanced techniques and make technological renovations. Many of
them have updated their manufacturing facilities, making great
improvements in their product quality.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese children's foodstuffs industry, starting from a
weak basis, has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, and
a group of producers has emerged with a sound production scale and
high product quality, the survey concluded.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Strives to Protect Tourists' Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The tourism departments of Sichuan
Province have taken effective measures to protect the interests of
tourists, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The province in southwest China has abundant tourism
resources. However, some tourism enterprises go in for activities
which harm the interests of tourists, such as false propaganda,
contract violation and bad service.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the provincial tourism department has
established supervision organizations in major scenic spots to take
control of tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the organizations are responsible for dealing
with complaints from tourists, and tourism agencies at fault
will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourism agencies are required to turn in a certain
sum of money at the beginning of the year, from which deductions
will be made if an agency is found to have harmed tourists'
interests.
</P>
<P>
If an agency does not receive any complaints for a whole year
the money, together with relevant interest, will be carried over
to the next year.
</P>
<P>
Provincial tourism officials said that this method has been
very effective in regulating the activities of tourism agencies.
</P>
<P>
Other measures related to prices, sanitation of catering places,
public security and traffic have also ensured good order of the
province's tourism market, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Handicrafts Prosper Again in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Traditional handicrafts from the
isolated plateau region of Tibet have broken through the barrier
of surrounding mountains to let outsiders enjoy their charm. And
now villagers there are reaping great profits from their ancestral
arts.
</P>
<P>
This regional artistry in southwest China has been practiced
for centuries, and is rooted in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
In east Tibet's Wazhin Village of Qamdo County, 27 of 33
households are engaged in handicrafts such as painting, gold and
silver decorations, and sculpture. More than half of the village's
income comes from the handicraft business, rather than farming.
</P>
<P>
The county is home to the Garma Gansa Temple, a famous
structure belonging to the Kagyudpa Sect of Tibetan Buddhism. It
was built in the early 12th century.
</P>
<P>
Assisting its construction were many handicraft experts invited
from Tibet's bordering countries of India, Nepal and Sikkim, as
well as other inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the temple, many of the craftsmen
remained in the mountainous area and started families. Now,
varieties of handicraft skills they passed on to their descendants
have resurfaced and are bringing new wealth to local residents.
</P>
<P>
Qamba Singge is a descendant of a silversmith family. His
grandfather worked all his life crafting silver for a wealthy
local official before Tibet was liberated from the control of
senior monks and landowners in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"But my grandfather left not a single slice of silver to me,"
he said. "Of course, the time is different and it's in these good
days that we can carry forward and develop our traditional
handicraft handed down from former generations."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we are getting rich thanks to the handicraft," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The village is the only one in the county with a highway
nearby, and for the past several years large quantities of
handicrafts have been shipped to other parts of the country and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Among local artisans, Danzim is expert in making delicate
Tangka, a type of scroll painting marked with Buddhist images.
</P>
<P>
"Now Tibetan people enjoy free religion, and the tourism is
booming. my Tangkas are more popular than at any other time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In his small workshop, he created more than 90 Tangkas last
year, earning 30,000 yuan (about 3,600 US dollars) -- a large sum
for a villager here.
</P>
<P>
Such considerable profits have encouraged more young people in
the village to learn the traditional arts, and many of them have
become skilled.
</P>
<P>
"From ancient times, there has been a tradition of making
handicrafts in the area, but it is in the past years that the
business has been revived," a local official said.

<HEADLINE> County in Eastern Guangxi Boosts Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Hexian County in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has become a tourist attraction,
thanks to the region's efforts to develop the eastern scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The county is located at the junction of Guangdong, Guangxi,
and Hunan, and is one of the only areas for travellers from Hong
Kong to Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and Guilin to simultaneously enjoy many
tourist highlights.
</P>
<P>
The county and adjacent areas began large-scale construction
on tourist routes in 1993, local tourism authorities told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
So far, Hexian has developed four tourist programs at the Gupo
Mountain, including sightseeing of local waterfalls. Investment in
the project was 5.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A state-level forest park at the Dagui Mountain has become an
ideal place for tourists interested in sightseeing and vacationing
at summer resorts.
</P>
<P>
Other scenic resorts include an aquatic amusement park, a
race course, a hot spring, and mountain scenery.
</P>
<P>
Another attraction for overseas and domestic tourists is the
folklore of the ethnic groups of Yao and Zhuang.
</P>
<P>
The county now has five hotels with more than 300 rooms that
cater to overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Hexian hosted more than 200,000 overseas and domestic visitors
from 1993 to 1995, according to local officials, earning 6.31
million yuan from domestic tourists and more than 450,000 US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Silence Club in Bustling Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Although it was early Sunday
morning, 59-year-old Mao Weizu was already on his way to the
silence club, a gathering place for local deaf people.
</P>
<P>
The club has invited a retired teacher from the Shanghai deaf
youth technical school to tell stories about a model worker in
sign language - the means used by most people unable to
communicate verbally.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 deaf men and women crowded into the activity
room, "listening" to the teacher's speech attentively. Some of
them discussed with each other when they heard interesting part of
the story. Some even couldn't help uttering "Ah-Ah" to express
their feelings.
</P>
<P>
When the party finished, many deaf folk stood at the entrance
of the room, "saying" goodbye to each other, and making an
appointment for the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These deaf people are just like Mao Weizu, who continue to take
part in the club's activities every week. The club, called the
"Silence Club", is very popular among the deaf people across the
city.
</P>
<P>
There was no such a gathering place for the deaf just two years
ago. At that time dozens of elderly deaf people used to gather at
Zhabei park, where the ad-hoc parties were usually interrupted by
bad weather.
</P>
<P>
So more than 50 deaf people wrote a letter to the District
Bureau of Civil Affairs, asking the bureau to provide an activity
place for them.
</P>
<P>
Knowing the difficulties of the deaf, Zhijiang Street
Neighborhood Committee extended a helping hand, assigning a room
for them and designating people to the club's to help arrange and
organize. With support from the district association for the
handicapped and the Office of the Zhijiang Street Neighborhood
Committee, the deaf club was established in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
At first, only a handful of deaf people went to the club, where
they usually drank tea and chatted. Gradually the club attracted
supporters from every corner of the city, increasing its
membership to more than 200.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP Grows Faster in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The gross national product (GNP) of
the Philippines grew by 6.2 percent in the first quarter this
year, up from the 5.4 percent posted in the same period last year,
a government official told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Director-General of the National Economic and
Development Authority Cielito Habito, the real per capita GNP
stood at 2,920 pesos (112 US dollars) in the first quarter, an
increase of 3.81 percent from the 2,813 pesos (108 US dollars) a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.7
percent, while the net inflow of factor incomes reached 9.13
billion pesos (351 million US dollars), mostly from remittances of
overseas workers and supplemented by the substantial increase of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, the sector of agriculture, fishery and
forestry grew by 1.83 percent. The industry sector, along with
the service sector, fueled the growth of the economy by
registering a growth rate of 5.87 percent, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate service sector grew by 5.22 percent, outpacing
the 4.63 percent attained during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, total exports grew by 29.53 percent and
total imports expanded by 24 percent in the first quarter. The
increase in merchandise imports contributed a large part to the
growing imports, said Habito.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Sunken Ship Captain Charged with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Captain of the sunken ship
Jumanne Rume and eight other senior officials of the Tanzania
Railways Corporation (TRC) marine department were charged with
murdering 615 people believed to have died in Lake Victoria last
week.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, the accused were suspended
early this week and their case would be committed to the high
court for trial.
</P>
<P>
The nine were remanded in custody until June 13 when the case
comes up for mention.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner of Police Mahmood Shomvi read the
charges in Mwanza on Wednesday before senior resident Magistrate
Sofia Wambura, saying that the ship's captain and eight other
officials "murdered mr. Kyamutoijo Tineishermo and 614 other
passengers of MV Bukoba."
</P>
<P>
All nine accused were not required to enter pleas. But the
captain committed suicide a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Edgar Maokola-Majogo said that
recovering bodies from the sunken ship would be no longer likely
to be completed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation is slow due to darkness and mud mixed
with blood, making it difficult for the divers to reach the
corpses. The ship has sunk into the mud by one meter, making
access to the first and second class cabins as well as the
pilot's cabin somewhat complicated.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Democrats Win Landslide Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party
kept its grip on power after garnering as much as 67.9 percent of
the vote in Sunday's first round of parliamentary elections, which
the opposition said was marred by manipulation.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results released by the Central
Electoral Commission today, the Democrats have done much better
than in the last general election in 1992, when they won 62.2
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Candidates from President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party
carried 95 of the 115 single-member constituencies across the
country, where deputies are directly elected.
</P>
<P>
In the previous 140-member one-chamber parliament, the People's
Assembly, the Democratic Party controlled 92 seats and the main
opposition Socialist Party held 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
But today's figures show that support for the Socialists, who
were widely expected to give the Democrats a close fight, had
shrunk dramatically from 25.6 percent in 1992 to 3.6 percent,
winning only five constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Union for Human Rights, another opposition grouping set up
by ethnic Greeks living in southern Albania, gained two seats, as
it did in the last general election.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, run-off ballots will take place between
the two top contenders on June 2 in 10 constituencies where there
were no clear winners. Fresh voting will be held in three
constituencies where "a lot of irregularities" have been found.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,180 candidates from 24 parties and nine
independents contested the 115 elected seats in the People's
Assembly. The other 25 will be distributed to the 12 parties which
won the most votes in the first round according to their shares of
the total ballot.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was 89 percent of the 2.2 million eligible to
vote in Albania's third multiparty election since it switched to
multiparty politics in 1991, nine percentage points higher than in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The election commission said candidates from the Socialist
Party, which pulled out of Sunday's poll several hours before
voting ended, would be replaced in the runoffs by candidates from
other parties.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a state body set up to organize and oversee the
election, also demanded that central and local authorities take
measures to ensure a smooth second round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission did not say whether candidates from five
other opposition parties, which quit Sunday's election following
the lead of the Socialists, would be replaced in the runoffs.
</P>
<P>
The five -- the Democratic Alliance, the Agrarian Party, the
Social Democratic Party, the Union for Human Rights and the Union
of National Unity -- joined the Socialists in condemning the
ruling Democrats for allegedly rigging the voting process.
</P>
<P>
The six opposition parties said they would not accept the
election results and would boycott the runoffs and the new
parliament. They tried to stage a mass protest rally in central
Tirana Monday noon, but were prevented by riot police who were
seen beating up demonstrators with shields, batons and fists.
</P>
<P>
Tension spread outside the capital Tuesday when opposition
supporters took to the streets in the southern city of Gjirokaster
and the southeastern city of Korca.
</P>
<P>
In an evening television broadcast, Berisha appealed to the
nation for calm and called on voters to take an active part in the
runoffs.
</P>
<P>
He also invited opposition candidates to re-join the election
and promised them the runoffs would be held in strict accordance
with the election law.
</P>
<P>
Election monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, who had been reluctant to comment on the
election Tuesday, reversed themselves today and slammed "a lot of
irregularities" in the voting process.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks Fifth Anniversary of Copyright Law Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials today again
hailed their achievements in protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech to mark the fifth anniversary of the
implementation of China's first copyright law, Ren Jianxin, a
member of the secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, said that "nobody can deny our great achievements in
protecting copyrights over the past five years."
</P>
<P>
According to Ren and other officials attending a gathering at
the Great Hall of the People, the achievements China has made
since it implemented the copyright law on June 1, 1991, can be
demonstrated as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The country has made public a number of laws and
regulations, and attended several major international copyright
conventions. Additionally, China's copyright laws have reached the
same high standards as those in advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Courts have opened special copyright tribunals and a total
of 1,243 copyright cases have been handled through the legal
system over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
-- The government has created administrative departments to
oversee copyright issues. In the past two years, it has increased
crackdowns on illegal operations by closing a number of factories,
companies, production lines and publishing houses, and by
confiscating and crushing many pirated goods.
</P>
<P>
-- Copyright classes have been opened throughout the country,
and even the mass media has been mobilized to spread the basics of
copyright information. Many societies and associations have
created their own copyright protection agencies.
</P>
<P>
-- International trade has been launched between Chinese and
foreign publishing houses, who now grant copyright authorizations
to each other.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the State Copyright Administration,
told those attending the meeting that copyright protection has
aided China's reform and opening up efforts and proved beneficial
to the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements fully demonstrate the attitude and resolution
of the government and the Chinese people to better protect
copyrights, and it is proof that the government has the capability
to do the work well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that copyright infringements occasionally
occur, as the copyright system is still in its infancy, public
awareness is limited, and shortcomings remain in the country's
copyright law.
</P>
<P>
China will further strengthen the protection of copyrights, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Killing Opposition Leader in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran denied any involvement in
killing an Iranian opposition leader who had been on political
asylum in Paris since 1979, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iranian
embassy in Paris issued an official communique Wednesday and
denied involvement in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Reza Mazlouman, former deputy minister of education of the
previous regime before 1979, was found shot to death in his home
in the outskirts of Paris last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mazlouman moved to France after the collapse of the
monarchical regime in Iran, and began cooperation with a
political group called the Salvation Front.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent investigation by France's police revealed that his
death had been engineered by factions within the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy denied the involvement and said the Islamic
Republic had consistently condemned all acts of terrorism, and
that it was up to the French police to find out facts behind the
killing.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Mazlouman had been an ordinary citizen of
Iran and that he had not been found guilty on any charges by any
of the post-revolution courts in Iran.

TAIYUAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Early on the morning of May 27, Liu
Xuwen, 77, and Liu Minghan, 71, arrived at the compound of the
villagers' committee with their voter qualification cards, where
they cast their ballots for a new village leadership.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth election of village leaders since 1988 the
two elderly farmers had attended. Both live in the Shajian Village
of the Shuozhou City, in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the first three elections, those attending included
officials from the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs and local
government departments, reporters, and a delegation from the US
Republican Association.
</P>
<P>
Of the 419 eligible voters in this 236-household village, 404
participated in the election, which would name five out of eight
candidates for a new villagers' committee.
</P>
<P>
Ballots were counted by an election supervisor chosen by the
voters. Su Zengxiang, director of the former villagers' committee,
was re-elected by a sweeping majority of 359 votes.
</P>
<P>
"We gave Su a second term because he has done a lot of good
things for the villagers in the past three years," the old men
said.
</P>
<P>
The average annual net income for Shajian villagers reached
3,800 yuan in 1995, the highest among all villages in Shuozhou,
ranking the village among the city's ten model villages.
</P>
<P>
Paul Grove, head of the US delegation, said that the election
was "very successful" and "reflected the will of the villagers."
</P>
<P>
"I am most impressed by the high enthusiasm the villagers
showed for the democratic election," he added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela and
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi have been
briefed on peace plans aimed at bringing lasting reconciliation
to Kwazulu/Natal province, a local daily "the Citizen" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and numerous
Kwazulu/Natal leaders in the public and private sectors had been
invited to attend a peace summit in Durban on June 13, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled peace summit was part of a church initiative to
bring an end to the endemic violence plaguing Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
Project Ukuthula, as the initiative was known, was launched
three weeks ago by the Anglican and Methodist churches in the
strife-torn province. It was aimed at involving all concerned
citizens, from political leaders to community members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) and the IFP had
held a series of meetings behind closed doors to discuss ways of
ending the violence. Various provincial leaders from both parties
were involved in the meetings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the political violence between ANC and IFP
supporters in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed the lives of about 20,000
people since mid-1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs said elections
such as the one in Shajian are "a common and regular practice" in
the vast rural areas of China.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1988, most villages across the country have held two or
three democratic elections of village leaders in accordance with
the Law on Elections of the People's Republic of China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the villagers' committee, which has a
three-year term limit, should be elected by the villagers.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of people, young and energetic, honest and
decent, and willing to work for the public, were elected as
village leaders, giving a great promotion to the economic growth
and public security improvement in rural areas," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the academic exchange between his ministry
and the US Republican Association has been active for more than
three years. During that time, many American scholars, legal
experts, and government officials were invited to visit China.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them found out that Chinese government takes a serious
attitude toward the construction of democracy, while Chinese
people enjoy wide democracy and freedom," he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Issues Certificates of Origin for ASEAN Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has begun to issue its own
Certificates of Origin (CO) for commodities made in Vietnam and
exported to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries to ensure preferential tariff treatment, report here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The preferential treatment is accorded by the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) treaty which has been signed by all
members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The CEPT treaty rules that certain commodities manufactured in
ASEAN member countries are entitled to enjoy import duty rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Goods able to be granted Vietanmese COS must be products
entirely made or harvested in Vietnam or products that have 40
percent of their content sourced from ASEAN member countries
(including Vietnam) but have their final production taking place
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The COS will be labelled "products of Vietnam". The Trade
Ministry said that its import-export bureaux located in major
cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh city, Da Nang, Nha Trang and Can
Tho in the Mekong delta will be responsible for the issuing of COS
to domestic manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Man Creates Calligraphy Masterpiece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A rare piece of calligraphy entitled
"Bai Hu Tu" (Picture of A Hundred Tigers), recently was completed
by a 71-year-old Chinese calligrapher in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
It consists of only one word, the Chinese character "Hu"
(Tiger), written in one hundred different ways. The 100 characters
are all seal characters, a style of Chinese calligraphy often used
on seals.
</P>
<P>
The seal characters are in red, black, and white, and look like
tigers in moving -- running, standing, springing, going up or down
the hills, or just lying down.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for his work, Jiang Guanyi, a retired government
official in the Hanzhong District in southern Shaanxi, spent
several years studying the evolution of the Chinese character for
"tiger" that evolved during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476
B.C.).
</P>
<P>
"I collected a total of 112 different ways of writing the
character 'Hu', from which I chose 100, and redesigned them in the
style of seal characters," he said, adding that he had a keen
interest in Chinese calligraphy since childhood.
</P>
<P>
Calligraphy experts called his work a masterpiece, as well as a
bold attempt to combine research of Chinese characters with the
ancient art.
</P>
<P>
Chinese calligraphers before Jiang created similar works, such
as "Bai Fu Tu" (a hundred Chinese characters for "happiness"),
"Bai Shou Tu" (a hundred Chinese characters for "longevity"), and
"Bai Long Tu" (a hundred Chinese characters for "dragon").

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh's Political Rivals Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- With less than two weeks away from
the seventh parliamentary elections in Bangladesh, no single party
seems to enjoy an upper hand in the close race for an overwhelming
majority in the hard-earned polls under a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll showed that the former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and its biggest feud Awami League (AL) are
running neck-and-neck after their two-year-old power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of the voters surveyed said they would go for
the AL headed by Sheikh Hasina and 29 percent said they would vote
for the BNP led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, according to
the nation-wide survey conducted by the non-governmental
Democracy-Watch.
</P>
<P>
It is Bangladesh's second general election this year after the
first one on February 15 was defied by a loose opposition
coalition spearheaded by the AL.
</P>
<P>
The two arch rivals -- the BNP and the AL -- are now hotly
engaged in a new round of fight to win the elections scheduled for
June 12.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has been accusing the AL of harboring pro-Indian
sentiments, a tactic which had helped the BNP win the 1991 polls.
</P>
<P>
The AL retaliated by pointing out that the former BNP
government failed to obtain a due share of Ganges water from India
and opened the domestic market to Indian goods.
</P>
<P>
It also promised not to renew a 25-year friendship treaty with
India that expires in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the anti-Indian issue, the performance of the
former BNP government is another point of contention.
</P>
<P>
The BNP appeared to run out of powerful counterattacks against
the AL's alleges of rampant corruption and politicalization of
administration during the BNP rule.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the AL is drawing more support from literate
voters in the country -- professionals and office staff -- as well
as unemployed voters while the BNP has more backing from farmers,
workers, students and housewives.
</P>
<P>
Ferdaus Masud, a political analyst, said the BNP has a slim
chance to win in the coming elections since the general mood of
the voters in this country normally remains against the ruling
party, especially after the BNP was ousted by a mammoth
non-cooperation campaign.
</P>
<P>
Many Bangladeshis, with the army's long-time political
involvement fresh in their memories, regard the sudden removal of
Chief of Army Staff Mohammad Nasim as adding an unknown factor to
this closely fought election.
</P>
<P>
Nasim and six other senior army officials have been under
military custody after he refused to obey the order of retirement
given by President Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
The AL has charged Biswas with intending to rig the polls in
favor of the BNP with the help of army.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that if neither the AL nor the BNP can win an
absolute majority, the forming of the new government would entail
the support of at least one of the two other main parties -- the
Jatiya (National) Party (JP) or Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
No election ally has been formed so far and all the four major
parties have put up their own candidates in all the 300
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that all parties are now fighting to win as many
seats as possible and trying to make a good bargaining after the
polls," said a South Asian diplomat here.

<P>
HAIKOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- In place of the usual attractive
girls, Han Yufeng, a 96-year old man, acts as the guide to the
residence of the Soong family, which played a conspicuous role in
modern Chinese history, in Wenchang City, south China's Hainan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Han is the cousin of Soong Ching Ling, former honorary
president of the People's Republic of China and wife of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen. He and his family are the only relatives of the Soong
family still residing on the island.
</P>
<P>
Old as he is, Han is a brilliant talker and never tires of
telling anecdotes about the Soong family to visitors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when the state allocated a special fund to renovate
the residence, visitors have come in an endless stream.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xidong, director of the management office of the
residence, said, "The old man always gets up at five a.m., and
cleans the residence before starting his guiding duties."

<HEADLINE> Psychological Education Helps Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A research program has helped 32
percent of primary and middle school students who had metal
problems avoid mental illnesses, according to sources at a local
education research institute.
</P>
<P>
The research program was carried out by the Liaoning Provincial
Education Research Institute in 1993 among over 10,000
primary and middle school students from 18 middle schools and 50
primary schools in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 35 percent of middle school students had
mental problems, and some one-third of primary school students had
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Based on the survey, the institute expanded its research to 102
primary and middle schools across the country, covering over 2,000
students who had metal problems.
</P>
<P>
In these experimental schools students can consult with
psychologists and give confidential written questions to their
teachers, who resolve these questions through lectures.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also compiled textbooks, and organized various
activities to encourage students to communicate with each other or
sent them to visit factories, armed forces bases and the
countryside, in a bid to help them form an active attitude toward
life.
</P>
<P>
Psychological education in the past three years has helped 322
students escape psychological anxiety and 541 excessively
unsociable students have become approachable. Nine students gave up
their attempts to leave their families and three abandoned their
intention to commit suicide.

<HEADLINE> Village Heads in Zhejiang Province Receive Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Governments at various levels in
east China's Zhejiang Province are running a range of training
courses to help improve the educational levels of village heads.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Zhejiang Provincial Government said the move
is designed to enable the heads of 43,000 villages to have a good
knowledge of techniques and management and lead villagers in
achieving common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Under a government plan all village heads should have a junior
middle school education and half of them should have a senior
middle school education within five years.
</P>
<P>
To this end governments of various counties, cities and
prefectures have drawn up plans for training village heads, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 20,000 heads are now studying in
schools run by colleges and secondary technical schools, as well
as undergoing training courses.
</P>
<P>
One tenth of them are taking college courses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1993 the Provincial Science and
Technology Commission have been running training courses in useful
techniques and rudiments of a market economy for village heads
throughout Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
To date, 584,000 of the 800,000 village heads and rural members
of Chinese Communist Party under the age of 50 have taken the
courses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 48,000 people have been granted the title of rural
technician.
</P>
<P>
Many village heads are spreading the the use of techniques for
crop cultivation and livestock breeding to help their fellow
villagers achieve prosperity, he said, adding that they are also
trying to build more factories in their villages.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in
China, currently has 790,000 village-run factories, double the
1990 figure. The per-capita income of rural residents shot up to
nearly 3,000 yuan last year from 1,867 yuan in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt to Deal with Whoever Wins Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
said that Egypt would deal with whoever becomes the Israeli new
prime minister according to his "flexibility" in solving the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with visiting Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi here Wednesday, Mubarak said that he hopes the new prime
minister will not adopt the kind of inflexible positions taken by
former Likud Premier Yitzhak Shamir.
</P>
<P>
Israeli voters cast their votes Wednesday to elect a premier as
well as the 120-member parliament. Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
opposition Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu are the only two
candidates for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
According to initial results released early this morning,
ring-wing Netanyahu took a narrow lead over Peres. The elections
are expected to determine the future of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the elections will not be known until at least
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the two candidates, Mubarak said, "we know Peres
and understand his mentality and flexibility. But I don't know
Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
But he told the press conference that Egypt had dealt with the
Likud in the past, and Egypt concluded a peace agreement with a
Likud prime minister, Menachem Begin, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who arrived in Egypt last Friday, concluded his visit
to Egypt today after holding a final round of talks with Mubarak
this morning.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists to Probe Rare Animals' Reproductive Behavior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have drawn up a
list of 13 rare and endangered animals for research into their
reproductive behavior.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zuwang, director of the Institute of Zoology
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the list comprises five
mammals, two birds, two fishes and four amphibious reptiles.
</P>
<P>
The scientists hope that the research will not only help save
the species from extinction but also help them increase their
numbers, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The animals include some little-known species as well as the
well-known panda, golden monkey, Yangtze dolphin and crested ibis.
</P>
<P>
The "wenquan she", or hot-spring snake, is the only snake found
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It gets its name from its habitat --
the Yangbajain Hot Spring in the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is
believed to be the only snake that has survived since before the
formation of the plateau. According to a survey of the
Chengdu-based Institute of Biology in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, there are now less than 100 such one-m-long harmless
snakes in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the listed species are under first-class state
protection, and many of them are on the verge of extinction, Wang
said. The number of rare antelope living around northwest China's
Qinghai Lake is estimated at less than 200. And a species of deer
unique to China is now restricted to a grove with an area of less
than ten km in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is able to artificially breed most species of
animals, but has not yet solved the problem of endangered animals
in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei Province has set up a nature reserve for
the Yangtze dolphin, and the Institute of Hydrobiology under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up a laboratory to study the
aquatic mammal.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Taking over Slight Lead from Peres: New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Likud challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu has seized an earlier slight lead from incumbent Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in the close race for Israeli premiership,
according to new polls released early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The first exit poll released at 10 p.m. (19:00 GMT) by Channel
1 Television Wednesday night put Peres leading by 50.7 to 49.3
percent over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Labor campaigners and activists gathering at the
Tel Aviv party headquaters immediately burst into cheers and
celebrations with joyful singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
However, their celebrations proved to be premature, as new
polls released at 2 a.m. today reversed eralier predictions.
</P>
<P>
With 98 percent of the votes counted, Netanyahu was shown to
lead by 50.3 to 49.6 percent over Peres, and Israeli TV reports
already predicated that Netanyahu is to win by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are about 140,000 votes still uncounted, mainly from the
soldiers, diplomats, merchant seamen, hospital patients and
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected to come out on Friday,
otherwise will be delayed until after Shabat, the Jewish weekend
that begins late Friday.
</P>
<P>
As for the elections of the Knesset (parliament), both the
Labor and the Likud, the two leading parties, appeared to have
lost some ground, with Labor's share of seats reducing to 34 from
the current 44, and the Likud's down to 31 from 40.
</P>
<P>
The big winners seem to be the religious parties and Yisrael
Ba'aliya, a new Russian immigrant party. The National Religious
Party and the Shas are expected to get 10 seats separately, while
Yisrael Ba'aliya to gain seven seats.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Israeli voters elect directly
the prime minister and the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The elections are widely regarded as the most fateful in the
48-year-old history of the Jewish state, which will set the course
of the nation and the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Leader Summoned to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- President of opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress (ZDC) Dean Mungomba was on Wednesday summoned
to police headquarters for questioning, local daily "the Post"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZDC General Secretary Derrick Chitala was quoted as saying
that his party will not allow their president to report to police
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
"The summons was another attempt by the government to
intimidate Mungomba and ZDC members," Chitala charged.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time they are summoning our president
simply to harass him," he claimed, adding "we therefore refuse
and maintain that he will not go there."
</P>
<P>
Chitala suspected that Mungomba had been called by the police
for his address to his supporters outside the supreme court
building after ZDC's application to block the approval of the
constitution amendment bill (the new constitution) by President
Frederick Chiluba was dismissed by the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Railway Says No to Non-Biodegradable Meal Boxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese railway stations and
passenger trains will forbid the use of non-biodegradable
disposable plastic meal boxes, beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
Instead, new meal boxes made of paper and polypropylene, a kind
of biodegradable plastic, will be used, according to the Ministry
of Railway.
</P>
<P>
Ding Qinxue, a ministry official, said that 14 manufacturers
have been selected to supply the new meal boxes.
</P>
<P>
China first produced disposable plastic meal boxes in
1985. Now, more than 100 manufactures produce 7.5 billion boxes a
year, of which about 400 to 500 million are discarded onto the
railway.
</P>
<P>
Meal boxes carelessly thrown out by railway passengers have
created a serious 'white pollution' problem around the Chinese
railway lines.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the old plastic meal boxes require 200
years to decompose, even when buried. They are potentially
poisonous to water creatures and animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Chinese National People's Congress adopted a
resolution demanding the control of 'white pollution." The railway
authority has since been looking for substitutions for the
containers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the Ministry of Railway has been conducting a
nationwide trial use of meal boxes that are
environmentally-friendly. The products made by the 14 factories
were finally chosen for use.
</P>
<P>
According to Ding, the new plastic meal boxes can completely
degrade in two months and pose no threat to the environment. They
cost some five cents more apiece than the old boxes.
</P>
<P>
The paper boxes prove more environmentally safe, but they are
also more expensive, costing 10 to 15 cents more than the old
boxes, Ding added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Population to Reach 12 Million in 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's population will reach 12
million by the year 2025, predicts the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) in its 1996 state of world population report
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's population will stand at 5.7 million by the end
of this year, with 72 percent residing in the country's urban
areas, well above the regional average of 66 percent, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest census conducted in December, 1994,
Jordan had 4.139 million people at the end of 1994 with an annual
growth rate of 4.7 percent from 1952 to 1994,
</P>
<P>
The general census also showed that Jordan has the highest
percentage of younger people in the total population, over 70
percent under the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's average natural population growth rate, one of
the highest in the world, is estimated at 3.3 percent for the
years 1995-2000, with urban population growth rate at 4.1
percent, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
Only Syria, Yemen and Oman will exceed Jordan's urban growth,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Confrontation Damages China-US Interests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Economic co-operation between China
and the United States will benefit both, whereas confrontation
will hurt both, according to observers here.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Sino-US trade and economic relations are
now at a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
One observer said that the main obstacle lies in the fact that
the US authorities have decided to impose sanctions against a
number of Chinese commodities, in total disregard of the interests
of the two countries, the fundamental interests of the people of
the two countries, and the effective measures that the Chinese
government has taken to protect intellectual property rights (IPR)
and the great progress China has made in protecting IPR.
</P>
<P>
China will incur losses from trade sanctions imposed by the US,
he said, noting that the US will also suffer no less severely from
China's retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and US governments signed a bilateral trade
agreement on July 7, 1979, which came into force on February 1,
1980. In accordance with this agreement, the two countries granted
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status to each other.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has been growing rapidly since the signing of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Chinese side show that bilateral trade
soared to 40.8 billion US dollars-worth in 1995 from 2.5 billion
US dollars-worth in 1979, rising at an average annual rate of 20
percent.

<P>
"The US has become China's third-largest trading partner," the
observer said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 American companies had launched 20,000
projects in China and spent over ten billion US dollars on the
projects, more than those from any other country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been regarded by many American companies
as the most important new market and the one with the greatest
potential in the world.
</P>
<P>
But the development of Sino-US trade and economic relations has
not been "smooth sailing," the observer said.
</P>
<P>
Out of domestic political needs, on May 15 this year the US
government released a list of Chinese commodities worth three
billion US dollars that will be subject to US trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the US government totally disregarded the
tremendous efforts the Chinese government has made to protect IPR
and the great progress China has made in protecting IPR.
</P>
<P>
The move of the US government has not only met with resolute
opposition from the Chinese side, but has caused concern to
far-sighted people around the world, including US statesmen and
business people.
</P>
<P>
US public opinion agrees that in case of a trade war between
the two countries, the interests of the consumers of the two
countries would be damaged, bilateral trade would fall sharply and
the economies of the two countries would be affected adversely.
</P>
<P>
A number of Americans hold that neither side could win a trade
war, which would cause enormous damage to Hong Kong's economy as
well, and the US would lose tens of thousands of jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some American economists have pointed out that from the
long-term point of view, the US would lose the enormous market of
China if it imposed trade sanctions on China.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is growing in a sustained, rapid and sound
manner, and its market is expanding steadily. Imports into and
exports from China are projected to reach or top 400 billion US
dollars in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The American trade and economic community is facing a historic
opportunity for expanding co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
A number of statesmen in Asia have criticized the US for
imposing sanctions against China, noting that the US is pursuing
"power politics" in the region, which will cause adverse effects
in the region and damage the economy of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to China and the US to solve their disputes
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In international economic relations the US frequently imposes
sanctions against other countries. This has met with strong
opposition from both developing and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development held in Paris on May 21, delegates of
other Western countries strongly criticized the US for its trade
sanctions policy. They demanded that the practice of imposing
unilateral sanctions in international trade be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
IPR protection complies with China's national policy of
invigorating the country through science and technology,
represents the fundamental interests of scientific and
technological progress and economic growth, and meets China's need
to expand international economic and technological co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the US signed an agreement on IPR protection in
February last year, the Chinese government has dutifully performed
all the obligations as stipulated in the agreement and implemented
the plan for effectively protecting and enforcing IPR.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the Chinese government has set up a
special task force for enforcing IPR, opened IPR courts, shut down
a number of production lines that turned out pirated CDs and VCDs,
and destroyed millions of pirated audio and video products. All
these are undeniable facts.
</P>
<P>
Trade friction between China and the US has been provoked by
the US authorities. Therefore, the US government should take
measures to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of differences between China and the US concerning
IPR, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher indicated that the
US does not intend to fight a trade war with China.
</P>
<P>
Observers here agreed that this is a positive gesture.
</P>
<P>
One observer said, "We are waiting to see what specific
measures the US government will take to reverse its erroneous
decision on IPR protection and make good the damage to Sino-US
relations."

JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Both the two major parties,
Labor and Likud, have lost quite a number of seats in the latest
television poll predictions for the make-up of the 120-member
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Labor is still the largest party with 34 seats down sharply
from 44 in previous Knesset. Likud has also fallen significantly
from 40 seats in last Knesset to 31 seats for the
Likud-Tsomet-Gesher bloc.
</P>
<P>
Both National Religious Party and Shas have made extensive
gains and now have 10 each. They are followed by Meretz which will
have nine seats, three less compared to last Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The next largest party is Yisrael Ba-Aliya led by former
Soviet Jewish activist Natan Sharansky. It gains seven seats.
</P>
<P>
Among the other parties, Hadash has six and, The United Arab
List, United Torah Judaism and The Third Way each gets four seats.
</P>
<P>
Finally Moledet gets two seats, one less than last elections.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the small parties are big winners at the
expense of Labor and Likud.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's highest governing body, the
State Council, has given approval for the resumption of the
once-suspended Oriental Plaza construction project, a stone's
throw from Beijing's Tiananmen Square, according to the "Beijing

</P>
<P>
The State Council has agreed in principle that the Beijing
Dongfang Honglian Cultural Company Ltd and a Hong Kong investment
company will jointly set up the Beijing Oriental Plaza Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company will be responsible for the construction and
operation of the compound, located at the southern outlets of

<HEADLINE> Road Construction in Full Play in Hainan Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- As part of an ambitious scheme to
improve its transportation network, the tropical island province
of Hainan, China's largest special economic zone, is busy building
its second around-the-island super highway.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2 billion-yuan (265.06 million US dollars) road, which is
expected to be completed by the end of the year, is considered vital to
the construction of a south-north industrial corridor and the
economic take-off of the western part of the province, provincial
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The project is also deemed by top central government and
provincial figures to be of great significance to the development
of the island's Yangpu Development Zone, which is the country's
first development zone heavily invested by overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Under the elaborate plan formed in 1993, the province vowed to
build a network of modern roads with super highways as main
arteries, high-grade roads linking the cities and counties, and
ordinary roads connecting the townships and villages.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has already fueled over two billion yuan
in the building and upgrading of over 780 kilometers of highways,
including a 268-km-long super highway at the eastern part of the
island. Total highways amount to 170,000 km.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Deputies Call for Stronger Science Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the ongoing fifth
national congress of the China Association for Science and
Technology here have called for stronger co-operation in science
and technology between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Eleven deputies from Taiwan are attending the conference. The
majority of them have certain influence in the science and
technology circles of the island province and have been promoting
exchanges and co-operation across the Taiwan Straits for many
years.
</P>
<P>
Uen Hua Chao, an expert in refrigeration from Taiwan, said that
the mainland has good basic research and Taiwan has some
experience in applied technology in this field, so they can
complement each other through exchanges. The refrigeration
industries on both sides of the Taiwan Straits started
co-operation five years ago and have reached primary common
understandings on the direction of research.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Chinese co-operate with each other," he said,
"They will be strong enough to compete with the developed
countries".
</P>
<P>
Many deputies talked about co-operation in the unification of
terminology in the areas of transportation, electronics, packaging
and illumination technology, and said that they hoped that the
work in this respect will be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
"Many technical terms in Taiwan derive from Japan," Shen Wen
Po, a manager from Taiwan, said. "We find it hard to understand
each other when having exchanges with our mainland counterparts,
and this is not conducive to the education of young people."
</P>
<P>
He said that the work of unifying the use of technical terms
should start as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> "Spring Bud" Continues Support for Rural Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Another 50,000 rural girls returned
to school with the aid of the Spring Bud Plan, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This makes the total beneficiaries from the program climb to
100,000, four years after the education charity was launched.
</P>
<P>
Now the help for schooling is being offered in 27 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, to contrast to only four at
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Bud project provides free primary education and room
and board for extremely poor rural girls.
</P>
<P>
These girls can also master one or two practical skills during
their school years to increase their self-sufficiency after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the plan received 3.7 million yuan in cash donations
and 5 million yuan worth of goods. It costs about 300 yuan to
provide schooling and housing for one girl.
</P>
<P>
About two-third of the 2 million unschooled children in China
are girls. One out of three women above 16 years old is illiterate
or semi-illiterate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has pledged to universalize nine-year
compulsory education and reduce girls' dropout rate to less than 2
percent by the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the China Children and Teenagers' Foundation is
planning to raise five million yuan to help another 50,000 girls.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will also establish 20 fund-raising boxes in big
hotels and restaurants in Beijing and expand activities in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia.

NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- One-fourth of the 12 million
girls born in India every year do not survive to see their
fifteenth birthday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a UNICEF

"Having been shortlisted with Thailand as a probable site," it

<HEADLINE> Indian United Front Partners Disagree on Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- India's United Front is suffering
from growing differences among its partners, which might force its
prime minister designate H.D. Deve Gowda to go in for a small
cabinet of eight to 10 members before the confidence motion, the
Statesman reported today.
</P>
<P>
No understanding has been reached so far on the composition of
the cabinet and the programs of the United Front government, the
report quoted a senior leader of Janata Dal, one of the front's
partners, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation Tuesday of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) government that failed to muster enough support in the
House, President S.D. Sharma asked the United Front's leader Deve
Gowda to be sworn in as prime minister on June 1 and to prove his
majority in the House on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United Front partners other than Janata Dal and
the Samajwadi (Socialist) Party said Wednesday that they have not
decided yet to remain in the front.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the United Front, the leaders were
delaying their decisions to press Gowda to agree to their demands
while hectic lobbying continued.
</P>
<P>
The United Front's steering committee has met twice in the past
couple of days, producing no consensus on economic policies and
the fate of the "hawala-tainted" politicians, the same sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is a major scandal in the country which
implicates many politicians.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the toil of formulating a program acceptable to
the front's main supporter -- the National Congress Party, Gowda
was reportedly having a tough time seeking to appease all the
constituent parties of the front.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today appointed Dick Sklar, a long-time political ally,
as American special coordinator of the civilian aspects of the
U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the appointment, White House spokesman Mike McCurry

irreversible by accelerating efforts to rebuild a political and
economic fabric of Bosnian society."
</P>
<P>
Sklar, who will leave for Bosnia in a few days, is not a career
diplomat, but headed the transition team for the U.S. Agency for
International Development when Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
He is currently president of the largest project and
construction management firm in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The appointment comes at a critical time as the United States

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Condemns U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind today condemned the United States for new
legislation punishing foreign companies that trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's attack came as the United States issued warnings to
three companies from Canada, Mexico and Italy that they may face
sanctions as the U.S. began implementing the Helms-Burton law
aimed at isolating its arch rival, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that that action is being taken...We believe that
the principle of these powers is wrong," Rifkind told the
U.S. National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"No one country should have the right to tell companies in
another country how they should behave in third countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said he would discuss the issue with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his
48-hour visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill, named after its
sponsors in Congress, in March after Cuban fighter planes shot
down in February two small aircraft piloted by an anti-Cuban group
based in the U.S.. Four people were killed in the incident. Cuba
has accused the United States of violating Havana's air space.
</P>
<P>
The legislation seeks to further isolate Cuba by penalizing
foreign companies investing in and trading with the Caribbean
country. The United States has maintained economic sanctions
against Cuba since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move has outraged many countries, including its
European allies, which charged that the legislation violated
international trade rules.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and British sides of
the Airport Committee of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) today signed an agreed minute on the project of the second
runway of Hong Kong's new airport.
</P>
<P>
The minute says that the two sides discussed the Airport
Authority's proposal to proceed as quickly as possible with the
design, construction and commissioning of the project of second
runway and associated facilities at the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the provisions of the "Memorandum of
Understanding Concerning the Construction of the New Airport in
Hong Kong and Related Questions", both sides reached a common view
on the proposal as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. The Airport Authority may immediately proceed with the
design and construction of the second runway (and associated
facilities) project,
with a view to its commissioning as soon as possible after
completion of the new airport (first runway and associated
facilities) project on the understanding that the undertaking of
these works will not have any adverse impact on the completion
date of the latter project.
</P>
<P>
2. All costs incurred by the Airport Authority in respect of
the second runway (and associated facilities) project up to the
time the new airport (first runway and associated facilities)
project is completed will be financed by borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Such borrowings will not need to be guaranteed or repaid by
the Hong Kong Government, and the Airport Authority will be liable
for the repayment of such debts in full. Such borrowings will be
separate from Project Borrowings as defined in the Financial
Support Agreement signed on December 1, 1995 between the
Government and the Airport Authority, and will not subject to the
terms of that Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Repatriate Vietnamese Refugees </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
repatriate more than 4,000 Vietnamese refugees after a UN decision
to stop financial aid for the foreign boat people staying on
Galang island of Riau province in West Sumatra, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has announced
that its aid ends on May 31, and has promised to bear all the
repatriation expenses.
</P>
<P>
"The mass repatriation of the refugees is not merely the result
of the UNHCR decision, but is also based on the assurance of the
Vietnamese government to accept its people on more lenient
conditions," the report quoted Chief of General Staff of the
Indonesian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Soeyono as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared our naval ships to repatriate all the
refugees," he said, adding that the process is scheduled to start
on June 1, and expected to take more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Indonesian government would be engaged in
developing an industrial estate on Galang island after it is
vacated.
</P>
<P>
The refugees on the island, most of them from Vietnam and
Cambodia, have stayed there over the past 20 years to escape from
the political and economic turmoil in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
The number of the refugees on Galang island once reached as
high as 120,000.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Curb Pollution in Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will soon issue
ministerial regulations to stop existing loopholes for the
establishment of new industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
Existing rules do not require factories located in industrial
zones to seek approval from the Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This has caused concern over pollution and safety standards in
industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has about 50 industrial zones, of which over 30 are
"industrial estates", which, operating under the Industrial Estate
Authority of Thailand (IEAT), are entitled to tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
The other some 20 are "industrial zones" which are not entitled
promotion privileges.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Industry Ministry issued an announcement to create
"free trade zones", which are a combination of an industrial
processing zone and a bonded warehouse area.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zones are restricted to seven industries,
including the electronic and appliance, automotive, packaging,
high precision and jewelry businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) today arrested seven officers of a Taiwan container ship
in the Halifax harbor for alleged killing of three Romanian
stowaways.
</P>
<P>
The ship's captain, first and second mates, chief engineer,
carpenter and cook were arrested.
</P>
<P>
A radio operator, who deserted the ship and jumped into the
harbor Tuesday, was captured earlier today.
</P>
<P>
All the seven officers could face charges of murder, the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Television reported
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan ship has anchored in the eastern coast harbor of
Halifax since last Friday and has been prevented from leaving
there because of murder allegations by the ship's eight Filipino
crew members, who have sought political refuge after they
abandoned the ship.
</P>
<P>
They accused the ship's officers of setting two Romanian
stowaways adrift on an oil-drum raft on March 12 and throwing
another overboard in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Today's arrest was made on the arrest warrants sent over by the
Romanian government and a Canadian apprehension warrant, RCMP
Sgt. Bill Price told the CBC television.
</P>
<P>
Romania has told Canada that it wants these officers extradited
if Canadian police find evidence they should be tried for throwing
the three Romanian stowaways overboard.
</P>
<P>
After they boarded the ship and made the arrests, the Canadian
police searched the vessel "from stem to stern" for more stowaways
and evidence, according to the television.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his visiting Thai counterpart Banharn
Silpa-archa met here today and discussed ways to promote bilateral
economic cooperation, said officials close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two men also exchanged views on regional and international
issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
But the officials were reluctant to disclose whether the
leaders have touched any differences between Malaysia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said in a speech at a dinner given in his honor
Wednesday that Thailand and Malaysia "must not let minor issues
that may arise to distract their close and cordial relations."
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers later witnessed the signing of two
memoranda of understanding on the sale and purchase of natural gas
from the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area.
</P>
<P>
Banharn arrived here Wednesday for a two-day official visit in
a bid to strengthen bilateral ties and economic cooperation. He
is scheduled to leave for Singapore this afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that EU-Russia relations are at their best and
hoped that they can be boosted further.
</P>
<P>
Dini made these remarks after two hours of talks with his
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov today will meet the "troika" of the European Union's
current, past and next presidents -- Italy, Spain and Ireland --
for talks to tighten EU-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
Russia will also on June 29 join the talks of the G-7 countries
-- the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Canada, Britain and
Italy-- which will meet in the eastern French city of Lyon on June
27-29.
</P>
<P>
Keen to foster closer ties with Western powers, Russia this
month also applied for full membership in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). OECD, set up in 1961,
has 27 members, most of which are Western industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's application was rejected but OECD promised closer
links with Russia, which has been an observer in 24 OECD executive
bodies since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he and Primakov had also discussed the peace process
in Bosnia and agreed that a meeting in the northern Italian city
of Florence on June 13-14 is important for Bosnia's general
elections and reconstruction. The elections are scheduled for
September 14.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister also praised Russian President
Boris Yeltsin for his major role in reaching a new cease-fire deal
with Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also held talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Set to Issue Bonds on US Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
planning to issue bonds on the capital market of the United States
in late July or early August this year, Bank Indonesia (BI)
announced.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday by the central bank and
received today said, Bank Indonesia, on behalf of the Indonesian
government, has begun preparations for its inaugural offering on
the US capital market.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the government bonds, BI said, is expected to
be served as benchmark for (Indonesian) private companies seeking
to issue bonds on the United States' market.
</P>
<P>
It is also an effort to diversify sourcing of funds from the
international market, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has previously issued bonds in
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said amid the fast development of money and
capital market on the international level as well as a greater
need to finance development project, "it is necessary for the
government to utilize long-term debt from non-bank institutional
investors on the international market."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank data shows that Indonesia's bond market was
still small compared to other Asian countries. In 1994, bonds
issued by Indonesian companies reached 25 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that the country's bond market could reach
39 billion US dollars in 1999 and 59 billion US dollars in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Australian External Balance Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's higher economic growth
caused its foreign trade deficit to blow out to near 2 billion
Australian dollars (1.6 billion US dollars) in April, according to
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today.
</P>
<P>
ABS said that the current account deficit widened to 1.995
billion Australian dollars (1.58 billion US dollars) in April
seasonally adjusted from a revised 1.204 billion Australian
dollars (951 million US dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Australia's current account deficit has remained under below
billion Australian dollars since last August.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that imports increased over 6 percent in
April, while exports grew less than 0.5 percent. The trade
deficit was blown out to 249 million Australian dollars (197
million US dollars) seasonally adjusted from a surplus of 29
million Australian dollars (23 million US dollars) in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the current account deficit was attributed to a
stronger economy that sucked in more imports.
</P>
<P>
National account figures released by ABS Wednesday showed that
the economy was growing at a rate of 4.8 percent in the year to
March.
</P>
<P>
Australia is known of its low level of national savings
comparing with other western countries. This has forced it to
rely on overseas funds to support its investment.
</P>
<P>
The government is pushing forward micro-economic reforms to
improve productivity on the basis of existing economic capacities,
as well as trying to alter people's saving habits.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Change Sugar Policy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will maintain its policy
of raising sugar production even though the supply in the region
has been increasing, especially from India and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will continue to boost sugar supplies by
expanding crop areas because it believes regional demand will
significantly increase, according to Manu Leopairote, director
general of the Industrial Promotion Department.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of 7.7 million tons of sugar
for the year 2001, compared to the supply of 5.88 million tons
during the 1995-96 production period.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar mills are able to maintain only 60 percent

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Democrats Win Landslide Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party
kept its grip on power after garnering as much as 82.6 percent of
the vote in Sunday's first round of parliamentary elections, which
the opposition said was marred by manipulation.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results released by the Central
Electoral Commission at 9:30 p.m. local time today, the Democrats
have done much better than in the last general election in 1992,
when they won 62.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Candidates from President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party
carried 95 of the 115 single-member constituencies across the
country, where deputies are directly elected.
</P>
<P>
In the previous 140-member one-chamber parliament, the People's
Assembly, the Democratic Party controlled 92 seats and the main
opposition Socialist Party held 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
But today's figures show that support for the Socialists, who
were widely expected to give the Democrats a close fight, had
shrunk dramatically from 25.6 percent in 1992 to 4.3 percent,
winning only five constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Union for Human Rights, another opposition grouping set up
by ethnic Greeks living in southern Albania, gained two seats, as
it did in the last general election.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, run-off ballots will take place between
the two top contenders on June 2 in 10 constituencies where there
were no clear winners. Fresh voting will be held in three
constituencies where "a lot of irregularities" have been found.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,180 candidates from 24 parties and nine
independents contested the 115 elected seats in the People's
Assembly. The other 25 will be distributed to the 12 parties which
won the most votes in the first round according to their shares of
the total ballot.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was 89 percent of the 2.2 million eligible to
vote in Albania's third multiparty election since it switched to
multiparty politics in 1991, nine percentage points higher than in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The election commission said candidates from the Socialist
Party, which pulled out of Sunday's poll several hours before
voting ended, would be replaced in the runoffs by candidates from
other parties.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a state body set up to organize and oversee the
election, also demanded that central and local authorities take
measures to ensure a smooth second round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission did not say whether candidates from five
other opposition parties, which quit Sunday's election following
the lead of the Socialists, would be replaced in the runoffs.
</P>
<P>
The five -- the Democratic Alliance, the Agrarian Party, the
Social Democratic Party, the Union for Human Rights and the Union
of National Unity -- joined the Socialists in condemning the
ruling Democrats for allegedly rigging the voting process.
</P>
<P>
The six opposition parties said they would not accept the
election results and would boycott the runoffs and the new
parliament. They tried to stage a mass protest rally in central
Tirana Monday noon, but were prevented by riot police who were
seen beating up demonstrators with shields, batons and fists.
</P>
<P>
Tension spread outside the capital Tuesday when opposition
supporters took to the streets in the southern city of Gjirokaster
and the southeastern city of Korca.
</P>
<P>
In an evening television broadcast, Berisha appealed to the
nation for calm and called on voters to take an active part in the
runoffs.
</P>
<P>
He also invited opposition candidates to re-join the election
and promised them the runoffs would be held in strict accordance
with the election law.
</P>
<P>
Election monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, who had been reluctant to comment on the
election Tuesday, reversed themselves today and slammed "a lot of
irregularities" in the voting process.

<HEADLINE> Samper's Counsel Criticizes General Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper's attorney criticized the General Prosecutor today
for not allowing him to appear before a congressional panel
investigating corruption allegations against the president.
</P>
<P>
This would prevent Samper from presenting his case, through his
defence counsel, at the hearings in the Chamber of
Representatives, Luis Guillermo Nieto said in a letter to
Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso.
</P>
<P>
The chamber on Tuesday began hearings on Samper's alleged
receipt of drug-related money in the 1994 election campaign that
brought him to power.
</P>
<P>
The chamber has 15 days to decide whether there is enough
evidence to bring formal charges against Samper, for which he
could face impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso declared on Tuesday that Samper's attorney cannot
appear at the hearings because it would "hamper the transparency
of the decision" and because "this is not just an ordinary trial".
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Nieto argued that the right to defend oneself
was enshrined as a fundamental right in the Colombian constitution
and was a universal juridical principle.
</P>
<P>
Colombians also have the right to know as much as possible
about the proceedings against the president and his response,
Nieto added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he could not understand how the general prosecutor
could say that, for the sake of transparency, the head of state
cannot defend himself on the same stage on which he is being
accused.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks Easier Flow of Goods to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is seeking the US
recognition of certified export inspection agencies for an easier
passage of its products through the US customs, the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Director-General of the Foreign Trade
Department Sumitra Vorakulchalerm, Thailand wants an automatic US
permission of the entry of its inspected products to replace the
customs sample-taking procedure.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has proposed to the US a memorandum of
understanding on the issue, said the report.
</P>
<P>
At present, the US customs takes 24 samples from each Thai
shipment of food products, with one substandard sample out of the
24 enough to justify the detaining of the entire shipment and
inspection of every item.
</P>
<P>
Under the current arrangement, any Thai company with more than
three shipment detentions in six months is required to have all of
its subsequent shipments detained automatically with 100 percent
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has already signed memoranda for mutual recognition of
standard inspection with Canada and Japan and is expected to sign
one with Russia soon.

<HEADLINE> China, Britain Agree on 2nd Runway at HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The two sides of the Sino-British
Airport Committee today reached a consensus on the construction of
the second runway at Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok on
the basis of the consultations between their experts.
</P>
<P>
After a plenary meeting of the committee held this morning,
senior representatives of the two sides on the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) signed an agreed minute.
</P>
<P>
Under the minute, the Airport Authorities can start the design
and construction work of the second runway right after the meeting
while all the expenditure of the project should be provided by the
Airport Authorities by raising loans.
</P>
<P>
The minute says that it is the Airport Authorities'
responsibility to pay all the loans and there is no need for the
Hong Kong government to inject any equity or provide financial
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that the second runway and its associated
facilities should be put into trial operation as soon as possible
after the completion of the first runway and its associated
facilities at the new airport, but the project of the second
runway should not produce any unfavorable impact on the completion
of the first runway and its associated facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side noted that the earlier construction of the
second runway will not only help bring the new airport's functions
into full play and maintain Hong Kong's status as a regional and
international aviation center, but will also produce positive
impact on Hong Kong's long-term social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Today's consensus is another positive progress achieved by the
Chinese and British sides in line with the objective needs of Hong
Kong's social and economic development, said the Chinese side on
the JLG.
</P>
<P>
It added that this is a positive result of the consultations
and cooperation between the two sides on the basis of the
Memorandum of Understandings on HK's New Airport.

<HEADLINE> Companies and Farmers Flee Trouble by Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Luoyang, an industrial city in
north China's Henan Province, has found a new way to get
frustrated state-owned companies and poverty-stricken regions out
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Golden Bridge Project" cooperation between the
city's large and medium-sized state-owned companies and poorer
regions has made it possible for more than 360 factories and firms
to come into existence, earning 2.7 billion yuan (325 million US
dollars) since the project began five years ago, a local official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Having more than 200 state-owned companies of large and middle
size, and science and technology research institutes, the city is
listed as one of the country's major industrial cities.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand seven out of the eight subordinate counties
are listed as the poorest counties of China, with a population of
830,000 listed as impoverished.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the farmers in the city was 1,040 yuan
last year, below the average level of the country and the province.
</P>
<P>
By sending 2,300 technicians, bringing technology and spending
300 million yuan to set up factories for rural regions, 88
companies and institutes have formed eleven "aiding rural region
groups", which have all helped the economic development of
counties around the city, the official said.
</P>
<P>
About 27,000 farmers from poorer regions have steered away from
farmlands to workshops, without leaving their hometowns, and this
has increased their annual income to up to 4000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The companies get low-cost labour, land and resources as well,
which create new money-making opportunities. Statistics showed
that about 60 branches, research and material bases were
established by the countryside-going companies, providing them
with sufficient raw material not only for branches but also for
main plants, he added.

irrigation techniques, imported from Israel, Netherlands and other
countries a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
So far 20,000 hectares of farmland in water-starved Tacheng and
Bole reclamation areas have been equipped with sprinkling systems
which can save 60 million cubic meters of water a year, equivalent
to building a medium-sized reservoir.
</P>
<P>
A leak-proof pipeline stretching 14,000 km has been laid in the
southern and northern slopes of Tianshan Mountain, which prevented
800 million cubic meters of water from leakage annually.
</P>
<P>
Drip and root-watering irrigation technology, imported from
Israel, are being used in Shihezi city and Tarim Basin.
</P>
<P>
Tacheng Prefecture has built a pressure sprinkling system on
11,333 ha of land, the largest of its kind in both China and the
world.
</P>
<P>
The technique of digging a furrow on plastic-film-covered
fields, which can save 1,500 cubic meter of water for every ha,
has been applied on 100,000 ha of land.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) the region is to
build 14,000 km of leakage-proof pipelines and expand the area
under sprinkler irrigation by 24,000 ha.

WUHAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A computer-aided design (CAD) system
developed by Wuhan Architectural Designing Institute has become an
indispensable timesaver for technicians working on lengthy
projects.
</P>
<P>
The institute has also become China's first among its 10,000
institutes that has completely computerized designing.
</P>
<P>
It took the institute only one month to finish the "paperless"
design of the 213-meter-high Wuhan World Trade Center using the
system. Otherwise hundreds of people would have had to work with a
paper mountain for half a year.
</P>
<P>
To date the system has been transferred to about 30 design
institutes and greatly improved their work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
All of China's prospecting and designing institutes are
striving to computerize their design facilities before the year of
2000.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Probably Won't Visit Ukraine Before Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
planned visit to Ukraine on June 1-2 has become impossible due to
the stalemate in the Black Sea Fleet dispute between the two
countries, a senior Ukrainian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had been expected
to sign a series of documents on bilateral relations during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit would possibly go ahead only if the two countries
reach a final settlement on dividing the Black Sea Fleet, based in
the Crimean port of Sevastopol in Ukraine, Secretary of Ukraine's
National Security Council Vladimir Gorbulin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no sign that Moscow and Kiev can iron out
their differences before Russia's June 16 presidential election,
and therefore there is reason to believe that Yeltsin will not
visit Ukraine after all, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been arguing over how to divide the
Black Sea Fleet and where it should be based since the collapse of
the former Soviet Union. Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin visited Kiev on May 24, but failed to resolve the
dispute.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's PC Ownerships to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will have 300,000 personal
computer owners this year, doubling last year's figure, according
to experts with Beijing Economic Information Center.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the capital saw 150,000 families with
personal computers. And the figure will double this year because
local dwellers have directly benefited from the on-going "Price
War" that all of the PC producers hope to win.
</P>
<P>
Lianxiang Computer Company first started slashing the prices of
its Pentium 75 multimedia computers to 10,000 yuan at the
beginning of this year, other major PC manufacturers had to follow
suit, lowering the price of their products to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
At present the price of common domestically-made PC has been
lowered to about 8,000 yuan, with most of the multimedia computers
selling at a price of no more than 10,000 yuan. And these
computers are becoming more and more affordable for Beijing
residents.
</P>
<P>
One of the direct factors that fueled the price war is that
both home and foreign computer manufacturers hope to expand their
market share as local consumers show a strong will to buy personal
computers within this year or next year.
</P>
<P>
Local residents' purchasing power has been greatly improved
over the past few years which stimulated their long-term
investment. The computers with famous brand such as IBM, Compaq,
also become their favorites.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the city's PC owners are government officials,
and employees of foreign-funded ventures and scientific research
institutes. These people now have 75 percent of the city's total
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that the price war will continue in the
coming years as most of the world electronics giants are trying
boost their sales in China, such as the American Packard Bell and
Sam Sung Electronics Company of Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been few people in China that can use
computers skillfully, in spite of the great market potential. Even
in Zhongguancun, China's "Silicon Valley" in Beijing, which has
the highest popularization rate of computers, such people account
for 12 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Government Not to Recognize New Party: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Wednesday
made it clear that it would not recognize the Uni Demokrasi
Indonesia Party (Pudi) or the Indonesian Democratic Union Party
set up by convicted former legislator Sri Bintang Pamungkas.
</P>
<P>
Based on existing laws, Home Affairs Minister Yogie S. Memet
said that there are only two recognized political parties, namely
the United Development Party (PPP), the Indonesia Democracy Party
(PDI) and one functional group (the Golkar).
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement here when commenting the
formation of the new party, official sources disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no other party or parties outside the two
parties and Golkar," President Soeharto also stated several days
ago.
</P>
<P>
Sri Bintang Pamungkas, in proclaiming Pudi's formation
Wednesday with himself as chairman, said the existing two parties
had failed to make changes and reforms in the political field.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the new party was attended by a number of
civil rights activists.
</P>
<P>
Yogie said that everything in the country had to be done based
on existing laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Armed Forces (Abri) also said the
Abri shared the home affairs minister's view that Bintang's party
could not be recognized because it was against the country's
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Rejects Self-determination of Malvinas Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will not allow the
Malvinas Islands to become independent, Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella said today.
</P>
<P>
And he called once again for dialogue with Britain to resolve
the long-standing dispute between the two countries over the
sovereignty of the islands, also known as the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
"Since we Argentines do not recognize the legitimate rights of
British dominion over the Malvinas Islands, we will not recognize
the island's independence by invoking  self-determination," the
minister said in a signed letter made public today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only rational path for resolving the conflict
is "by sitting down to negotiate the dispute", as the United
Nations has repeatedly urged.
</P>
<P>
There is a clause in the Argentine constitution that mandates
the recovery of the sovereignty over the archipelago through
peaceful means and respecting the way of life of its inhabitants,
di Tella said.
</P>
<P>
Self-determination does not apply in the Malvinas Islands as
was decided by the United Nations in support of Argentina's
stand. And Argentina's recognition of a higher degree of autonomy
for the zone does not alter its status.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain fought a war in 1982 over the sovereignty
of the islands in the south Atlantic which are still under British
rule.

<HEADLINE> Local Law Encourages Growth of Beijing Economic Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- New regulations for the Beijing
Economic and Technology Development Zone have helped improve the
investment environment of the zone and attract more foreign and
domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Economic and Technology Development Zone gave the
go-ahead in 1995 to 29 ventures and investment volumes reaching
294 million U.S. dollars, Yi Xiqun, head of Beijing Foreign
Economic and Trade Commission, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said the investment volume of the zone in 1995 accounted for
63.3 percent of the total of the zone in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
Yi said at the ongoing 27th session of 10th Beijing Municipal
People's Congress that the regulations have guaranteed the healthy
development of Beijing Economic and Technology Development Zone,
and the year of 1995 witnessed the most rapid development of the
zone since its establishment in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Adopted by Beijing Municipal People's Congress last May, the
local law stipulates the rights and duties of investors. The zone
has also established a legal office and an auditor's office for
investors.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the regulations, the development zone
has attracted investment by more transnational corporations,
high-tech ventures, finance and foreign trade companies, the
municipal official said.
</P>
<P>
The zone's major foreign-funded projects in 1995 include
telecommunications project of Japan's Mitsui Company, Germany's
pharmaceutical giant Bayer A.G and projects of American Telephone
and Telegraph Company and Switzerland's ABB company.
</P>
<P>
The development zone last year also signed 17 land lease
contracts with a number of foreign and domestic businesses,
covering one million square meters of leased space.
</P>
<P>
The number accounts for 1.5 times of the zone's land lease
total in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
Yi Xiqun said about 30 ventures in the zone will become
operational by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Interbank Lending Rates Become Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank, the People's
Bank of China(PBC), will no longer impose ceilings on interest
rates on interbank lendings.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as a move further indicating the financial
authorities' determination to gradually liberalize the interest
rate system.
</P>
<P>
According to PBC sources, the interest rates on the
interbank-lending market will be allowed to float, or become
negotiable between lenders and borrowers, starting from June 1.
</P>
<P>
"Liberalising interest rates will help promote the development
of the capital market which is crucial to a market economy," said
a central bank official, insisting that the timing for the move is
well chosen.
</P>
<P>
China set into operation a national computer-linked inter-bank
lending market in Shanghai at the start of the year. So far the
transactions have been smooth and "the interest rates have not
exceeded on a single session the limits set by the central bank,"
noted the PBC official.
</P>
<P>
According to him, under a stringent monetary policy adopted by
the central bank since last year, commercial banks now report an
adequate capital pool.
</P>
<P>
"There is little chance that the interest rates on inter-bank
loans will go out of control after the cancellation of the rate
limits," he said, pointing out that the macro economy and the
capital investment are well on a rational track.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank will keep alert and make sure
that the lendings obtained from the inter-bank markets are not
used to buy securities or flow to capital investment or real
estate.

from Cipollini's team mate Silvio Martinello in a stage raced at
an average speed of more than 45 kph.
</P>
<P>
Cipollini's win had no effect on the fight for the pink jersey
of race leader, with Davide Rebellin tucked safely in the wake of
Cipollini.
</P>
<P>
Italian Rebellin is to spend a fifth day as leader on
Thursday, still four seconds clear of Russian Pavel Tonkov.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Increases Funds For Science And Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government will
inject 10 billion pesos (about 1.3 billion u.s.dollars) into its
science and technology programs, a figure that doubles the amount
allotted to the area in 1995, President Ernesto Zedillo said today.
</P>
<P>
During the awarding of "Academy of Scientific Research" prizes
for 1995, Zedillo said that he will continue to support scientific
research institutions since scientific research is a fundamental
task for building a stronger, more prosperous and just country.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that he will negotiate, soon, a loan with the
World Bank to complement the funds allocated to science and
technology, areas that will receive funds equal to one percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
After pointing out that Mexico should have a much wider
scientific community, Zedillo said that "we have decided to double
the number of students receiving scholarships in national and
foreign institutions of higher learning and postgraduate studies.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that it is necessary to find new ways for other
sectors to participate in the financing of these areas because
applied research and its potential ties with the productive
sector offers new horizons.

<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Treasurer Costello has declared the Cabinet will press ahead
with 8 billion Australian dollars (6 billion US dollars) in Budget
spending cuts despite Wednesday's release of significantly
stronger than expected economic growth figures.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Government still needs to make spending cuts of
8 billion Australian dollars to balance the Budget because the
surge in economic growth in the March quarter has been wiped out
by weak revenue collections, Treasurer Costello said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of building workers walked off the job
Wednesday in a national strike in protest at the Federal
Government's refusal to overturn a taxation ruling removing the
tax-exempt status of award travel allowance.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street continued to
fall sharply today as bonds tumbled, sending long-term interest
rates high.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 35.84 to 5,673.83.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 9 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 346.13 million shares as against 338.25
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 2.08 to 358.44 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.30 to 667.93.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.97 to 1,225.33, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 3.50 to 607.27.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the blue-chip barometer lost more than 53 points as
investors grew increasingly skeptical about new gains in the
market's record-setting advance and started taking in profits.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also gave back more of their recent gains
after holding their ground for much of the session.
</P>
<P>
Bonds dropped further today after Federal Reserve Board
Governor Susan Phillips, speaking at a conference, said the
economy was doing very well but that there were some signs of wage
inflation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the yield on 30-year Treasuries jumped over 6.9
percent, with investors worrying that the Fed would raise interest
rates in July to fight inflation by slowing consumer spending.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- American scientists have
successfully transplanted sperm-making cells between species,
raising the possibility of using animals to produce sperm for
infertile men.
</P>
<P>
Their findings were published in the June issue of the journal
Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The researchers froze sperm-making cells from mice for up to
156 days, thawed them, implanted them in other mice and found that
the cells produced sperm.
</P>
<P>
The technique could one day enable men made sterile by
chemotherapy to regain their fertility, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
With further improvement, the techniques could also be a boon
to conservation of endangered animals, livestock breeding and
studies of human genetic diseases, they added.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Foreign Companies Over Investments in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration today
sent out letters to several foreign companies, warning them that
they may soon be subject to U.S. sanctions for their business
activities in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nick Burns said that today's action
was the first step in the process of carrying out the so-called
Helms-Burton legislation enacted by President Bill Clinton on
March 12. The legislation was intended to intensify economic
sanctions against Cuba and to punish those foreign companies that
invest in properties in Cuba formerly owned by American
individuals or corporations but later confiscated by the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration used to oppose most provisions of
this legislation because of the opposition of U.S. allies. But it
had a change of heart in February after Cuba shot down two
Miami-based planes intruding the Cuban airspace.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the letters "merely inform" those companies
that for their investments in Cuba, their top officers, major
shareholders and immediate family members could be denied visas to
the United States or excluded from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the second step would be the public issuance of
guidelines for foreign companies and countries on related
provisions of the legislation and, as the third step, the United
States would "determine" that certain individuals would not be
able to obtain visas or use their existing visas for travel to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He did not identify the names of the companies and the
individuals to whom such "advisory letters" had been sent, because
of the "commitments" Washington had made to some of its "allied
governments" or "friendly governments," particularly Canada and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted unidentified officials as
disclosing that the affected companies included Grupo Domos, a
Mexican telephone company; Stet, an Italian telephone company; and
Sherritt International Corporation, a Canadian company that mines
nickel and cobalt in eastern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Burns noted that the "overriding focus" of the Clinton
administration in implementing this legislation would be "to
maximize the pressure on Fidel Castro and on the Cuban government
and to minimize the pressure and the effect of the legislation as
we can do so on our friendly governments around the world, but
particularly friendly governments here in North America."
</P>

The New York Times reported that the Helms-Burton legislation
"has caused a storm" in Canada and Mexico and among American
allies in Europe. "All contend that the United States has no right
to dictate whether non-American companies can invest in Cuba," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria recently called the
U.S. legislation "a very, very dangerous precedent." Canada also
condemned it as a violation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Canadian and Mexican officials were in Washington Tuesday,
talking with U.S. officials over the disputes. But the State
Department spokesman refused to give any details about the result
of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Accuses Croatia of Violating Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav commission for
humanitarian issues denounced Croatia today for still holding in
its prisons several hundred prisoners of war and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The commission discussed today the implementation of a
"cooperation protocol" signed with the Croatian commission for
detained and missing persons in Zagreb on April 17 and concluded
that the protocol was not fully implemented, a statement issued by
the Yugoslav Ministry of Information said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav commission said only 302 persons out of the total
number of detainees in Croatian prisons had been visited by the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while it was known
that there were many prisoners who had not been registered by the
ICRC.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia is thus flagrantly violating the Geneva conventions
and the Dayton peace accord and is failing to honor an obligation
it assumed by signing the cooperation protocol to free all those
who have been captured and detained against their will under its
authority," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The commission criticized Croatia for failing to meet a single
obligation from the protocol, while Yugoslavia has released all
detainees, it added.
</P>
<P>
The rump Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, went
into a brief war with Croatia when the republic declared
independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. The two countries
have not yet recognized each other diplomatically due to the
territorial dispute.

<HEADLINE> 500 Million Urbanites Are Poor, Says UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 million urban
residents in developing countries cannot meet their basic needs,
according to a United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA) report launched here today.
</P>
<P>
In its state of the world population report for 1996, UNFPA
blamed the problem on ''urban poverty, sub-standard and
over-crowded housing, inadequate water and sanitation,
insufficient education and employment opportunities as well as
the gap between the rich and poor''.
</P>
<P>
The report says that globally, urban population is growing at
a rate of 2.5 percent a year, faster than the world's population,
with 2.6 billion of the 5.8 billion people living in cities.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.7 billion of the world's urban population live in
developing countries, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
The report also examines related health issues, environmental
hazards, over-crowding and the spread of infectious diseases,
saying that ''improving social and economic conditions for all
people and promoting sustainable development is increasingly an
urban challenge''.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for integrated policies and plans linking
balanced development of rural and urban areas to poverty
alleviation, the empowerment of women through education, greater
involvement in decison making and better enterpreneurial
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
This needs the joint efforts of governments and
non-governmental organizations, it adds.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges India to Resume Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today requested India to
reciprocate Nigeria's waiver of the 32 million U.S. Dollars
imposed on the Asian country's airline in 1987 over drug
charges by resuming its Air India flights to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to a brief offered to Indian High Commissioner
to Nigeria S.K. Uppal, India is known to have invited officials
of the Nigerian aviation industry for deliberations although
its response to the issue is being awaited.
</P>
<P>
The brief, prepared by the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, also raises the issue of detention of a large number
of Nigerians in India since 1987.
</P>
<P>
"There are cases of suspicious deaths in the prisons due to
brutality and negligence of Indian authorities," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian high commissioner in India has recommended that
Nigeria have an extradition treaty with India to allow for the
exchange of prisoners. But no agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
The Indian high commissioner was in Abuja to discuss with
Nigeria's minister of industry cooperation between the two
countries in the development of small-scale industries, machine
tool building and sugar production.
