<HEADLINE> Lunar Module Maker Looks Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUTCHOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- Tom Kelly is often called the father of  
the lunar module that, 30 years ago, put men on the moon. But as 
the retired engineer tells it, he was more cheerleader. He shies 
from credit, preferring the collective ``we,'' as in: ``We gave the 
20th century one of the few really good things that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And: ``We all knew that that was a once-in-a-lifetime  
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And: ``We were in the right place at the right time.''  
</P>
<P>
	The place was Grumman Aerospace Corp. in Bethpage, N.Y., a  
defense contractor where Kelly, now 70, once supervised nearly 
3,000 engineers. There, some 7,000 people in all created machines 
that linked man and moon. Their task began late in 1962, with a $2 
billion government contract. It ended in 1971, a dozen hand-built 
modules later. 
</P>
<P>
	Though self-effacing as the ``step-by-step plodder type,'' he  
believed in teamwork. Ross Fleisig, 77, of Garden City, N.Y., led 
one of Kelly's teams as an aeronautical engineer. He recalls a 
cajoling leader who could ``get people to do more than they thought 
they could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Kelly retired four years ago, he has written a memoir,  
``To the Moon -- an Engineer's Adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His story starts in Merrick, Long Island, where he grew up in a  
lower-middle class family. Even in high school, engineering 
fascinated him, and he graduated as valedictorian with a four-year 
Grumman scholarship to study at Cornell University. His prize 
included summer jobs with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't masters degrees from Columbia University and  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology or a tour in the Air Force 
that turned Kelly's eyes to the heavens. It was the Russians, who 
launched Sputnik, the first space satellite, in 1957, and later 
prompted President John F. Kennedy's pledge to place ``man on the 
moon'' before the end of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30, working at Grumman, Kelly developed plans for an orbiting  
observatory, precursor of the Hubble Space Telescope. Then, early 
in 1960, he was asked to take a look at a moon program touted by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the young space 
agency. He did, first with one, then 10, then 30 engineers. ``This 
idea kept gaining momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking government contracts was a gamble. ``This was all just a  
'What if?''' Yet it came: 15 flight vehicles, 10 test articles, 2 
simulators, other small pieces. Eventually, six completed space 
missions. A seventh -- jettisoned and burning in Earth's atmosphere 
-- saved astronauts aboard the Apollo 13 mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunar project dominated Kelly's life for eight years, 8 a.m.  
to 8 p.m. His wife, Joan, a scholar of English literature, 
understood. ``It was the most exciting job of the century,'' she 
says. ``What an adventure! ... He was doing something wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he and colleagues did it very publicly. ``If anything went  
wrong,'' he muses, ``the whole world would know about it before we 
did!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And here's how they worked: ``We had to make it up as we went  
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spiderlike module couldn't weigh too much, only 16 tons. (It  
didn't need to, with the moon's weaker gravity.) It was not 
aerodynamically sleek, at 29 feet across, from footpad to footpad, 
and just about as tall. But it was delicate, in places no thicker 
than four layers of aluminum foil, with wiring easily snapped. 
Crushable aluminum honeycomb filled its spindly legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the module lay in backup systems, all tested and  
re-tested with Kelly's crew wrestling with hypothetical problems 
and investigating all mishaps. Of 14,000 reported failures, only 22 
were never explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how hard we tried it,'' Kelly says. ``That's what made  
it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly supervised creation of the modules, from his designs and  
others. At one point, in what he calls ``a kind of ironic 
revenge,'' he also supervised their construction. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moon landing, Kelly's teams built not one, but, in  
essence, two machines. The bottom, or descent stage, with the 
spidery legs, got the men to the lunar surface and provided safe 
harbor while they walked, conducted experiments and collected 
rocks. The top part, or ascent stage, featured a small rocket ship 
that ferried two astronauts back to the orbiting command module. 
</P>
<P>
	For most Earthlings, the lunar module proved successful on July  
20, 1969, as astronaut Neil Armstrong took the first gleeful step 
on the moon. Not so for Kelly: ``The high point for me was when 
they were home, safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came more work, with more modifications. No two modules  
were alike. The last three, for instance, weighed two tons more. As 
rockets became more efficient, lunar modules could carry more 
equipment and extend each moon visit with more air and power. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, visitors to Bethpage, 30 miles east of New York, can see  
what remains of Grumman's and Kelly's moon endeavor -- a massive 
three-story, sand-brick office building; a huge four-story, 
red-brick hangar. 
</P>
<P>
	No markers tell that history happened here. Grass and weeds fill  
cracks in the concrete parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Grumman has since merged with Northrop, and company headquarters  
are in California. The Bethpage facility has been reduced to 2,500 
workers designing and developing military planes. 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate the 30th anniversary, Kelly plans to attend a  
fund-raiser for the Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchell Field, a 
former Air Force base in Uniondale. 
</P>
<P>
	At his home on the eastern end of Long Island, his big black  
telescope points past wide picture windows fronting a calm bay. 
Sometimes he aims it toward the moon, where six Apollo modules 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kellys have six grown children and 10 grandchildren. Grandpa  
likes to tease with his telescope. ``Can't you guys see them?'' he 
asks the youngsters, slate-blue eyes twinkling as they gather to 
peer at what Tom Kelly put on the moon.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``NewsRadio'' actor Andy Dick has asked a  
judge to consider him for a yearlong drug diversion program that 
could clear him of drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick, 33, had been scheduled to enter a plea Friday to charges  
including cocaine and marijuana possession and hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he appeared Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court and  
asked to be sent to the drug program. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected to be handed down at Dick's arraignment  
Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick was arrested May 15 after his car hit a telephone pole near  
the Hollywood Bowl. Police said Dick appeared intoxicated and tried 
to flee.

<HEADLINE> Swingers Get Together in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- There haven't been any Austin Powers  
sightings. But thousands of swingers have convened here this 
weekend to view erotic art, attend human sexuality workshops and 
do, uh, what swingers do. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel pool was dominated Friday by itsy-bitsy, string  
bikinis. One man wore a T-shirt that read, ``Guess Where I'm 
Pierced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't call it a ``swingers conference'' -- at least not  
around chief organizer Robert McGinley, a psychologist from 
Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is NOT a swingers conference. It is NOT a sex conference,''  
McGinley, founder of Lifestyles Organization, said during an 
opening briefing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, it's the ``Lifestyles '99 Reno Rendezvous,''  
which touts its educational programs, personal freedom and sexual 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
	Workshops include ``Romance on the Internet,'' ``HIV Update,''  
``500 Unusual Sex Practices,'' ``Growing Up With Kinky Parents'' 
and ``Sex Without Guilt: The Morality of Sexual Pluralism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porn star Ron Jeremy was slated to speak on ``Sex and the Law.''  
</P>
<P>
	There's a session called ``Introduction to Swinging ... for  
experienced and novice swingers alike'' -- consenting couples who 
swap spouses or practice other-than-monogamous relationships. It 
offers tips on how ``to handle jealousy, personal hygiene and safe 
sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people here are involved in swinging,'' McGinley  
conceded. ``But the Lifestyles Convention sponsors no sex acts 
whatsoever. What it does is let people learn about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinley said that after 30 years of study, he still can't  
define a ``swinger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nudists here. We have people involved in threesomes.  
We have people who are plain ordinary couples exploring the 
possibility of enhancing their relationship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janine Hansen, founder of the Nevada Eagle Forum affiliated with  
conservative Phyllis Schlafly, criticized the convention as 
reinforcing a negative stereotype of Nevada as the ``Sin State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It promotes the image that this isn't a stable community,''  
she told the Reno News &AMP; Review. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno Hilton officials said they'd had only one complaint, from  
two Las Vegas mothers traveling with a gymnastics team of girls 
ages 10 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Women wearing see-through outfits with string-bikini underwear  
were parading through the hotel and casino Thursday night, Linda 
Levy and Jo Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never in my 42 years of life have I seen anything like this,''  
Levy said. ``It's horrible. It's disgusting. We were never told by 
the Hilton there'd be anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel managers agreed to transfer them to another hotel across  
town, although Hilton official Rhett Long said the team's tour 
director was notified ahead of time and that convention-goers 
haven't acted inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing they've seen are thong bikinis and those are  
not against the law,'' Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Mason, a San Diego psychologist and convention speaker,  
said he thought about half of the 4,000 people at the conference 
were ``swingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them drop their kids off at the grandparents and  
they're ready to kick their heels up for the night,'' said Mason, 
who first addressed the convention in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was amazed by the smiles on people's faces. They've gotten  
rid of one of the biggest sources of stress in our lives. They 
handle sex as a normal part of life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinley founded the Lifestyles Organization in 1973 with a  
retreat attended by about 125 in Riverside, Calif. The group moved 
its convention to Nevada because of legal battles with liquor 
officers in California who won't allow erotic art exhibits in the 
same building with liquor sales.

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Tainted Juice Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Reacting to dozens of salmonella cases  
nationwide, the Food and Drug Administration on Saturday warned 
consumers not to drink unpasteurized orange juice distributed by an 
Arizona company. 
</P>
<P>
	The juice products, both frozen and liquid, were distributed  
under several brand names by Sun Orchard Inc. of Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Sun Orchard label, the juice was sold under the  
labels Earls &AMP; Joey Tomato's, Trader Joe's, Markon, Sysco, Aloha 
and Voila! The juice in question was dated for use by July 7 or 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 52 cases of salmonella poisoning in Washington state  
have been linked to the unpasteurized orange juice. Other states 
and Canadian provinces also have reported cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials say those who suspect they may have salmonella  
poisoning should see a doctor immediately. The bacteria can cause 
severe intestinal distress and possibly even death. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Orchard has stopped production of unpasteurized juice and is  
now pasteurizing all of its juice products, the FDA said.

<HEADLINE>  Soccer Finale Caps Magic Run for US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Brandi Chastain ripped off her jersey  
and sank to her knees in glee. Her exhausted teammates erupted in 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stands at the Rose Bowl, thousands of young girls  
squealed in delight. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's soccer got the World Cup ending it always wanted  
Saturday, a dramatic victory by the United States over China on 
penalty kicks after 120 minutes of scoreless play, in a setting 
unlike anything seen before in women's sports in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest crowd ever to see a women's game in any sport --  
90,185 -- cheered their heroes on through 90 minutes of regulation 
play and two 15-minute overtimes before Chastain's left-footed kick 
found the right side of the net to give the United States a 5-4 
victory for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, glittering confetti shot out over the field  
and America had a glittering set of new heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Young girls stood cheering them on, the paint on their red,  
white and blue faces running in the 90-degree heat. Fathers hugged 
daughters and mothers cried as the scene of jubilation unfolded on 
the field below. 
</P>
<P>
	A soccer fantasy that didn't seem possible three short weeks ago  
came to a frenzied crescendo that might have been much the way the 
team's youthful followers imagined as they played fantasy games in 
suburban parks and in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a storybook finish for a team that has its place in  
history,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. 
</P>
<P>
	That place hadn't yet been secured early in the day as girls  
screamed as the U.S. team arrived on a bus for the game and cried 
out the name of their favorites. Their mothers stood by flashing 
pictures, and some boys were even seen wearing No. 9 Mia Hamm 
jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	The ending capped quite a ride for the group of fresh-faced,  
talented and down-to-earth women carried the hopes of the United 
States and, quite possibly, the future of women's sports into 
overtime after a scoreless game. Yes, the U.S. team was favored to 
be here, but few could have imagined the team would be greeted with 
such a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just such great role models,'' said Tim LaMacchia, a  
Miami accountant watching two of his young daughters eating nachos 
before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMacchia, who has five daughters, brought 4-year-old Jessica  
and 6-year-old Michelle across the country. They skipped a dance 
recital to see the game while his wife stayed home with three other 
girls, including 21-month-old twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them is named Mia, after Mia Hamm,'' Michelle said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was soccer moms, though, who helped re-elect President  
Clinton, and he returned the favor by attending Saturday, watching 
a team that actually features two 31-year-old mothers -- Carla 
Overbeck and Joy Fawcett. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country is caught up in it,'' said Clinton, who  
visited both teams in their lockerrooms affter the game. ``In some 
ways it's the biggest sporting event of the last decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But these pioneers would make less for winning the World Cup (a  
$12,500 bonus) than Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown gets 
for retiring one batter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy I want to leave is that no longer can anyone take  
women athletes lightly,'' forward Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``There 
are no more excuses. They can't say we can't draw or that we are 
not marketable. We have proved it from Game 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's game became America's game, at least for a brief  
summer fling, thanks to the 20 women who can dribble and shoot with 
the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the final featured two entire hours of scoreless soccer  
that might have tested the attention span of even the most ardent 
faithful in the hot summer sun, almost every seat remained filled 
for the shootout that decided the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, a 31-year-old free spirit who posed with nothing on  
but a soccer ball recently for a magazine, may not have been 
thinking about being a role model as she stripped off her jersey, 
revealing a black sports bra, after making the winning penalty 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' the U.S. defender said. ``I just lost my  
mind. I thought, my god, this is the greatest moment of my life on 
the soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the greatest moment for women's soccer and,  
arguably, for the entire world of women's sports. The crowd that 
packed the Rose Bowl was enthusiastic and appreciative 
</P>
<P>
	The response has been quite a contrast to the U.S. victory in  
the very first women's World Cup in China in 1991. That was greeted 
largely with yawns, partly because it was played halfway around the 
world, and partly because the sport had not yet attained the level 
of popularity it now has here. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, women's soccer wasn't deemed  
ready for prime time. There, the United States defeated China 2-1 
before 76,000, but NBC televised only 10 minutes of previously 
taped highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the women showed they were going to be a force right  
away, both on the field and at the gate. They beat Denmark 3-0 in 
the June 19 opener at the Meadowlands in New Jersey before a 
soldout crowd of 78,972. Four more wins in packed stadiums merely 
increased the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	The hype never waned, as ticket brokers reported seats going for  
up to $1,000, far more than the regulation price of $45 to $110, 
and 4,000 extra seats were put on the market. Television ratings 
for the semifinal match against Brazil topped those for the 
deciding game of the Stanley Cup hockey finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be answered is whether the mini-boom will last longer  
than the red, white and blue paint on the faces of their young 
fans. Women's sports enjoyed a similar -- though less frenzied -- 
renaissance during the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to enjoy this while it is happening, because  
it's very special and might never happen again,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm was the star of the U.S. team, the goal-scoring whiz with  
all the endorsements, including a spot alongside Michael Jordan in 
a Gatorade commercial. She was perhaps the only player fans might 
have been able to name before 16 nations began the 32-game 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, players like Milbrett, Julie Foudy and Michelle  
Akers have become household names. 
</P>
<P>
	Young girls were in abundance Saturday, and so were their  
mothers and fathers. They painted their faces red, white and blue 
and wore tiny soccer balls to hold their pigtails. 
</P>
<P>
	In early tournament games, the girls had chanted ``Girls rule!  
Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one magical summer, indeed that's true.

	Though the final featured two entire hours of scoreless soccer  
that might have tested the attention span of even the most ardent 
faithful in the hot summer sun, almost every seat remained filled 
for the shootout that decided the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, a 31-year-old free spirit who posed with nothing on  
but a soccer ball recently for a magazine, may not have been 
thinking about being a role model as she stripped off her jersey, 
revealing a black sports bra, after making the winning penalty 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' the U.S. defender said. ``I just lost my  
mind. I thought, my god, this is the greatest moment of my life on 
the soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the greatest moment for women's soccer and,  
arguably, for the entire world of women's sports. The crowd that 
packed the Rose Bowl was enthusiastic and appreciative 
</P>
<P>
	The response has been quite a contrast to the U.S. victory in  
the very first women's World Cup in China in 1991. That was greeted 
largely with yawns, partly because it was played halfway around the 
world, and partly because the sport had not yet attained the level 
of popularity it now has here. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, women's soccer wasn't deemed  
ready for prime time. There, the United States defeated China 2-1 
before 76,000, but NBC televised only 10 minutes of previously 
taped highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the women showed they were going to be a force right  
away, both on the field and at the gate. They beat Denmark 3-0 in 
the June 19 opener at the Meadowlands in New Jersey before a 
soldout crowd of 78,972. Four more wins in packed stadiums merely 
increased the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	The hype never waned, as ticket brokers reported seats going for  
up to $1,000, far more than the regulation price of $45 to $110, 
and 4,000 extra seats were put on the market. Television ratings 
for the semifinal match against Brazil topped those for the 
deciding game of the Stanley Cup hockey finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be answered is whether the mini-boom will last longer  
than the red, white and blue paint on the faces of their young 
fans. Women's sports enjoyed a similar -- though less frenzied -- 
renaissance during the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to enjoy this while it is happening, because  
it's very special and might never happen again,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm was the star of the U.S. team, the goal-scoring whiz with  
all the endorsements, including a spot alongside Michael Jordan in 
a Gatorade commercial. She was perhaps the only player fans might 
have been able to name before 16 nations began the 32-game 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, players like Milbrett, Julie Foudy and Michelle  
Akers have become household names. 
</P>
<P>
	Young girls were in abundance Saturday, and so were their  
mothers and fathers. They painted their faces red, white and blue 
and wore tiny soccer balls to hold their pigtails. 
</P>
<P>
	In early tournament games, the girls had chanted ``Girls rule!  
Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one magical summer, indeed that's true.

<HEADLINE> Ind. Town Residents: Racism Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- The killing of a Korean student by a  
white supremacist blamed for a two-state rampage against minorities 
was a shock to what many see as a welcoming college town, a place 
of quirky bookstores, Big Ten athletics and intellectual residents. 
</P>
<P>
	But some residents say there are really two Bloomingtons: the  
liberal community attached to Indiana University, whose campus 
occupies much of the city, and another town more typical of the 
conservative, white-dominated state where it's located. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anyone who is not white, it was not a surprise,'' said  
Suzanne Faulk, a 48-year-old black Bloomington native and secretary 
at the city's biggest black church. ``It was a surprise it hadn't 
happened before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is sometimes called the most northern Southern state, and  
``race has always been a challenge in Indiana,'' said James 
Madison, an IU history professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The white supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, is believed to  
have gone on a three-day crime wave through Illinois and Indiana 
that targeted blacks, Jews and Asians. Two people were killed -- a 
black man in the Chicago suburb of Skokie and the Korean student in 
Bloomington -- and nine others were injured. On July 4, Smith 
apparently committed suicide following a police chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people on the university campus were already familiar with  
Smith, a former English and criminal-justice student who openly 
espoused white supremacist views and passed out leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
	On one occasion, more than 500 people marched along  
Bloomington's tree-lined streets protesting Smith's leaflets and 
views. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington, about 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis, is more  
than 90 percent white. Four percent of its residents are black and 
5 percent are members of other non-white groups. 
</P>
<P>
	And it sits in the middle of a state where blacks and other  
minorities comprise only about 9 percent of the population, a state 
that has long been fertile ground for the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana became a stronghold for the Klan in the 1920s, when the  
biggest Klan rally on record drew nearly 200,000 people to the 
north-central city of Kokomo. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Indiana have not had as much experience living with  
'others,''' Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bloomington residents say their city of 65,000 is different  
from the rest of the state. For one thing, the Big Ten school draws 
about a third of its 35,000 students from outside Indiana and about 
16 percent of its students are not white. 
</P>
<P>
	IU's music department is ranked second in the nation. An  
Internet magazine recently ranked the campus second on a list of 
the most ``wired'' public universities in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most wonderful places in the U.S.,'' said  
Patrick Efiom, a black social worker and a former IU student. 
</P>
<P>
	But other black residents -- mostly those with few ties to the  
university -- say they see racial intimidation often enough to 
consider the insults part of their everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't happen in one part of town or another,'' said  
Faulk. ``It's all over, all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more visible signs, many residents say, is a parking  
area near the town square, where small crowds park their pickups 
and party on most weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not uncommon to see Confederate flags there -- on bumper  
stickers, car-seat covers or waving in the breeze -- and several 
blacks report regularly hearing racial insults as they pass by. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't do anything about it because it happens all the  
time,'' said Kenya James, a 17-year-old high school junior who used 
to work at a Taco Bell across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they haven't received any race-related complaints  
about the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Nelms, who is black and the university's vice president  
for student development and diversity, said Bloomington is not 
unlike any other place he's ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are divided according to social class and race,'' like  
most every place else in America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bloomington is America,'' Madison said.

<HEADLINE> Desert Bull Run Draws Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESQUITE, Nev. (AP) -- It was decidedly not Pamplona. There were  
no crowded city streets, just barren, sun-baked desert. And many of 
the bulls seemed more curious than furious. 
</P>
<P>
	The second annual running of the bulls kicked off here Saturday  
with about 600 runners, some dressed in chicken suits, matching 
wits and stamina against 40 bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured, although both the runners and the bulls  
seemed exhausted by their exercise in temperatures hovering around 
the triple digits. Phoenix promoter Phil Immordino said the bulls 
flipped several runners into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see footprints in my back, you'll know I didn't make  
it,'' Ray Sheppard, 61, of Phoenix joked as he prepared to run in a 
knockoff of the 400-year-old running of the bulls in Pamplona, 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Immordino had hoped for a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 for the  
three-day weekend, but only 3,000 people turned out Saturday. About 
2,000 watched a bullfighting and bullriding event Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The event continues Sunday with two more runs.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's bull run was held in Arizona, at a Mohave County  
site on the outskirts of Mesquite.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay, Mexico Win at Copa America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's Miguel Benitez misfired on  
a crucial penalty kick in the tiebreaker shooout, giving Uruguay a 
shootout victory in a quarterfinal game Saturday in the Copa 
America soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay won the shootout 5-3 after the teams finished regulation  
play tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other quarterfinal Saturday, Mexico eliminated Peru in  
another game settled by penalty kicks. Mexico had a 5-4 advantage 
after the teams tied 3-3 in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraguay got by the host team when Benitez fired a shot that  
goalie Hector Cabrini just managed to tip with his glove. The ball 
hit the post and bounced away, and Uruguay converted its final shot 
to eliminate the tournament's hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hurting,'' Benitez said. ``A lot of people trusted in me  
and I failed them. I beg their forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez scored in the 15th minute and Uruguay tied it in the  
64th. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay, which has won the tournament 14 times, decided this  
year to send only a junior team in need of international seasoning. 
The country's top stars didn't come, and even the coach, former 
Argentine star Daniel Passarella, stayed home. Now Uruguay advances 
to the semifinal against the winner of Sunday's Colombia-Chile 
game.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes 10 Percent Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans on Saturday unveiled an $864  
billion plan that would cut income taxes by 10 percent over the 
next decade. The proposal offered broad appeal to conservatives but 
was directly at odds with White House efforts to focus budget 
surpluses on Social Security, Medicare and some new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington,  
the politicians will surely spend it,'' said House Ways and Means 
chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, the architect of the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer's blueprint goes far beyond one proposed Friday by Senate  
Republicans, who are pushing a $792 billion alternative aimed at 
the middle class in hopes of attracting some Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address Saturday, Clinton repeated that any tax  
cuts using $2.9 trillion in projected budget surpluses over the 
next 10 years must wait until Social Security and Medicare are 
safeguarded for future retirees, including a new prescription drug 
benefit. The president will meet Monday with congressional leaders 
from both parties to stress the importance of reforming Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts  
before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to 
all our families in the 21st century,'' Clinton said. ``First 
things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Archer portrayed the House GOP tax relief plan as a fair  
refund for the overpayment of taxes -- even if much of it goes to 
people earning higher incomes -- and a way to head off a new era of 
massive government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans are determined to protect taxpayers, who  
ultimately get stuck with the bills,'' Archer said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said almost half the House tax cut would come in the form  
of a gradual 10 percent reduction in all tax rates over the next 
decade, a proposal pushed and then abandoned earlier this year by 
GOP leaders following Democratic criticism that it mainly helps the 
rich. Archer's statement pointed out, however, that people earning 
over $100,000 a year pay 62 percent of U.S. income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide added that for a family of four with taxable income of  
$55,705, a 10 percent income tax cut would mean an extra $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the House GOP plan has something for each of the party's  
constituencies: lower capital gains taxes for investors, 
elimination of the ``marriage penalty'' for religious and 
pro-family conservatives, tax breaks for private school expenses 
and phaseout of inheritance taxes for small businesses and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Christmas tree that attempts to give every Republican  
what he wants, without any consideration of how it would affect the 
budget in the long run,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top 
Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does not become law, Republicans trying to hold their slim  
House majority in 2000 can blame Democrats for failing to cut 
taxes. And Democrats can counter that they were fighting to 
preserve Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The $792 billion Senate plan, meanwhile, does not include cuts  
in capital gains taxes, the private school tax breaks or the 
complete repeal of inheritance taxes. It does cut income taxes, but 
only by lowering the bottom 15 percent bracket to 14 percent -- 
which reduces all taxes equally but would mean more to people 
making less. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, chairman of the tax-writing Finance  
Committee, said in the GOP radio message Saturday that his plan 
also stresses improved retirement savings, increased access to 
health care through new tax deductions and breaks for long-term 
care also sought by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``In offering this historic tax relief, we will not fail to meet  
the challenges of Social Security and Medicare,'' said Roth, R-Del. 
``But the rest of the surplus, rather than go to create more 
government in Washington, needs to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee, which initiates all tax  
legislation in Congress, is expected to approve its bill by 
Wednesday, with the Finance Committee to follow the next week. GOP 
leaders hope to have a House-Senate compromise by the first week of 
August, but that could prove difficult given the differences 
between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, Democrats do not expect Clinton to sign into law  
any tax cut of the size proposed by Republicans. There is a chance 
that some items with bipartisan support could resurface in a more 
modest measure of $500 billion or less that would move in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Military Chiefs Want More Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a decade of shrinking the military, the  
nation's uniformed chiefs are beginning to call for an about-face. 
The post-Cold War world, they argue, is putting a bigger strain on 
America's armed forces than the Clinton administration and Congress 
-- even the military -- had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking beyond lessons learned from the strains of fighting a  
78-day air war in Yugoslavia, the Navy is eyeing more ships and 
sailors and the Air Force more planes and pilots. The Army and 
Marine Corps, whose leaders took over just a few weeks ago, are 
studying the matter but may also want more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is the most outspoken.  
</P>
<P>
	``We must reverse our current downsizing trajectory,'' Adm. Jay  
Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in a recent speech. He 
cited ``mounting evidence'' that the future fleet of 305 ships the 
Navy once thought would be enough -- there are 322 today -- ``is not 
likely to be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has no match today, but is stretched thin,  
even in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found that peacetime is not what it used to be,'' Rep.  
Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said in a recent speech on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps are about one-third  
smaller than at the end of the Cold War in 1989, yet Skelton says 
their pace of operations, in war and in peace, is 300 percent 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: overworked troops, shortages of spare parts and  
aircraft and other weapons not ready for war. This has made it 
harder for the services to retain their best people, many of whom 
can make more money as civilians. The Air Force, for example, has 
an especially big problem keeping pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the problem is particularly acute for those forces  
not first in line to deploy abroad, in the Navy's case the ship and 
aircraft crews at home bases training for their next missions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're still expected to go here, train there, do this, do  
that; you don't have the people, you don't have the parts, you 
don't have the money, and you're just spinning yourself in. That's 
what's killing us,'' Johnson said in an interview in his Pentagon 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has known for several years that overseas  
commitments -- from peacekeeping in Bosnia to combat air patrols 
over Iraq, from threats of war in Korea to an air campaign in 
Yugoslavia, and now a long-term peacekeeping mission in Kosovo -- 
were straining its resources. 
</P>
<P>
	What's different now is that some are making the case for a  
bigger military, a reversal of the ``downsizing'' trend that began 
in the mid-1980s and continued through the Pentagon's most recent 
assessment of the nation's defense needs. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 Pentagon study concluded the active-duty military could  
be cut to 1.36 million troops at the start of the 21st century 
without undue risk of undermining the nation's security. That 
compares with 2.13 million when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based in part on a judgment that the biggest  
threat facing the United States was ``coercion and large-scale, 
cross-border aggression against U.S. allies'' by hostile states 
with significant military power, such as Iran, Iraq and North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	While those threats have not disappeared, the biggest drain on  
the U.S. military in recent years has been the air war over 
Yugoslavia, which severely stretched the Air Force and forced the 
Navy to divert an aircraft carrier from East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has been eager to provide more money for the military,  
including a 4.8 percent pay raise in the budget year starting Oct. 
1, which is more than President Clinton had proposed. Increasing 
the size of the military may be harder, despite early support from 
some key lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress will press the military to trim its  
headquarters staffs, which many consider bloated, and to make more 
use of private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton, ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee,  
is particularly worried about the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it bluntly,'' Skelton said, ``the Army today is too  
small.'' It may need an extra 40,000 soldiers to meet its worldwide 
commitments without wearing out its people and weapons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Eric Shinseki, speaking to reporters June 23, a day after  
he took +ver as Army chief of staff, said he needed time to study 
the issue but his gut feeling told him an Army of 480,000 soldiers, 
the limit set by Congress, is too small. He said he would know more 
precisely in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	In a departure interview last month with the Marine Corps Times  
newspaper, Gen. Charles Krulak, the Marine Corps commandant, said 
his service needs about 5,000 more troops. ``We have cut past the 
fat, cut past the muscle, and we're into the bone,'' the newspaper 
quoted Krulak as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Krulak's successor, Gen. Jim Jones, said at his Senate  
confirmation hearing in June that the Marines have cut back so far 
they lost a ``shock absorber'' of force strength. He said a study 
begun during Krulak's tenure was looking at troop totals and all 
other aspects of the Marines' force structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I predict that one of the findings will be that we would like  
to have the shock absorber back,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force, now catching its breath after the Kosovo bombing  
campaign, is studying the implications of that 11-week war, both in 
future needs for more planes and ``in terms of the total number of 
people'' it needs, a senior Air Force officer told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, who discussed the matter on condition he not be  
identified, said that in organizing a new system of 10 air 
expeditionary forces for overseas contingencies, planners 
discovered they are 3,000 people short.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Pennies Up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some financial institutions and commercial  
banks are pinched for pennies these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand for pennies has increased dramatically in 1999, which  
has led to instances of temporarily low local penny inventories at 
commercial banks and financial institutions in several regions of 
the nation,'' from Pennsylvania to Missouri, the U.S. Mint and the 
Federal Reserve Board said in a joint statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of pennies from the Mint to the Federal Reserve are  
running 33 percent higher than last year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	From January through April, the Mint shipped 3.6 billion  
pennies, up from 2.7 billion shipped during the same period last 
year, the Mint and Federal Reserve said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither agency could provide detailed information on regions of  
the country where spot shortages of the one-cent coins have been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's been published reports over the last several months  
of businesses temporarily running short on pennies in such places 
as the Philadelphia area, Charlotte, N.C., and Cape Girardeau, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that some banks have had long-standing customer  
service policies to accept coins from the public,'' the 
Mint-Federal Reserve statement said. ``During this period of high 
demand we want to encourage additional banks to adopt policies to 
facilitate recirculation of pennies by accepting coins from the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Due to the increased demand for pennies, the Philadelphia and  
Denver mints -- the largest in the world -- are continuing to 
manufacture pennies at least six days a week on a 24-hour schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 30 years, the Mint has produced more than 312  
billion pennies. It estimates that more than 114 billion pennies 
actively circulate in the United States -- more than 426 for every 
man, woman or child in the country, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, projected demand this year for all coins is running  
21 percent above the all-time high of 19 billion coins in 1994, the 
Mint and Federal Reserve said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two culprits are usually behind spot shortages of pennies or  
other coins: People hoard the coins and don't use them or demand 
surges, generally in the summer or around holidays, coin experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mint produces billions of pennies, but unfortunately most  
members of the public stash them away in coffee cans and desk 
drawers. So it's really a recycling problem,'' said Donn Pearlman, 
spokesman and legislative liaison for the Professional Numismatists 
Guild, whose members are specialists in rare coins and paper money. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman also said there's greater demand for pennies and other  
coins in the summer when people are on vacation and traveling, and 
during the holidays when people are shopping more.

<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A court ruling ordering the city to  
let neo-Nazis march through the downtown area of this resort town 
on Saturday was a nod to free speech, the head of the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whites still have the right to speak as of this date,'' Aryan  
Nations leader Richard Butler said Friday. ``We will march!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations, based in nearby Hayden Lake, is the political arm  
of the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which holds that God has 
ordained the formation of a whites-only homeland in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the white supremacists also gathered Saturday, and  
Gov. Dirk Kempthorne planned to speak at a human rights rally at 
North Idaho College, several blocks from the Aryan Nations parade 
several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to him that he be there and show what the face  
of Idaho really is,'' said press secretary Mark Snider. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coalition Against Nazis said it would have hundreds of  
counter-demonstrators in Coeur d'Alene from throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing we want to do is send a message that the type  
of white supremacist violence that happened in Illinois will not be 
allowed to happen in the Northwest,'' said coalition member Ann 
Slater of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist Benjamin Smith went on a killing rampage  
through Illinois and Indiana last weekend, attacking blacks, Jews 
and Asians. Two people were killed and nine others were injured 
before Smith shot himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department assigned 30 to 40 officers to monitor the  
parade, said police Capt. Carl Bergh. 
</P>
<P>
	The police force already was stretched thin because of a weekend  
hot rod rally and motorcycle show. The town has a year-round 
population of about 25,000 but can swell to as many as 100,000 in 
the summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar parade in Coeur d'Alene a year ago, about 90 Aryan  
Nations marchers clashed with some 1,400 counter-demonstrators. Two 
dozen counter-demonstrators were arrested; some of them later won 
an $80,000 settlement from Kootenai County after claiming civil 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge rejected a move by  
municipal officials to move the march out of the downtown area and 
to a route beside a former garbage dump. The judge called that an 
unconstitutional infringement on free speech. The American Civil 
Liberties Union supported Aryan Nations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials ruled out further court action and urged  
residents to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a black eye on our community,'' said downtown business  
official Malcolm Johnstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, there was shoving and shouting as about 80 white  
supremacists rallied in Coeur d'Alene City Park and were met by 
about 200 counter-demonstrators. No one was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Three Jets Arrested in Long Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Two New York Jets football players and a  
former Jet were arrested Saturday after an altercation in a Long 
Beach bar and a scuffle with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Fabini, 24, and John ``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, both of the  
Jets, and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking 
at Bogart's Bar and Restaurant when they became rowdy around 12:30 
a.m., said Lt. Joseph Kearnes. Police were called and, after 
requesting assistance from backup officers, the three were 
arrested, Kearnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with  
Cincinnati three weeks ago, kicked out a window of a police 
cruiser, sending glass into the faces of the arresting officers, 
Kearnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with two counts of felony assault and was  
released on $50,000 bail. Elliott -- who pleaded guilty last year to 
driving while impaired -- was charged with disorderly conduct, 
public lewdness, harassment and assault and was released on $10,000 
bail. Fabini was charged with disorderly conduct and was released 
on $100 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are scheduled to be arraigned in Long Beach city court  
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, former Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau was  
sentenced to 15 days in jail on Friday after being arrested on 
charges he violated a protection order obtained by his estranged 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge said Gastineau's arrest violated the terms of a  
conditional discharge in a separate harassment case involving a 
woman he dated before marrying his wife.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Withdraws Muslim Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has  
withdrawn his appointment of a Muslim leader to a congressional 
panel assigned to review U.S. policy on terrorism. Jewish groups 
and several members of Congress said the nominee had justified acts 
of terror against Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Gephardt  
said Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs 
Council in Los Angeles, had been recommended to him as having 
extensive public service experience and being involved in 
interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Democrat said, however, the appointment was  
subsequently questioned and since a security check could take a 
year, twice as long as the life of the commission, he was 
withdrawing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite these circumstances, Mr. Al-Marayati is prepared to  
provide input to the commission on matters of interest and concern 
to the American Muslim community,'' Gephardt said in the letter, 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt told Hastert he hoped the panel would ``listen to the  
voices of this community and address the issues of civil rights for 
all Americans consistent with a strong U.S. anti-terrorism 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven House members wrote FBI Director Louis Freeh they had  
received information of statements by Al-Marayati justifying 
terrorism against Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These assertions cause us great concern as it is essential  
that all members of the commission be unequivocally committed to 
the prevention and prosecution of terrorism directed at the United 
States or our ally Israel,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment had been challenged by the Zionist Organization  
of America, the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation 
League and by the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish  
Committee, said Al-Marayati for a number of years had justified and 
minimized acts of terrorism against Israel and against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton A, Klein, national director of the Zionist Organization  
of America, said in a statement that ``these anti-Israel and 
pro-terrorist individuals and groups should be condemned and 
relegated to the margins of society, not granted credibility by 
being given government appointments and meetings at the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Gephardt's  
decision and said he had bowed to political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reversal by Representative Gephardt will only serve to  
institutionalize discrimination against American Muslims and their 
leaders,'' the council said in a statement. ``Muslims have been 
widely stereotyped using the issue of terrorism and it is therefore 
essential that a credible Muslim voice be heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim Public Affairs Council called on Hastert and Gephardt  
to reinstate their director ``and allow the country to hear a 
Muslim voice'' on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	It accused the ``pro-Israel lobby'' of manipulating discussion  
of an important issue, and said the Jewish groups that oppsoed 
Al-Marayati were ``extreme Zionist organizations'' trying to 
establish a pro-Israel litmus test for any Muslim considered for 
national service. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Marayati told The New York Times he would not withdraw. ``I  
think that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite 
these security clearances and get down to the business of the 
country,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Returning to Newark, N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- In the 1930s and '40s, it was hard to  
imagine a more baseball-crazy place than Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newark Bears were the nation's top minor league team,  
regularly cranking out new players for the powerhouse New York 
Yankees. The Newark Eagles, a top-flight Negro League team, 
featured five future Hall of Famers. Team rosters included such 
greats as Yogi Berra, Monte Irvin and Larry Doby. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans celebrated the Bears' return from spring training in  
Florida with an annual parade through the city. When other Negro 
League teams were scheduled for home games with the visiting 
Eagles, they commonly switched the games to Newark because Eagles 
fans could be counted on to pack the stands. Lena Horne and Joe 
Louis caught most Eagles openers. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that faded when both teams quit the city after the 1949  
season, leaving 14,000-seat Ruppert Stadium, which they shared, an 
empty curiosity until it was torn down in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Friday, professional baseball returns to Newark when the  
new Newark Bears, a franchise of the independent Atlantic League, 
christen the 6,014-seat Riverfront Stadium -- at $34 million one of 
the most expensive minor league ballparks ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's return is being hailed both by fans eager to revive a  
storied sporting tradition and by politicians hoping to replace 
negative images of a city still struggling to recover from race 
riots in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newark has always been a hotbed for baseball for as long as I  
can remember,'' says Irvin, the Hall of Fame outfielder who starred 
with the Eagles in the 1940s before helping lead the New York 
Giants to pennants in 1951 and 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go way back to the Knothole Gang,'' he says, recalling the  
program that allowed thousands of youngsters to see Bears games 
from the bleachers at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I became a member of the Newark Eagles, and we won our  
first championship in 1946. It was a very happy time in my life. It 
was a real pleasure playing in Newark. Every Tuesday they'd have 
Ladies Night and on Sundays people would come straight from church 
in their coats and ties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doby, who played two seasons for the Eagles, was the second  
black player in the major leagues, joining the Cleveland Indians in 
1947 a few weeks after Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doby recalls the segregation of the time, noting that the Bears  
stayed at the Riviera Hotel on High Street, which had a white 
clientele, and the Eagles stayed at the black-owned Grand Hotel on 
West Market. He says black players patronized the city's 
black-owned establishments. ``They knew we played for the Newark 
Eagles and treated us with great respect,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Indians, Doby had to eat and sleep apart from his  
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't as comfortable as playing in Newark,'' he recalls.  
``There, you knew you could be together with your teammates in the 
same hotels, restaurants and buses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Berra tore up the International League, lacing pitches  
thrown over his head or down in the dirt for base hits in 77 games 
with the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good baseball town,'' says Berra, the catcher who  
went on to anchor Yankee dynasty teams of the 1950s and '60s. ``I 
loved it here; it was great. We had a lot of fun in Newark, we 
really did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, suddenly, it was over. The Eagles, tangled in the decline  
of the Negro League after baseball's color line was broken, moved 
to Houston. The Bears were sold to the Chicago Cubs and moved to 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Sharpe James says the dual departures tore a hole in  
Newark's civic fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took away an image that the city could clearly identify  
with, something we could worship and talk about. We didn't have 
anything that belonged to everyone in Newark anymore,'' he says. 
``It was a rallying point for the whole community, something to 
talk about and brag about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team that now carries the Bears name is owned by another  
former Yankee catcher, Rick Cerone, a hometown boy who has invested 
more than $2 million in the fledgling franchise. The new Bears, 
created last year, have played 121 games, both ``home'' and away, 
on the road over two seasons, waiting for completion of the new 
ballpark downtown along the Passaic River. 
</P>
<P>
	As young Rick was learning the game on the city's sandlots, his  
father, Aldo, passed along stories of sneaking into Ruppert Stadium 
as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted me to know that where we grew up was a place that  
had a great history of professional baseball,'' Cerone says. ``I 
had offers to go to other cities that were going to do this and 
that for us, but this is kind of personal. I didn't want to give up 
on Newark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball venture is not without critics. Cost overruns  
doubled the stadium's estimated cost. The city and Essex County are 
footing the bill, hoping to recoup some of the money under a 
complicated revenue-sharing arrangement with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Others question the economic impact a minor league baseball  
stadium can have on Newark's downtown; one economist has likened it 
to the opening of a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears hope to draw about 120,000 fans for its 36 games at  
Riverfront Stadium this year. Opening night is sold out. The team 
aims to provide affordable nights out for families (ticket prices 
range from $6 to $8) and a place where former big leaguers looking 
for second chances or hopeful kids can catch the eyes of major 
league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerone has taken pains to incorporate Newark baseball history. A  
picnic area in left field is called the Eagles' Nest and the team 
mascot is named ``Rippin' Ruppert.'' He says he'll revive the 
Knothole Gang tradition by bringing area schoolkids into the park 
at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This city is going to be special again,'' Cerone says. ``If  
this makes people proud to have the word `Newark' on the front of 
their chest again, then it'll all be worth it.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Take Crack at Green Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's the stadium where Carlton Fisk waved a home  
run fair in the 1975 World Series, the same stadium where Bucky 
Dent's three-run homer carried the New York Yankees over the Boston 
Red Sox in the 1978 AL East playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the stadium that will be on a national stage again Tuesday  
night when baseball's best gather for the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's the stadium that, a few years from now, may not exist.  
</P>
<P>
	It's 87-year-old Fenway Park, where the Green Monster, 37 feet  
high but just 310 feet down the left field line, turns pop flies 
into homers and vicious liners into wall-banging singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk and Dent hit their balls over that wall. On Tuesday,  
sluggers Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and others will take aim at it 
just as opposing sides have been swinging away in the battle over 
renovating or replacing the park that opened on April 20, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Red Sox want to look at it as somewhat of a  
farewell party,'' said Michael Governor, spokesman for Save Fenway 
Park!, which has an architect-designed plan to renovate the 
stadium. ``The true all-star this coming Tuesday is Fenway Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials have met with the preservationists but say the  
plan doesn't have a chance of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really does not,'' said Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for  
the club. ``We understand the emotion that pushes people to 
renovate Fenway Park. No one loves Fenway Park more than the Red 
Sox. We looked at renovation for a long time but it clearly is just 
not feasible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's national spotlight could point out the stadium's  
shortcomings -- narrow seats and aisles, outdated restrooms and too 
few concession stands. St. John said bringing the stadium into 
compliance with handicapped-access regulations makes renovation 
even less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Red Sox have proposed a $545 million stadium  
project just across Yawkey Way from the current one. Groundbreaking 
could begin in the fall of 2000, with the first game possible in 
the 2003 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be worked out is financing. The Red Sox say they'd like  
to keep public aid to a minimum. But they may need $200 million for 
infrastructure work besides the $350 million they plan to spend on 
the stadium. They also must obtain land now occupied by 24 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be about 100 luxury boxes, and the current capacity  
of 33,871, lowest in the majors, would be boosted to about 45,000. 
That would provide money for a team that hasn't won the World 
Series since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	The current infield, part of the grandstand and the third-base  
dugout would be preserved, and the Green Monster would be moved 
closer to the shortstop area. All that would serve as part of the 
entrance to a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is using All-Star events to show off its plan. A model  
of the new stadium is on display at FanFest, where thousands of 
fans flock to exhibits. Television monitors there show a web page 
in which fans can comment on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball commissioner Bud Selig has said renovation can't  
work, the preservationists are taking advantage of the national 
spotlight as well. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned rallies in conjunction with Sunday's Futures Game  
involving top minor-league prospects, Monday night's home run derby 
and Tuesday night's main event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all kinds of banners and signs,'' Governor said. ``I  
don't know if you necessarily want to call it a protest march. It's 
a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The All-Star game represents a wonderful opportunity to take  
this campaign of ours national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if, in the end, the Red Sox get their way.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you go through the list of what everybody wants to  
change, you cannot bring this ballpark to a modern facility without 
tearing it all down,'' St. John said. ``By the time we've done 
that, we haven't preserved anything.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Celebrates 90th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP is recommitting itself to fight ills  
still gripping black America as the nation's largest and oldest 
civil rights organization celebrates its 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This convention will be celebratory, but we will also be  
looking back towards the principles we were founded on,'' said 
Julian Bond, the NAACP's national board chairman. ``It's nice to 
reminisce, but we can't afford not to keep looking forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an expected 14,000 members trickled into New York for  
Saturday's start of the six-day conference, NAACP officials mourned 
Friday's death of James Farmer, founder of the Congress of Racial 
Equality and the last survivor of the ``Big Four'' who guided the 
civil rights battles of the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The civil rights movement has lost a giant,'' Bond said.  
</P>
<P>
	The four -- Farmer, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern  
Christian Leadership Conference, Whitney Young of the Urban League 
and Roy Wilkins of the NAACP -- led many of the marches, sit-ins and 
freedom rides through the South that transformed America's racial 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	While those accomplishments helped in the area of public  
accommodations and voting rights, the civil rights struggles of the 
1990s are examining why black Americans are paid less, do not 
achieve as well in school and vote in fewer numbers than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look inward first as a community looking for  
solutions,'' said the NAACP's president, Kweisi Mfume, who is 
responsible for day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we have strengths we don't always use. Once we look  
inside to overcome obstacles, then we can pressure government and 
others to our causes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The convention's wide-ranging agenda also deals with police  
brutality, job discrimination in federal workplaces, health 
disparities between white and black America and peace and order in 
Africa, Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was heartened that a major part of the NAACP program,  
economic development in poor areas, received a presidential embrace 
last week. President Clinton toured areas like the Watts 
neighborhood in Los Angeles with corporate leaders, spreading a 
message for increased private investment and government incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good first step, but it has to be followed by  
substance,'' Mfume said. ``This president has reached out before, 
but he has to have a Congress that shares those same goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected to draw attention at the convention, which closes  
Thursday, is the March increase in annual dues from $10 to $30. 
Some worry it could hurt the struggling smaller branches among the 
2,220 in the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the year, it seemed the 90th birthday party for the  
NAACP would double as a going away party for Mfume, a former 
five-term congressman from Baltimore, where the NAACP is 
headquartered. Influential city leaders there had courted Mfume to 
run for mayor, and many political observers said Mfume likely would 
cruise to victory. But in May, he decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that my job is to finish the work I have begun here,''  
Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond added the group needs stable leadership after recent years  
of power fights and squabbling at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an organization, we badly need consistency,'' Bond said.  
``We are relieved he's going to stay with us, and we won't have to 
go through the torturous process of having to replace him.''

<HEADLINE> Steels' Stage Victory Taken Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAUBEUGE, France (AP) -- Tom Steels already won two stages at the  
Tour de France, and he dearly wanted to win the one at Maubeuge, so 
close to his home country of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Steels who crossed the finish line first in Friday's  
sixth stage, but he watched rival sprinter Mario Cipollini of Italy 
get the glory. The jury ruled that Steels unfairly swerved out of 
his line of motion and impeded the movement of another rider. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini, known as the ``Lion King'' and the ``King of  
Sprints,'' will be remembered for a rare hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a rider won three consecutive stages of the Tour  
de France was 1948 when Gino Bartali, another Italian, did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This annulment was justified, because we almost had a serious  
accident,'' said Cipollini, who is in second place. ``The sprint 
must be correct. The rules are clear. Steels was in a line, then he 
passed three meters to the right at the moment (Jan) Svorada was 
passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was not Steels' first incident with Tour de France  
authorities. In 1997, he was thrown out of the Tour after hurling a 
water bottle at another rider during a sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	If Steels' victory was clean, he would have finished the day  
only three seconds behind the overall leader, Jaan Kirsipuu of 
Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Erik Zabel moved up to second in the stage and Jaan  
Kirsipuu of Estonia was third -- enough to hold onto the coveted 
yellow jersey by 26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels was awarded 172nd place in the stage -- fifth from last  
place. He remains third in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Stuart O'Grady is fourth in the overall standings,  
followed by Zabel. American Lance Armstrong, coming back from 
testicular cancer, is in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Every stage this week has been marked by unsuccessful early  
breakaways followed by a furious sprint to the finish line. 
Friday's stage was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the longest breakaway was led by Francois Simon, the  
French national champion, who was trying to win a Tour de France 
stage as did each of his older brothers: Pascal, Regis and Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon's group was caught by the pack at 5 miles before the  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 107-mile route began at Amiens in the Somme region, where  
the famous World War I battle was fought. War cemeteries remain 
today, including some for Australian and British soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders passed fields of potatoes and sugar beets as the  
route headed to Maubeuge, just near Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen riders broke out at after 4 miles from the starting  
point of Amiens, a city known for having the largest cathedral in 
France. But they were soon swallowed by the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The second breakaway came at about 16 miles and featured 18  
riders. Among them were Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton. But the 
Americans were caught 9 miles later. 
</P>
<P>
	The main breakaway came after 46 miles, when Simon and fellow  
Frenchmen Frederic Guesdon and Gilles Maignan broke loose, as did 
Francisco Cerezo of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	But the four, like so many before them this week, were unable to  
stay ahead of the pack and the final onslaught of sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	When the race hits the mountains next week, the sprinters will  
give way to the climbing specialists, and many may drop out.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Faces Order To Recall Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Toyota and the U.S. Justice Department have  
failed to reach a settlement over allegedly faulty 
pollution-control computers on 2.2 million of the company's cars, 
possibly setting the stage for a massive recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department was expected to seek a court order in  
Washington, D.C., on Monday to force Toyota to fix or replace the 
computers, which could cost the automaker up to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Sales USA, Toyota's U.S. subsidiary based in  
Torrance, Calif., vowed to fight such a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disheartening,'' Toyota spokesman Joe Tetherow said. ``We  
tried to settle, but our reasonable offers were all rejected. Now 
we will go the distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Sales USA turned down a final settlement offer by  
the Justice Department late Thursday that would have avoided the 
recall but cost the company at least $100 million in fines, USA 
Today reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time an automaker had rejected a federal  
settlement involving emissions systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate centers around Toyota's emissions-control  
computers, which federal and state pollution officials say don't 
detect gas vapor leaks and fail to activate ``check engine'' lights 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement talks, which took place over the past several  
months, covered Toyota and Lexus cars and trucks built from 1996 to 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Sent Home To Rest Bad Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tampa Bay slugger Jose Canseco, who leads the AL  
with 31 home runs, was sent home from the ballpark Saturday to rest 
his chronically ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
	He is listed as day-to-day and it's not yet known how the injury  
will affect his status for Tuesday's All-Star Game. Canseco, 
batting .276 with 69 RBIs, was elected to start as the designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who celebrated his 35th birthday July 2, came out of  
Friday's game in the eighth inning against Florida with a stiff 
back. He underwent an examination Saturday afternoon and, after 
arriving late to the ballpark, he was given permission to go to his 
Miami home. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco missed 12 games in June and July last year with similar  
back spasms, but didn't miss a start following the All-Star break. 
He had two separate stints on the DL due to back ailments in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Canseco underwent back surgery to remove fragments and  
also sustained a ruptured disc.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Financier Had 6 Identities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He's a man of many names.  
</P>
<P>
	On his birth certificate, he is Martin Richard Frankel. This  
identifies the guy accused of pulling off one of the largest frauds 
in modern finance, an operator who built a phantom empire by 
bilking small insurance companies out of at least $215 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This fellow disappeared in May. This fellow's name did not. It  
has appeared in lots of places: police blotters, court papers, IRS 
affidavits, FBI most-wanted list and more than a few newspaper 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it appears at the bottom of a photograph of a man in a  
button-down white shirt, with pasty cheeks, a half grin, greasy 
hair parted on the side and slung over a high forehead, squinting 
eyes barely visible behind the glare of thick, Woody Allen-ish 
spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
	It also appears, in bold lettering, on an arrest warrant, issued  
by the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, dated May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED,'' it reads, ``to arrest Martin  
Frankel, aka Michael King, aka David Rosse (or ``Ross''), aka Eric 
Stevens, aka Steve Rothschild.'' The document failed to mention at 
least two other Frankel aliases: Robert Guyer and Fausto Fausti. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Martin Frankel's many names, and how he used them,  
comes from police reports, regulatory documents, investigators, 
former investors and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Bitter, a tool-and-die maker who hired Frankel as his broker  
14 years ago in Toledo, Ohio, is only surprised that Frankel didn't 
use more aliases. ``He's a pathological liar,'' Bitter says. 
``Marty's the kind who likes his own lies so much, he starts 
believing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also liked to borrow things. Sometimes he borrowed other  
people's money. Sometimes he borrowed their names. Sometimes he 
asked nicely. Sometimes he didn't bother to ask. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wily, with an imagination fertile enough to dream up a  
phantom insurance and philanthropic empire that, investigators say, 
duped investors from California to the Caribbean, from New York 
City to Vatican City. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he wasn't that imaginative with aliases. Most, if not all,  
of the names Frankel used belong to people he had met or learned of 
through acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the late 1980s, his penchant for deception evolved  
into a pattern and, finally, into an obsession -- an obsession that 
created, at last count, six Martin Frankels. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *STEVE 'MARTY' ROTHSCHILD   	
</P>
<P>
	No one ever actually saw this Steve Marty Rothschild.  
</P>
<P>
	He first appeared around 1987 as a name in Martin Frankel's  
notebook. Later, he showed up in business correspondence written by 
Frankel. Finally, he gained his own mailing address: 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Marty Rothschild  
</P>
<P>
	3415 Stanhope Drive  
</P>
<P>
	Toledo, Ohio 43606  
</P>
<P>
	No one, in fact, knew that Steve Marty Rothschild existed until  
a private investigator found an envelope in Frankel's trash. The PI 
had been hired by Frankel's former boss whose wife took up with 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Stephen Rothschild, a Toledo lawyer, had no clue,  
either. In 1989, he was hired by a friend, Ted Bitter, to recoup 
$65,000 Bitter had entrusted to Frankel -- a stock investment that 
had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the course of our investigation,'' says Rothschild,  
``we came across some documents that had the name Rothschild on 
them. We laughed. It was typical of what we'd already learned about 
Frankel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild and Frankel aren't exactly twins. Frankel stands 6  
feet tall, weighed 135 pounds, ``the kid who didn't fit in at 
school,'' his friends said. Rothschild is 5 feet 6 inches tall, 200 
pounds, outgoing, assertive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Frankel ever tried to take over the identities  
of the people whose names he used,'' says Rothschild. ``Now THAT 
would have been creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *ERIC STEVENS   	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens came into being sometime around 1989, after Frankel  
began romancing his ex-boss's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	This personage was more than just a name on a business envelope:  
He came across as an experienced bond trader eager to employ a 
novel and lucrative strategy to improve the returns on insurance 
company assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens didn't dress like a slick broker. He wore faded  
jeans, thick glasses, T-shirts. His hair was unruly. A Bill Gates 
run amok. 
</P>
<P>
	Working out of the home of Martin Frankel's parents, Stevens set  
up a bogus trust fund, Thunor Trust, and teamed up in 1991 with 
John A. Hackney, a Tennessee bank executive, to persuade small 
Southern insurance companies to wire him money to invest through a 
company he called Liberty National Securities, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the two wouldn't meet for another eight years, Stevens'  
soft, nonstop telephone patter about ``protecting people's sacred 
assets'' won over Hackney and at least seven insurance firms in 
five Bible Belt states. 
</P>
<P>
	They transferred at least $215 million (insurance regulators say  
it could have been as much as $350 million) to an impressive 
sounding address: 82 Wall Street, Dept. 1105, New York, N.Y. 10005. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing more than Eric Stevens' mail drop.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *ROBERT GUYER   	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens was given a number of brief respites from life  
between 1991 and 1998. During those breaks, Martin Frankel became 
Robert Guyer, president of Liberty National Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the insurance companies that were wiring huge sums of  
money to Liberty National bothered to check the Robert Guyer name 
at the bottom of the company's correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the Robert Guyer signature on a September 1998 contract to  
handle the insurance companies' portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, in May 1999, a fax arrived at the Michigan office of  
the real Robert Guyer, the real president of the legitimate Liberty 
National Securities. Guyer had met Martin Frankel in the 1980s when 
they had worked at the same brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax, from several of the Southern insurance firms, posed an  
eye-popping question: Where was the $950 million they had on 
account at his firm? 
</P>
<P>
	John Czarnecki, Guyer's lawyer, says his client had no knowledge  
Frankel was doing any of these things. ``He didn't know what they 
were talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *MICHAEL KING   	
</P>
<P>
	Michael ``Mike'' King was born to the life of royalty.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he appeared like a tornado in the wealthy New York  
suburb of Greenwich, Conn., paying cash for two pieces of prime 
property: a $3 million mansion at 889 Lake Ave. and an adjacent 
$2.6 million house. 
</P>
<P>
	The driveway soon bristled with leased limos, BMWs and Mercedes.  
Live-in chefs worked around the clock to accommodate his nocturnal, 
gourmet tastes. Young women from places like Switzerland, Russia, 
Alaska and Asia traipsed in and out of the Lake Avenue homes at all 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	King met his ladies by trolling through Internet personals,  
calling dating services and placing personals ads in the Village 
Voice. He frequented The Vault, a Manhattan club that caters to 
sadomasochists. He collected a riding crop, ropes and 
sadomasochistic literature and pornographic videos. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned his estate into a fortress, with armed bodyguards, a  
6-foot fence, surveillance cameras and floodlights. Inside, he 
built a financial whiz kid's Xanadu, complete with 80 trading 
terminals linked to the New York Stock Exchange, satellite dishes, 
four computer servers and 25 monitors with sexually explicit 
messages on screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Among King's neighbors the rumors swirled: His guards were  
carrying satchels of money and grenades. He's going to buy more 
homes on Lake Avenue and connect them with covered walkways. He's 
going to replace his windows with bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                         *DAVID STEVEN ROSSE   	
</P>
<P>
	David Steven Rosse was not the partying type. He was quite  
serious about finance. And he was not, like Martin Frankel, a Jew. 
In fact, he aggressively courted the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	He dazzled church officials by receiving them at his estate, by  
paying for tickets on the Concorde, by offering them rides on his 
private jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosse stacked the shelves of his Lake Avenue library with  
Catholic literature. He poured over the life of St. Francis of 
Assisi, renowned for aiding the poor. He told people he watched 
movies about St. Francis all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to donate $50 million to Catholic charities. When  
Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, who serves on a board that provides 
legal counsel to Pope John Paul II, flew to New York to meet Rosse, 
the American millionaire claimed he wanted to set up a charitable 
foundation inside the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	After consulting with Monsignor Giovanni Battista Re, the  
Vatican's third-highest official, Colagiovanni agreed to help Rosse 
set up a charitable foundation outside the Vatican, according to 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Rosse did so -- in the British Virgin Islands, a  
corporate tax haven. The charity's name? The St. Francis of Assisi 
Foundation. Among its list of trustees? Walter Cronkite and Lee 
Iacocca, whose names were used without permission. Its legal 
counsel? Washington power broker Robert S. Strauss, former U.S. 
ambassador to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Strauss acknowledges participating in ``certain  
transactional matters'' for the phantom foundation, according a 
statement by Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm handling the 
charity's investment. It no longer does so, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Colagiovanni says he had pledged to donate $50,000 from his own  
foundation to help Rosse. Did he ever send the money? The monsignor 
isn't telling. 
</P>
<P>
	Footnote: Martin Frankel borrowed the name David Steven Rosse  
from one of his $10,000-a-month bodyguards. The real David Rosse is 
suing Frankel for ``emotional distress'' and using his name without 
consent. Rosse could not be reached, and his lawyer did not return 
messages left on his answering machine seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *FAUSTO FAUSTI   	
</P>
<P>
	Fausto Fausti has a bank account in Switzerland. It's not clear  
what his nationality is, what color hair he has, what he does for a 
living, where he goes on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the IRS knows: Fausti is one rich son-of-a-gun.  
</P>
<P>
	In April, a month before firefighters found piles of documents  
burning in two fireplaces in the ransacked and empty mansion at 889 
Lake Avenue, the amount of $3 million was transferred to Fausti's 
Swiss bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	The sender? Martin Frankel, via the People's Bank in Bridgeport,  
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Frankel's propensity for using other people's names most  
certainly damaged quite a few insurance companies, embarrassed the 
Vatican and left U.S. financial regulators scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	It may also have created some inconvenience for the one  
individual whose name Frankel (the one now on the lam) couldn't 
possibly have used for an alias: a Greenwich neighbor of Frankel's 
who has the misfortune of also being named Martin R. Frankel. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> KC's Montgomery Goes on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Montgomery, Kansas City's career  
saves leader, is going on the disabled list with a hip problem and 
has no idea how long he'll be out. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, 37, has 297 career saves, three short of becoming  
the 10th reliever to reach 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's the farthest thing from my mind. I'm assuming  
it's never going to be,'' said Montgomery, the loser in Friday 
night's 6-5 loss to Houston. ``Coming into the season, hopefully 
that was going to be a nice little celebration in April or May, 
something to remember down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, who underwent shoulder surgery following the 1997  
season, has spent almost his entire 12-year career with Kansas City 
after coming over in a trade with Cincinnati in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the collapse of the entire Royals' bullpen, he is 1-4  
this year with a 7.54 ERA, converting only half his 10 save 
opportunities. As a group, the Royals relief corps has 13 saves and 
21 blown saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to make Jeff the scapegoat of the bullpen,'' said  
general manager Herk Robinson. ``He hasn't been effective, but 
nobody else has, either. Right now we'll get him healthy and see 
what it's like when he comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery will officially be on the 15-day DL and report to the  
Royals' complex near Haines City, Fla., next Thursday to begin 
rehabilitation. The problem concerns a tendon on his right hip 
which prevents him from driving off the mound, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in an area that's difficult to treat. They said it could  
take two weeks, six weeks or two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want to do is be crazy and go out there and  
try to outguess my health. It's just not fair to the other guys in 
this clubhouse to go out there and pretend it's going to be OK. 
It's very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he insisted he's not thinking that his career is over.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to stretch things, then yes, you can say that. But  
you're really stretching. I might not make it home after the game 
tonight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said the Royals would not try to persuade Montgomery to  
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess our option is releasing a player. Retiring is his,''  
Robinson said.

<HEADLINE>  Desert Bull Run Draws Hundreds </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MESQUITE, Nev. (AP) -- It was decidedly not Pamplona. There were  
no crowded city streets, just barren, sun-baked desert. And many of 
the bulls seemed more curious than furious. 
</P>
<P>
	The second annual running of the bulls kicked off here Saturday  
with about 600 runners, some dressed in chicken suits, matching 
wits and stamina against 40 bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured, although both the runners and the bulls  
seemed exhausted by their exercise in temperatures hovering around 
the triple digits. Phoenix promoter Phil Immordino said the bulls 
flipped several runners into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see footprints in my back, you'll know I didn't make  
it,'' Ray Sheppard, 61, of Phoenix joked as he prepared to run in a 
knockoff of the 400-year-old running of the bulls in Pamplona, 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Immordino had hoped for a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 for the  
three-day weekend, but only 3,000 people turned out Saturday. About 
2,000 watched a bullfighting and bullriding event Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The event continues Sunday with two more runs.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley Highlights Race Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the city where his professional basketball  
legend was crafted, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley 
told thousands of NAACP delegates Saturday night that matters of 
racial justice would get top priority in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, race is the reason I'm in politics,'' Bradley  
said in brief comments to a gathering of 3,500 at a gospel show to 
start the NAACP's 90th annual convention. Bradley, a former New 
Jersey senator, explained that watching the discussion and 
successful vote on the 1964 civil rights bill helped push him 
towards a life of political service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the lone candidate facing Vice President Al Gore in the  
Democratic field, said that while blacks are advancing in some 
quarters like home ownership rates, 40 percent of black children 
live in poverty, compared to 20 percent of all children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I become president, I promise those numbers will go down in  
my time in office,'' Bradley said to applause from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he would strengthen hate-crime legislation,  
support affirmative action laws and appoint people ``who reflect 
the talent in the African American community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's visit to the nation's largest civil rights group was  
somewhat unexpected. He wasn't listed on the program and NAACP 
officials expressed doubts as late as noon Saturday that Bradley 
would be able to attend. They could confirm Bradley's appearance 
only hours before the gospel show started. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore raised more than $18 million through June 30, Bradley  
took in a respectable sum of more than $11 million. His 
fund-raising efforts have been aided by prominent sports figures 
like Los Angeles Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, who roomed with Bradley 
while playing for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore enjoys several advantages over Bradley, including a greater  
number of political endorsements and the platform of the White 
House. And a June CNN-Gallup-USA Today survey gave Gore a 64 
percent to 28 percent lead. The survey had a plus or minus 5 
percentage point margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	But appealing to the black vote in 2000 may be an area of  
Bradley strength. Bettering race relations was one of Bradley's 
reoccurring themes during his 18 years as New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Bradley termed racial unity as ``the defining moral  
issue of our time'' and set the pursuit of social integration at 
the top of his presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Education Is Top US Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told the country's  
second largest teachers' union Saturday he would ``move heaven and 
earth'' to make education the top U.S. priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention the 2000 presidential race directly in a  
speech at the national meeting of the American Federation of 
Teachers. But he said that in any ``future public service,'' issues 
such as more money to repair crumbling and overcrowded schools, 
improve classroom technology and increase teacher pay would top his 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have a national commitment that education is our  
No. 1 priority,'' Gore told about 2,000 cheering teachers. ``I will 
move heaven and earth, and leave no stone unturned, to bring about 
the revolutionary change we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has asked Congress for tax breaks that would  
free up $25 billion in private money for school modernization 
targeted at poor inner-city schools. Gore said poorly maintained 
schools help create indifferent students. 
</P>
<P>
	``The powerful but unspoken message: if you want to goof off, if  
you think you education is not that important to you, go right 
ahead. It's not that important to us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But repairing schools shows a ``commitment'' that the primary  
goal is learning, Gore said, sending a new message to students: 
``You ought to do your part and study hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress also advocate tax incentives to raise  
more money for public school construction, but their plan does not 
set aside money specifically for inner-city districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing federal budget surplus projections, Gore said education  
priorities should include hiring more teachers to reduce 
overcrowding, paying them more, and ensuring the Internet becomes 
more fully integrated in classroom teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with pride of the ``e-rate'' -- Republicans call it the  
``Gore tax'' -- a telephone fee he pushed that has raised $2 billion 
for classroom Internet hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to have them name it after me,'' he said. ``We have  
to finish the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers applauded enthusiastically throughout Gore's  
speech, but afterwards some said they want to see the words backed 
up with actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how important education is, but when it  
gets right down to it, where's the money?'' said Lyris Russ, a Los 
Angeles elementary school teacher with 27 years' experience.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Comeback Welcome, Reassuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From old-fashioned semiconductor makers to  
newfangled Internet companies, the high-tech businesses that 
dominate the Nasdaq composite index are on a roll. They propelled 
the index to six new records over the course of seven recent 
trading sessions, and show no signs of flagging. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 21.21 to close at 2,793.07, a modest  
gain, but enough to lock in the latest record high close. The 
index, as important as the Dow Jones industrials to many investors, 
has tumbled and soared over the past year, but this past week's 
broad-based advance offered welcome reassurance that despite the 
youth of many of its companies, the Nasdaq remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Records are being set and smashed with stunning frequency in the  
continuing bull market, but the Nasdaq's gains are noteworthy 
nonetheless, for in the two months leading up to the streak, the 
index saw some dark moments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq struggled through much of May and June as investors  
moved their money away from technology shares and toward more 
conservative investments. The culprit? The threat of higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-growth, often high-priced technology companies that  
often feed the Nasdaq's growth faltered as the Federal Reserve 
debated whether to raise rates. Higher rates can endanger any stock 
by boosting the cost of borrowing and cutting into corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the technology companies that may post meager earnings on  
the promise of future growth are especially vulnerable, said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``When interest rates are high, I'm less likely to take a chance  
on a company that promises me results someday'' rather than now, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed ended the suspense June 30, raising interest rates a  
modest quarter-percentage point. And then a funny thing happened: 
Companies began dropping hints about their second-quarter earnings, 
and high-tech companies were able to entice investors by indicating 
they actually could deliver good results right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're through the preannouncements, and we got through with  
relatively few blowups,'' said Curt Rohrman, a fund manager and 
assistant vice president at USA Imco Equity Investments in San 
Antonio. ``The quarterly numbers should be very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! offered confirmation this past week, announcing it had  
earned 11 cents per share in the second quarter, above the 8 cents 
per share forecast by First Call Corp., and even surpassing the 
rumored 9 or 10 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock did slip a bit, as investors locked in profits after  
bidding it higher in the days leading up to the announcement. But 
Yahoo! has clearly helped the Nasdaq's gains, rising from 120 in 
early June to a peak of 178 1/8 July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	That high price illustrates one of the ironies of the Nasdaq.  
The index, which traditionally listed the smallest and youngest of 
the publicly traded companies has seen many fledgling firms balloon 
in size. Some have moved to the New York Stock Exchange in search 
of a higher profile, but high-tech powerhouses like Microsoft and 
Intel still trade through Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Those industry leaders are driving the recent runup, Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had very good relative performance, right across the  
board,'' he said, pointing to semiconductor makers like Intel, 
networking companies like Cisco Systems and Internet retailers like 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell joined the high-tech celebration Friday as Goldman, Sachs &AMP;  
Co. added the company, the nation's largest direct seller of 
personal computers, to its list of recommended stocks for private 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the recent gains heartens analysts, who last year  
bemoaned the soaring valuations of Internet stocks that showed few 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is maturing,'' Johnson said. ``Investors are now  
gravitating toward companies where there's a good chance the 
earnings will be better than estimates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq ended the week with a gain of 52.05 points, or 1.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials average set a record of its own Friday,  
rising 66.81 points to close at 11,193.70. The blue-chip index rose 
54.46 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 12.06 for the week, picking  
up 8.86 Friday to close at 1,403.28, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite was up 2.56 for the week,  
rising 3.63 Friday to 657.68. The American Stock Exchange composite 
picked up 10.31 on the week and closed at 812.73, rising 4.04 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of  
small-company stocks, inched up 1.47 for the week to 457.98, having 
risen 3.23 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $12.84 trillion, up $102.56 billion from last 
week. A year ago, the index was $10.88 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Former Northwestern Coach Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Relatives of former Northwestern basketball coach  
Ricky Byrdsong said during his funeral Saturday they have no hate 
for the man who killed him last week during a racially motivated 
shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no hate in our hearts,'' Byrdsong's father-in-law, Joe  
Kelly Jr., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, 43, an Atlanta native, was shot by Benjamin Nathaniel  
Smith on July 2 while walking with his children in Skokie, a 
Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith killed a second man and wounded several Jews and Asians  
before shooting himself July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sorry that justice wasn't done,'' Kelly said. ``If  
he'd gotten life, maybe he would've been saved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 people attended Saturday's service at the Cathedral of  
Faith Church of God in Christ in southwest Atlanta. including 
former players, ministers and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1989, he recruited me. Coming from the inner city of  
Detroit, he was the kind of guy I needed,'' said Dwayne Kelly, who 
played for Byrdsong while both were at the University of Detroit, 
Byrdsong's last stop before Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	A star player at Atlanta's Douglass High and a graduate of Iowa  
State, Byrdsong was fired from Northwestern in 1997 after a 33-72 
record and went on to be an executive with a Chicago insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the coach is gone, the game is not over,'' said the  
Rev. Haman Cross Jr. of Detroit's Rosedale Park Baptist Church, 
where the Byrdsongs worshiped before moving to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong's wife, Sherialyn, daughters Sabrina, 12, and Kelley,  
10 and son Ricky Jr., 8, also attended the funeral.

<HEADLINE> Chi. Cop Shooting Found Unjustified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Police Department's Office of Professional  
Standards says the shooting of a passenger in a car that had fled 
police was not justified and that the four officers involved should 
be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Terry Hillard will consider the  
recommendations over the weekend, a police spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short police chase, LaTanya Haggerty, 26, was shot and  
killed June 4 when an officer mistook her cellular phone for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	In Haggerty's case and that of another police shooting on June  
5, both the victims and the officers who fired were black. The 
cases have raised questions about how the race of suspects may be a 
factor in tense situations, even when the officers themselves are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were wrong to fire at the car and they disobeyed orders  
to break off the chase, according to the report given to Hillard on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillard will decide whether to forward the panel's findings to  
the police board, or he can recommend up to a 30-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope he (Hillard) doesn't succumb to public pressure and he  
does what's right,'' said Bill Nolan of the Fraternal Order of 
Police. ``If that is not the case we'll make our voices known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police group plans protests if Hillard suggests anything  
more than a suspension, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County State's Attorney Dick Devine has not decided whether  
to press criminal charges against the officers, said spokesman Bob 
Benjamin.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Making History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- It was not the biggest game in the lives  
of several American soccer players. Just the latest biggest one for 
the likes of Kristine Lilly, Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm and Julie 
Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the Women's World Cup grabbed headlines and the  
imagination of the country. Yes, as many as 90,000 fans were in the 
Rose Bowl for today's final against China. Certainly, what they had 
done over the last three weeks was a monumental achievement for 
themselves, their sport, their gender and their gender's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that foursome has been through a lot since joining the  
national team. And they just might go through a lot more, such as 
at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road and a memorable one,'' said Akers, at 33  
the oldest U.S. player. She joined the national squad in 1985 and 
is one of the best the sport has produced. ``This tournament has 
been wonderful for what it has done for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some great times before, though.''  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Akers was the mainstay of the 1991 team that won the  
first Women's World Cup. She led the tournament in scoring as a 
striker, but since has moved back to midfield, where she controls 
the pace and distributes the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Akers played in only two Cup games because of injury.  
She also struggled through the 1996 Olympics, physically exhausted 
at the end, but still playing a key role in capturing the gold 
medal. She then was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	So Akers has had lots of battles in her career.  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, who entered today's game with a tender left hamstring,  
came aboard in 1987. She is the career goals leader, men or women, 
in international play. Through two World Cups, an Olympics and 
Goodwill Games, she has been the focal point of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that experience made it easier for Hamm to handle the  
hype and pressure associated with the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think if we win or lose will have that much of an  
impact, because this tournament has been a tremendous success 
already,'' Hamm said Friday. ``And this team has been able to bring 
about a lot of excitement and recognition for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think people also realized how well the other teams play  
and how entertaining our game is. The World Cup has achieved what 
all of us wanted it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foudy, a co-captain and one of the most spirited of players,  
first played for the national team in 1988. She has been at the 
core of just about every major achievement the Americans have 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been everything we dreamed or imagined it would be,''  
she said of the tournament. ``But it isn't the first time we've 
played under pressure and gone after a huge prize. We've had our 
share of big games, and we've done pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, like Foudy and Akers, is a midfielder who also began  
playing for the U.S. team in '87. She's been a forward, too, and a 
true sparkplug. 
</P>
<P>
	As she surveyed the scene over the past three weeks, Lilly  
couldn't help but think back to the early days. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize what you had to do to be on this national  
team back then,'' Lilly said. ``We had to train by ourselves 
because there wasn't a team to play with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing that set apart the national team players  
from the ones who didn't make it was the great commitment they had 
on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A commitment that shows no signs of disappearing.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Denies Report He Confessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal says a  
magazine article that reports he expressed regret for killing a 
police officer is a ``rumor-turned-lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, who has maintained his innocence, released a  
statement from prison Friday night, saying Vanity Fair was wrong 
and that he had never been contacted about the allegation by former 
prison volunteer Philip Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lie is a lie,'' Abu-Jamal said. ``I find it remarkable that  
this rumor-turned lie was never brought to my attention by the 
author, by Mr. Bloch himself or by Vanity Fair magazine, which 
never contacted me. Welcome to snuff journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The article's author, Buzz Bissinger, wrote that attempts to  
contact Abu-Jamal and his lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther was found guilty of killing  
officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. Police arriving at the scene found 
the dying officer and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own gun, 
and several witnesses identified him as the shooter. An officer and 
hospital worker testified during the trial that Abu-Jamal confessed 
to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch, who befriended Abu-Jamal through his work with the prison  
reform organization Pennsylvania Prison Society, told the magazine 
in its August issue that they often discussed subjects from prison 
life to philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Bloch said, while discussing whether violence was  
acceptable in the name of one's beliefs, he asked Abu-Jamal whether 
he regretted killing Faulkner and received a one-word reply: 
``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a long pause,'' Bloch told Vanity Fair. ``I think we  
probably realized what he had just done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch said he came forward because of his ``disgust'' with the  
tactics of those who believe Abu-Jamal was wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal contends he is innocent and blames his conviction on a  
biased judge and an ineffective lawyer. His writings and efforts to 
win a new trial have attracted worldwide attention.

	U.S. Defeats China To Win World Cup  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The U.S. team defeated China 5-4  
Saturday on penalty kicks to capture the Women's World Cup soccer 
title. When Chastain's left-footed kick landed high in the net, the 
Rose Bowl erupted in cheers. U.S. goalie Briana Scurry had stopped 
Liu Ying's shot with the penalty score at 2-2. The game remained 
0-0 after regulation and two 15-minute overtime. President Clinton 
was one of the 90,185 spectators at the biggest women's sporting 
event in American history. ``It was the most exciting sports event 
I have ever seen,'' Clinton told the victorious U.S. athletes.

	Britain Probes Kosovo Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Defense Ministry said Sunday it is  
investigating the British paratroopers in Kosovo who opened fire 
this month on a Kosovo Liberation Army car, killing two rebels. A 
Defense spokesman said the soldiers have not been charged with any 
crime and are still on active duty. Official reports on the 
incident said the soldiers opened fire on the vehicle because they 
feared their lives were at risk from a man firing celebratory shots 
into the air from the roof of the car. But witnesses have said the 
paratroopers did not do enough to warn the people in the car and 
that no attempt was made to stop the vehicle.

	6 Nations Sign Congo Truce  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Six nations fighting in Congo's civil war  
signed a long-awaited peace accord Saturday, but squabbling rebels 
balked, dashing hopes for a speedy end to the continent's biggest 
conflict. Congo's government and the five neighboring countries 
that have been drawn into the fight said a cease-fire will begin 
within 24 hours. Because the three squabbling rebel groups refused 
to sign, there was nothing to prevent them from continuing their 
fight, said Olivier Kamitatu, a leader of the Congo Liberation

	Bill Bradley Highlights Race Issues  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
told thousands of NAACP delegates Saturday night that matters of 
racial justice would get top priority in his administration. 
``Quite frankly, race is the reason I'm in politics,'' Bradley said 
in brief comments to a gathering of 3,500 at a gospel show to start 
the NAACP's 90th annual convention. Bradley, a former New Jersey 
senator, explained that watching the discussion and successful vote 
on the 1964 civil rights bill helped push him towards a life of 
political service.

	House GOP Wants 10 Pct. Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans Saturday proposed an $864  
billion plan to cut income taxes by 10 percent during the next 
decade. The GOP proposal was directly at odds with White House 
efforts to focus budget surpluses on Social Security, Medicare and 
some new spending. ``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays 
in Washington, the politicians will surely spend it,'' said House 
Ways and Means chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, the architect of the 
Republican plan.

	U.S. To Discuss China Bomb Payments  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is sending  
officials to Beijing to discuss payments for 20 people injured and 
families of three killed in the mistaken U.S. bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The State Department said 
Saturday that Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering ``conveyed 
our willingness to provide a humanitarian payment'' when he visited 
Beijing last month to apologize for the ``awful tragedy'' of the 
May 7 bombing. Department legal adviser David Andrews will head the 
delegation going to the Chinese capital this coming week, the 
department said.

	NAACP Marks 90th Birthday

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP is recommitting itself to fight ills  
still gripping black America as the nation's largest and oldest 
civil rights organization celebrates its 90th birthday. As an 
expected 14,000 members trickled into New York for Saturday's start 
of the six-day conference, NAACP officials mourned Friday's death 
of James Farmer, founder of the Congress of Racial Equality and the 
last survivor of the ``Big Four'' who guided the civil rights 
battles of the 1950s and 1960s.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Defeats China To Win World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Playing through heat, exhaustion and  
tension, the two best women's soccer teams on the planet couldn't 
shake one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Something had to give. And after 120 minutes without a score,  
including a sudden-death overtime, something did. 
</P>
<P>
	Briana Scurry's fingertips, Kristine Lilly's head and Brandi  
Chastain's foot made all the difference against China in the World 
Cup final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us have hearts too large for our chests,'' said  
Chastain, who scored the winning penalty kick in the shootout then 
dropped to her knees and ripped off her white jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	She swung the shirt over her head as her jubilant U.S. teammates  
mobbed her and the record crowd of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl cheered 
wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' Chastain said. ``I just lost my mind. I  
thought, my god, this is the greatest moment of my life on the 
soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the greatest moment for a team that captured America  
with its style and grace, and now has conquered the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain's goal, which followed a save by Scurry in the  
shootout, gave the U.S. team the most prestigious trophy in soccer 
before the largest crowd ever to see a women's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to stop just one and my teammates would put all  
of them in,'' said Scurry, who stopped Liu Ying on the third 
attempt in the shootout. ``I went totally on instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festive gathering in 90-degree heat included President  
Clinton. The crowd roared when Scurry made the diving save to her 
left. Moments later, they roared even louder, their cheers 
reverberating off the San Gabriel Mountains, as Chastain won it. 
</P>
<P>
	None of it would have been possible if not for Lilly. She saved  
her team in the 100th minute during the sudden-death overtime, 
heading a shot off the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a goal if I'm not there,'' she said. ``After I did it, I  
wanted to get downfield and score and end the game quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No way. It would go on for 20 more minutes, and then into the  
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, who was cut from the national squad in 1994 and had to  
work her way back onto it, posed for Gear Magazine in June with 
nothing but a strategically placed soccer ball hiding her naked 
body. This time, she revealed a black sports bra as she and her 
teammates leapt on one another in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the courage of the American team,'' U.S. coach Tony  
DiCicco said. ``They just fought and fought and fought. There are 
two champions here today, and only one is taking a trophy home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we win, it means all of America wins. They so much  
epitomize what America is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the game finally over, the U.S. players jumped about with  
whatever energy they had left following two hours of exhausting 
soccer and the tension-filled shootout. After they received their 
championship medals, they jogged around the field carrying three 
huge American flags as the fans roared and chanted ``U-S-A, 
U-S-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cloudburst of confetti littered the field as Scurry ran to the  
stands to slap hands with fans. She then got down on both knees and 
saluted the crowd, which was chanting ``Scurry, Scurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams stood hand-in-hand for photos after sharing one of  
the most intense experiences in sports -- a shootout to decide a 
World Cup crown. Coincidentally, the men's World Cup final in 1994 
at the Rose Bowl ended in a shootout after a 0-0 tie, with Brazil 
beating Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	China shot first and Xie Huilin hit the left corner of the net.  
Co-captain Carla Overbeck matched the goal to a huge cheer from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qiu Haiyan barely got the ball past the outstretched hands of a  
diving Scurry, and Joy Fawcett made no mistake with her shot for 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu's shot was in the middle of the net and Scurry got her hands  
on it to send it wide. Lilly then almost nonchalantly put hers in. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Ouying beat Scurry, but Mia Hamm scored. That brought Sun  
Wen, the tournament's leading scorer, to the spot with the crowd in 
a frenzy. Sun put her shot to the left of Scurry for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Chastain.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dave Letterman told me to have her take one,'' DiCicco said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another star was Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest of the  
Americans. She left the game with an injury in the final moments of 
regulation. But when she played, she dominated the midfield, never 
allowing Sun to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
	China's brilliant midfielder, Yan Jin, finally got going when  
Akers left. She created several chances in the extra periods, when 
China had a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the two best teams in the tournament -- China outscored  
opponents 19-2 and the United States had an 18-3 margin -- these 
teams have created a scintillating rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat the Chinese 2-1 for the 1996 Olympics gold  
medal and 2-0 for the '98 Goodwill Games crown. China had won two 
of three this year, including the championship of the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big one went to the Americans, and the series now stands  
12-5-5 for the United States, which also won the first World Cup in 
China in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans arrived early and ready. By halftime of the third-place  
game, won by Brazil on penalty kicks, the stands were nearly 
filled. Just about everywhere youngsters with red-white-and-blue 
painted faces waved American flags. Chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A'' 
began even as Norway and Brazil were playing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American team marched onto the field, Akers jumped up  
and down like a schoolgirl as her teammates waved their arms above 
their heads and encouraged more cheering from a crowd already 
screaming its lungs out. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of sound, punctuated by a U.S. Navy F-18 fly-over at  
the conclusion of the national anthem, was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much to cheer about for most of the sloppy  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie was tested much, and the crowd's biggest reaction  
of regulation time was when the crowd booed as Clinton was shown on 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country was caught up in this, not only fans  
of soccer but young girls,'' Clinton said. ``In some ways, it's the 
biggest sporting even of the last decade. It's new and exciting for 
the United States. It will have a very far-reaching impact, not 
only for the United States, but for the world.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Scurry's one save and Chastain's deciding goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention Lilly's header off the goal line that kept the  
Americans alive in overtime.

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Enters Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- With his hoop earring and ever-salty  
tongue, John McEnroe took his place among the white pants and straw 
hats of tennis society on Saturday with his induction into the 
International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	As McEnroe himself once said, ``YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the most controversial player in modern tennis.  
He took whining to the next level,'' said Olympic champion speed 
skater Eric Heiden, who presented his college buddy for induction. 
``I think we ought to hold off on that induction until John 
apologizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it true that I have to apologize?'' McEnroe asked the  
crowded stadium at the Newport Casino. When the answer came back as 
a resounding ``No,'' he said, ``That's what I thought. To hell with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He then embarked on a rambling but amusing 45-minute speech --  
his co-inductee Ken McGregor took five -- in which he thanked 
everyone from his first coach to his last while insulting 
newspapers, erstwhile doubles partner Steffi Graf, Australia and 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, McEnroe was enshrined alongside his hero Rod Laver,  
his mentor Harry Hopman and fellow former bad boys Ilie Nastase and 
Jimmy Connors. Already, a McEnroe room has been established in the 
Hall's halls, complete with McEnalia from baby photos to trophies 
to pictures from his after-tennis life as artist, guitar player and 
father of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is known for his whining as much as his winning, it  
was the latter that earned McEnroe a place in the Hall. Winner of 
three Wimbledon singles titles and four in the U.S. Open, McEnroe 
won 77 championships in all and also played 12 years for the U.S. 
Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling himself ``the last guy to play great tennis with a wood  
racket,'' McEnroe said his career marked the end of an era. But it 
was also clear that he had more in common with today's brash young 
stars than with the men and women in long pants and white dresses 
that populate the pictures in the Hall's galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Making no apologies for the behavior that earned him a  
reputation as tennis' enfant terrible, McEnroe said that he knows 
that his legacy will be tainted by the tantrums that punctuated his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK. I deserve it,'' he admitted. ``... I think that my  
emotions were on my sleeve. I think that my drive and intensity 
were on display. I'll never get away from the label of the next 
Nastase, or Connors, or a combination of both, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I was as bad as them. But I was pretty close.''  
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe told about the first time he played Boris Becker and the  
then-unheralded 18-year-old was pouting the entire match -- 
``pulling a McEnroe, I guess you'd call it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Listen, guy. You've got to win something before you  
start pulling that. This is out of line,''' McEnroe recalled. 
``Three months later, he won Wimbledon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning, McEnroe said, was the key.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he said: if he was just a naughty boy, no one would  
have noticed him,'' said former New York Mayor David Dinkins, who 
was on hand for the ceremony. ``He'll be remembered for his record. 
You can't take that away from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his current job as television commentator, McEnroe is all  
talk and very little action. But he made a run at the Wimbledon 
mixed doubles title this year before Graf pulled out to concentrate 
on singles; she bore the brunt of McEnroe's anger for much of the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving half an hour late for his pre-enshrinement news  
conference, McEnroe proceeded to commit at least five potential 
code violations for foul language. Still, it was a slightly 
mellower McEnroe that praised the Hall facilities, was gracious to 
McGregor and even -- gasp! -- campaigned for the enshrinement of an 
umpire, though not the one he once called ``the pits of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get along with umpires,'' he said in uncharacteristic  
understatement. ``That was pretty clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much as he shook up the tennis world when he became the youngest  
man ever to be ranked No. 1 on the ATP computer, McEnroe hurled 
bombs at the establishment -- most of them in good fun. But he 
turned serious when he thanked those who shaped his career, saying 
that when Hopman moved to New York it was a turning point in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe in someone up above,'' McEnroe said. ``That  
person, for whatever reason, wanted me to play tennis.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Sen. Smith Leaving GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Critics of Sen. Bob Smith's expected  
decision to quit the Republican Party say he is killing two birds 
with one stone -- his presidential campaign and re-election to his 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire conservative is prepared to announce next week  
that he will leave the GOP and continue his campaign for the 
presidency as an independent or third-party candidate, a source 
close to the campaign said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith plans to bolt the party not because of his campaign, which  
has garnered little support, but because of his philosophical 
objection to the direction of the Republican mainstream, said the 
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has threatened to quit several times in recent weeks,  
contending that many Republicans have abandoned their conservative 
base by softening their positions against abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson said it was the  
other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would not be a case of the party leaving you, Bob, but  
rather of you leaving our party,'' he said in a letter to Smith. He 
called such a decision a ``serious mistake for you personally, with 
only a marginal political impact -- and a counterproductive one at 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duprey, the state Republican chairman, added: ``This is a  
selfish move and is doomed to failure. It signals the end of his 
political career in New Hampshire. Bob should not seek the 
nomination of our party in 2002 for the Senate if he is unwilling 
to stay in our party now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Smith was talking to GOP leaders, friends and  
supporters about leaving the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican state Rep. Tom Rice said he got a call from Smith's  
office telling him that the senator would make his announcement 
Tuesday. ``But whether he was forming a third party or going with 
an existing one, I don't know,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was vacationing and not taking calls from reporters, Karen  
Hickey, his campaign spokeswoman, said Friday. ``I can't confirm, I 
can't deny,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said he might form his own party, or run as a  
candidate for either the Reform Party or U.S. Taxpayer Party. He 
supports low taxes, a strong national defense and school prayer. He 
strongly opposes abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform Party national chairman Russell Verney said Smith is  
welcome to seek the party's nomination if he is ready to tell 
members where he stands on economic and government reform issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smith has strong social issues. Our party has no social  
issues,'' Verney said. ``We concentrate on economic issues and 
government reform. We tell our candidates they can state their 
social positions as individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, some of Smith's GOP presidential rivals also were  
quick to react. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer said, ``It would be a tragedy for the Republican  
Party to start splitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said, ``He's got strong convictions;  
maybe he's thinking that is what he's got to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest CNN-Gallup poll, Smith was supported by 1 percent  
of Republicans, well behind virtually every other candidate in a 
field dominated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-term senator, Smith has said he would not resign his  
Senate seat even if he runs for the presidency as a member of a 
third party and loses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. Smith has long been a leader in the fight for lower  
taxes, a stronger defense and smaller government,'' said John 
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``I 
trust if the reports are true that this issue will be discussed by 
the Senate Republican Conference with Sen. Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be up to the GOP conference to decide whether to  
protect Smith's seniority rights on committees. 
</P>
<P>
	His chairmanship of the Ethics Committee could be at risk, and  
he is in line to become chairman of the Environment Committee in 
the next Congress if Republicans hold their majority.

<P>
	``I can't really look back. I have to really try to look forward  
at this point,'' the suspended New York Yankees outfielder said 
Friday, though he declined to speculate when he might resume his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real focus is myself and my recovery right now. Baseball  
is No. 2. Baseball is just a part of my life. I enjoy playing 
baseball, but living life and staying clean and sober is the most 
important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry spoke as he worked out at a team facility for the  
first time since his arrest on drug and solicitation charges three 
months ago. He said alcohol and pressure he put on himself to make 
a speedy return from colon cancer surgery led to his brush with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-time All-Star also said he lied about the status of  
his chemotherapy last spring because he didn't want to hurt his 
chances of making the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm done with chemotherapy now. I had mentioned I was done  
with it earlier, but I wasn't. I was covering it up to try to get 
back as soon as possible playing baseball,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body went through some changes, some changes I've never  
experienced before in my life. It was very hard for me. I think I 
was really too hard on myself, pressing myself to do too much, 
instead of allowing myself to wait until my body started feeling 
better. I take a lot of that responsibility on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he fell into a deep depression when the Yankees broke  
spring training and left him behind in Tampa to continue 
rehabilitation at the minor league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry blamed his relapse with alcohol on himself, saying he  
``slacked off'' on attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He 
spent four weeks in a rehab clinic for substance abuse in 1994 and 
was suspended for 60 days the following year after testing positive 
for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a tendency to come down on athletes, but we have  
people in very high positions that go through the same struggles I 
do with my alcoholism,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clean and sober today, and that's the most important  
thing. I want to stay that way. I'm back on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was arrested April 14 in Tampa and charged with  
possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and offering an undercover 
female police officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest six weeks later and was placed on 18  
months' probation. He also was ordered to stay out of bars and be 
tested for drugs twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry ran, took fly balls in the outfield and 15 minutes of  
batting practice Friday. He finished the closed workout in the 
weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder was placed on administrative leave  
following his arrest. Commissioner Bud Selig said he could rejoin 
the Yankees on Aug. 11, and possibly this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was asked about those who think he doesn't deserve  
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things that have happened to me are things that I bring on  
myself. It's not anyone else,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm not going to 
criticize what others have to say. I just hope they wish me well.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Activists March, Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITECLAY, Neb. (AP) -- American Indian activists on Saturday  
marched into town and asked four bars and a grocery to vacate this 
tiny border town, the third protest over alcohol sales and other 
issues in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people marched from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  
in South Dakota to Whiteclay. Others followed in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The marchers drummed and sang during the two-mile walk from Pine  
Ridge, then posted signs ordering the five businesses to leave 
within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters object to alcohol sales at the four beer stores  
that total millions of dollars each year. The grocery does not sell 
alcohol, but Indian leaders have accused its owner of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol is banned on the reservation. One of Whiteclay's four  
beer-selling establishments lies within approximately 80 feet of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
	After posting the notices during a walk through Whiteclay, the  
marchers, beating drums and shouting encouragement, stopped in the 
middle of the town in front of the grocery, which was looted and 
burned during a similar rally last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people plastered a large red banner across the front of the  
store that read ``American Indian Movement Grand Council.'' The 
grocery remains closed after the melee June 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Poor Bear, organizer of the three marches, said he hopes the  
tribal government will try to follow through with the eviction 
notices, even though the tribe has no legal jurisdiction in 
Whiteclay.

<HEADLINE> O's Exercise Ripken's 2000 Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It used to be an absurd question: Is Cal  
Ripken going to play? 
</P>
<P>
	He will next year, his 18th season with the Baltimore Orioles.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's $6.3 million option for the 2000 season was exercised  
by the Orioles on Friday, giving baseball's iron man at least one 
more year in his brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who turns 39 next month, was 2-for-4 in his first career  
appearance against Curt Schilling on Friday night in a 4-2 loss to 
the Phillies. He's batting .314 with 12 homers and 36 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken will make his 17th consecutive All-Star appearance and  
16th straight start for the American League on Tuesday at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the start of the season, I had a number of things hanging  
over my head, and the contract situation was one of them,'' said 
Ripken, who didn't want to talk about his contract until something 
more important was taken care of -- batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an uncomfortable situation,'' he said. ``But after I  
sort of got myself physically back and got my focus back mentally, 
the contract thing sort of took care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who played in a record 2,632 consecutive games before  
asking out of the lineup last Sept. 20, is 53 hits shy of 3,000 and 
four homers away from 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are big numbers,'' Ripken said. ``Three thousand hits,  
that's a number that we, as baseball fans, have come to understand 
as a magical number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was batting .179 when he went on the disabled list for  
the first time in his career with lower back pain on April 20. 
Though some critics thought it was time for Ripken to retire, he is 
batting .335 since coming off the DL and has hit in 28 of his last 
36 games with a .349 average. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the first six-hit game of his career on June 3, going  
6-for-6 against Atlanta. Ripken admitted Friday that his stint on 
the DL and his poor start scared him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never been on the DL,'' Ripken said. ``I didn't know how  
I was going to react, how I was going to feel. ... The season 
started with a major injury. There was a lot of uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken signed a two-year extension on April 3, 1997. The Orioles  
had until the All-Star break to exercise the option for 2000 or pay 
a $2.5 million buyout. Ripken had wanted three years guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Orioles decided not to pick up the option -- a  
possibility that only would have presented itself if Ripken's 
performance continued to slide -- Ripken wasn't sure how he would've 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a long and very fulfilling career to this point,''  
Ripken said. ``I probably would have done the very best I could the 
second half and when the season was over, re-evaluated my 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren, who made the announcement,  
didn't make it clear why it wasn't done in Baltimore on Thursday on 
the team's day off. Then again, Veterans Stadium is the sight of 
one of Ripken's many milestones. He won his only World Series 
championship at the stadium in 1983, when Baltimore beat the 
Phillies and Ripken caught the last out -- a line drive by Garry 
Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one great memory here, the ending of the World Series  
in '83,'' Ripken said. ``There was a great celebration in that 
clubhouse, and a great feeling of satisfaction. I was fortunate 
enough to get there and play on a championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos issued a statement about Ripken's  
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very proud to have an individual of Cal Ripken's  
stature with us throughout his illustrious career,'' Angelos said. 
``His accomplishments are unparalleled and he will always be 
thought of as one of the greatest Orioles of all time.''

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Defeats China To Win World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Playing through heat, exhaustion and  
tension, the two best women's soccer teams on the planet couldn't 
shake one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Something had to give. And after 120 minutes without a score,  
including a sudden-death overtime, something did. 
</P>
<P>
	Briana Scurry's fingertips, Kristine Lilly's head and Brandi  
Chastain's foot made all the difference against China in the World 
Cup final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us have hearts too large for our chests,'' said  
Chastain, who scored the winning penalty kick in the shootout then 
dropped to her knees and ripped off her white jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	She swung the shirt over her head as her jubilant U.S. teammates  
mobbed her and the record crowd of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl cheered 
wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' Chastain said. ``I just lost my mind. I  
thought, my god, this is the greatest moment of my life on the 
soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the greatest moment for a team that captured America  
with its style and grace, and now has conquered the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain's goal, which followed a save by Scurry in the  
shootout, gave the U.S. team the most prestigious trophy in soccer 
before the largest crowd ever to see a women's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to stop just one and my teammates would put all  
of them in,'' said Scurry, who stopped Liu Ying on the third 
attempt in the shootout. ``I went totally on instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festive gathering in 90-degree heat included President  
Clinton. The crowd roared when Scurry made the diving save to her 
left. Moments later, they roared even louder, their cheers 
reverberating off the San Gabriel Mountains, as Chastain won it. 
</P>
<P>
	None of it would have been possible if not for Lilly. She saved  
her team in the 100th minute during the sudden-death overtime, 
heading a shot off the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a goal if I'm not there,'' she said. ``After I did it, I  
wanted to get downfield and score and end the game quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No way. It would go on for 20 more minutes, and then into the  
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, who was cut from the national squad in 1994 and had to  
work her way back onto it, posed for Gear Magazine in June with 
nothing but a strategically placed soccer ball hiding her naked 
body. This time, she revealed a black sports bra as she and her 
teammates leapt on one another in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the courage of the American team,'' U.S. coach Tony  
DiCicco said. ``They just fought and fought and fought. There are 
two champions here today, and only one is taking a trophy home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we win, it means all of America wins. They so much  
epitomize what America is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the game finally over, the U.S. players jumped about with  
whatever energy they had left following two hours of exhausting 
soccer and the tension-filled shootout. After they received their 
championship medals, they jogged around the field carrying three 
huge American flags as the fans roared and chanted ``U-S-A, 
U-S-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cloudburst of confetti littered the field as Scurry ran to the  
stands to slap hands with fans. She then got down on both knees and 
saluted the crowd, which was chanting ``Scurry, Scurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams stood hand-in-hand for photos after sharing one of  
the most intense experiences in sports -- a shootout to decide a 
World Cup crown. Coincidentally, the men's World Cup final in 1994 
at the Rose Bowl ended in a shootout after a 0-0 tie, with Brazil 
beating Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	China shot first and Xie Huilin hit the left corner of the net.  
Co-captain Carla Overbeck matched the goal to a huge cheer from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qiu Haiyan barely got the ball past the outstretched hands of a  
diving Scurry, and Joy Fawcett made no mistake with her shot for 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu's shot was in the middle of the net and Scurry got her hands  
on it to send it wide. Lilly then almost nonchalantly put hers in. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Ouying beat Scurry, but Mia Hamm scored. That brought Sun  
Wen, the tournament's leading scorer, to the spot with the crowd in 
a frenzy. Sun put her shot to the left of Scurry for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Chastain.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dave Letterman told me to have her take one,'' DiCicco said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another star was Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest of the  
Americans. She left the game with an injury in the final moments of 
regulation. But when she played, she dominated the midfield, never 
allowing Sun to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
	China's brilliant midfielder, Yan Jin, finally got going when  
Akers left. She created several chances in the extra periods, when 
China had a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the two best teams in the tournament -- China outscored  
opponents 19-2 and the United States had an 18-3 margin -- these 
teams have created a scintillating rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat the Chinese 2-1 for the 1996 Olympics gold  
medal and 2-0 for the '98 Goodwill Games crown. China had won two 
of three this year, including the championship of the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big one went to the Americans, and the series now stands  
12-5-5 for the United States, which also won the first World Cup in 
China in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans arrived early and ready. By halftime of the third-place  
game, won by Brazil on penalty kicks, the stands were nearly 
filled. Just about everywhere youngsters with red-white-and-blue 
painted faces waved American flags. Chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A'' 
began even as Norway and Brazil were playing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American team marched onto the field, Akers jumped up  
and down like a schoolgirl as her teammates waved their arms above 
their heads and encouraged more cheering from a crowd already 
screaming its lungs out. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of sound, punctuated by a U.S. Navy F-18 fly-over at  
the conclusion of the national anthem, was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much to cheer about for most of the sloppy  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie was tested much, and the crowd's biggest reaction  
of regulation time was when the crowd booed as Clinton was shown on 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country was caught up in this, not only fans  
of soccer but young girls,'' Clinton said. ``In some ways, it's the 
biggest sporting even of the last decade. It's new and exciting for 
the United States. It will have a very far-reaching impact, not 
only for the United States, but for the world.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Scurry's one save and Chastain's deciding goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention Lilly's header off the goal line that kept the  
Americans alive in overtime.

<HEADLINE> Graf To Enter U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steffi Graf, finished with the French Open and  
Wimbledon, could be playing her final Grand Slam event at the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, a five-time winner of the Open, was included in a list of  
entries submitted by the WTA Tour to the United States Tennis 
Association, which will run the Open from Aug. 30 through Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi has been one of the favorites at the U.S. Open  
throughout her career,'' tournament director Jay Snyder said. ``We 
are excited that she has decided to return for at least one more 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Martina Hingis for the French Open championship,  
Graf announced she would no longer compete in the clay-court 
tournament. When she lost to American Lindsay Davenport in the 
finals at Wimbledon, Graf said it was her last match in the 
grass-court event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of fun, but I guess, yes, there's going to be  
a certain time when I've got to move on with something else in my 
life,'' she said after Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, has won 22 Grand Slam titles, second only to Margaret  
Court Smith's 24. She is ranked No. 3 in the world and was ranked 
No. 1 for a record total of 377 weeks. In 1988, she swept all four 
Slams -- the Australian, the French, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open -- 
as well as winning the Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has been the No. 1 seed at the U.S. Open a record nine  
times.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Financier Had 6 Identities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He's a man of many names.  
</P>
<P>
	On his birth certificate, he is Martin Richard Frankel. This  
identifies the guy accused of pulling off one of the largest frauds 
in modern finance, an operator who built a phantom empire by 
bilking small insurance companies out of at least $215 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This fellow disappeared in May. This fellow's name did not. It  
has appeared in lots of places: police blotters, court papers, IRS 
affidavits, FBI most-wanted list and more than a few newspaper 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it appears at the bottom of a photograph of a man in a  
button-down white shirt, with pasty cheeks, a half grin, greasy 
hair parted on the side and slung over a high forehead, squinting 
eyes barely visible behind the glare of thick, Woody Allen-ish 
spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
	It also appears, in bold lettering, on an arrest warrant, issued  
by the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, dated May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED,'' it reads, ``to arrest Martin  
Frankel, aka Michael King, aka David Rosse (or ``Ross''), aka Eric 
Stevens, aka Steve Rothschild.'' The document failed to mention at 
least two other Frankel aliases: Robert Guyer and Fausto Fausti. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Martin Frankel's many names, and how he used them,  
comes from police reports, regulatory documents, investigators, 
former investors and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Bitter, a tool-and-die maker who hired Frankel as his broker  
14 years ago in Toledo, Ohio, is only surprised that Frankel didn't 
use more aliases. ``He's a pathological liar,'' Bitter says. 
``Marty's the kind who likes his own lies so much, he starts 
believing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also liked to borrow things. Sometimes he borrowed other  
people's money. Sometimes he borrowed their names. Sometimes he 
asked nicely. Sometimes he didn't bother to ask. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wily, with an imagination fertile enough to dream up a  
phantom insurance and philanthropic empire that, investigators say, 
duped investors from California to the Caribbean, from New York 
City to Vatican City. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he wasn't that imaginative with aliases. Most, if not all,  
of the names Frankel used belong to people he had met or learned of 
through acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the late 1980s, his penchant for deception evolved  
into a pattern and, finally, into an obsession -- an obsession that 
created, at last count, six Martin Frankels. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *STEVE 'MARTY' ROTHSCHILD   	
</P>
<P>
	No one ever actually saw this Steve Marty Rothschild.  
</P>
<P>
	He first appeared around 1987 as a name in Martin Frankel's  
notebook. Later, he showed up in business correspondence written by 
Frankel. Finally, he gained his own mailing address: 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Marty Rothschild  
</P>
<P>
	3415 Stanhope Drive  
</P>
<P>
	Toledo, Ohio 43606  
</P>
<P>
	No one, in fact, knew that Steve Marty Rothschild existed until  
a private investigator found an envelope in Frankel's trash. The PI 
had been hired by Frankel's former boss whose wife took up with 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Stephen Rothschild, a Toledo lawyer, had no clue,  
either. In 1989, he was hired by a friend, Ted Bitter, to recoup 
$65,000 Bitter had entrusted to Frankel -- a stock investment that 
had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the course of our investigation,'' says Rothschild,  
``we came across some documents that had the name Rothschild on 
them. We laughed. It was typical of what we'd already learned about 
Frankel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild and Frankel aren't exactly twins. Frankel stands 6  
feet tall, weighed 135 pounds, ``the kid who didn't fit in at 
school,'' his friends said. Rothschild is 5 feet 6 inches tall, 200 
pounds, outgoing, assertive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Frankel ever tried to take over the identities  
of the people whose names he used,'' says Rothschild. ``Now THAT 
would have been creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *ERIC STEVENS   	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens came into being sometime around 1989, after Frankel  
began romancing his ex-boss's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	This personage was more than just a name on a business envelope:  
He came across as an experienced bond trader eager to employ a 
novel and lucrative strategy to improve the returns on insurance 
company assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens didn't dress like a slick broker. He wore faded  
jeans, thick glasses, T-shirts. His hair was unruly. A Bill Gates 
run amok. 
</P>
<P>
	Working out of the home of Martin Frankel's parents, Stevens set  
up a bogus trust fund, Thunor Trust, and teamed up in 1991 with 
John A. Hackney, a Tennessee bank executive, to persuade small 
Southern insurance companies to wire him money to invest through a 
company he called Liberty National Securities, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the two wouldn't meet for another eight years, Stevens'  
soft, nonstop telephone patter about ``protecting people's sacred 
assets'' won over Hackney and at least seven insurance firms in 
five Bible Belt states. 
</P>
<P>
	They transferred at least $215 million (insurance regulators say  
it could have been as much as $350 million) to an impressive 
sounding address: 82 Wall Street, Dept. 1105, New York, N.Y. 10005. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing more than Eric Stevens' mail drop.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *ROBERT GUYER   	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Stevens was given a number of brief respites from life  
between 1991 and 1998. During those breaks, Martin Frankel became 
Robert Guyer, president of Liberty National Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the insurance companies that were wiring huge sums of  
money to Liberty National bothered to check the Robert Guyer name 
at the bottom of the company's correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the Robert Guyer signature on a September 1998 contract to  
handle the insurance companies' portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, in May 1999, a fax arrived at the Michigan office of  
the real Robert Guyer, the real president of the legitimate Liberty 
National Securities. Guyer had met Martin Frankel in the 1980s when 
they had worked at the same brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax, from several of the Southern insurance firms, posed an  
eye-popping question: Where was the $950 million they had on 
account at his firm? 
</P>
<P>
	John Czarnecki, Guyer's lawyer, says his client had no knowledge  
Frankel was doing any of these things. ``He didn't know what they 
were talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *MICHAEL KING   	
</P>
<P>
	Michael ``Mike'' King was born to the life of royalty.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he appeared like a tornado in the wealthy New York  
suburb of Greenwich, Conn., paying cash for two pieces of prime 
property: a $3 million mansion at 889 Lake Ave. and an adjacent 
$2.6 million house. 
</P>
<P>
	The driveway soon bristled with leased limos, BMWs and Mercedes.  
Live-in chefs worked around the clock to accommodate his nocturnal, 
gourmet tastes. Young women from places like Switzerland, Russia, 
Alaska and Asia traipsed in and out of the Lake Avenue homes at all 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	King met his ladies by trolling through Internet personals,  
calling dating services and placing personals ads in the Village 
Voice. He frequented The Vault, a Manhattan club that caters to 
sadomasochists. He collected a riding crop, ropes and 
sadomasochistic literature and pornographic videos. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned his estate into a fortress, with armed bodyguards, a  
6-foot fence, surveillance cameras and floodlights. Inside, he 
built a financial whiz kid's Xanadu, complete with 80 trading 
terminals linked to the New York Stock Exchange, satellite dishes, 
four computer servers and 25 monitors with sexually explicit 
messages on screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Among King's neighbors the rumors swirled: His guards were  
carrying satchels of money and grenades. He's going to buy more 
homes on Lake Avenue and connect them with covered walkways. He's 
going to replace his windows with bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                         *DAVID STEVEN ROSSE   	
</P>
<P>
	David Steven Rosse was not the partying type. He was quite  
serious about finance. And he was not, like Martin Frankel, a Jew. 
In fact, he aggressively courted the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	He dazzled church officials by receiving them at his estate, by  
paying for tickets on the Concorde, by offering them rides on his 
private jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosse stacked the shelves of his Lake Avenue library with  
Catholic literature. He poured over the life of St. Francis of 
Assisi, renowned for aiding the poor. He told people he watched 
movies about St. Francis all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to donate $50 million to Catholic charities. When  
Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, who serves on a board that provides 
legal counsel to Pope John Paul II, flew to New York to meet Rosse, 
the American millionaire claimed he wanted to set up a charitable 
foundation inside the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	After consulting with Monsignor Giovanni Battista Re, the  
Vatican's third-highest official, Colagiovanni agreed to help Rosse 
set up a charitable foundation outside the Vatican, according to 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Rosse did so -- in the British Virgin Islands, a  
corporate tax haven. The charity's name? The St. Francis of Assisi 
Foundation. Among its list of trustees? Walter Cronkite and Lee 
Iacocca, whose names were used without permission. Its legal 
counsel? Washington power broker Robert S. Strauss, former U.S. 
ambassador to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Strauss acknowledges participating in ``certain  
transactional matters'' for the phantom foundation, according a 
statement by Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm handling the 
charity's investment. It no longer does so, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Colagiovanni says he had pledged to donate $50,000 from his own  
foundation to help Rosse. Did he ever send the money? The monsignor 
isn't telling. 
</P>
<P>
	Footnote: Martin Frankel borrowed the name David Steven Rosse  
from one of his $10,000-a-month bodyguards. The real David Rosse is 
suing Frankel for ``emotional distress'' and using his name without 
consent. Rosse could not be reached, and his lawyer did not return 
messages left on his answering machine seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *FAUSTO FAUSTI   	
</P>
<P>
	Fausto Fausti has a bank account in Switzerland. It's not clear  
what his nationality is, what color hair he has, what he does for a 
living, where he goes on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the IRS knows: Fausti is one rich son-of-a-gun.  
</P>
<P>
	In April, a month before firefighters found piles of documents  
burning in two fireplaces in the ransacked and empty mansion at 889 
Lake Avenue, the amount of $3 million was transferred to Fausti's 
Swiss bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	The sender? Martin Frankel, via the People's Bank in Bridgeport,  
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Frankel's propensity for using other people's names most  
certainly damaged quite a few insurance companies, embarrassed the 
Vatican and left U.S. financial regulators scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	It may also have created some inconvenience for the one  
individual whose name Frankel (the one now on the lam) couldn't 
possibly have used for an alias: a Greenwich neighbor of Frankel's 
who has the misfortune of also being named Martin R. Frankel. 
</P>
<P>

	U.S. Women Get World Cup Champs  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- On a decisive final shot by Brandi  
Chastain, the U.S. team today beat China 5-4 on penalty kicks to 
win the Women's World Cup soccer tournament. The game was 0-0 after 
regulation and two 15-minute overtime sessions. The Rose Bowl 
erupted in cheers when Chastain's left-footed kick sailed high into 
the net. To chants of ``U-S-A!, U-S-A!'' the tired American players 
leaped about with whatever energy they had left. President Clinton 
was among the 90,185 spectators at the biggest women's sporting 
event in American history. Before the World Cup final, Brazil today 
took third place, beating Norway 5-4 on penalty kicks.

	Clinton Seeks Preventive Medicare

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton today said America's  
elderly who rely on Medicare must have affordable preventive care. 
Making his weekly radio address, Clinton said: ``No senior should 
have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need.'' He wants 
to eliminate Medicare co-payments and deductibles for preventive 
medical care such as hepatitis B vaccinations, colo-rectal and 
prostate cancer screening and diabetes management.

	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Squabbling rebels refused to sign a Congo  
peace accord today, dashing hopes for a speedy end to the 
continent's biggest current conflict. But six warring countries 
signed the deal and agreed to carry out a cease-fire within 24 
hours. Even so, Olivier Kamitatu, a leader of the Congo Liberation 
Movement, said there's nothing to prevent the three squabbling 
rebel groups from continuing to fight. ``It is not binding so long 
as we have not signed,'' he said of the peace accord.

It was their first deployment as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping 
force in the Serbian province. Included were 86 soldiers and three 
armored personnel carriers, Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
The unit left the Pristina airport and went to Kosovska Kamenica in 
southeastern Kosovo. Their plan was to set up an advance base for a 
larger force.

	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A day after a violent police  
raid on a Tehran University dormitory, thousands of demonstrators 
protested Saturday outside the school, demanding the resignation of 
hard-liners in the Islamic government. ``Death to despotism! Death 
to dictators!'' protesters chanted in Tehran, according to 
witnesses. By late Saturday, 25,000 people had gathered -- including 
students and ordinary Iranians.

	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Under the protection of a federal  
court order, members of the Aryan Nations today paraded through 
downtown streets. But they were outshouted by protesters who forced 
the marchers to detour. Four protesters were arrested. After the 
20-minute parade, some of the two dozen Aryans saluted supporters 
in the crowd with the Nazi straight-arm gesture. City officials had 
urged people to ignore the march, but thousands of opponents 
gathered along the parade route, chanting ``No Nazis! No KKK! No 
fascists! USA!''

satellite-positioning systems flew over Ohio and Kentucky while 
monitors tracked the exact location of each aircraft. The ``ADS-B'' 
system, more accurate than radar and with a longer range than

York Mets a 9-8 victory over the New York Yankees. The Mets came 
back from deficits three times and overcame six Yankee home runs. 
The Yankees had won 124 consecutive games when they led entering 
the ninth, but Mariano Rivera (2-2) blew a save chance for the 
third time in 25 chances.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazi Parade Blocked in Idaho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Human rights demonstrators blocked  
an Aryan Nations parade route through downtown city streets today, 
forcing the white supremacists to make a one-block detour. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after a federal judge ruled the city couldn't move the  
marchers out of the downtown area, two dozen Aryan Nations marchers 
were outnumbered by thousands of opponents chanting ``No Nazis! No 
KKK! No fascists! USA!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three blocks into the parade, about 20 of the anti-Aryan Nations  
demonstrators sat down on Sherman Avenue and halted the march. 
Police immediately routed the Aryans down a side street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's that white power, guys?'' shouted protester Brad  
Nelson of Coeur d'Alene. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade lasted about 20 minutes, including the detour.  
</P>
<P>
	City officials had urged residents and visitors to shun the  
march. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge derailed efforts  
by the city to move the Aryans from downtown to a route across a 
former dump site on the city's outskirts, ruling it an 
unconstitutional free-speech restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade held last summer during the Aryans' annual conference  
attracted about 90 group members and supporters, and about two 
dozen of an estimated 1,400 protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The summer tourist season swells Coeur d'Alene from a town of  
25,000 to about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a black eye on our community,'' said Malcolm  
Johnstone, a downtown businessman. ``We have to send them a message 
that this is not anything that supports community values 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, about 80 white supremacists and 200 opponents  
shouted and scuffled with each other at a city park before an Aryan 
Nations rally.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Summit Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation that would expand  
federal civil rights law to cover gay people believe Congress may 
be more receptive to the idea now, a year after a similar bill 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of tragic incidents, including a white supremacist's  
weekend shooting spree, has increased the pressure on the federal 
government to act, they said. Representatives from dozens of civil 
rights groups plan to meet at the White House on Monday to plan 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the prospects for the bills now are better now. These  
regrettable incidents demonstrate why they are necessary,'' said 
Richard Socarides, President Clinton's civil rights adviser. ``With 
each publicized incident more and more pressure is put on the 
opposition and those who say that this is not a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government can't continue to sit on the  
sidelines,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is sponsoring a 
bill with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``With each new tragedy, it 
becomes more and more difficult for Congress to claim there's no 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed and nine others injured in Illinois and  
Indiana during the Fourth of July weekend, apparently by a white 
supremacist who committed suicide Sunday after a police chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Socarides said planning for the meeting began before the  
shootings, and the push for the law was inspired by a string of 
incidents, including the dragging death of a black man in Texas and 
the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual Wyoming college 
student who was lashed to a fence in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills introduced in the House and Senate would give the federal  
government a stronger hand by adding acts of hatred motivated by 
sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate 
crimes already covered by federal law -- acts sparked by prejudice 
based on race, religion, color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would allow states and local governments to ask the  
federal government to help in investigating and prosecuting those 
crimes. Federal officials also would be able to intervene if they 
believe that a state or local government is not pursuing a hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills also would expand the definition of hate crimes. Under  
current law, the federal government may step in only if the crime 
in question occurred on federal property or during a federally 
protected activity, such as while a victim was voting or going to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation now moving through Congress would loosen that  
definition to include any incident with a connection to interstate 
commerce -- use of a gun manufactured in another state, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the bill is unnecessary because states have not  
avoided prosecuting such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say the bill itself would discriminate by creating  
special classes of victims such as gays, would greatly expand the 
federal government's power and jurisdiction and would have a 
``chilling effect'' on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need more laws. What we need is stricter enforcement  
of the laws we have,'' said Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for the 
conservative Family Research Council. ``Those who believe we need 
to federalize legislation on hate crimes are in fact lobbying for 
super prosecution for certain kinds of crimes as opposed to 
succinct application of the law in all crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights  
political group, said the bill simply provides more resources to 
fight violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with thought police and first amendment  
rights,'' David Smith said. ``It has everything to do with 
protecting people from these violent crimes.''

<HEADLINE> Gehrig Uniform Sells for $451,541 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The uniform Lou Gehrig was said to have worn  
when he made his famous farewell speech in 1939 was sold for 
$451,541 at auction on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount was believed to be the most ever paid for a baseball  
uniform, according to Leland's spokesman Marty Appel. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most ever paid for any type of Yankees' equipment,  
said Appel, a former public relations director for the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Appel said the flannel pinstripe uniform worn by the Hall of  
Fame first baseman was purchased by a south Florida man who did not 
want his name made public. The winning bid was made over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig, dying from a rare neurological disorder, amyotrophic  
lateral sclerosis, said goodbye to New York fans in a moving speech 
at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig told the packed stadium, ``I consider myself the luckiest  
man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known if the uniform was the same one that fetched  
$306,130 from five businessmen at auction in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Gehrig uniform highlighted the final day of the  
two-day Leland auction. On the first day, Carlton Fisk's home run 
ball that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series for the Boston Red 
Sox sold for $113,273.

<HEADLINE> McCain Focusing on New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Braving dark clouds, a crowd of more than  
100 quizzed Republican presidential hopeful John McCain on issues 
ranging from gun control to services for veterans, the Panama Canal 
and the line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens approached McCain afterward Friday to shake his hand,  
snap photos or wish him luck. Several who had met McCain at earlier 
appearances re-introduced themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator has made 11 trips to New Hampshire, site of  
the nation's first primary. He has made only one to Iowa, site of 
the first caucuses, and that was largely in his capacity as 
chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain says he is not ignoring Iowa, but state party officials  
say there is no evidence that he has a campaign organization in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	One factor in his decision to put more focus on New Hampshire  
than Iowa could be his long-standing opposition to subsidies for 
ethanol, a grain alcohol derived from corn and added to gasoline 
subsidies. Cutting off those subsidies would hurt farmers in Iowa, 
a corn-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ruling out Iowa, but there's no doubt New Hampshire  
is very important,'' McCain said. ``I think most Iowans -- except 
for Archer Daniel Midland -- agree that these are the kinds of 
subsidies that are not good for America.'' ADM, the large 
agribusiness company, is the nation's biggest ethanol producer. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, McCain's political strategists talk about the  
independence of New Hampshire voters while playing up McCain's 
maverick reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting John McCain in a state that is known for its  
contrariness and for its independence and for its unique ability to 
rally around candidates with a strong message,'' said John Weaver, 
McCain's national political director. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain needs to finish in the top three in the New Hampshire  
primary, said Mike Dennehy, the New England campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, the campaign is working to increase McCain's  
name recognition, which Dennehy said stands at about 60 percent in 
New Hampshire. The campaign wants to see that figure increase to 80 
percent to 90 percent by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has 10 New Hampshire staff members and a headquarters. In  
Iowa, by comparison, ``I haven't seen any signs of an organization 
or coalition anywhere in Iowa,'' said Will Lynch, a Republican 
consultant in Iowa who worked for Jack Kemp in 1987 when the former 
New York congressman was running. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the ethanol issue, McCain would appeal to Iowa  
voters, Lynch said. He said that while the average Iowa voter may 
not know about McCain's stance on ethanol subsidies now, they would 
once he starts campaigning in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know why else he's not coming in here. He's  
got a fantastic resume and I know people respect his history and 
heroism,'' Lynch said, referring to McCain's 5 1/2 years as a prisoner 
of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to ethanol subsidies may be one of the elements that  
brought down the campaign of Sen. Phil Graham of Texas in the last 
presidential primary season, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's decision largely to ignore Iowa is unusual, according  
to Kayne Robinson, chairman of Iowa's Republican Party. The other 
Republican hopefuls have set up elaborate operations, have lined up 
the support of activists and visit the state often, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all have visible, palpable presences in the state that  
you can feel and you can see,'' Robinson said. ``I don't think 
that's true of McCain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other Republicans practically have daily contact with the  
Iowa party, it doesn't know of a McCain representative in the 
state, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We neither hear from McCain nor do we know of anyone on the  
ground there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robinson isn't so sure that the ethanol issue was the  
deciding factor to play down Iowa. McCain's push for campaign 
finance reform probably would hurt him more than ethanol, he said. 
And the reason may be as simple as limited resources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just made a decision to concentrate on other places  
and that's their right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic  
Party, said that given the crowded Republican field, McCain may be 
making the best use of his limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be smart to take a whole pass on this thing and focus  
on breaking out in New Hampshire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lynch called the strategy ``stupid'' because a strong Iowa  
performance can help a candidate in the New Hampshire primary. 
Candidates who don't get that surge in Iowa have to scramble to 
keep up in New Hampshire, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cockpit Smoke Diverts Jet to Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A United Airlines Boeing 777 was diverted to  
Denver on Friday evening after a report of smoke in the cockpit, 
and six crew members were hospitalized and treated for dizziness, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 907 was heading from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco when  
the cockpit smoke prompted an alert, said Denver International 
Airport spokesman Chuck Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane landed safely shortly after 7 p.m. and the passengers  
were taken off. Crew members remained aboard and ``apparently were 
overcome by some sort of fumes or smoke,'' Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 10 flight attendants were examined by paramedics and six  
were taken to a hospital, where he said some were given oxygen for 
nausea and others complained of symptoms including scratchy throats 
and irritated eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for The Medical Center of Aurora, George Peck, said  
the six were treated for dizziness and released.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Given Pacemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Elton John has had a pacemaker inserted to  
overcome what he called ``a minor imbalance in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving London's Wellington Hospital today, the 52-year-old pop  
star told reporters, ``I feel very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bit stiff, a bit sore but everything went really well,''  
he said before driving off in a chauffeured limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came as a bit of a shock, but the operation was a simple  
procedure, the only thing I really regret is canceling my shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had thought he was suffering from sunstroke after  
playing tennis at his house in Nice, France. He took ill on a 
flight to Ireland where he was to have performed at the July 4 
wedding of singer Victoria Adams, known as Posh Spice, and soccer 
player David Beckham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literally, I was on the plane to David and Victoria's wedding,  
but I was ill and had to have some tests. I was given the all-clear 
and went back to France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had continued to feel weak so came to London for tests, he  
said. He was admitted to the hospital Friday and had the pacemaker 
put in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will resume a normal lifestyle after a couple of months  
rest. Life will get back to normal,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his fans had been very supportive, and he promised that  
every canceled show would be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	He also issued a statement saying the only long-term effect of  
the heart problem ``is that I have to carry a card explaining why I 
set off the alarms when I walk through airport security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacemakers regulate the heartbeat by sending an electrical  
charge from a tiny lithium battery down a wire to the heart muscle. 
They are usually placed in a pocket under the skin of the abdomen 
or the collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Elton called his pacemaker a precaution against further  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the first the problem was diagnosed as a viral problem in  
the middle ear, but after a long series of tests it was also 
discovered that there was a minor imbalance in my heart,'' his 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a short and commonplace procedure,'' it said. ``I  
stayed in hospital overnight just for observation and I have now 
been discharged and later today I will be returning to Nice to 
recover and rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``My doctors have ordered me to rest for the rest of the month  
and I will not therefore be able to play at any of the concerts 
planned this month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had canceled three concerts scheduled for today, Sunday and  
Monday in southern England, and hours before the operation he 
announced he was pulling out of two concerts in northern England 
next weekend.

<HEADLINE> Akron Is Rolling Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- There was a time when Americans started their  
days eating cereal made in Akron and driving to work on tires made 
in Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	Working men flocked to ``the rubber capital of the world'' --  
poor men, black and white, from Europe, Appalachia and the South -- 
drawn by the scent of molten rubber and good factory jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Akron wasn't like New England, with quaint covered bridges and a  
Revolutionary past, or New York, with skyscrapers and an attitude. 
It felt it was somehow more, well, American. 
</P>
<P>
	Just working people, building the wealth of the country. Not a  
sophisticated place; Akron had no Broadway. But it had the Soap Box 
Derby, the Pro Bowlers Association and the Goodyear Blimp. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the 1970s and '80s, Akron died with the factories that  
made it strong. Soon the city was just a particularly rusty spot in 
the Rust Belt -- and that's the way it seemed it would stay. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, to the surprise even of loyal Akronites, the town is  
starting to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere is the rebirth more visible than on a clear evening at  
Canal Park, home of Akron's minor-league baseball team, the Aeros. 
It's one of several big projects, publicly funded and bolstered by 
private development, that have breathed life into the city center. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans amble over to the quaint, red-brick ballpark after grabbing  
a bite to eat and a beer nearby. Inside a few players warm up on 
the outfield grass while others sign balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby Twigg, who works for a printing business, shows his sons  
the art of getting an autograph. Jeremy, 8, and Josh, 5, catch on 
quickly. Pens in outstretched hands, they stand at a wall 
separating fans from the field, wearing expressions somewhere 
between enthusiasm and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything is so pleasant that their father still can't quite  
believe he's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember the old, dilapidated buildings, places that  
were totally abandoned,'' Twigg says, waving his hand as if to push 
the memory aside. ``Akron has really come a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the Aeros from behind home plate with her young son,  
Diane Craddock has similar thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up, shopping downtown was such a treat,'' she said.  
``Then everything disappeared. Now we're bringing it all back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akron's rise and fall was tied to rubber.  
</P>
<P>
	The first rubber company came here in 1870 when Dr. Benjamin  
Franklin Goodrich, a Civil War surgeon turned businessman, put down 
roots to get away from competition in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Akron became home to four tire-makers -- companies now known as  
B.F. Goodrich Corp., Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., GenCorp and 
Bridgestone-Firestone, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker Oats Co. cereal mills moved in, and Akron's population  
tripled in a decade to 208,000 in 1920. Eventually, it topped 
300,000. A magazine profile at the time was titled ``Akron -- 
Standing Room Only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, Goodyear launched its first advertising blimp, an icon  
big enough to match the city's enormous productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Black families like Art Minson's came here for a better life.  
</P>
<P>
	Minson, now 85, arrived when he was 6. His father worked in a  
West Virginia coal mine but wanted out. He was on his way to 
Detroit to look for a job. He stopped in Akron, got some 
construction work and stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	His son worked for 40 years at Goodyear.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen Akron go down and go up,'' Minson said. ``When I was  
a kid, there were so many people downtown you couldn't get on the 
sidewalk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Knepper, a 73-year-old city native and now a professor  
emeritus at the University of Akron, also remembers when downtown 
was vigorous -- if hastily built and poorly planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole place stank of molten rubber, he recalled. But people  
got used it and, hey, it was the stench of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Grit from the smokestacks settled on everything. If you lived  
near a rubber factory you couldn't hang sheets out to dry for fear 
of getting them stained with soot, said Ray Dove, a retired 
Goodyear chemist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosperity, and all that came with it, didn't last.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s and '80s, mergers, takeover attempts and product  
recalls destroyed Akron's tire-making industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories shut. Knepper, the professor, estimates the city lost  
about 35,000 manufacturing jobs between 1970 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, no major tire plants are left in Akron. Goodyear is still  
headquartered here, but Quaker Oats was gone by 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Department stores closed as the job losses and competition from  
suburban malls annihilated the downtown. Akronites of today have 
grown up with the legend of the city official who walked through a 
vacant downtown lot and was asked why the weeds weren't cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Why bother, he is supposed to have replied; they'll just grow  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got so bad in the early 1980s that native daughter  
Chrissie Hynde, lead singer and songwriter of the Pretenders, 
immortalized the town's plight in ``My City Was Gone'': 
</P>
<P>
	``I went back to Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	``But my city was gone.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no train station.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no downtown ...  
</P>
<P>
	``My city had been pulled down  
</P>
<P>
	``Reduced to parking spaces.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Akron has fought back, shifting the emphasis from heavy  
industry to leisure, high tech and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Don Plusquellic, Akron's mayor since 1987, the city has  
poured money into projects to lure people downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Jim Phelps, deputy mayor for economic development: ``Our  
strategy was that if we can modify people's behavior, we may be 
able to modify their attitudes. We modify their behavior by giving 
them something they can't find somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years alone, Phelps estimates, $100 million or  
more has been spent on Canal Park; Inventure Place, a science 
museum that houses the Inventors Hall of Fame; and the John S. 
Knight Center, a downtown convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts, helped by the economic boom of the 1990s, have  
sparked some action. 
</P>
<P>
	Canal Park, for example, attracted 521,122 fans last season, the  
best figures in Class AA baseball. A district of bars and 
restaurants has sprung up around the park, doing good business 
before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses are coming back, too. Akron's jobless rate as of May  
was 5 percent, a little above the state and national average but 
lower than Cleveland, Dayton and nearby Canton. 
</P>
<P>
	While manufacturing still makes up about one-quarter of the  
jobs, the focus has shifted to smaller firms involved in automotive 
parts, specialty chemicals and metalworking, said Rebecca Guzy of 
the Akron Regional Development Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown, developer Tony Troppe recently renovated two grand old  
buildings near the federal courthouse and has had little trouble 
renting to lawyers and other professionals who want to be in an 
area with more character than a suburban industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
	Troppe likes to say that he used to drive through the same  
neighborhood ``to hear my muffler reverberate off the empty 
buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOJO Industries Inc., which makes skin care products, plans to  
move its headquarters with about 250 employees into the old 
Goodrich headquarters next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Akron still has problems.  
</P>
<P>
	The boom days of rubber are gone forever. Ohio doesn't even rank  
among the top five states for tire production anymore, according to 
Rubber &AMP; Plastics News. Oklahoma, North Carolina, Alabama, 
Tennessee and Illinois are the leaders now, and roughly one-fifth 
of the tires on the road in the United States are now made abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventure Place, the science center, has battled budget deficits  
since it opened in 1995. The city schools have received low ratings 
from the state, and the police department has been plagued in the 
past year by errant officers. In the most serious case, a captain 
was convicted of murdering his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, a retired lieutenant faced charges after he was  
accused of protecting the leader of an alleged prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the U.S. Conference of Mayors honored Plusquellic in  
June for his efforts to make Akron more livable, the May issue of 
Forbes magazine ranked Akron just 154th among 162 cities on its 
list of best places to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mood in Akron is still upbeat. Some people have even  
stopped longing for the days when rubber was king. 
</P>
<P>
	``Akron today is a much better place to live and work than it  
was in the good old days,'' Knepper said.

<HEADLINE> Brothel Lands In Feds' Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- In less than a month, the girls of the Mustang  
Ranch will be gone and the tacky carpets, overstuffed sofas and 
flocked wallpaper will belong to the government. And the government 
will be shutting it down. Perhaps forever. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury on Friday ordered the owners of the brothel to  
turn it over to the government, along with other properties owned 
by two companies convicted of being set up to hide the identity of 
the true owner, fugitive brothel baron Joe Conforte. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal court jury ruled that A.G.E. Enterprises Inc. and  
its holding company, A.G.E. Corp. Inc., existed to conceal 
Conforte's ongoing involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of prostitution never faced the jury, as it is legal  
in a dozen of Nevada's 17 counties, including the one where the 
Mustang is located outside Reno. The defendants were convicted of 
conspiring to protect Conforte. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Howard McKibben issued preliminary orders for all the  
forfeitures effective immediately so the government could begin 
identifying the assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnover of the brothel was postponed -- until Aug. 9 -- so  
people there could make arrangements to move out. The government 
will then seize the bordello and padlock it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not be an operating brothel,'' said Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Gregory Damm, declining to speculate whether it would ever 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel on Friday also ordered that the two companies forfeit  
$20 million each and that former Mustang Ranch madam Shirley 
Colletti surrender $220,000 for taking part in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Colletti said she was devastated.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm innocent of all those charges,'' she said. ``All the money  
I have to pay back is money I earned working 24 hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Colletti attorney David Houston, was more  
outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why doesn't the government get off its lazy butt and go arrest  
Conforte instead of picking the pocketbook of a 63-year-old 
woman?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Conforte fled the country after the Internal Revenue Service  
seized the brothel in 1990 for failure to pay taxes. The government 
argued that the ranch then was sold to his cohorts at a tax auction 
months later for pennies on the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Spills Into La. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- A train car was punctured Saturday,  
spilling 28,000 gallons of liquid chemical into a nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred around 6:30 a.m., when an engine with a  
car attached was trying to back up and get hooked up to another 
car, said Union Pacific Railroad spokesman Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The coupling device, which would have joined the cars, was not  
properly lined up and pierced a hole in the second car, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2-ethylhexanol leaked into the Red River. About  
4,000 to 5,000 gallons spilled onto the ground, state police 
Trooper Chris Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no serious injuries or evacuations as a result of the  
spill. Officials closed down Interstate 20 near the leak for most 
of the morning because of strong fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	While 2-ethylhexanol is flammable and can cause respiratory  
problems and nausea, it is not considered dangerous because it is 
biodegradable and will dissipate, said Nancy Ledford, a spokeswoman 
for Eastman Chemical, which manufactured the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleanup crews, who put booms in the water to contain the  
chemical, said it may be Tuesday before the river is cleared up.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Medicare Drug Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid speculation that political pressures  
leading to the 2000 elections could spark a compromise, President 
Clinton will meet next week with congressional leaders of both 
parties to discuss ways to help older Americans pay for 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good sign that we have the Republican  
leadership with the door open,'' Clinton said about chances for a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he believes the House will  
approve some help with drug costs for the neediest retirees this 
year. And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has asked the 
Finance Committee to send to the Senate Medicare overhaul 
legislation that would improve retirees' access to prescription 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his weekly radio address today to promote a  
prescription drug benefit through the Medicare program and to 
encourage older Americans to seek preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Medicare's founding in 1965, a medical revolution has  
transformed health care in America. Once the cure for many 
illnesses was a scalpel; now just as likely it's a 
pharmaceutical,'' the president said. ``That's why I made helping 
seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical 
care a key part of the Medicare plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his plan also would eliminate the deductible in all  
co-payments for all preventive services for cancer, diabetes, 
osteoporosis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to  
screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its 
screenings might have avoided,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House meeting -- at which Clinton, Lott, Hastert and  
Democratic leaders Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Sen. Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D., are expected also to discuss other topics -- has been 
scheduled for Monday, after lawmakers return from a week-long 
Independence Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure to get something done on Medicare drugs payments  
``could crush a diamond,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of the 
Biotechnology Industry Organization, which lobbies for drug makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether all or just some retirees will get help paying their  
drug bills, and how much, will depend on how disagreements between 
Democrats and Republicans are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, drug benefits would be available as an  
option for all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries starting in 2002. 
Initially it would provide 50 percent government coverage of 
prescription costs up to a $1,000 annual cap in exchange for a $24 
monthly premium paid by enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say direct Medicare drug subsidies are needed only  
for the poorest beneficiaries, while others could be helped through 
the private sector. Tax breaks for those who buy private Medigap 
insurance that covers drugs are among alternatives GOP leaders are 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest projections for government surpluses, totaling close  
to $1 trillion over the next decade, have made it easier for even 
conservative lawmakers to contemplate creating an expensive new 
government benefit for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger-than-expected surplus ``makes fixing the prescription  
drug part of Medicare a reality,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare's potential power as a political weapon threatens to  
spoil chances for a deal, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties feel they want to do something, and both want to  
take credit, but neither party trusts one another,'' said 
Democratic consultant Victor Kamber. ``This could just be a 
political football where both talk about it and blame the other one 
come election time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But pressure to compromise will be strong on both Democrats and  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers know from mail and town meetings that expensive  
prescriptions rank high on the list of retirees' wish lists, said 
John Rother, public policy director for the American Association of 
Retired Persons, the nation's largest organization of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the expectation is raised that they're going to do  
something about it, I think it's going to be very hard for them not 
to follow through,'' Rother said. ``This is going to be a voting 
issue in the next election if they don't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while adding drug coverage to Medicare is ``popular on the  
surface,'' GOP pollster Ed Goeas said, ``polling shows people are 
concerned ... that it may cause a runaway cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers will have some strong backup in their  
argument that Clinton's plan would overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals and other health care providers are mobilizing to  
protest the president's plan to get much of the $118 billion needed 
to pay for his drug benefit from curbs on Medicare payments for 
other kinds of care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  
meanwhile, has already run newspaper ads cautioning that government 
involvement in the drug market could result in price controls that 
would mean less choice for retirees and dry up investment dollars 
for biomedical research.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Enters Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- With his hoop earring and ever-salty  
tongue, John McEnroe took his place among the white pants and straw 
hats of tennis society on Saturday with his induction into the 
International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	As McEnroe himself once said, ``YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the most controversial player in modern tennis.  
He took whining to the next level,'' said Olympic champion speed 
skater Eric Heiden, who presented his college buddy for induction. 
``I think we ought to hold off on that induction until John 
apologizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it true that I have to apologize?'' McEnroe asked the  
crowded stadium at the Newport Casino. When the answer came back as 
a resounding ``No,'' he said, ``That's what I thought. To hell with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He then embarked on a rambling but amusing 45-minute speech --  
his co-inductee Ken McGregor took five -- in which he thanked 
everyone from his first coach to his last while insulting 
newspapers, erstwhile doubles partner Steffi Graf, Australia and 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, McEnroe was enshrined alongside his hero Rod Laver,  
his mentor Harry Hopman and fellow former bad boys Ilie Nastase and 
Jimmy Connors. Already, a McEnroe room has been established in the 
Hall's halls, complete with McEnalia from baby photos to trophies 
to pictures from his after-tennis life as artist, guitar player and 
father of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is known for his whining as much as his winning, it  
was the latter that earned McEnroe a place in the Hall. Winner of 
three Wimbledon singles titles and four in the U.S. Open, McEnroe 
won 77 championships in all and also played 12 years for the U.S. 
Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling himself ``the last guy to play great tennis with a wood  
racket,'' McEnroe said his career marked the end of an era. But it 
was also clear that he had more in common with today's brash young 
stars than with the men and women in long pants and white dresses 
that populate the pictures in the Hall's galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Making no apologies for the behavior that earned him a  
reputation as tennis' enfant terrible, McEnroe said that he knows 
that his legacy will be tainted by the tantrums that punctuated his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK. I deserve it,'' he admitted. ``... I think that my  
emotions were on my sleeve. I think that my drive and intensity 
were on display. I'll never get away from the label of the next 
Nastase, or Connors, or a combination of both, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I was as bad as them. But I was pretty close.''  
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe told about the first time he played Boris Becker and the  
then-unheralded 18-year-old was pouting the entire match -- 
``pulling a McEnroe, I guess you'd call it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Listen, guy. You've got to win something before you  
start pulling that. This is out of line,''' McEnroe recalled. 
``Three months later, he won Wimbledon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning, McEnroe said, was the key.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he said: if he was just a naughty boy, no one would  
have noticed him,'' said former New York Mayor David Dinkins, who 
was on hand for the ceremony. ``He'll be remembered for his record. 
You can't take that away from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his current job as television commentator, McEnroe is all  
talk and very little action. But he made a run at the Wimbledon 
mixed doubles title this year before Graf pulled out to concentrate 
on singles; she bore the brunt of McEnroe's anger for much of the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving half an hour late for his pre-enshrinement news  
conference, McEnroe proceeded to commit at least five potential 
code violations for foul language. Still, it was a slightly 
mellower McEnroe that praised the Hall facilities, was gracious to 
McGregor and even -- gasp! -- campaigned for the enshrinement of an 
umpire, though not the one he once called ``the pits of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get along with umpires,'' he said in uncharacteristic  
understatement. ``That was pretty clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much as he shook up the tennis world when he became the youngest  
man ever to be ranked No. 1 on the ATP computer, McEnroe hurled 
bombs at the establishment -- most of them in good fun. But he 
turned serious when he thanked those who shaped his career, saying 
that when Hopman moved to New York it was a turning point in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe in someone up above,'' McEnroe said. ``That  
person, for whatever reason, wanted me to play tennis.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Focusing on New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Braving dark clouds, a crowd of more than  
100 quizzed Republican presidential hopeful John McCain on issues 
ranging from gun control to services for veterans, the Panama Canal 
and the line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens approached McCain afterward Friday to shake his hand,  
snap photos or wish him luck. Several who had met McCain at earlier 
appearances re-introduced themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator has made 11 trips to New Hampshire, site of  
the nation's first primary. He has made only one to Iowa, site of 
the first caucuses, and that was largely in his capacity as 
chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain says he is not ignoring Iowa, but state party officials  
say there is no evidence that he has a campaign organization in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	One factor in his decision to put more focus on New Hampshire  
than Iowa could be his long-standing opposition to subsidies for 
ethanol, a grain alcohol derived from corn and added to gasoline 
subsidies. Cutting off those subsidies would hurt farmers in Iowa, 
a corn-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ruling out Iowa, but there's no doubt New Hampshire  
is very important,'' McCain said. ``I think most Iowans -- except 
for Archer Daniel Midland -- agree that these are the kinds of 
subsidies that are not good for America.'' ADM, the large 
agribusiness company, is the nation's biggest ethanol producer. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, McCain's political strategists talk about the  
independence of New Hampshire voters while playing up McCain's 
maverick reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting John McCain in a state that is known for its  
contrariness and for its independence and for its unique ability to 
rally around candidates with a strong message,'' said John Weaver, 
McCain's national political director. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain needs to finish in the top three in the New Hampshire  
primary, said Mike Dennehy, the New England campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, the campaign is working to increase McCain's  
name recognition, which Dennehy said stands at about 60 percent in 
New Hampshire. The campaign wants to see that figure increase to 80 
percent to 90 percent by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has 10 New Hampshire staff members and a headquarters. In  
Iowa, by comparison, ``I haven't seen any signs of an organization 
or coalition anywhere in Iowa,'' said Will Lynch, a Republican 
consultant in Iowa who worked for Jack Kemp in 1987 when the former 
New York congressman was running. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the ethanol issue, McCain would appeal to Iowa  
voters, Lynch said. He said that while the average Iowa voter may 
not know about McCain's stance on ethanol subsidies now, they would 
once he starts campaigning in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know why else he's not coming in here. He's  
got a fantastic resume and I know people respect his history and 
heroism,'' Lynch said, referring to McCain's 5 1/2 years as a prisoner 
of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to ethanol subsidies may be one of the elements that  
brought down the campaign of Sen. Phil Graham of Texas in the last 
presidential primary season, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's decision largely to ignore Iowa is unusual, according  
to Kayne Robinson, chairman of Iowa's Republican Party. The other 
Republican hopefuls have set up elaborate operations, have lined up 
the support of activists and visit the state often, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all have visible, palpable presences in the state that  
you can feel and you can see,'' Robinson said. ``I don't think 
that's true of McCain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other Republicans practically have daily contact with the  
Iowa party, it doesn't know of a McCain representative in the 
state, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We neither hear from McCain nor do we know of anyone on the  
ground there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robinson isn't so sure that the ethanol issue was the  
deciding factor to play down Iowa. McCain's push for campaign 
finance reform probably would hurt him more than ethanol, he said. 
And the reason may be as simple as limited resources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just made a decision to concentrate on other places  
and that's their right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic  
Party, said that given the crowded Republican field, McCain may be 
making the best use of his limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be smart to take a whole pass on this thing and focus  
on breaking out in New Hampshire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lynch called the strategy ``stupid'' because a strong Iowa  
performance can help a candidate in the New Hampshire primary. 
Candidates who don't get that surge in Iowa have to scramble to 
keep up in New Hampshire, he said.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Longshore Talks Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Associated Press, in a July 7 story  
about a longshore workers strike, erroneously quoted a union 
spokesman as saying that a refusal by longshore workers in Los 
Angeles and Long Beach to work overtime or during lunch was in 
sympathy with the Oakland dock workers.

	Spokesman Steve Stallone did confirm that the workers in Los

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Film Opens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Brandishing light sabers, Japanese ``Star Wars''  
fans welcomed the opening Saturday of the hit film in the land 
credited with inspiring the saga. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds lined up as early as Friday morning at select theaters  
for a special countdown ceremony for the arrival of ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wore costumes of Darth Vader, Yoda and other ``Star Wars''  
characters. And the crowd broke out into a cheer when the film 
finally began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special effects are so awesome,'' said Shingo Oyama, a  
19-year-old college student, lining up with a friend outside a 
Tokyo theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others, Oyama has seen all three previous ``Star  
Wars'' films and was dead set on seeing the latest on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's makers have made no secret that the work owes much to  
Asian influences: the kimono-like costuming, the sword-fighting 
scenes, the Kabukiesque makeup, and, of course, the epic fable of 
good vs. evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, who came to Japan in person last month to  
plug the film, is an avid fan of the late Japanese filmmaker Akira 
Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Asian-Americans have complained about stereotyping. But the  
Japanese haven't minded a bit, seeming to see it all as an honor. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, TV shows here have featured hype on the film,  
sometimes showing off ``Star Wars'' products like action figures 
and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hards, who couldn't wait to see the movie, went all the way  
to the United States, where it opened May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	With such anticipation, the arrival of the film at more than 400  
theaters nationwide was a jubilant affair. At the Miyukiza theater 
in Tokyo more than 1,000 people packed three showings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were clapping from joy, shaking their light sabers,''  
said theater employee Akinari Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all gave the film a thumbs-up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The visual effects were fantastic, but there wasn't much  
content to the story,'' said Shinichiro Oka, a 31-year-old computer 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, seeing `Star Wars' is an important thing to do. It was  
worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Take Kosovo Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An advance unit of Russian  
paratroopers arrived in the U.S.-controlled sector of Kosovo on 
Saturday for their first deployment as part of the NATO-led 
peacekeeping force in the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit left the Pristina airport and went to Kosovska Kamenica  
in southeastern Kosovo, said Lt. Cmdr. Louis Garneau, a spokesman 
for the NATO-led peacekeeping mission. Their plan was to set up an 
advance base for a larger force. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, bad weather in rugged terrain near the village of  
Ljubenic in western Kosovo hampered NATO efforts to search an area 
where villagers says the bodies of hundreds of ethnic Albanians 
killed by Serb forces in early April are located. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's advance party of Russian peacekeepers included 86  
soldiers and three armored personnel carriers, Russia's ITAR-Tass 
news agency said. It said they would prepare for the arrival of the 
13th Pskov paratrooper battalion. 
</P>
<P>
	Their headquarters will be a factory damaged by NATO bombs on  
the outskirts of Kosovska Kamenica, 20 miles southeast of Pristina 
and 10 miles northwest of U.S. Camp Bondsteel near Gnjilane. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of Russian peacekeepers has been a sharp point of  
contention between Moscow and NATO since about 200 Russian troops 
sped overland from Bosnia and occupied Pristina's airport June 12, 
beating NATO forces by hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow also was infuriated by the 78-day NATO bombing campaign  
that forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace 
plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal reached with NATO, Russia will deploy 3,600  
peacekeepers in Kosovo. In addition to the Pristina airport and the 
U.S. sector, they will work in sectors assigned to French forces in 
northern Kosovo and German troops in the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO plans to deploy 55,000 peacekeepers, about half of which  
are in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance's commander in Kosovo, British Lt. Gen. Michael  
Jackson, has said he hopes the presence of Russians, who share 
Slavic and Eastern Orthodox roots with Serbs, will make Kosovo's 
minority Serbs feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's pledge to protect them, at least 60,000 Serbs  
have fled the province in the face of revenge attacks by returning 
ethnic Albanian refugees. More than 600,000 refugees have flooded 
home since Serbian troops started pulling out to make way for NATO 
forces June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians in some parts of Kosovo have protested plans to  
put Russian troops in their towns. Many see Russians as allies of 
the Serbs and reminders of the horrors the Albanians suffered under 
a Serb crackdown before and during NATO's bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western Kosovo village of Ljubenic on Saturday, heavy  
rain and low clouds frustrated hopes of villagers to lead 
peacekeepers into the mountains west of the town where locals say 
there are as many as 350 bodies of ethnic Albanians killed by Serb 
forces. The area is in rugged terrain about four miles south of 
Pec. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers say most of the victims had fled into the snow-covered  
mountains to escape their Serb attackers, but bones scattered on 
the ground in the village showed some never made it that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the announcement Friday that Italian troops and the  
international war crimes tribunal would investigate the area, 
estimates of the number of victims have varied widely. Accounts of 
the killings, however, have generally been consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers said hundreds of people fled into the mountains in  
early April, about a week after NATO started its bombing campaign, 
to escape attacks by Serb forces. They said Serbs surrounded them 
in the mountains, however, and commenced a slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs came in special units with helicopters,'' Adem  
Celaj, a survivor, said. ``They were wearing snow-white uniforms. 
You could hardly see them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The farther you go up in the mountains, you find more and more  
bodies,'' said another local, Miftar Ukshinaj. ``I saw the body of 
a naked woman. They had pushed her from the rocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Capt. Bernard Tandretto, a French air force  
officer in the peacekeeping force's information center, said five 
bodies were found elsewhere Friday -- three in a house and two in a 
well -- in western Kosovo near Djakovica. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the Djakovica area, two civilians, including one child,  
were killed when a land mine they tried to defuse with a knife 
exploded. Six other people were wounded in the accident and taken 
to hospital, he said. The exact location of the incident was not 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-government demonstrations continued Saturday as activists  
and disgruntled Yugoslav army reservists work to drive Milosevic 
and other local and republic authorities from office. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 people gathered in Leskovac, in southern Serbia, for  
the sixth consecutive day of anti-government rallies in that town, 
the private Beta news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta also reported that about 500 army reservists gathered  
Saturday in the town of Vranje, about 180 miles southeast of 
Belgrade, demanding back pay for their service during the NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Generation of Girls To Be Named Mia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Get ready for a generation of girls  
named Mia. And Briana, Tiffeny, Tisha, Shannon and above all 
others, Brandi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup ended Saturday the best way it could, with  
a United States victory over China secured by Brandi Chastain, a 
31-year-old, free-spirited Californian who posed for a magazine 
last month wearing nothing but a soccer ball and dared anyone to 
suggest beauty, brains and athletic ability couldn't be bundled in 
one package. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, the second after Chastain's winning shot ricocheted  
off the left side netting and rattled around the back of the goal, 
she proved just how different your daughter's role models are from 
your mother's. 
</P>
<P>
	She stripped to her black sports bra, dropped to her knees at  
the penalty spot and let loose the scream of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' Chastain said, apologizing for none of  
it. ``That's what it was -- nothing more, nothing less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for this tournament. For nearly a month,  
America was deeply and inexplicably mad for a sport and a bunch of 
athletes most folks barely knew existed when this wondrous summer 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the 32-game tournament, the intricacies of soccer  
remained a mystery to many -- including the penalty-kick shootout 
that decided the game following 90 minutes of regulation and two 
15-minute overtime periods. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same can't be said about the 20 women who filled out the  
U.S. roster in April and set out to reclaim the World Cup trophy 
hoisted by the Norwegians four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No group of athletes was more accessible, more articulate or  
down-to-earth than this one. None loved its work more or 
communicated that feeling better. And not since another celebrated 
collection of amateurs pulled off the ``Miracle on Ice'' at the 
1980 Lake Placid Olympics has a troupe of athletes been loved so 
much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been incredible, this ride we've been on,'' goalkeeper  
Briana Scurry said. ``It's great to see your country getting behind 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the afternoon, though, most of their countrymen  
looked on with their hearts stuck in their throats. China is a 
familiar, formidable foe, one of the few countries on a par with 
the United States in terms of providing athletic opportunities for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	These teams were the finalists for the Olympic gold medal at  
Atlanta in 1996 -- decided by a late goal from Tiffeny Milbrett -- 
and the Chinese had won two of three meetings with the Americans 
this year. All four games ended with 2-1 scores. 
</P>
<P>
	And the longer this one went on, the less there seemed to be  
separating them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had the better of the play in the first half and  
the second overtime. The Chinese dictated matters in the second 
half and the first overtime, including the best chance of the game, 
when Fan Yunjie's header off a corner kick was headed back off the 
goal line by Kristine Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	What all that ebb and flow yielded in the end was the shootout,  
which is the soccer equivalent of deciding Game 7 of the NBA Finals 
with a free-throw shooting contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides had practiced for just such an ending, but U.S. coach  
Tony DiCicco saw a huge hole when he set out to select his five 
shooters. Michelle Akers, the 33-year-old grande dame of the 
American team and its best penalty kicker, was not available. She 
had been substituted as regulation expired after suffering heat 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	Staring at his roster, DiCicco knew the stories behind each name  
by heart. There were stories about sacrifices made and redemption 
sought. What he needed to know, ultimately, was who wanted the 
pressure and who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco settled on this order: First, captain Carla Overbeck,  
the original soccer mom, followed by Joy Fawcett, also 31, also a 
defender, and the team's only other parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Kristine Lilly, the North Carolina graduate who was so  
unnerved by the prospect of speaking before basketball coach Dean 
Smith at an alumni dinner that she fainted dead away on the podium. 
Fourth was Mia Hamm, the reluctant star, who has shoes, a Barbie 
doll and a building at Nike's national headquarters named after 
her, but a limited supply of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	And last was the irrepressible Chastain, DiCicco's riskiest call  
of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain began her U.S. team stint as an irrepressible forward  
in 1991, dropped out of the picture until the Olympics and then was 
asked by DiCicco to change her game around entirely and become a 
defender. When the U.S. met China this past March, in the final of 
the Algarve Cup in Portugal, Chastain took a penalty kick with her 
right foot and missed. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiCicco called her name again this time, she felt a  
surprising calm. She didn't dare look at Chinese goalkeeper Gao 
Hong, whose smile had unnerved her the last time they stared down 
one another in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the whistle blew, I just stepped up and hit it,''  
Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	A left-footed rocket rippled the side netting, the fifth of five  
American attempts. Goalkeeper Briana Scurry made it stand up by 
stopping one of China's five shots. A second after Chastain scored, 
she disappeared beneath an avalanche of joy and affection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought,'' she recalled, '' `My God, this is the greatest  
moment of my life on a soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't the only one who had that feeling.  
</P>

<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- A juvenile court judge is seeking  
contempt of court charges against a reporter who wrote about 
confidential court proceedings in a child custody case. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Friday, Judge Kathleen Akao ordered  
reporter Robin Musitelli and attorneys for the Santa Cruz Sentinel 
to appear in court July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Akao said they must show why they shouldn't be punished for  
violating court orders and state law prohibiting juvenile court 
documents from being reviewed by anyone other than authorized 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Musitelli reported on the case of a father who accused Child  
Protective Services of making false allegations to seize his 
methadone-addicted baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the Sentinel published details of the case  
knowing public disclosure was prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentinel Editor Tom Honig said he disagreed with the judge's  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand any action against a newspaper for doing  
its job, for aggressively pursuing a story,'' Honig said. ``To have 
a judge hold a newspaper in contempt seems, on the face of it, in 
violation of the First Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Place in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ignoring the calendar.  
With time running out on his presidency, he is reaching for new 
ideas rather than slowing down. He is racing around the country and 
the world rather than relaxing at Camp David or on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	His place in history is at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Marked as only the second president ever to be impeached,  
Clinton is searching for a legacy based on achievements instead of 
scandal. The roaring economy is aiding his search, giving him the 
financial cushion of $5.9 trillion in expected budget surpluses 
over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lame duck on the books, but he isn't acting like one,''  
said James Thurber, director of American University's Center for 
Congressional and Presidential Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is looking to put Social Security and Medicare on sound  
financial footings, subsidize prescription drug costs for seniors, 
tighten gun controls, build new schools, hire 100,000 new teachers, 
spend billions on child care and health care, bring peace to the 
Middle East, stabilize war-battered Kosovo and resolve the age-old 
conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that Bill Clinton is still  
legacy-minded,'' said Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the 
American Enterprise Institute. ``He's not going to have any desire 
to coast for the remaining 18 months of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to have proposals out there on these issues because  
it's not only a potential opportunity to get something done, but 
obviously these are meat and potatoes, bread and butter issues for 
Democrats,'' Ornstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurber said Clinton's presidency is far from over.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has so much energy, and he wants his legacy to be so  
positive, that he's still driving. He gets inspired when he gets 
down, it seems,'' Thurber said, referring to the impeachment ordeal 
that dominated the first months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	With his headline-grabbing proposals on Medicare and Social  
Security, Clinton demonstrated anew his knack for dominating the 
news and shaping the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans hold slim majorities in the House and Senate,  
Thurber said, ``I hope they remember that the president has the 
power of the veto, and presidents win 97 percent of the time on the 
veto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is good for Clinton, though, might not be deemed in the  
best interest of Democrats as they try to regain control of the 
House and Senate. While the president says he wants to move 
programs through Congress, Democrats may decide they would rather 
have an issue to fight in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has told Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton they are  
free to disagree with him if it suits their political purposes, as 
the vice president seeks the presidency and the first lady pursues 
a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials recoil from talk about legacy-building.  
Some think it sounds like Clinton is more interested in 
resume-padding and scandal repair than in doing the peoples' 
business. The chief of staff, John Podesta, said he banned the word 
``legacy'' from White House discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disavowals, however, Clinton has been known to fret  
about his legacy. He told CBS' Dan Rather that he was not at all 
sure that the word ``impeachment'' would show up in the first 
paragraph of his obituary. The president portrayed his impeachment 
struggle as a battle of honor rather than disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Former political strategist Dick Morris, in his book ``Behind  
the Oval Office,'' recounted a lengthy discussion with Clinton in 
1996 about great presidents and where he might fit in. 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding he could not be a first-tier president without a war  
or other unanticipated historical force, Clinton questioned what it 
would take to be ranked in the second tier. They discussed making 
welfare reform work, balancing the budget and breaking the back of 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good list,'' Clinton said, according to Morris. ``I've got it  
down. I'll think about it a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton never talks publicly in terms of legacy, even as he pats  
his administration on the back for the strong economy and falling 
crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any president who talks about legacy is not in the business of  
producing one,'' said Brookings Institution political scholar 
Thomas Mann. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he is doing is perfectly consistent with his performance  
throughout his presidency,'' Mann said. ``This is an ambitious, 
energetic politician whose perhaps greatest strength is trying to 
shape the agenda, who has a knack for identifying issues and 
articulating positions that resonate with the citizens of this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a mistake to somehow attribute it to  
last-minute legacy. If it is, it's foolish,'' Mann said. ``The only 
way Clinton can work the presidency is full throttle, from 
beginning to end.''

<HEADLINE> Search Expands for Murder Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- The search for a man suspected of killing  
three teen-age girls at his home before fatally shooting his Bible 
study teacher expanded to Kentucky after his cash machine card was 
used there, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dragnet for Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, has extended more  
than 200 miles southeast of Sidney, the western Ohio city where 
three teens were found dead late Thursday inside Hensley's home. 
Police believe he is heavily armed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky State Police said Hensley, who has relatives in  
Kentucky, used the bank card in the town of London on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims Sherry Kimbler and her cousin Tosha Barrett, both 16,  
had been shot several times Thursday at close range with a shotgun. 
Amy Mikesell, 14, was found stabbed in the basement. Police said 
Ms. Kimbler was Hensley's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	A 22-year-old woman who escaped after being shot remained  
hospitalized in serious condition with leg and shoulder wounds. 
Authorities said she identified Hensley as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Wildermuth, 37, a Bible study teacher at Hensley's church,  
was shot and killed at his house about 30 minutes after the first 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Steven Wearly said Hensley knew the girls but did  
not say why they were at the home, which Hensley shared with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found 24 Molotov cocktails lined up on a workbench in  
the basement. They appeared to contain gasoline, according to bomb 
squad members who detonated the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	No motive has been revealed for the shootings, but police Capt.  
Dean Kimpel said investigators were examining the possibility that 
Hensley could be part of a satanic cult. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearly said Hensley had previously been arrested on a public  
indecency charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley, a worker at the Glacier Daido America automotive parts  
plant in nearby Bellefontaine, was considered an employee in good 
standing, said Jeff Wheeler, a quality assurance manager.

<HEADLINE>  Cipollini Wins 4th Straight Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THIONVILLE, France (AP) -- The first week of the Tour de France  
favors sprinters, and Mario Cipollini has made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Living up to his billing as the ``King of Sprints,'' the  
engaging Italian on Saturday became the first rider since 1930 to 
win four straight Tour stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the spotlight moves to Lance Armstrong: arguably the  
overall favorite and certainly the emotional one, with his stirring 
comeback from testicular cancer. The American, who won the race 
prologue, is favored in Sunday's crucial time trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Already in fifth place overall, Armstrong could soon be wearing  
the leader's yellow leader's jersey again, as the race hits the 
Alps for a series of grueling mountain stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance just elicits confidence, because he believes in himself  
so much,'' said Mark Gorski, general manager of Armstrong's U.S. 
Postal Service team. ``If he believes, then everybody believes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Marston, a fan from Boise, Idaho, who watched the race on  
Saturday, was more concise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance is just on fire,'' Marston said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong stayed safely in the pack on Saturday, as his team  
tried to make sure he stayed in form for Sunday's time trial. His 
coach ordered teammates to surround him so he'd be protected from 
the wind, and wouldn't expend too much energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh stage was marked by a long and gallant breakaway by  
Frenchmen Jacky Durand and Lylian Lebreton, who were caught by the 
pack with 2.5 miles to go, after lasting nearly 124 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 142-mile route took the riders from Avesnes-sur-Helpe, near  
the Belgian border, past fields of corn to Thionville, next to 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	For the seventh time in as many days, the race ended in a  
furious sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	After catching the breakaway riders, the teams leading the pack  
jockeyed to get their star sprinters into position. They were all 
there: Cipollini, Erik Zabel of Germany, Australian Stuart O'Grady, 
Belgian Tom Steels, and Jaan Kirsipuu, the Estonian who has held 
the yellow jersey since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zabel, who fell with 21.7 miles to go but recovered and joined  
the sprinters at the front, suddenly slipped out of his pedals with 
about 75 yards left to race. Amazingly, he stayed on the bike. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini suddenly had an easy path. He crossed the finish line  
by three lengths, and then took a long, satisfied look backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu came in third, after O'Grady, and kept the yellow  
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini's feat came 69 years after Frenchmen Charles Pelissier  
won the last four stages of the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning four consecutive Tour de France stages doesn't seem  
real,'' he said. ``I have to thank my teammates once again, 
especially Gian Matteo Fagnini who pushed me towards the finish 
line.'' All week, the Italian's Saeco teammates have worked 
mightily to put him into winning position. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to second place overall, trailed by O'Grady, Zabel,  
Armstrong and Spaniard Abraham Olano. 
</P>
<P>
	After the time trial, the riders have a rest day and then they  
head to the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week has belonged to Cipollini. On Friday, he had  
already entered the record books when he won a third consecutive 
stage, the first rider to do so since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	He achieved that feat thanks to the jury's decision to  
disqualify Steels, who crossed the finish line first. Authorities 
ruled Steels had unfairly swerved out of his line and impeded the 
movement of a fellow rider, Jan Svorada of Slovakia.

<HEADLINE>  Will Women's Soccer Now Prosper? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Now that the Women's World Cup has been  
a rousing success financially and artistically, the questions 
begin: 
</P>
<P>
	What does it all mean? Will women's soccer prosper, both here  
and abroad? Is a professional league on the U.S. horizon? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is sure, but riding the euphoria of the last three weeks,  
everyone is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some small way, we have all been a part of history,'' says  
Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee and the 
guiding force behind the most successful women's sports event ever. 
``This tournament has demonstrated how our sport is growing all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift and the way the tournament  
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a 
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say, 
`That event is responsible for the development of women's 
sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The development of women's soccer is the more pertinent topic  
right now. Another showcase is coming up, in Sydney next September. 
Australia also is bidding for the 2003 Women's World Cup and has no 
competition right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a difficult act to follow the great tournament the  
U.S. has been able to stage,'' said Basic Scarsella, chairman of 
Soccer Australia. ``It will come following the 2000 Olympic Games 
and that will give us some interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings for U.S. team games have surpassed those for the  
Stanley Cup, and a sellout crowd of 90,000 for Saturday's 
championship match between the hosts and China helped push the 
average attendance to more than 38,500 for 17 tournament dates. 
</P>
<P>
	With a much smaller population, Australia might expect to  
average 15,000 fans at each game, although Scarsella noted that his 
nation may have deeper soccer roots than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the organizing committee in the United States has been  
able to do is market to a different audience,'' Scarsella said. 
``They've tapped a market that's never been tapped before, and 
great credit should go to the organizers for being able to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it must continue doing that, leading the way, if the legacy  
of WWC '99 is to be a lasting one. 
</P>
<P>
	``American companies are doing a great job of promoting the  
athletes,'' Messing said. ``The media has provided an avenue to the 
public and to make them accessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, though, it is their talent that is the deciding  
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That talent, at least in this country, needs a steady place to  
exhibit itself. The national team almost certainly will stage a 
tour of exhibition games against other countries later this year. 
When the Olympic squad is chosen, it, too, will be on display in 
numerous exhibitions and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after the 2000 Olympics, a U.S. league of some sort becomes  
a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is to have a league of our own,'' Brandi  
Chastain said. ``We really don't have a place to stay sharp. 
Without a place for our young players to play, it will be hard for 
us to be as successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, with the way women's soccer abroad is improving, the  
Americans' spot among the elite no longer is so secure. Although 
college programs are strong, those players -- especially ones who 
are not quite at the national team level -- must have a place to 
hone their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer already has begun studying a plan for a women's  
league. Just as with the startup of Major League Soccer, which 
didn't occur until two years after the 1994 men's World Cup was 
held here, the establishment of a women's league won't be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a necessity for us to stay successful,'' says Lauren  
Gregg, the longtime U.S. assistant coach and a former head coach at 
North Carolina and Virginia. ``What we classified as professional 
and nonprofessional and successful and unsuccessful may be 
different than the traditional professional league. For us, a 
professional league needs to be something that pays our players a 
salary to train the way they need to train, and develops our 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could pay our best players to play and train year-round and  
take the onus off U.S. Soccer, which has made a huge investment in 
this team. That's why we're successful, but they're not in the 
long-term position to pay our players. At the same time, if we 
don't have a league, our schedule is so demanding they have to pay 
them, because the players are basically full-time.''

	There isn't a lot of money in women's soccer, either. The U.S.  
players will make a bonus of around $12,500 each for the World Cup. 
While Chastain, Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and a few 
other veterans will do just fine with endorsements and personal 
appearances after the tournament, some of the others aren't likely 
to prosper.

exist, in countries such as Brazil and Germany, or are developing, 
particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty uncertain,'' Foudy said. ``There's a lot of  
questions. We know we'll get back together for some games, go to 
residency (camp), then have some games before the Olympics. And 
then ... then what?''

<HEADLINE>  Will Women's Soccer Now Prosper? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Now that the Women's World Cup has been  
a rousing success financially and artistically, the questions 
begin: 
</P>
<P>
	What does it all mean? Will women's soccer prosper, both here  
and abroad? Is a professional league on the U.S. horizon? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is sure, but riding the euphoria of the last three weeks,  
everyone is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some small way, we have all been a part of history,'' says  
Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee and the 
guiding force behind the most successful women's sports event ever. 
``This tournament has demonstrated how our sport is growing all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift and the way the tournament  
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a 
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say, 
`That event is responsible for the development of women's 
sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The development of women's soccer is the more pertinent topic  
right now. Another showcase is coming up, in Sydney next September. 
Australia also is bidding for the 2003 Women's World Cup and has no 
competition right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a difficult act to follow the great tournament the  
U.S. has been able to stage,'' said Basic Scarsella, chairman of 
Soccer Australia. ``It will come following the 2000 Olympic Games 
and that will give us some interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings for U.S. team games have surpassed those for the  
Stanley Cup, and a sellout crowd of 90,000 for Saturday's 
championship match between the hosts and China helped push the 
average attendance to more than 38,500 for 17 tournament dates. 
</P>
<P>
	With a much smaller population, Australia might expect to  
average 15,000 fans at each game, although Scarsella noted that his 
nation may have deeper soccer roots than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the organizing committee in the United States has been  
able to do is market to a different audience,'' Scarsella said. 
``They've tapped a market that's never been tapped before, and 
great credit should go to the organizers for being able to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it must continue doing that, leading the way, if the legacy  
of WWC '99 is to be a lasting one. 
</P>
<P>
	``American companies are doing a great job of promoting the  
athletes,'' Messing said. ``The media has provided an avenue to the 
public and to make them accessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, though, it is their talent that is the deciding  
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That talent, at least in this country, needs a steady place to  
exhibit itself. The national team almost certainly will stage a 
tour of exhibition games against other countries later this year. 
When the Olympic squad is chosen, it, too, will be on display in 
numerous exhibitions and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after the 2000 Olympics, a U.S. league of some sort becomes  
a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is to have a league of our own,'' Brandi  
Chastain said. ``We really don't have a place to stay sharp. 
Without a place for our young players to play, it will be hard for 
us to be as successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, with the way women's soccer abroad is improving, the  
Americans' spot among the elite no longer is so secure. Although 
college programs are strong, those players -- especially ones who 
are not quite at the national team level -- must have a place to 
hone their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer already has begun studying a plan for a women's  
league. Just as with the startup of Major League Soccer, which 
didn't occur until two years after the 1994 men's World Cup was 
held here, the establishment of a women's league won't be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a necessity for us to stay successful,'' says Lauren  
Gregg, the longtime U.S. assistant coach and a former head coach at 
North Carolina and Virginia. ``What we classified as professional 
and nonprofessional and successful and unsuccessful may be 
different than the traditional professional league. For us, a 
professional league needs to be something that pays our players a 
salary to train the way they need to train, and develops our 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could pay our best players to play and train year-round and  
take the onus off U.S. Soccer, which has made a huge investment in 
this team. That's why we're successful, but they're not in the 
long-term position to pay our players. At the same time, if we 
don't have a league, our schedule is so demanding they have to pay 
them, because the players are basically full-time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't a lot of money in women's soccer, either. The U.S.  
players will make a bonus of around $12,500 each for the World Cup. 
While Chastain, Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and a few 
other veterans will do just fine with endorsements and personal 
appearances after the tournament, some of the others aren't likely 
to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our younger players have to choose, `Do I go into  
another career, or do I starve and stay in soccer forever?''' Gregg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option is to play in the few women's pro leagues that  
exist, in countries such as Brazil and Germany, or are developing, 
particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>

questions. We know we'll get back together for some games, go to 
residency (camp), then have some games before the Olympics. And 
then ... then what?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defeats China To Win World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- They captured America and now they've  
conquered the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, idolized at home like no other women's sports  
team, won the World Cup on Saturday, beating China 5-4 on penalty 
kicks after a 0-0 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	With a festive gathering of 90,185 that included President  
Clinton cheering their every move, the Americans capped the most 
successful women's sporting event ever by winning their second 
championship in the most dramatic, exhausting way imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandi Chastain sent a punishing left-footed penalty kick high  
into the net to win it as the Rose Bowl crowd erupted in cheers 
that resounded off the San Gabriel Mountains. She then ripped off 
her jersey in celebration and was mobbed by her jubilant teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team of courage,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.  
``They just fought and fought and fought. There are two champions 
here today, and only one is taking a trophy home. 
</P>
<P>
	``America should be very proud of these young ladies.''  
</P>
<P>
	To deafening chants of U-S-A, U-S-A, the players leapt about  
with whatever energy they had left. After they received their 
championship medals, they jogged around the field carrying three 
huge American flags as the fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
	A cloudburst of confetti littered the field as goalkeeper Briana  
Scurry, who made the winning save during the penalty kicks, ran to 
the stands to slap hands with some fans. She then got down on both 
knees and saluted the crowd, which was chanting ``Scurry, Scurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams stood hand-in-hand for photos after sharing one of  
the most intense experiences in sports -- a shootout to decide the 
most prestigious prize in soccer, a World Cup crown. 
Coincidentally, the men's World Cup final in 1994 at the Rose Bowl 
ended in a shootout after a 0-0 tie, with Brazil beating Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	China shot first and Xie Huilin hit the left corner of the net.  
Co-captain Carla Overbeck matched the goal to a huge cheer from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiyan Qui barely got the ball past the outstretched hands of a  
diving Scurry, and Joy Fawcett made no mistake with her shot for 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Ying Liu's shot was in the middle of the net and Scurry dived  
left to get her hands on it and send it wide. Kristine Lilly almost 
nonchalantly put hers in. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouying Zhang beat Scurry, but Mia Hamm scored. That brought Sun  
Wen, the tournament's leading scorer, to the spot with the crowd in 
a frenzy. Sun put her shot to the left of Scurry for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Chastain, who was cut from the national squad in 1994  
and missed the last World Cup. But she fought her way back onto the 
team and was the biggest of several stars on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another savior was Lilly. In the 100th minute, in 90-degree  
heat, a header by Fan Yunjie was headed off the goal line by Lilly 
with Scurry beaten. The crowd sighed, then roared at Lilly's 
championship-saving play. 
</P>
<P>
	Another star was Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest of the  
Americans. She left the game with an injury in the final moments of 
regulation. When she played, she dominated the midfield, never 
allowing Sun to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
	China's brilliant midfielder, Yan Jin, finally got going when  
Akers left. She created several chances in the extra periods, when 
China had a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the two best teams in the tournament -- China outscored  
opponents 19-2 heading into the final and the United States had an 
18-3 margin -- these teams have created a scintillating rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat the Chinese 2-1 for the 1996 Olympics gold  
medal and 2-0 for the '98 Goodwill Games crown. China had won two 
of three this year, including the championship of the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big one went to the Americans, and the series now stands  
12-5-5 for the United States, which also won the first World Cup in 
China in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans arrived early and ready. By halftime of the third-place  
game, won by Brazil on penalty kicks, the stands were nearly 
filled. Just about everywhere youngsters with red-white-and-blue 
painted faces waved American flags. Chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A'' 
began even as Norway and Brazil were playing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American team marched onto the field, Akers jumped up  
and down like a schoolgirl as her teammates waved their arms above 
their heads and encouraged more cheering from a crowd already 
screaming its lungs out. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of sound, punctuated by a U.S. Navy F-18 fly-over at  
the conclusion of the national anthem, was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much to cheer about for most of the sloppy  
game. The Chinese seemed tentative and their passes rarely 
connected until overtime . The Americans' oft-questioned defense 
was rock solid. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie was tested much, and the crowds biggest reaction  
of regulation time was when the crowd booed as Clinton was shown on 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country was caught up in this, not only fans  
of soccer but young girls,'' Clinton said. ``In some ways, it's the 
biggest sporting even of the last decade. It's new and exciting for 
the United States. It will have a very far-reaching impact, not 
only for the United States, but for the world.''

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- It's not just the French who adore Jerry Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
	The Venice Film Festival will honor Lewis with a career award  
and a showing of ``The Bellboy,'' the comic's 1960 film. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis will receive the Golden Lion career award on Sept. 11, the  
last day of the Venice festival, when his film about a hapless 
worker at a Miami hotel will be screened, organizers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Festival director Alberto Barbera praised Lewis, 73, as an  
``inescapable point of reference for many comic authors and 
actors.''

<HEADLINE> Closer Excited To Join Diamondbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Matt Mantei very much wants to keep his nickname  
``Ice Man.'' If it means the Arizona Diamondbacks finally will be 
able to cool off the opposition in the late innings, they're more 
than happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game with Oakland had just begun when the  
Diamondbacks' new closer arrived at Bank One Ballpark after his 
flight from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't wait to get here,'' he said. ``I felt like a little  
kid coming into the stadium. It was like playing in a Little League 
World Series or something. I'm just excited to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-throwing right-hander was a little bleary-eyed after a  
late-night farewell party with some of his Marlins' teammates after 
he learned of the trade that sent him to Arizona on Friday night. 
Still, he wanted to go to the mound Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to get in there today,'' he said. ``But there's  
always tomorrow or the next day. I know I'm going to have some 
opportunities to pitch here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks sent reliever Vladimir Nunez, top minor-league  
prospect Brad Penny and minor league player to be named to the 
Marlins to get Mantei. General manager Joe Garagiola was able to 
avoid losing a position player on the big league roster even though 
the Marlins knew how much the Diamondbacks need a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona has blown 14 of 29 save opportunities this season. The  
Diamondbacks knew they needed a closer to stay in the NL West race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was aware of that. I knew they'd had some tough times in the  
bullpen,'' said Mantei, who had 10 saves in 12 opportunities with 
Florida. ``It shouldn't take that much to turn it around. It should 
be fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei, who just turned 26, underwent arthroscopic surgery in  
1996 to repair a partially torn rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was going to be able to pitch again. I just didn't  
know I'd be as strong,'' he said, ``but I'm stronger than I was 
before I had the surgery. I thank God every morning when I wake up 
and I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei said his top pitching speed this year has been ``a couple  
at 100 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clubhouse was empty when Mantei arrived because the game had  
started. He figured out which uniform to put on, then shook hands 
with his new teammates in the dugout before trotting out to the 
bullpen between the first and second innings. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Mantei got a first-hand look at Randy Johnson.  
Johnson has been known to throw 100 mph pitches after nine innings. 
Johnson was beaten 2-0, the latest in a series of hard-luck 
outings, but Mantei was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh man, that guy's amazing,'' Mantei said. ``He's a pitcher.  
He doesn't just go out there and throw 100 mph every time. He 
pitches. The guy is awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei said he felt he owed the Marlins something after they  
stood by him through his rotator cuff and back injuries. But he 
said he appreciates their trading him to a team that's contending 
in just its second season, a franchise that's quickly earned a 
reputation as being generous to its players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've hard some great things about this organization,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei hasn't pitched since Tuesday. His only chance before the  
All-Star break will be Sunday, when the Diamondbacks conclude their 
three-game inter-league series with Oakland. Meanwhile, he had one 
top priority Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to go back to the hotel and get some sleep,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Former CART Champ Vasser Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- While new teammate Juan Montoya is  
enjoying unexpected success, former CART FedEx Series champion 
Jimmy Vasser is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser, who won the title in 1996 and then lost championship  
battles with then-teammate Alex Zanardi each of the past two 
seasons -- took some solace Saturday in qualifying sixth for the 
Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America. 
</P>
<P>
	That matched his qualifying effort earlier this season in  
Brazil. Vasser's only better starting position was second last 
month in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty happy because that's the best qualifying run we've  
had in a while,'' Vasser said. ``It's nice to be back at the sharp 
end of the grid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, a 23-year-old rookie from Colombia, continued his  
strong performance, qualifying second behind pole-winner Michael 
Andretti. It is Montoya's eighth top-five start in 10 races and his 
fifth front row start. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngster, who leads the series points, has four poles and  
four wins and could match the rookie record of five victories -- by 
Nigel Mansell in 1993 -- with a win on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy is a great driver and he's just had some bad luck,''  
Montoya said. ``We've had a lot of good things happen. But he'll 
win some races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is certainly no animosity between the new teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Montoya was presented with a stylish clock for  
leading the second quarter voting in the Driver of the Year Award. 
Vasser made it a point to be there to shake Montoya's hand and 
congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy you won it, but it's my turn next,'' Vasser said  
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HARD HIT:@ Richie Hearn slid off track and crashed hard Saturday  
during qualifying for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pushing the car trying to get another lap in for us  
before the checkered flag and I just lost it,'' said Hearn, who was 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner John Della Penna shook his head and said, ``We're  
just having a terrible weekend. We have virtually no testing with 
this car, so we've been behind the eight ball all weekend. Richie 
was just trying to get as much out of the car for as long as he 
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team recently switched from a Swift chassis to a Reynard.  
Hearn will start 24th in the 26-car field. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	CHEESY GUY:@ Paul Tracy won the Miller Lite 200 last month at  
Milwaukee, so a victory here Sunday would give him a Wisconsin 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 Road America winner, who will start ninth, said, ``I'd  
love to sweep the Wisconsin Champ Car races. My wife, Liisa, is 
from Crivitz, so I'm already an honorary cheesehead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe winning at Milwaukee and Road America in the same year  
would make it official.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CLOSING IN:@ Andretti's pole on Saturday was the 32nd of his  
career, moving him just a bit closer to CART record-holder Rick 
Mears. Mears, who retired in 1993, won 39 poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti already holds the CART record for laps led, but needs  
to be out front for only nine laps Sunday to reach 6,000. Mears is 
a distant second in that category with 3,286.

<HEADLINE> Fu Battles Back From Layoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Fu Mingxia has been  
fairly fantastic, despite a three-year layoff. In fact, the time 
away may have done her good. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Olympic gold medalist continued to shine in her  
return from retirement, hitting crisp dives on the toughest 
routines attempted Saturday to win the 3-meter springboard title at 
the University Games, adding to an earlier platform win. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 5-foot-2 Fu defeated two of the world's best, making an  
Olympic bid at Sydney in 2000 all the more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I retired because I was tired spiritually,'' the Chinese diver  
said through an interpreter. ``Mentally, I needed a little break. 
After I had some rest during these three years, I feel very well 
psychologically. I feel very motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's bad news for stars like Russians Irina Lashko and Yulia  
Pakhalina, who each won titles at the 1998 World Championships in 
Fu's absence, but were relegated to silver and bronze, 
respectively, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu totaled 550.230 points. Lashko, runner-up to Fu on the  
springboard in Atlanta, finished with 528.300, and Pakhalina had 
521.010. 
</P>
<P>
	``These two wins are progress in my career,'' Fu said. ``I think  
this is good preparation for the 2000 Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She could become the only woman to win five Olympic diving gold  
medals in a career. 
</P>
<P>
	Platform and springboard golds in the Atlanta Games made her the  
first woman in 36 years to win both Olympic events. She also won 
the platform at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fu, who was 12 when she won her first world title, quit the  
sport shortly after Atlanta, although she had to petition the 
government for permission. Now 21, she studies economics at 
Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University. 
</P>
<P>
	She denied she was pressured to return to international  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mallorca, the United States earned the right to defend its  
women's basketball gold medal by beating Russia 87-79 in the 
semifinals. The U.S. will meet Spain, a 67-63 winner over Ukraine, 
in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's basketball, the U.S. beat Canada 87-82 in the  
quarterfinals. The United States, winner of five straight gold 
medals, will play Mexico next, while Spain and Yugoslavia also 
advance to the final four. 
</P>
<P>
	China rallied from two sets down to beat Russia for the women's  
volleyball gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba more than doubled its gold medal total at the games, which  
close Tuesday, by taking two in judo, one in fencing, and two in 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Yoelvis Quesada easily won the triple jump with a  
top effort of 17.40 meters, and Daymi Pernia shattered the 
University Games record in the women's 400-meter hurdles for the 
second straight day. Pernia won the gold in 53.95 seconds, with 
NCAA champion Joanna Hayes second in 54.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit today I knew I was going to win from the  
start,'' said Pernia, who has made an impressive comeback from 
right knee surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hers was one of three records set at Son Moix Stadium, where  
fewer than 500 spectators turned out for track and field 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Bloom of the United States won the shot put with an event  
record 21.11 meters, lopping 0.26 meters off a mark that had stood 
since 1985. Bloom, a past NCAA champion in the discus and shot put 
for Wake Forest, earned a silver in the discus here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	European cross country champion Sergiy Lebid of Ukraine won the  
men's 5,000 meters in 13:37.52, four hundredths of a second faster 
than Italy's Franco Fava ran in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men's winners were Mexico's Alejandro Lopez in the  
20-kilometer walk and Hungary's Zsolt Nemeth in the hammer. Among 
the women, Tifanny Lott-Hogan of the United States won the 
heptathlon, Romania's Claudia Iovan took the 10-kilometer walk, and 
Pavla Hamackova gave the Czech Republic gold in the pole vault.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Misses Eighth Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Boston's Nomar Garciaparra missed his eighth  
straight start Saturday because of a groin injury but said he'll be 
ready to play in Tuesday night's All-Star game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably be in there starting, probably play an inning or  
two,'' Garciaparra said before the Red Sox met the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, third in the American League in hitting at .366,  
overtook New York's Derek Jeter in the final week of voting for the 
AL's starting shortstop spot. Garciaparra has 14 homers and 57 RBIs 
and a 17-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	He aggravated his left groin on July 2 against the Chicago White  
Sox and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to hurt me (to play),'' Garciaparra said. ``It  
might actually help me to see where I'm at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams said Garciaparra won't play Sunday  
against Atlanta in the final game before the All-Star break, He 
said the club was ``leaving the door open'' for Garciaparra to play 
Tuesday before the hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say there's an opening if things go right,''  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, the manager of the AL team, wasn't  
looking forward to having Garciaparra come out of the game early in 
favor of Jeter. Red Sox fans are expected to boo, even if their 
hometown hero leaves the game to avoid aggravating the groin more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't play in these next two games, what do we do  
here?'' Torre said Saturday morning. ``But I'm going to wait for 
someone to tell me. I'm not going to make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is one of Torre's coaches for Tuesday's game and  
probably will have the final say.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Wants Court Role Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, ending a day  
and a half of testimony, asked a federal judge Saturday to limit 
court involvement in repairing the trouble-plagued Indian trust 
fund program and allow him to ``get this problem nailed down and 
solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Babbitt's testimony, the government rested its defense in a  
class action lawsuit filed by Indians demanding that the courts 
take over the trust fund, overhaul its error-filled accounting 
system and make restitution to Indians who have lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	Final arguments were expected to come late next week, but it's  
not known when Judge Royce Lamberth will issue his decision in the 
monthlong trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During testimony Friday and Saturday, Babbitt clashed repeatedly  
with the plaintiffs' attorney, Elliott Levitas. At one point, 
Babbitt, who described himself as a long-standing supporter of 
Native Americans, suggested he was being ``pistol-whipped'' in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government acknowledged in the trial that the Indian trust  
fund, which distributes money owed individual Indians based on land 
holdings, has been mismanaged for many years. Its record system is 
so shoddy and incomplete that making accurate fund distributions 
will be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Babbitt argued he has begun to correct matters and  
the accounting system is being cleaned up. ``We're almost there,'' 
he said, although he admitted the overhaul might take several more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth, who cited Babbitt for contempt this year for acting  
too slowly to produce Indian trust fund records, gave no indication 
how he will rule. He said, however, that Babbitt was ``very 
constructive'' in acknowledging a measure of court supervision 
might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was widely expected that Lamberth will order court  
supervision of the trust fund, which has deposits of $500 million. 
Many of its 300,000-plus Indian account holders live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The involvement of the court is very important,'' Babbitt  
said, speaking directly to the judge. He said he hopes for a 
limited court presence, perhaps through an ``advisory'' panel to 
settle disputes under threat of having to return to court if 
disputes cannot be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs want Lamberth to appoint a special master to oversee  
trust fund reforms and remove its management from the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, which has been in charge of it for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress directed appointment of a special trustee of the fund  
in 1994 to work within the Interior Department. The trustee, Paul 
Homan, a former banking executive and bank regulator, disagreed 
sharply with Babbitt on how to resolve the fund's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Homan resigned last January and charged that Babbitt undercut  
his authority. Babbitt testified that Homan openly showed ``his 
disdain for the BIA'' by insisting the bureau could not produce 
needed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony, Babbitt acknowledged he wanted to fire Homan, and  
if he were running a business he would have asked him to resign. 
Instead, he installed a deputy under Homan ``to make the trains 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homan has proposed a broad strategy for fixing the trust fund  
problem that includes creation of a new agency outside the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs to fix and manage the fund. Babbitt contends 
Indian tribes almost unanimously want fund management to remain 
within the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that the treatment of Homan was  
an example of Babbitt talking about fund reform but stifling needed 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding his questioning of Babbitt, Levitas, a former  
congressman, introduced the transcript of a January 1993 Senate 
hearing. Then, only five days into his job, Babbitt promised action 
``in 60 days'' on fixing the trust fund accounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the transcript showed, the remark was greeted with  
laughter, noted Levitas.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Eager To Manage Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Houston manager Larry Dierker is ready  
to return to the Astros after next week's All-Star break, one month 
after he had a seizure in the dugout and underwent brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him this morning,'' interim manager Matt Galante  
said Saturday before Houston's interleague game with Kansas City. 
``He's doing good. He's still planning on being back right after 
the All-Star break. His first game will be next Thursday against 
Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker suffered a seizure in the dugout during a game on June  
13, and doctors removed tangled blood vessels in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They originally said he could possibly be back after the  
break,'' Galante said. ``It's on the quicker side rather than the 
later side, but he's right on schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Saturday night's game, the Astros were 11-14 in  
Dierker's absence, one game behind Cincinnati in the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last four or five times I talked to him and saw him, he  
looked good and sounded great,'' Galante said. ``There's nothing he 
can't do but drive a car. He won't be able to drive for about five 
or six months. It's a state law that after a seizure like that you 
can't operate a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``But other than that, he's doing great.''  
</P>
<P>
	Galante said not driving will be no problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make whatever arrangements we need to make. We'll drive  
him back and forth.''

<HEADLINE> Dallas 5, Kansas City 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas scored four times in the final 10 minutes  
as the Burn beat Kansas City 5-0 Saturday night at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kreis, leading the MLS with 36 points, had two goals and  
two assists. Paul Broome and Chad Deering each had a goal and an 
assist, while Ted Eck added a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn's scoring outburst was the second-quickest in league  
history. The Los Angeles Galaxy scored four times in six minutes on 
June 4, 1998 in an 8-1 victory over the Burn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the way the guys played tonight,'' Burn coach  
Dave Dir said. ``We got a little sloppy when they went down to 10 
men, but they eventually wore down and we were able to take 
advantage. This was Kansas City's third game in a week and I 
thought they played very well. The score was not indicative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn (10-9) remains tied with the Chicago Fire in the  
Western Conference race, as Chicago defeated the New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars tonight. Kansas City (4-13) remains in sixth 
place in the West.

<HEADLINE> Scurry Stops China's Penalty Kicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Briana Scurry charged left, deflected  
the ball with her outstretched arms and a record crowd of 90,185 
fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up China's first two penalty kicks, the American  
goalkeeper stopped Liu Ying with the score tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hit it pretty hard, but I don't think she placed it all  
that well,'' Scurry said. ``I knew I just had to make one save the 
entire time because I knew my teammates would make their shots. I 
knew if I just got one, we'd probably win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She charged out of the net, pumping her arms, encouraging long,  
loud cheering that enveloped the Rose Bowl in Saturday's Women's 
World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was telling them to come on, make it as loud as you can,''  
Scurry said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kristine Lilly beat Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong to put the  
Americans ahead 3-2, the pumped-up goalie stalked back to the line 
for her next challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, who has a black panther tattooed on her left shoulder,  
roamed left, then right before finally taking up her spot in the 
center of the goal. She stared defiantly into the eyes of the next 
Chinese player, daring her to beat her from 12 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more penalty kicks got by Scurry before Brandi Chastain won  
the World Cup for the United States, 5-4, following a 0-0 tie. 
Chastain ripped her white jersey off, exposing a black sport top, 
and waved it wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry ran into the stands for an embrace with her best friend  
while her teammates piled on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Brandi, I lost control,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Scurry got a scare in the 100th minute. She fell to her knees  
trying to stop a header by Fan Yunjie that would have won the game 
for China. But Scurry wasn't the last line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly leapt at the goal line and headed the ball clear,  
saving the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a little miracle today,'' the 27-year-old Scurry said,  
smiling. ``I was like, `Uh-oh. The ball is behind me.' I didn't 
know Lilly was behind me, but I'm glad she was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry is known for her calmness, leaping ability and great  
hands -- and she needed all three when Liu approached the ball for 
China's third penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really focused on that one,'' Scurry said. ``Just  
looking at her walking up to the ball I had a feeling it was going 
to be the one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coach Tony DiCicco huddled with Scurry before the penalty  
kicks began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her all she could be in this shootout was a hero,'' he  
said. ``Bri was the hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry is now 1-1 in shootouts, having lost the other one a few  
years ago. She's been the No. 1 goalkeeper for the United States 
since 1994, starting three times as many matches as any other 
goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave the Americans little to worry about in front of their  
goal during the tournament. They yielded only three scores in the 
World Cup, one a ball they put into their own net. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, nicknamed ``The Rock'' and ``The Wall'' by her  
teammates, was downright stingy in a 2-0 semifinal victory over 
Brazil on the Fourth of July. She called her 52nd career shutout 
and third of the tournament her best effort in five years on the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, Scurry made a series of spectacular moves. She  
tipped a shot over the net, got a hand on another Brazilian kick, 
then made a sprawling two-handed stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God Bri is on our team,'' Mia Hamm said after semifinal  
win. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry has been good since she helped Anoka High win the 1989  
Minnesota state soccer championship. She went on to star at 
Massachusetts, helping the school to the NCAA Final Four in 1993. 
Even then she was the queen of shutouts, collecting 37 in 65 starts 
in her four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	For 120 minutes on Saturday Scurry saw little action, making  
just two saves. But she likes it that way. She said before the 
final that she prefers a boring game without any shots to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so her coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish there had been some goals so the crowd could enjoy some  
of the great attacking players on the field,'' DiCicco said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who promised to run naked through the streets of  
Athens, Ga., if the United States won the gold medal at the 1996 
Olympics, and kept her word, is ready for some peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been great, but I'd like to have my life back,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Film Opens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Brandishing light sabers, Japanese ``Star Wars''  
fans welcomed the opening Saturday of the hit film in the land 
credited with inspiring the saga. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds lined up as early as Friday morning at select theaters  
for a special countdown ceremony for the arrival of ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wore costumes of Darth Vader, Yoda and other ``Star Wars''  
characters. And the crowd broke out into a cheer when the film 
finally began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special effects are so awesome,'' said Shingo Oyama, a  
19-year-old college student, lining up with a friend outside a 
Tokyo theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others, Oyama has seen all three previous ``Star  
Wars'' films and was dead set on seeing the latest on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's makers have made no secret that the work owes much to  
Asian influences: the kimono-like costuming, the sword-fighting 
scenes, the Kabukiesque makeup, and, of course, the epic fable of 
good vs. evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, who came to Japan in person last month to  
plug the film, is an avid fan of the late Japanese filmmaker Akira 
Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Asian-Americans have complained about stereotyping. But the  
Japanese haven't minded a bit, seeming to see it all as an honor. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, TV shows here have featured hype on the film,  
sometimes showing off ``Star Wars'' products like action figures 
and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hards, who couldn't wait to see the movie, went all the way  
to the United States, where it opened May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	With such anticipation, the arrival of the film at more than 400  
theaters nationwide was a jubilant affair. At the Miyukiza theater 
in Tokyo more than 1,000 people packed three showings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were clapping from joy, shaking their light sabers,''  
said theater employee Akinari Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all gave the film a thumbs-up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The visual effects were fantastic, but there wasn't much  
content to the story,'' said Shinichiro Oka, a 31-year-old computer 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, seeing `Star Wars' is an important thing to do. It was  
worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Pioneer Farmer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- James Farmer, who as head of the  
Congress of Racial Equality led the Freedom Riders and helped end 
segregation in interstate buses in the 1960s, has died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, who had been in ill health in recent years, died Friday  
while hospitalized, said Ron Singleton, a spokesman for Mary 
Washington College where Farmer was a professor. No further details 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of the Big Four civil rights leaders of the 1960s,  
Farmer was blind and had both legs amputated because of 
complications of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Farmer helped to make America a better nation, and I was  
saddened to learn of his death today,'' President Clinton said in a 
statement Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer founded the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942 and in  
the following decades shared the spotlight with Whitney Young, head 
of the National Urban League, and NAACP leader Roy Wilkins. All 
were overshadowed by the Rev. Martin Luther King. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is simply irreplaceable,'' said Kweisi Mfume, president of  
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
``James Farmer leaves this century as one of a few select men and 
women to be responsible for great change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer's most celebrated accomplishment as head of CORE was to  
lead the Freedom Rides in 1961. It was a nonviolent effort to 
desegregate interstate buses and terminals, but participants 
encountered violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped recruit CORE members James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and  
Michael Schwerner, all of whom were murdered in Mississippi during 
the Freedom Rides. Their slayings were the subject to the 1988 
movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Farmer often faced threats of violence  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who said he wasn't afraid during the civil rights  
movement was either a liar or without imagination,'' he said in a 
1991 interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Division within CORE over leadership and direction led Farmer to  
resign in 1966. More recently, he has taught, served briefly in the 
Nixon administration and made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, President Clinton presented Farmer with a  
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a vindication,'' Farmer said when the award was  
announced. ``I certainly was ignored and forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer was born in Texas and grew up in Mississippi. He entered  
Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, in 1934 as a 14-year-old 
freshman. He graduated from theological school at Howard University 
in 1941, and was a conscientious objector during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	After college, he worked for the Fellowship of Reconciliation  
and started contemplating how to change racist practices in 
America. He became a proponent of Mohandas Gandhi's nonviolent 
methods, something King later espoused, and founded CORE while 
living in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1942, Farmer tested Gandhi's vision at the Jack  
Spratt Coffee Shop near the University of Chicago. The manager 
there refused to serve Farmer but agreed to serve Farmer's friend, 
a white man -- until Farmer reminded the manager of the state's 
civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me what I wanted. I ordered doughnuts, my friend  
ordered coffee,'' Farmer said. ``He told us the doughnuts would be 
a dollar apiece. When we left, he charged the usual 5 cents per 
doughnut. We decided to pursue it because, obviously, this 
gentleman had a problem regarding race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer and CORE activists followed up with the nation's first  
sit-in: 26 people hogging the counter and all the available booths. 
Jack Spratt's managers offered to serve them in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them we were comfortable where we were. They served  
us,'' Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer moved to the Fredericksburg area in 1980 to write his  
autobiography, ``Lay Bare the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his illnesses, Farmer taught a course at Mary Washington  
College in Fredericksburg on the history of the civil rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1998 interview, Farmer admitted there had been times over  
the years when he felt chafed by the lack of universal recognition 
for his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There've been moments of bitterness. And I simply shrug them  
aside,'' Farmer said. ``Historians have a way of looking under the 
headlines, below the headlines, and seeking truth. If they do that, 
I think I will be given credit for seminal work in civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer is survived by two daughters, Tami Gonzalez of Partlow  
and Abbey Levin of Darnestown, Md., and a granddaughter.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Player Shot at Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Jimmy Robinson, a senior wide receiver for  
Kentucky, was shot twice during a party near the campus. He was 
hospitalized in good condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was shot in the upper left arm and left thumb, breaking  
both bones, a statement from the university said. Team physician 
Scott Mair said Robinson would be re-evaluated for further 
treatment during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Hal Mumme was out of town and could not be reached for  
comment, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington police said as many as 300 people attended a party at  
University Commons apartment complex swimming pool around midnight 
when a group of strangers crashed the party and fighting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that people were thrown into the pool and  
a man pulled out a handgun. Multiple shots were fired in the 
parking lot area, police Lt. James Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was the only person shot. He was hospitalized at UK  
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman left the scene and no arrests have been made, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, of Stone Mountain, Ga., played the last two seasons  
for Kentucky after transferring from Georgia Military College in 
1997. Last season, he caught 26 passes for 285 yards and two 
touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Wreaks Havoc in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs struggling to put their lives  
back together after NATO bombing were confronted with new troubles 
Saturday: flooding that forced some to flee their homes and left 
parts of the capital without power or drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight storms wreaked havoc with railway and road traffic  
throughout Serbia and even set off an air-raid siren in one town, 
causing panic among some residents who thought NATO bombing had 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one death was reported and 10 people were missing, the  
private Beta news agency said. A 60-year-old man drowned Friday 
night in the swollen Lugomir River while trying to rescue his 
cattle in a village near the town of Jagodina, 60 miles southeast 
of Belgrade, Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be a punishment from God. First NATO nearly  
destroyed everything I had, then this. ... Could it be worse?'' 
said Petko Budimir, 40, whose rented house was flooded. His 
previous home was nearly destroyed when NATO bombed Belgrade's 
Strazevica suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The area was a frequent target during NATO's 78-day air campaign  
against Yugoslavia, which was launched to force Belgrade to accept 
a peace plan for the Serbian province of Kosovo. The bombing ended 
in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers used inflatable boats to evacuate residents from  
several buildings in another Belgrade suburb, Rakovica. Debris was 
strewn across streets in the area as local residents struggled to 
build a sandbag barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parts of Belgrade were without drinking water and  
electricity, the Politika TV station reported Saturday. The 
capital's main emergency hospital was flooded, and health workers 
issued a plea that only emergency patients be brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	An international train traveling from Belgrade to the Bulgarian  
capital, Sofia, was blocked overnight in a Belgrade suburb after 
flooding wrecked a stretch of track. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of heavy flooding to the west in  
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	As heavy rains continued Saturday in Serbia, Beta said the main  
highway from Belgrade to Nis in southeastern Serbia was cut near 
the town of Jagodina by a landslide. High water cut a rail line in 
the area, where a state of emergency was declared, Beta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also expressed concern about high water threatening a  
dam on the Gruza River near Kraljevo, 75 miles south of Belgrade. A 
local Kraljevo radio station warned residents near the dam to leave 
the area, Beta said, and the state-run Tanjug news agency said 
there was danger the whole area could be flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Vecernje Novosti reported Saturday that heavy rain in  
the town of Trstenik, 95 miles south of Belgrade, set off an 
air-raid warning siren, prompting some residents to flee their 
homes for fear of air attacks. They returned after local radio 
repeatedly broadcast a message that the alert was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In the central Serbian city of Kragujevac, floods caused a power  
blackout and disrupted the city's regular water supply. Lightning 
sparked a number of fires, Beta said.

<HEADLINE> Dad Couldn't Save Son From Gang Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At first, he thought he could save his son.  
</P>
<P>
	So he would chase him down trash-filled alleys and over fences,  
too old to run after someone half his age but too scared to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	And he would hustle to the police station, persuading cops to  
let him take his boy home, promising he'd get him help. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Luis Rodriguez was determined to steer his son,  
Ramiro, away from the bloody life of gangs he had wallowed in a 
generation earlier in Los Angeles when he nearly ended up one more 
tattooed corpse in a morgue. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, Luis was a gangbanger, hopped up on drugs  
or booze, willing to firebomb a house or spray a crowd with 
gunfire, whiling away his days in jail cells instead of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the kid doing the running.  
</P>
<P>
	But Luis grew out of it. He made a life for himself. He became a  
writer and poet; people paid to read his words, to hear his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro, too, would grow up, he told himself, and find his own  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	So when his son sank deeper into gang clutches, Luis fought to  
free him in every possible way: Good schools. Family counseling. A 
psychiatric hospital. A youth group they formed together. 
</P>
<P>
	He even gave Ramiro a written blueprint of his errors -- a  
painful autobiography of his own gang-cursed days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, Luis, 45, tours the country, speaking of lessons learned.  
He calls it a sentence, community service, for crimes he has 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro has just begun another sentence: At 24, he is in the  
early days of a 28-year prison term for attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It is a squinting bright day outside, but the school auditorium  
is damp and dim as the squat man in the navy blazer utters words he 
hopes another father's son will hear: 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 11 when I joined a gang.  
</P>
<P>
	``At 12, I was doing drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	``At 13, I started getting arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I was 17, I was charged with attempted murder.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before I was 18 years old, 25 of my friends were dead.''  
</P>
<P>
	Luis Rodriguez, writer and poet, is for the moment reciting the  
facts of his own resume, the history of a boy who doubted he would 
survive to become a man. 
</P>
<P>
	He has come this day to address about 100 juniors at Holy  
Trinity High School who have read his autobiography, ``Always 
Running.'' He has come to tell how the sins of one generation were 
passed on to another, how history repeated itself, and tore apart 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here because I did a lot of things right,'' Luis says,  
clutching an open book of his poetry in a silver-ringed hand. ``I'm 
here because I made a lot of mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I clasped the screwdriver and walked up to the beaten driver  
in the seat whose head was bleeding. The dude looked at me through 
glazed eyes, horrified at my presence ... Do it! were the last 
words I recalled before I plunged the screwdriver into flesh and 
bone, and the sky screamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So wrote Luis in his memoir, ``Always Running.''  
</P>
<P>
	But his life story didn't begin the way you might think.  
</P>
<P>
	He grew up with loving parents. His father, an educated man, was  
a high school principal in Mexico who dreamed of golden 
opportunities across the border. But he never mastered English and 
ended up cleaning animal cages in a college science lab in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodriguez family moved about Southern California. By age 13,  
Luis, nicknamed ``Chin,'' for his jutting jaw, was a full-fledged 
gang member, dabbling in sex, drugs and crime. Soon after, his 
mother kicked him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a raging kid,'' he says, sitting in his cramped living  
room, the crook of his thumb on his left hand tattooed with a cross 
and three rays, symbol for la vida loca, or ``crazy life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a crazy life it was.  
</P>
<P>
	Luis snorted, smoked, shot and swigged his way through his teen  
years. Aerosol cans. Mescaline. Methamphetamine. Heroin. Vodka, 
rum, tequila. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the drugs and violence were the best thing,'' he says.  
``I didn't like school. I didn't like family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he did like was the gang, and he was eager to prove his  
mettle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the guys wanted soldiers to do jobs,'' he says, ``I was  
the first one to go. Shoot somebody? Firebomb their homes? Anything 
like that I was game for. I loved the adrenaline rush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing,'' Luis says, ``was just one big suicide  
journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His quick wits helped him wriggle off the hook many times, but  
he still wound up in juvenile detention halls and jails in Monterey 
Park, East Los Angeles, Pomona. Rites of passage, he assured 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But times were changing.  
</P>
<P>
	The riots were over, the federal government was helping  
inner-cities, do-gooders were streaming into his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	And they saw something in Luis that he didn't even see himself:  
A good speaker, a leader, a kid with a flair for words. 
</P>
<P>
	They encouraged him to return to high school, where he wrote a  
column for the student newspaper. He discovered the fiery rhetoric 
of Eldridge Cleaver, Malcolm X, Claude Brown, and decided one day 
he would tell his own story. 
</P>
<P>
	But Luis was a Jekyll and Hyde: He could impress a school  
counselor in the morning, then go on a drive-by shooting that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	At 17, he was charged with assault with intent to commit murder.  
But the case was dropped. Then after a run-in with his own gang, he 
decided to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left the gang,'' he says, ``my thing was I'm never  
going back. It was a closed door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 21, Luis was married with a son, Ramiro. Soon, his daughter,  
Andrea, came along. 
</P>
<P>
	But the young man who had survived as a thief, armed robber and  
burglar had to do something different -- honest work. So he tried 
various jobs, from truck driver to carpenter to steelworker. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, he dreamed of becoming a writer. Finally, it  
became a reality. First he worked at a newspaper, then, having 
moved to Chicago, he founded his own press and immersed himself in 
poetry. He married for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	His children visited each summer; they would camp, go to the  
beach and amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	Then one day, Ramiro's mother called from California.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your son,'' she told Luis, ``needs a father.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At 13, Ramiro was a baby-faced kid who was resentful of his  
absentee father and harboring a secret: He had been physically 
abused by men his mother knew. 
</P>
<P>
	So a new home, even with a father he didn't know well, was  
promising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We loved our father ... but we never felt like we had a real  
relationship with him,'' Ramiro says. ``It could have been any man 
to get us out of our situation, for a month, or at least for a 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home was Humboldt Park, on Chicago's near West Side, a melting  
pot of Puerto Ricans, Mexicans and blacks -- and some of the most 
intense gang activity in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the trouble began.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro was bright, but he was tossed out of or quit three  
schools. He fought. He sold and used drugs -- cocaine, acid, wicky 
sticks, a combination of reefer and embalming fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis didn't like what he saw, because he saw himself.  
</P>
<P>
	He imposed 10 p.m. curfews. He banned TV. He demanded to meet  
Ramiro's friends. The angrier he got, the worse it got, with his 
son sneaking out in the middle of the night -- just as Luis had done 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ain't going to be in no gang,'' he told him, trying to  
barricade the doorway with his fireplug body. Ramiro scurried 
around him, down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it at the time but now I know that he didn't  
want me to follow in his footsteps,'' Ramiro says, his almond eyes 
flashing. ``He didn't want to see his son join a gang, but I needed 
something, man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like his father, Ramiro found security in the gang.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had more of a relationship with them than I ever had with my  
father,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Every now and then, his father pulled him out of the life, once  
signing him into a psychiatric hospital, where Ramiro flashed gang 
signs, hurled a chair at a staffer and ended up in leather 
restraints. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, he returned to the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to use what you know,'' Ramiro explains. ``It's  
just like any businessman on Wall Street. They play the stock 
numbers. That's what they know. ... The drugs, the guns, the 
violence. This is what we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then two things united father and son.  
</P>
<P>
	Luis wrote ``Always Running,'' and it made the New York Times'  
list of notable books in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The details were a revelation to his son, who knew only sketchy  
details of his father's past. 
</P>
<P>
	And Luis and Ramiro formed a group, Youth Struggling for  
Survival. This was no anti-gang crusade. Every kid was accepted as 
is. The group tried to divert their energies into artistic, 
spiritual and community activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis and Ramiro also bonded on a book tour. They were an  
appealing made-for-TV duo: the father who had rejected gangs, the 
son still in the gang's grip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no intention of getting out,'' Ramiro says. ``I'm not  
the kind of person when I join something, I leave it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last Mohican,'' says his father, who watched Ramiro's  
buddies mature and marry, while his son clung to his gangster ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came real trouble: Ramiro was arrested in two drive-by  
shootings. He wasn't the gunman either time, but at 18, he was an 
adult, facing the possibility of serious time. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis rode to the rescue again, even while battling his own  
demons: a serious drinking problem (up to 25 beers a day, he says) 
that he has since kicked. He hired a lawyer and lined up people to 
testify to Ramiro's good deeds with other kids, just as folks had 
rallied around him long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro was sentenced to boot camp, where he flourished.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is your break,'' Luis counseled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to change,'' he promised his family.  
</P>
<P>
	For a while, he did. Then the pressures of work, college and  
everyday life mounted, and everything unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really wanted to be in the streets,'' his father says.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro sees it another way:  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't strong enough to take my own life so I found how to  
do it in other ways. I guess I just really wanted to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small but intense fire burning in Ramiro. ... He's  
made it so far, but every day is a challenge. Now I tell him: You 
have worth outside of a job, outside the `jacket' imposed on you 
since birth. ... Stop running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the final words of ``Always Running.''  
</P>
<P>
	Seven years after those lines were written, Ramiro has nowhere  
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	He's inmate No. B72006 at Menard Correctional Center, serving  
time for attempted murder. In 1997, Ramiro got into a scuffle with 
a truck driver, shot him and fled, leading police on a chase. He 
shot at two officers; neither was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	This time Luis could not save his son.  
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a prison visiting room, Ramiro runs a hand nervously  
through his shoulder-length black hair, twisting it into a 
ponytail. He talks about writing poetry, his regret in not turning 
to his father as his world collapsed and his painful separation 
from his three children by three women he didn't marry. 
</P>
<P>
	He has never held his youngest in his arms. His oldest, 6, will  
be 18 before Ramiro is eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love my family and I really love my kids ... but I  
just didn't love myself,'' he says. ``I really don't think I would 
be here if I asked my father for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	His speech over, Luis Rodriguez thinks of his son.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you,'' he says, smiling with the memory,'' he was a  
really beautiful little boy ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro was a chatterbox who would wave at strangers from car  
windows and give his toys to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Luis has two more sons to raise, and when he speaks to them  
of Ramiro, he always has good things to say. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he is alone, he blames himself for not being there when  
Ramiro was younger. 
</P>
<P>
	He regrets not giving him the stable family life he needed. And  
he can't help but be haunted by his son's long sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro is hundreds of miles away, but he's never far from Luis'  
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	There are powerful poems his son wrote. There are smiling photos  
of Ramiro with his brothers and sister on the living room shelves. 
There are phone calls and visits to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's still a father's lament.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't say,'' he whispers, ``that I didn't have a hand  
in this.''

<HEADLINE> Jeter Bats Cleanup for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter moved into the cleanup spot of the  
New York Yankees' batting order for the first time in his career, 
going 0-for-4 in Saturday's 9-8 loss to New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter's average dropped from a league-leading .377 to .373 --  
second to the .375 for Toronto's Tony Fernandez. Jeter had batted 
second in 71 games this year and hit third 11 times. He also batted 
leadoff once. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a plan. He goes up there and gives us his money's  
worth,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``He's probably been the 
most consistent of any of our players this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter struck out in the first, grounded out in the fourth, flied  
out in the sixth, was intentionally walked in the seventh and 
grounded out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said earlier, you're only your number in the order in  
your first at-bat,'' he remarked, saying the switch didn't mean 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was designed to get Bernie Williams back to the No. 2  
spot. Williams, the Yankees' cleanup hitter in recent years, hit 
second last month when Jeter was dropped to third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time we put him there, it seemed to put us on fire,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch remained in the leadoff spot, Paul O'Neill hit  
third and Tino Martinez batted fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I could split the left-handers up was to do  
this,'' Torre said, a reference to O'Neill and Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre pulled Jeter aside when the Yankees arrived at Shea  
Stadium about 2 1/2 hours before the first pitch. Williams didn't mind 
the shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he was hitting second, he said, `OK.' If I told him  
he was hitting fourth, he'd say, `OK,''' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter lost out to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra in fan voting for  
the starting AL shortstop in Tuesday's All-Star game at Fenway 
Park. Garciaparra missed his eighth straight game Saturday after 
injuring his groin July 2 against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't play in these next two games, what do we do  
here?'' said Torre, the American League's manager. ``But I'm going 
to wait for someone to tell me. I'm not going to make that 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Turks Kill 40 Kurds in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Thousands of Turkish troops backed by  
helicopter gunships killed 40 Kurdish rebels during a weeklong 
offensive in northern Iraq, a news report said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Private NTV television said the troops withdrew early Saturday  
but gave few other details. No Turkish casualty figures were given. 
Military officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has condemned the offensive, launched July 3, calling it a  
violation of its sovereignty. Troops went nine miles inside Iraqi 
territory, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey frequently crosses into neighboring Iraq, where rebels  
belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, maintain bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest incursion was the first since a Turkish court  
sentenced Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to death on June 29 
for leading a war for autonomy. The conflict has killed some 37,000 
people since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the rebels claimed to have killed 18 Turkish soldiers  
in an attack in southeastern Turkey, according to Kurdish news 
agency report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels said they bombed a Turkish military outpost near the  
town of Yusekova, the Germany-based DEM news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said the attack was launched in retaliation for the  
death sentence issued to Ocalan and for ``the memory of all ... 
guerrillas killed'' in the 15-year old fighting, DEM said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not say when the attack took place, and there was  
no military confirmation of the attack, which could not be 
independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's sentence will be appealed. If upheld, it still must be  
endorsed by parliament and the president.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Education Is Top US Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told the country's  
second largest teachers' union Saturday he would ``move heaven and 
earth'' to make education the top U.S. priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention the 2000 presidential race directly in a  
speech at the national meeting of the American Federation of 
Teachers. But he said that in any ``future public service,'' issues 
such as more money to repair crumbling and overcrowded schools, 
improve classroom technology and increase teacher pay would top his 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have a national commitment that education is our  
No. 1 priority,'' Gore told about 2,000 cheering teachers. ``I will 
move heaven and earth, and leave no stone unturned, to bring about 
the revolutionary change we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has asked Congress for tax breaks that would  
free up $25 billion in private money for school modernization 
targeted at poor inner-city schools. Gore said poorly maintained 
schools help create indifferent students. 
</P>
<P>
	``The powerful but unspoken message: if you want to goof off, if  
you think you education is not that important to you, go right 
ahead. It's not that important to us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But repairing schools shows a ``commitment'' that the primary  
goal is learning, Gore said, sending a new message to students: 
``You ought to do your part and study hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress also advocate tax incentives to raise  
more money for public school construction, but their plan does not 
set aside money specifically for inner-city districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing federal budget surplus projections, Gore said education  
priorities should include hiring more teachers to reduce 
overcrowding, paying them more, and ensuring the Internet becomes 
more fully integrated in classroom teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with pride of the ``e-rate'' -- Republicans call it the  
``Gore tax'' -- a telephone fee he pushed that has raised $2 billion 
for classroom Internet hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to have them name it after me,'' he said. ``We have  
to finish the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers applauded enthusiastically throughout Gore's  
speech, but afterwards some said they want to see the words backed 
up with actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how important education is, but when it  
gets right down to it, where's the money?'' said Lyris Russ, a Los 
Angeles elementary school teacher with 27 years' experience.

<HEADLINE> D.C.-Baltimore Bid Gets $1M Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics has  
received a major boost, with donations of more than $1 million in 
new corporate contributions. The pledges push efforts to raise $10 
million by 2002 past the halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition, which is  
working to pursue the Olympics, has gained $750,000 in pledges in 
the past month from Giant Food Inc., T. Rowe Price, The Rouse Co. 
and Marriott Corp., as well as nearly $500,000 in services such as 
office space and legal services. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, now with about $5.25 million in total contributions  
and pledges, will submit its formal bid to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee in December 2000. A single American winner will be 
selected in 2002 to participate in a worldwide competition to host 
the 2012 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other American cities, including Dallas, are seeking the  
2012 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented move, the coalition also said it would push  
to hold opening and closing ceremonies jointly on the Mall in 
Washington and at Baltimore's Inner Harbor rather than in a single 
amphitheater. The group also plans to make such ceremonies open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Knise, president and chief executive of the  
Washington-Baltimore 2012 Coalition, said construction of new 
facilities, which has burndened many prior Olympics cities, will be 
kept at a minimum for a bid here. Thanks to several new facilities, 
such as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and MCI Center, the focus will be 
on using those existing sites or building temporary modifications, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really want to make this a games of the people, and with  
that our mantra is to build less and use more of what's already in 
place,'' Knise said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the coalition has not yet formally approached the U.S.  
Park Service, which administers the Mall, about the ceremonies. He 
said the group intends to do so soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Summer Olympics opening ceremonies, going back to ancient  
Greece, have always been in an enclosed stadium,'' said John Lucas, 
an Olympic historian and retired Penn State professor. ``This 
Washington idea is very provocative. With the IOC in such a state 
of flux, the time is right for some brave new thinking. But they 
should come up with a backup plan in case the USOC doesn't want to 
go through with it.''

<HEADLINE> Utah State AD Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- Utah State athletic director Bruce Van De  
Velde resigned Friday to become an associate AD at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Van De Velde said he is leaving for his family and for the  
professional opportunity at Oklahoma, where he will be the senior 
associate AD. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the opportunity to have served as director this  
past year and am grateful for the support shown to the program 
during my time here,'' Van De Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation is effective July 28.  
</P>
<P>
	Van De Velde was hired at Utah State just over a year ago to  
replace Chuck Bell, who became AD at San Jose. Before that, Van De 
Velde was an associate AD at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	While at Utah State, Van De Velde hired basketball coach Stew  
Morrill, the second-winningest coach in Colorado State's history, 
and women's volleyball coach Tom Peterson, who won the men's 
volleyball national championship while at Penn State.

	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Two U.S. Air Force planes took  
off Sunday on a medical aid mission to Antarctica. They're dropping 
medication and diagnostic equipment to a worker who discovered a 
lump in her breast but can't immediately leave the frigid 
continent. The 47-year-old woman might not be evacuated from 
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station until late October, the earliest

title. When Brandi Chastain's left-footed kick landed high in the 
net, the Rose Bowl erupted in cheers. U.S. goalie Briana Scurry had 
stopped Liu Ying's shot with the penalty score at 2-2. The game 
remained 0-0 after regulation and two 15-minute overtime. President 
Clinton was one of the 90,185 spectators at the biggest women's

this month on a Kosovo Liberation Army car, killing two rebels. A 
Defense spokesman said the soldiers have not been charged with any 
crime and are still on active duty. Official reports on the 
incident said the soldiers opened fire on the vehicle because they 
feared their lives were at risk from a man firing celebratory shots 
into the air from the roof of the car. But witnesses have said the 
paratroopers did not do enough to warn the people in the car and 
that no attempt was made to stop the vehicle.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans on Saturday proposed an $864  
billion plan to cut income taxes by 10 percent during the next 
decade. The GOP proposal was directly at odds with White House 
efforts to focus budget surpluses on Social Security, Medicare and 
some new spending. ``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays 
in Washington, the politicians will surely spend it,'' said House 
Ways and Means chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, the architect of the

<HEADLINE> Another Dramatic Homer For Piazza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another day, another three-run homer against the  
New York Yankees for Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a big step for us,'' he said after the Mets'  
dramatic 9-8 victory Saturday over their crosstown rival. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 6, Piazza hit a two-run homer off Roger Clemens as the  
Mets won 7-2 at Yankee Stadium, stopping an eight-game losing 
streak and Clemens' 20-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, he broke a sixth-inning tie with a three-run  
homer that gave the Mets a 5-2 victory over the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, with the Mets trailing 6-4 in the seventh, he reached  
down for a low pitch from Ramiro Mendoza and hit a three-run homer, 
a 482-foot drive that bounced off a tent behind the left-field 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza didn't even watch it, afraid of being called a showboat.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to look up,'' he said. ``I just wanted to get  
around the bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza is showing the Mets made a good investment when they  
signed him to a $91 million, seven-year contract after last season. 
He's homered in three straight games, going 2-for-3 with four RBIs 
Saturday. Piazza is hitting .311 with a team-high 19 homers and 55 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a streaky hitter,'' he said. ``You go through  
times of the year when you come through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it happens against the Yankees, everyone in New York takes  
notice -- especially when it happens in three straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	On the back pages of the tabloids and on talk radio, the Yankees  
and Mets compete for attention. Some think there's a battle between 
Piazza and the Yankees' Derek Jeter for the title of biggest star 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Piazza. His focus is on returning the Mets to the postseason  
for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel any competition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Four More Satellites Put in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Four more Globalstar communication  
satellites rocketed into orbit today in the second launch of its 
kind in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing Delta II rocket took off at 4:45 a.m. The satellites --  
worth about $15 million each -- separated in pairs about an hour 
later. High wind had forced a two-day launch delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Globalstar, based in San Jose, Calif., plans to begin providing  
wireless telephone service this fall. Today's launch boosted the 
number of Globalstar satellites in orbit to 28; altogether, 48 
satellites are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Globalstar launch is planned for later this month and  
yet another in August, also aboard Delta rockets. Four satellites 
were placed in orbit June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's launch cost about $115 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral  
Space and Communications Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Fires, Killing May Be Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Two brothers suspected of killing a gay  
couple near this rural Northern California town have been linked to 
arson attacks at three Sacramento synagogues that caused over $1 
million in damages, and investigators have seized white supremacist 
literature from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29,  
were arraigned Friday on charges of receiving stolen property that 
prosecutors said was linked to slaying victims Gary Matson and 
Winfield Scott Mowder in Happy Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Shasta County Sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson  
confirmed a link between the brothers and evidence pointing to the 
June 18 synagogue fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Literature espousing white supremacist beliefs was found at the  
brothers' home outside Redding, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched the brothers' modest house and brought out  
several bags of evidence, and a van from the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Beatrice Stansbury said the brothers were ``very quiet,  
very clean cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd see the lights on late at night, but we didn't think  
anything of it. We never had any problem with them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Smith, who owns the Palo Cedro nursery where the older  
Williams brother worked two years ago, said the brothers were 
deeply religious. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he warned Benjamin Williams, known by his middle name  
Matthew, not to impose his religious beliefs on the customers. 
Smith also drew the line when he talked about taxation and the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd rant and rave about things just like anybody else,''  
Smith told the San Francisco Chronicle. ``I told him, he has 
opinions, but this is a business. I want it separated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two were arrested Wednesday in Yuba City.  
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were being held in lieu of $150,000 bail each.  
Richardson said a credit card belonging to one of the murder 
victims was used to make a purchase for delivery to a Yuba City 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and local authorities staked out the business, arresting  
the brothers. One was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Authorities 
confiscated two assault rifles, a shotgun, 9 mm pistols and other 
items that Richardson declined to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said his department hopes to file murder charges  
against the brothers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are examining whether the case is part of a wide  
hate-crime conspiracy and whether the Williams brothers were linked 
to the anti-Semitic World Church of the Creator, based in East 
Peoria, Ill., The Sacramento Bee reported. There was no answer 
Saturday at the home of the group's leader, Matthew Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	A former World Church member killed himself last weekend after  
targeting minorities in a shooting rampage in Indiana and Illinois. 
Two people were killed and nine were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said investigators also planned to search an area in  
Oroville, about 85 miles south of Redding. He would not disclose 
details about that search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bee also reported Saturday that after the brothers' arrest  
authorities found a list of 32 names linking the brothers to the 
synagogue fires in Sacramento, about 150 miles south of Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the names on the list were of people connected with the  
burned synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires, set within minutes of each other on June 18, caused  
more than $1 million in damage at Congregation B'nai Israel, 
Congregation Beth Shalom and the Knesset Israel Torah Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A leaflet blaming the ``International Jew World Order'' for the  
war in Kosovo was left behind at one of the synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson, 50, and Mowder, 40, were found shot in their bed on July  
1 in Happy Valley, just outside Redding.

<HEADLINE> Image Everything in Maligned Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For Tim Watkins, the image of Watts as a  
blighted neighborhood is sometimes just as stubborn a foe as the 
crime and unemployment he confronts as youth director of local 
social service agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As President Clinton's visit this past week refocuses the  
nation's attention on communities such as Watts, Watkins hopes 
Americans get a glimpse of the good as well as the bad. 
</P>
<P>
	That is crucial for Watkins and others who are trying to spur  
commerce in such areas. Businesses that can bring jobs and 
investment to a community often are frightened away by the 
inner-city image of gangs, violence and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point came only Wednesday, when a TV news crew  
canceled an interview about Clinton's visit to cover a hostage 
situation a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me that's a significant indicator of what makes the news in  
Watts. It's generally negative and sensational, in that order,'' 
said Watkins, who works for the Watts Labor Community Action 
Committee. ``On the one hand it reinforces the impression that this 
is a dangerous, nasty and ugly place, and on the other hand it robs 
us of an opportunity to show people what's positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton visited South Los Angeles Thursday as part of a four-day  
national tour to promote private and public investment in 
underserved communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment in South Los Angeles has increased since the 1992  
riots, but community leaders say much more is needed if residents 
are to feel the benefits of the nation's long economic expansion. 
They hope Clinton's visit will help erase negative images and 
convince more banks and corporations that there are profitable 
markets to be tapped in inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're looking at it from afar, all you see is that  
image,'' said Shari Berenbach, executive director of the Calvert 
Foundation, a Bethesda, Md.-based nonprofit spinoff of the socially 
conscious Calvert Group mutual funds. The foundation oversees a 
separate investment fund that targets undeveloped communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Negative images that frighten investors also diminish the  
aspirations of young people growing up in poor communities, Carolyn 
Martin said as she stood across the street from Southwest College 
to catch a glimpse of Clinton as he drove by. Martin tries to raise 
expectations of youth as education coordinator for a local office 
of the Congress of Racial Equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to turn the whole mindset around,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Watts, the image is etched deep in Americans' minds. Most  
know the community as the scene of violent riots in 1965. The 
community erupted again, along with the rest of South Los Angeles, 
in 1992 after white police officers were acquitted in the 
videotaped beating of Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
	As outside businesses make contact and get to know the people in  
underdeveloped communities, good investment opportunities will 
become apparent, Berenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential market for lenders in Watts and other similar  
areas is big. Minority-owned businesses are growing at double the 
rate of all firms in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent estimate by the Chicago-based business coalition Social  
Compact places the number of minority firms at nearly 2 million 
with total sales of $205 billion. Demand for capital in the 
minority business community is estimated to be in excess of $144 
billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax incentives included in Clinton's plan might make it easier  
for both businesses and individuals to invest in communities such 
as Watts. The proposal includes a 30 percent income tax credit on 
earnings from stock or other equity interests in selected community 
development organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Such equities, Berenbach said, typically offer a return of 3  
percent or 4 percent. Under the new program, investors could add 
another 6 percent a year, spread over five years, for such 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal would allow up to $6 billion in such  
equities to be issued between 2000 and 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvert's fund, Calvert Community Investments, has sold $9.6  
million worth of these equities over the past four years. Berenbach 
believes many investors who are now reluctant to put their money in 
poor communities would be attracted to the prospect of greater 
gains through a government-sponsored program. 
</P>
<P>
	As activists in Watts and similar communities try to change the  
perceptions of investors and corporate executives, they also battle 
to keep their children and neighbors from accepting the negative 
images. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1992 riots, many people in South Los Angeles have been  
infused with a new spirit of self-reliance that is spreading, said 
John Bryant, founder of Operation Hope, a private group that works 
with banks to give inner-city residents access to loans and classes 
about financial responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	After the riots, people looked back on years of neglect and  
realized they had to depend on themselves, he said. 
</P>

	``It forced people to be innovative in the way they looked at  
their lives, they could no longer afford to be intellectually or 
spiritually lazy,'' he added. ``And once they were forced to use 
those new tools, they kind of said, 'Hey, this works.'''

<HEADLINE> Lott Copes With Narrow GOP Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After days of gridlock, Majority Leader Trent  
Lott stood at his desk to announce a classic Senate deal: Democrats 
would allow swift passage of routine spending bills, as he wanted, 
in exchange for the health care debate they sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have some trust,'' the Mississippi Republican said.  
``We have to give the benefit of the doubt to the leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments seemed directed not so much at Democratic  
lawmakers, who are united enough to thwart Lott at numerous turns, 
as at his own fractious GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	And with good reason.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate rules give extraordinary power to a determined minority,  
or even to a single senator, and Lott also must contend with a 
skillful president of the opposite party. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he has been buffeted by dissent within his  
party. Government spending, foreign policy and gun control have 
brought increased unhappiness in recent months, particularly among 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP senators are ``grumbling, but I don't know that they're  
that unhappy,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. ``We're all 
grown-ups here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in his Capitol office shortly after a  
gun-control debate in which Republicans first rejected and then 
accepted new restrictions on gun-show sales, Lott brushed aside a 
question of whether his three-year tenure had hit a rough spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so at all,'' he said. Since he gained his post  
in 1996, he said, Congress has passed a balanced budget plan, a tax 
cut and overhauls of Medicare and immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to send Clinton another tax cut this year, as  
well as legislation to lock up the Social Security surplus. Lott 
also wants to narrow differences with the administration on 
spending bills and avoid year-end concessions of the type that 
infuriated many Republicans last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also has struggled with political fallout from articles  
describing a 1992 appearance before the Council of Conservative 
Citizens, an organization that has been condemned as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the controversy flared in the same time frame as  
impeachment and charged that anonymous allies of President Clinton 
were behind it. ``We have reason to believe that they had 
investigators in my state combing around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't find women problems. They couldn't find money  
problems. So the only thing they could come up with was I spoke to 
a group that has some members who espouse views that I don't agree 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott conceded, ``A lot of this is innuendo and hearsay.''  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``I don't know  
what Senator Lott is talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That issue aside, numerous Republican aides, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said GOP senators freely criticize Lott in 
private. They complain he does not attack the Democrats 
aggressively enough and does not forcefully advance a conservative 
GOP agenda. Some worry that Lott will not be strong enough in 
combating demands to lift the spending caps put in place in the 
1997 balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lott can jab Clinton -- he's holding up the president's  
nominee for the United Nations, for example -- aides say senators 
grumble he sometimes cares more about checking items off a 
legislative to-do list than with content of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency spending bill grew so costly last spring that 23 of  
the other 54 Republicans voted against it, including two other GOP 
leaders. ``I said it sucks, but we ought to pass it,'' Lott told 
reporters after a closed-door caucus where Republicans aired their 
unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
	With other Republicans demanding that ``pork barrel'' spending  
be cut out of the measure, Lott agreed to take out a $7 million 
provision he had included for a storm-damaged National Guard armory 
in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Capitol, the tensions within the GOP leadership have  
become evident in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's relationship with the No. 2 Republican senator, Don  
Nickles of Oklahoma, is not a close one. Nickles constantly presses 
Lott to deal more aggressively with the top Democrat, Sen. Tom 
Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's ties with the third-ranking Republican, Sen. Larry Craig  
of Idaho, were strained by the gun-control debate, in which Craig 
played a prominent role. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader's defenders point to the Republicans' 55-45  
edge in the Senate -- a majority but not ``a practical majority, 
because on any given thing you lose four or five votes,'' said Tom 
Korologos, a lobbyist who has studied the Senate's ways for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he said, ``there's no stable farm club'' of  
conservative Democrats willing to side regularly with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, if Daschle is able to hold together 41 Democrats, he can  
use the Senate's filibuster rules to thwart GOP legislation and win 
votes on his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case on gun control and on health care, which is  
due up in the Senate this week. Democrats are planning to force GOP 
senators to vote on several amendments with strong public support. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control caused a near meltdown in May, when Republicans were  
forced into a series of embarrassing apologies and retreats in 
lengthy floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, a White House-backed bill passed the GOP-controlled  
Senate, with Vice President Al Gore jubilantly casting a key 
tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans seethed privately that Lott had handed a  
lifeline to Gore, whose White House campaign was struggling.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- When the World Cup ended, the woman who  
essentially started it all for the United States in 1985 had to 
come out of the locker room to grab her teammates and celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers needed an IV after leaving the game because of  
heat exhaustion and a slight concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, who battles chronic fatigue syndrome and, at 33, is the  
oldest player on the U.S. squad, helped keep her team in the game 
with inspired play in the midfield for more than 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, going up for a corner kick, she banged heads with a  
Chinese player and had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	A team official said it wasn't necessary to take her to a  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers' coach and teammates said she was one of the reasons they  
won the game in the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans were treated to witnessing one of the greatest women  
athletes in history, a true champion leaving it all on the field, 
playing for her teammates,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. 
``Michelle Akers inspires me and I know she does her teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Briana Scurry, whose save in the shootout led to the  
American victory, said Akers was dominant in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time a ball went up in the air, she was finishing it  
with her head, just basically taking over the entire midfield 
singlehandedly,'' Scurry said. ``She had her bell rung and had some 
dizziness, but she wanted to stay in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers led the Americans to the title in the first Women's World  
Cup, in China in 1991, when she was the tournament's leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	She also provided a sign of things to come when she became the  
first American woman soccer player to sign a shoe endorsement deal, 
also in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG IN BRAZIL, TOO:* The success of the World Cup hasn't had an  
impact on the sport in just the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Nene said the media coverage in her country ``will be a  
great motivation for young people. They will enter more leagues and 
be inspired to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has won a record four men's World Cups, only  
recently has become a power in women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHORT SHOTS:* Among those sending good luck telegrams to the  
U.S. team was hockey star Wayne Gretzky. ... Each member of the 
1991 World Cup championship American squad were invited to the 
game, but officials weren't sure how many attended. ... Mia Hamm's 
husband, Marine captain Christian Corry, was given permission by 
the corps to return from Japan and was at the game. ... The pop 
group Hanson performed the U.S. national anthem, while China's 
anthem was sung by Lin Liu, a 24-year-old singer. ... Between the 
third-place and championship games, pop star Jennifer Lopez 
performed two songs: ``If You Had My Love,'' and ``Let's Get 
Loud.''

<HEADLINE> Nixon Had Speech if Moon Trip Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first moon landing 30 years ago went  
triumphantly right. But had it gone terribly wrong, President Nixon 
would not have been at a loss for eloquent words. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo tucked away in the National Archives contains a  
contingency speech to have been delivered if the two men who 
stepped on the moon could not get off. 
</P>
<P>
	It was written to be used if they were doomed, but not yet dead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore  
in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace,'' begins the 
speech, incorporated in a memo entitled ``In Event of Moon 
Disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It ends with the thought that people will always gaze at the  
moon knowing ``there is some corner of another world that is 
forever mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo is dated July 18, 1969, two days before the moon  
landing by Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin. 
</P>
<P>
	If disaster struck, Nixon was advised to call each of the  
``widows-to-be'' before reading the statement to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA would cut off communication with the stranded astronauts  
and a clergyman would ``adopt the same procedure as a burial at 
sea, commending their souls to 'the deepest of the deep,' 
concluding with the Lord's Prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong and Aldrin made it safely off the moon, back into  
the command module with Michael Collins, and home. The words were 
drafted by William Safire, then a Nixon speechwriter and now a 
columnist for The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Safire did not return a phone call Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	It has long been rumored that astronauts landing on the moon  
carried suicide capsules in case their return became impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apollo 11 astronauts spent more than 21 hours on the moon,  
as untold millions around the globe watched on live television 
during the 2 1/4 hours they actually spent outside the lunar module, 
on the moon's dusty surface. Collins orbited above in the command 
module. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo did not deal with what to do if disaster struck after  
Armstrong and Aldrin had joined Collins for the return voyage. It 
was geared to the moon visit watched by the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan and speech were passed on to H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's  
chief of staff, by an aide, along with drafts of statements for a 
successful flight. The aide told Haldeman: ``As for the disaster 
contingency statement, we suggest that you hang on to it personally 
to hand to the President if it becomes necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it was, Nixon had the happy duty of putting in a call to  
Armstrong and Aldrin while they stood on the moon. ``Because of 
what you have done, the heavens become a part of man's world,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires  
us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to 
Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had it been otherwise, these were the words prepared:  
</P>
<P>
	``Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore  
in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that  
there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there 
is hope for mankind in their sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most  
noble goal: the search for truth and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will  
be mourned by their nation; they will be mourned by the people of 
the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send 
two of her sons into the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to  
feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the 
brotherhood of man. 
</P>
<P>
	``In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in  
the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our 
heroes are epic men of flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's  
search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they 
will remain the foremost in our hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	``For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights  
to come will know that there is some corner of another world that 
is forever mankind.''

<HEADLINE> Journalists Urged To Think Globally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Minority journalists should take a global view in  
their coverage of the news, panelists at the Unity '99 convention 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must, in a multicultural society, learn to think  
multiculturally, not just in the boxes that we've become accustomed 
to. The global village must begin to think globally and not just 
nationally, which we're not accustomed to,'' said the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, one of the speakers at ``America's Brave New World: Heaven 
or Hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The media cannot just suck up the jet fumes of nationalist  
leaders. It must in fact try to think globally as well,'' Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 6,000 minority journalists, editors and reporters have  
been meeting here this week for the Unity '99 convention. 
</P>
<P>
	International law, human rights, self-determination, economic  
justice and consistency should become the moving forces of world 
development, ``as opposed to oil and water routes, land and 
ideology,'' said Jackson, the head of Operation Push and the 
Rainbow Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge for us as journalists is getting Americans to  
realize that the news isn't just what's happening in our back yard 
or on our front porch ... We need to make people understand that 
foreign news is not just news about the latest saga of the British 
royals,'' said Vicki Mabrey, CBS ``60 Minutes II'' correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also ``lacks knowledge of Asia and ... is  
culturally insensitive,'' said Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong 
Kong-United States Economic Cooperation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Strains in China-U.S. relations over revelations of nuclear  
spying have led to ``a racial profiling of Chinese-Americans as 
part of the China-bashing'' in Congress, said George Koo, managing 
director of International Strategic Alliances Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Chinese-Americans have been racially profiled, then all  
Asian-Americans are in the same boat,'' Koo said. ``You, ladies and 
gentlemen, can do something about this. Bring the Asian-American 
perspective into the discussion when the U.S.-China relation is 
being discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As media people, we should all remember that racial profiling  
begins at home,'' warned another panelist, Suzan Shown Harjo, 
president of Morning Star Institute, an Indian rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are in law enforcement, people who are in the FBI,  
where do they get these notions from?'' Harjo said. ``When we 
stereotype ourselves and each other in the press ... that can be 
used against us.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Station Drops Imus Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Don Imus got the boot in Bean Town.  
</P>
<P>
	Radio station WEEI-AM is dropping ``Imus in the Morning'' on  
Aug. 24, saying Friday the broadcast veteran has lost his edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used to be very fast paced and energetic. He was very  
passionate and the audience was captured by it,'' said Jason Wolfe, 
station program director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's at a point in his life where he's comfortable and  
he wants to do the show for himself. He's got a young child now, 
which has made him a softer personality. I think all of those 
factors have contributed to his ratings decline. It's not 
entertaining anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, weekdays from 6-10 a.m., had been No. 1 in the Boston  
market in 1996, but has since dropped from a 10 share to a 4.7 
share. The station has aired the show since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity Broadcasting, which owns New York's WFAN-AM, where  
Imus' show originates, expects another Boston station will pick up 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Don Imus will be on the sidelines for long in  
Boston,'' said Infinity executive David Pearlman.

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Pace Elims Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Grinfromeartoear, Sign of Success  
and longshot Blissfull Hall scored victories Saturday night in the 
legally marred eliminations for the $1 million Meadowlands Pace. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a state appeals court ordered the Meadowlands  
Racetrack to redraw the fields for the three eliminations because 
it said the track had erred in not dividing trainer Brett Pellings' 
six entrants evenly among the three races. 
</P>
<P>
	After the track tried to fix the error on Thursday, Robert  
Glazer, the owner of Peter Pan Stables, filed a complaint and the 
court sided with him. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fields redrawn, Glazer managed to get two of his three  
horses into next Saturday night's final, although his heavily 
favored The Panderosa was just nipped at the wire by Blissfull Hall 
in the third elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelling got three horses in the final, including The Panderosa  
and Grinfromeartoear. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Ron Pierce, Blissfull Hall posted the fastest winning  
time of 1.51.1. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three finishers in each elimination and the fastest  
fourth-place finisher advanced to next week's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Grinfromeartoear was never challenged in winning the first  
elimination in 1:51.3. Jack Moiseyev moved Grinfromeartoear to the 
lead around the half-mile pole and they led by more than two 
lengths at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover closed late with Pierce, finishing a  
half-length behind the winner and a half ahead of Washington VC, 
driven by George Brennan, 
</P>
<P>
	Grinfromeartoear paid $11.20, $3.60 and $2.60 in winning for the  
third time in seven starts this year for Pelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett told me he was the best,'' Moiseyev said after driving  
Grinfromeartoear for the first time. ``He was real sharp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Ouellette also made his first drive with Sign of Success a  
winning one in taking the second elimination by 2 1/2 lengths over the 
John Campbell-driven Stutzpan. New Jersey Classic winner Art's 
Conquest, Pelling's other finalist, overcame the No. 10 post to 
finish third. 
</P>
<P>
	Sign of Success, who didn't win in his first five starts this  
year, paid $13.80, $9.20 and $3.80 in capturing his third straight 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall rallied from fifth at top of the stretch to nip  
The Panderosa by a nose in the final elimination. Mystical Shark 
was third and Goliath Bayama got the final spot in next week's 
final by finishing fourth in 1:51.3. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall paid $58.80, $13.20 and $6 in winning for the  
second time in three starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $160,000 Arthur J.Cutler Memorial for trotters, the richest  
race on the card, was won easily by Kick Tail. The Berndt 
Lindstedt-driven 4-year-old covered the mile in a career-best 
1:54.1 and paid $6.40, $4.80 and $3.60.

<HEADLINE> Rapids 2, United 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jorge Dely Valdes' goal broke a tie in the  
74th minute as the Colorado Rapids beat D.C. United 2-1 Saturday 
night in a match between MLS conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes got a step on United defender Brian Kamler at the top of  
the penalty area. When Kamler offered little resistance, Valdes 
broke through and scored on a soft shot beneath goalie Tom 
Presthus. It was Valdes' seventh goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado improved to 6-3 on the road and has one more road  
victory than it did last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Conference-leading D.C. (12-7), which has lost four of  
six games, tied the game about two minutes earlier on a goal by 
A.J. Wood. Following Geoff Aunger's cross from the left side, Wood 
hit the last of a series of three headers, bouncing the ball into 
an open net to ruin Rapids goalie Ian Feuer's shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey DiGiamarino gave Colorado (12-4), which has won five of  
seven and leads the Western Conference, a 1-0 lead in the 61st 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes corralled the rebound of an errant D.C. corner kick from  
the left side and sprung DiGiamarino with a long lead pass. 
DiGiamarino sped past defender Jeff Agoos and converted a low shot 
from the top of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGiamarino's goal came about nine minutes after an apparent  
goal by D.C.'s Roy Lassiter was disallowed because Lassiter was 
ruled offsides. 
</P>
<P>
	Feuer made five saves, three of them in the second half. D.C.  
had six chances in the final five minutes, but could not come up 
with the equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which dropped its first five regular-season matches  
against United, has now won two straight over D.C.

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs Undersea U.S.-Japan Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission has  
given permission to a U.S.-Japanese consortium to build and operate 
an undersea fiber optic cable between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan-US Cable Network, or JUS, had amended its construction  
and maintenance agreement to address concerns that the undersea 
cable would have an anti-competitive effect on the industry, the 
FCC said Friday. Those amendments included a provision that grants 
each of the consortium's members, including AT&AMP;T, the right to 
provide connections between the cable and public networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also decided that the growing amount of trans-Pacific  
cable traffic outweighed any anti-competitive risks.

<HEADLINE> Trucker in Amtrak Accident Ran Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- The driver of a truck involved in an  
Amtrak derailment will be charged with failing to stop for an 
approaching train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw the train coming, but it was too late,'' Texas  
Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger said Friday. ``We 
think in essence he ran the stop sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Bubela, 21, of El Campo, Texas, also faces possible  
citations for failure to have a log book and faulty brakes, Vinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Bubela's employer, Key Energy Services of New  
Brunswick, N.J., declined comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was headed Thursday from Los Angeles to  
Orlando, Fla., when it slammed into Bubela's rig, flipping 10 of 
its 13 cars off the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty of the 235 passengers and an engineer were injured. Most  
were treated for bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no warning lights or gates at the rural crossing  
about 62 miles west of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be looking at why the accident occurred, doing  
interviews with some people, some sight-distance testing and 
checking the speed of the train,'' said Keith Holloway, a spokesman 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloway said the train's event recorder was recovered from the  
lead engine and has been sent to Washington for review by crash 
experts.

<HEADLINE> River Keen Takes Bel Air Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Charging up from the outside, River  
Keen fought a stretch-long duel with favored Barter Town to win the 
$125,000 Bel Air Handicap by a neck on Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first victory for the Irish-bred 7-year-old since  
trainer Bob Baffert claimed him last December. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chris Antley aboard, River Keen rallied on the outside  
turning for home to finish the 1 1-16 miles in 1:40 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Quake finished 5 1/2 lengths behind Barter Town for third.  
</P>
<P>
	River Keen, who carried 117 pounds, paid $16.20, $5.80 and  
$3.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Barter Town, ridden by Victor Espinoza at 113 pounds, closed at  
6-5 odds and paid $3 and $2.40. Quake, with 117-pound Laffit Pincay 
Jr. aboard, paid $4.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> 'Eyes' Stars Didn't Read Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's vision of ``Eyes  
Wide Shut'' belongs completely to late director Stanley Kubrick. 
Neither star read the book the racy new film was based on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanley didn't want us to,'' Kidman says in the August issue  
of Esquire. ``He wouldn't let us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taken from the Arthur Schnitzler novel ``Traumnovelle,''  
Kubrick's final film deals with a rich married couple exploring the 
depths of their desire, and the jealousy that arises from it. The 
movie's laborious two-year filming drew as much attention as its 
stars and director. 
</P>
<P>
	But it made perfect sense to Kidman. Asked why it took so long,  
she said, ``Because that's what Stanley spent his money on -- time. 
He didn't spend money on elaborate sets. He didn't spend it on 
special effects. He bought time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Kubrick's 13th film, was completed a week  
before the legendary director died in March at age 70.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Wet, stormy weather was scattered from the Southwest to the  
Northeast on Saturday as a cool front pushed across the nation, and 
thunderstorms also were scattered over the Gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cooler air behind the front, temperatures fell to record  
lows of 38 at Pocatello, Idaho; 46 at Rapid City, S.D.; 46 at North 
Platte, Neb., and 49 at Goodland, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Moisture streaming along the cold front helped produce showers  
and thunderstorms from Texas across the Mississippi and Ohio 
Valleys into New England. 
</P>
<P>
	During the afternoon, as the cold front pressed slowly  
southward, storms grew more numerous from central Texas to eastern 
Kentucky and across the Tennessee Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Locally heavy rain fell in central Texas, and flash flood  
warnings were posted for several counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered thunderstorms and showers also developed along much of  
the Gulf Coast, from southern Texas to the Florida Panhandle, 
becoming more numerous and expanding inland during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southwest, afternoon showers and thundershowers developed  
across parts of Arizona and New Mexico, with a few showers 
extending from Arizona into adjacent sections of southern 
California, Nevada and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few showers were possible in North Dakota and  
northern Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 35 at Stanley, Idaho, to early afternoon readings of 
95 at Salisbury, Md.; Fort Belvoir, Va., and Phoenix. The lowest 
wind chill was 22 at Malta, Idaho, and the highest heat index by 
early afternoon was 121 at Salisbury, Md.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Sees The End Coming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Shortly after missing the cut at  
the U.S. Senior Open, Arnold Palmer climbed aboard his plane and 
flew back to Latrobe, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	He had plenty to think about on the way.  
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by his play in the Open, Palmer said if his game did  
not come around, he would not be playing in many more tournaments. 
One of the best ever to grace a golf course can see the end coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible, the last two days,'' Palmer said Friday. ``I  
don't know that I will play much more competition like this. I may 
play a few tournaments, a Masters or something like that. But 
unless I start hitting it a lot better in Latrobe, I am not going 
to take it anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never used the word `retire' and even named some  
tournaments in which he planned to play, Palmer noted, ``Well, I 
guess everything has to come to an end somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most popular golfer in history, Palmer couldn't  
break 80 in the Open, shooting rounds of 81 and 84. Friday's 84, 
which included a two-stroke penalty for an illegal putting stance 
as he was tapping in on No. 18, was his worst score ever in the 
Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he didn't make the cut was 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have some commitments this year which I will finish, some  
events that I have committed to, but other than that, that is about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who turns 70 on Sept. 10, said he'll play in a seniors  
tournament in Boston in August and probably will play in next 
year's Senior Open at Saucon Valley in his home state of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be here. I am not happy about the way I  
played,'' Palmer said. ``But I am not saying I am not going to play 
again, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has four Masters championships and two British Open  
titles among his 92 victories worldwide. His last victory on the 
senior tour came in 1988, but he remains one of the game's most 
enduring figures -- a fact that was evident in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge crowds followed Palmer during his rounds at the Des Moines  
Golf and Country Club and applauded his every step. At times, it 
seemed as if he spent more time tipping his cap than wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy playing golf and I will probably never give up  
playing,'' Palmer said. ``So that tells you the answer to that. I 
have always said when I can't enjoy playing out here and having the 
competition as a part of my existence, then I will discontinue the 
competition and play at home with my foursome.''

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Wins at Oceanport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Super filly Silverbulletday took the lead  
at the top of the stretch and romped to a five-length victory 
against three rivals in the $250,000 Monmouth Breeders' Cup Oaks on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was Silverbulletday's first since finishing seventh in  
the Belmont Stakes against males, and this one was really no 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Jerry Bailey let Silverbulletday get comfortable for the  
first half mile, challenged pacesetter Bag Lady Jane on the final 
turn and then drew off in the stretch to the cheers of the crowd of 
12,402 at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday covered the mile and a sixteenth for 3-year-olds  
in a leisurely 1:43 in winning for the sixth time in seven starts 
this year and for the 12th time in 14 career outings. The 
3-year-old daughter of Silver Deputy paid $2.10 and earned $150,000 
for owner Michael Pegram. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no place or show wagering. Of the $157,535 in the win  
pool at the track, $123,995 was bet on Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly has earned $1.25 million this year, pushing her career  
total to $2.36 million. It was her ninth graded stakes win and it 
also gave trainer Bob Baffert his first win ever in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Boom Town Girl closed in the stretch under Tommy Turner to edge  
Bag Lady Jane by a length for second. Chatter Patter was a distant 
fourth, another 12 1/4 lengths farther back. West's Secret was an 
early scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Aaron Gryder put Bag Lady Jane on the lead from the  
inside post and the Canadian-bred filly led the small field through 
the opening half mile in 47.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Silverbulletday started from the outside No. 4 and  
they went four wide into the first turn. Silverbulletday moved into 
second early in the backstretch and then waited to make her move. 
</P>
<P>
	The ease of the race was nothing like Silverbulletday's race in  
the Belmont when her eight-race winning streak was snapped. The 
filly was on the lead early with Kentucky Derby and Preakness 
winner Charismatic challenging all the way.

<HEADLINE> U.N. To Mark World Population Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is using this year's  
World Population Day to draw attention to the challenges the world 
faces as the earth's population passes the 6 billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Population Fund is urging governments, schools,  
foundations and organizations to use Sunday's commemoration to 
build awareness for the Day of 6 Billion, which will be marked Oct. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reaching 6 billion marks a success,'' said the population  
fund's executive director, Nafis Sadik. ``People today live longer 
and healthier lives than any generation in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6 billion mark will also be a challenge, particularly  
for the billion people between ages 15 and 24 who must have the 
choice to determine the size of their families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their decisions will also help determine how they live -- in  
poverty or prosperity; on a green and healthy planet or in a world 
devastated by human activities,'' she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	World population growth has slowed, but the globe is still  
crowded by 78 million more people every year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NYC Mayor Koch Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Former New York mayor Ed Koch walked out of a  
hospital smiling Saturday, more than a week after suffering a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never going to retire. I'm very proud of my career and I  
want to continue adding to it,'' Koch said. ``I'm happy to be going 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koch suffered the heart attack on July 1. During his hospital  
stay, he underwent two angioplasties, a procedure in which doctors 
place a balloon-tipped catheter in a clogged artery and inflate it 
to remove blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	The former mayor also received a new pacemaker during his stay.  
He got his first pacemaker after a minor stroke in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch said he plans to resume his daily workouts in about four  
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Body of Cuban Migrant Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. Coast Guard crews on Saturday found the body  
of a migrant Cuban woman who disappeared after a boat collided with 
a Coast Guard cutter and sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Her body was found about 45 miles north of the spot where a  
motorized 25-foot wooden boat carrying 12 Cubans collided with the 
cutter at about 11 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were rescued.  
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard ships and helicopters searched for the woman in a  
600-mile area in the waters off Florida. Officials would not 
comment on her cause of death until an autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans' boat was attempting to cut across the bow of the  
cutter 10 miles east of Hillsboro Inlet, which is about 36 miles 
north of Miami. The collision sank the boat in six minutes, said 
Jeff Murphy, a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, foreigners who reach U.S. shores are allowed  
to seek asylum, but those intercepted at sea are returned to their 
homeland or another country. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescued Cubans were moved to another Coast Guard cutter and  
transported to Freeport, Bahamas. From there, they were to be taken 
to the U.S. Naval Base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay, where they will be 
interviewed and repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, this is the direct responsibility of Fidel Castro  
whose 40 year dictatorial grip over the Cuban people causes them to 
throw themselves to the sea in search of the freedom we take for 
granted,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash comes amid tension between Cuban exiles in Miami and  
the Coast Guard in the wake of an incident June 29, when eight 
Coast Guardsmen used pepper spray and fire hoses on six Cubans 
trying to make it to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Live television broadcasts of the incident enraged many of  
Miami's Cuban community, who protested the Coast Guard's actions by 
blocking traffic on two major roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Coast Guardsmen were removed this week from law  
enforcement duty pending an internal investigation.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THIONVILLE, France (AP) -- A look at Saturday's seventh stage of  
the 86th Tour de France: 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE: A 142 mile ride that began at Avesnes-sur-Helpe, near the  
Belgian border, to Thionville, next to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE WINNER: Italy's Mario Cipollini, riding for the Saeco  
team, won his fourth straight stage, edging out his rivals in a 
time of 5 hours, 26 minutes 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW OTHERS FARED: Australia's Stuart O'Grady finished second and  
Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia was third. Saturday's stage was marked by 
a long breakaway by Frenchmen Jacky Durand and Lylian Lebreton, who 
were caught by the pack with 2.5 miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
	OVERALL STANDINGS: Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu did well enough to  
retain the yellow jersey. Cipollini remained in second place, 14 
seconds behind the leader. O'Grady moved into third place, 34 
seconds back. American Lance Armstrong edged up to fifth place, 54 
seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	TOUR TIDBITS: Cipollini made cycling history by becoming the  
first rider since 1930 to win four consecutive Tour de France 
stages. He broke the record held by Frenchmen Charles Pelissier, 
who won the last four stages of the Tour 69 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``Winning four consecutive Tour de France  
stages doesn't seem real,'' Cipollini said. 
</P>
<P>
	NEXT STAGE: Sunday, a crucial 35-mile time trial in the city of  
Metz.

<HEADLINE> British Open Returns to Carnoustie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Tiger Woods and David Duval have  
heard reports of tall grass, narrow fairways and wicked weather. 
Their own experience only affirms what seems to be a unified 
opinion about this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to Carnoustie Golf Links, Pinehurst No. 2 could be a  
piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart was the only player who beat par in the U.S. Open  
on the domed greens of North Carolina. Four weeks later and an 
ocean away, it's time to take a deep breath and get ready for what 
could easily become the toughest test of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the weather conditions are like they can be, it might make  
Pinehurst look easy,'' Duval said. ``Those fairways tend to be 
narrower than Pinehurst's were. You've got this grass that is 7 
feet tall everywhere, and wind and rain and ... it could be very, 
very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its 128th edition, the British Open travels to Carnoustie  
this week for only the sixth time and the first since 1975, when 
young Tom Watson surged ahead of Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller 
and then beat Jack Newton in an 18-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite sure what to expect, because the top players in  
the world were still in high school when Watson won the first of 
his five claret jugs. Woods wasn't even born. 
</P>
<P>
	So why all the concern?  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, Duval and Ernie Els are among those who know Carnoustie  
from when the old Scottish Open was played there in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I played the 17th,'' Woods said. ``One day, I  
hit a driver off the tee, then a driver off the fairway and the 
ball barely rolled onto the green. The next day, I hit a 5-iron off 
the tee and a 5-iron off the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say it's a very interesting golf course.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus called Carnoustie the toughest course he has played  
anywhere in the world. So did Gary Player, who beat Nicklaus by two 
strokes in the 1968 Open. So does just about anyone who has 
experienced Carnoustie in all of its horrific splendor -- the Barry 
Burn that winds its way through the brutally long closing holes, 
native grasses that grow waist-high and the blasts of wind off the 
North Sea, always the best defense in links golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The course plays 7,361 yards to a par 71. The final four holes  
measure 1,688 yards -- none a par-5, one of them a 250-yard par-3 
that Nicklaus reached with a driver in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Els played the Scottish Open in 1996, the year Ian Woosnam won  
at 1-over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't too much rough then,'' Els said. ``I hear news  
from over there that if they play it now and the wind blows, 300 
might be the winning score. It's the toughest links you will ever 
find anywhere in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, for one, is up to the challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	He returned to his roost as No. 1 in the world ranking with some  
of the best golf of his young career. Woods' four-stroke victory in 
the Western Open was the third in his last four tournaments -- he 
also beat a world-class field in Germany, then won the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The exception was the U.S. Open. Woods has gone nine majors  
since winning the 1997 Masters with a record score, by a record 
margin, and setting off expectations that he might eventually 
topple Nicklaus' record of 18 majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he finished only two strokes back of Stewart at  
Pinehurst. A year ago at Royal Birkdale, a thrilling birdie-birdie 
finish left him only one stroke out of the playoff between champion 
Mark O'Meara and Brian Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	His game has been retooled, including a more shallow swing plane  
for better control. The distance is just as great. The confidence 
never has been higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really pleased at the way I'm scoring in the wind,'' he  
said. ``And obviously, on Carnoustie it's not going to be calm. To 
play as well as I have in the wind really does make you feel pretty 
good. I think I'm going there on a positive note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same holds true for Duval, even though he has flirted with  
sensational comebacks in the two majors this year but has failed to 
hold it together. He was within one stroke of the lead at Augusta 
on Sunday until a double bogey on No. 11. He was tied for the lead 
at Pinehurst until playing four holes in 4-over. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last chance for Woods and Duval to go head-to-head  
in a major before their made-for-TV meeting in California on Aug. 
2. As much patience, precision and sheer ability that Carnoustie 
requires, it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Carnoustie is a type of course that can have an effect  
like Pinehurst did, where it seems like a lot of the top players 
are going to be at the top late in the event because it's going to 
demand very, very good play,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by an American would be the fifth in a row, the  
longest streak in 69 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Els might be a good candidate to interrupt that trend. He has  
been strangely silent since beating both Woods and Duval down the 
stretch in Los Angeles, but has all the qualities to handle 
whatever Carnoustie offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing links golf. I have had some good results on  
links golf courses,'' Els said. ``I have put a lot of working into 
my game, so maybe it will come off then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest threat of all could be the newest star in golf --  
19-year-old Sergio Garcia, who won the Irish Open in only his sixth 
start as a professional, then started off at Loch Lomond with a 
first-round 62. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them could be in for the fight of their lives.  
</P>
<P>
	The third major of the year will again present something  
different. The Masters had rough. The U.S. Open didn't, instead 
requiring a supreme short game around the shaved, domed greens 
created by Donald Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the elements of links golf are at Carnoustie -- the wind  
and weather, the heather and gorse, the punishing pot bunkers. But 
no one, except for Watson and a few past champions in the field 
like Player and Tony Jacklin, has seen Carnoustie as an Open venue. 
</P>
<P>
	After the '75 Open, a poor economy sent Carnoustie into a state  
of disrepair. It lost so much stock that it was dropped from the 
Open rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	The five clubs in Carnoustie got together to form the Carnoustie  
Links Management Committee, and slowly began to restore the luster 
to what has always been regarded as the toughest test of British 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be on display this week with the claret jug on the line.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Faces Order To Recall Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Toyota and the U.S. Justice Department have  
failed to reach a settlement over allegedly faulty 
pollution-control computers on 2.2 million of the company's cars, 
possibly setting the stage for a massive recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department was expected to seek a court order in  
Washington, D.C., on Monday to force Toyota to fix or replace the 
computers, which could cost the automaker up to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Sales USA, Toyota's U.S. subsidiary based in  
Torrance, Calif., vowed to fight such a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disheartening,'' Toyota spokesman Joe Tetherow said. ``We  
tried to settle, but our reasonable offers were all rejected. Now 
we will go the distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Sales USA turned down a final settlement offer by  
the Justice Department late Thursday that would have avoided the 
recall but cost the company at least $100 million in fines, USA 
Today reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time an automaker had rejected a federal  
settlement involving emissions systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate centers around Toyota's emissions-control  
computers, which federal and state pollution officials say don't 
detect gas vapor leaks and fail to activate ``check engine'' lights 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement talks, which took place over the past several  
months, covered Toyota and Lexus cars and trucks built from 1996 to 
1998.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Honor Glide took the lead entering the stretch  
and prevailed in a driving finish to register a one-half length 
victory in the 42nd running of the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap 
for horses 3 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jose Santos, Honor Glide covered 1 3/8 miles of turf in

victory in two starts this year for the 5-year-old by Honor Grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Parade Ground came from far back to finish second in the field  
of six. It was a half-length more to Federal Trial, who was 
disqualified from third to fourth for interfering with Fahris in 
the stretch. Fahris was placed third in the official order of 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Honor Glide returned $20.40, $8.40 and $6.40. Parade Ground paid  
$4.20 and $3.30 and Fahris was worth $5.80.

<HEADLINE> Lott Copes With Narrow GOP Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After days of gridlock, Majority Leader Trent  
Lott stood at his desk to announce a classic Senate deal: Democrats 
would allow swift passage of routine spending bills, as he wanted, 
in exchange for the health care debate they sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have some trust,'' the Mississippi Republican said.  
``We have to give the benefit of the doubt to the leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments seemed directed not so much at Democratic  
lawmakers, who are united enough to thwart Lott at numerous turns, 
as at his own fractious GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	And with good reason.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate rules give extraordinary power to a determined minority,  
or even to a single senator, and Lott also must contend with a 
skillful president of the opposite party. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he has been buffeted by dissent within his  
party. Government spending, foreign policy and gun control have 
brought increased unhappiness in recent months, particularly among 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP senators are ``grumbling, but I don't know that they're  
that unhappy,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. ``We're all 
grown-ups here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in his Capitol office shortly after a  
gun-control debate in which Republicans first rejected and then 
accepted new restrictions on gun-show sales, Lott brushed aside a 
question of whether his three-year tenure had hit a rough spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so at all,'' he said. Since he gained his post  
in 1996, he said, Congress has passed a balanced budget plan, a tax 
cut and overhauls of Medicare and immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to send Clinton another tax cut this year, as  
well as legislation to lock up the Social Security surplus. Lott 
also wants to narrow differences with the administration on 
spending bills and avoid year-end concessions of the type that 
infuriated many Republicans last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also has struggled with political fallout from articles  
describing a 1992 appearance before the Council of Conservative 
Citizens, an organization that has been condemned as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the controversy flared in the same time frame as  
impeachment and charged that anonymous allies of President Clinton 
were behind it. ``We have reason to believe that they had 
investigators in my state combing around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't find women problems. They couldn't find money  
problems. So the only thing they could come up with was I spoke to 
a group that has some members who espouse views that I don't agree 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott conceded, ``A lot of this is innuendo and hearsay.''  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``I don't know  
what Senator Lott is talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That issue aside, numerous Republican aides, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said GOP senators freely criticize Lott in 
private. They complain he does not attack the Democrats 
aggressively enough and does not forcefully advance a conservative 
GOP agenda. Some worry that Lott will not be strong enough in 
combating demands to lift the spending caps put in place in the 
1997 balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lott can jab Clinton -- he's holding up the president's  
nominee for the United Nations, for example -- aides say senators 
grumble he sometimes cares more about checking items off a 
legislative to-do list than with content of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency spending bill grew so costly last spring that 23 of  
the other 54 Republicans voted against it, including two other GOP 
leaders. ``I said it sucks, but we ought to pass it,'' Lott told 
reporters after a closed-door caucus where Republicans aired their 
unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
	With other Republicans demanding that ``pork barrel'' spending  
be cut out of the measure, Lott agreed to take out a $7 million 
provision he had included for a storm-damaged National Guard armory 
in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Capitol, the tensions within the GOP leadership have  
become evident in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's relationship with the No. 2 Republican senator, Don  
Nickles of Oklahoma, is not a close one. Nickles constantly presses 
Lott to deal more aggressively with the top Democrat, Sen. Tom 
Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's ties with the third-ranking Republican, Sen. Larry Craig  
of Idaho, were strained by the gun-control debate, in which Craig 
played a prominent role. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader's defenders point to the Republicans' 55-45  
edge in the Senate -- a majority but not ``a practical majority, 
because on any given thing you lose four or five votes,'' said Tom 
Korologos, a lobbyist who has studied the Senate's ways for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he said, ``there's no stable farm club'' of  
conservative Democrats willing to side regularly with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, if Daschle is able to hold together 41 Democrats, he can  
use the Senate's filibuster rules to thwart GOP legislation and win 
votes on his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case on gun control and on health care, which is  
due up in the Senate this week. Democrats are planning to force GOP 
senators to vote on several amendments with strong public support. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control caused a near meltdown in May, when Republicans were  
forced into a series of embarrassing apologies and retreats in 
lengthy floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, a White House-backed bill passed the GOP-controlled  
Senate, with Vice President Al Gore jubilantly casting a key 
tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans seethed privately that Lott had handed a  
lifeline to Gore, whose White House campaign was struggling.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Protest Low Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWEETGRASS, Mont. (AP) -- Farmers and ranchers in Montana and  
North Dakota held rallies aimed at getting the federal government 
to do something about low livestock and grain prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 900 farmers joined the protest here on the Canadian border  
Friday, while another 120 rallied in Portal, N.D., also on the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters claim large corporations have created monopolies  
in agribusiness that have depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The rallies were held at the sites of past protests against  
Canadian exports. Farm groups contend Canada has been dumping 
illegally subsidized agricultural products into the United States 
and forcing prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dena Hoff, a Montana rancher and chairwoman of the Family Farm  
Coalition's' trade task force, said the protesters don't blame 
Canadian farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't let agribusiness divide farmers to make us forget  
that corporate manipulation destroys the family farm economy in 
both countries,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several speakers accused the Justice Department of failing to  
attack what they say is unfair competition in their markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a grain cartel out there is what we've got, and it's  
hard for individual farmers to sell into that kind of a market,'' 
said farmer Helen Waller.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys QB Aikman Gets Engaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has become  
engaged to a former employee of the team's public relations 
department, according to The Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported in its Saturday editions that Aikman and  
Rhonda Worthey had been dating for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthey was wearing a large diamond ring when the couple  
returned from a California vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	No wedding date has been set, but it will be after the NFL  
season ends in January, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to the Dallas Cowboys, Aikman agent Leigh  
Steinberg and Aikman Enterprises were not returned to The 
Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met at Valley Ranch, where Worthey worked until she  
resigned several months ago to devote fulltime to her 9-year-old 
daughter, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, 32, has never been married. Worthey is 30.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: F1 Linked To Drug Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Customs officials are looking into allegations of  
a link between Formula One motor racing and cocaine smuggling amid 
accusations that Grand Prix cars may have been used to conceal 
drugs as they are transported around the world, the Sunday Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting mostly unidentified police detectives and customs  
sources, the newspaper said customs officers were tipped off by an 
informant from the motor racing world 18 months ago and recently 
began monitoring the movement of Formula One personnel and 
equipment through the British port of Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came on the day of the British Grand Prix at  
Silverstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone declined to comment, the  
newspaper said, but an unidentified aid of Ecclestone was quoted as 
saying: ``He did not have any knowledge or evidence that 
individuals within F1 were doing anything of the sort. If he had 
information or evidence he would have taken it to the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that an earlier investigation by Scotland  
Yard into whether racing cars and their containers were being used 
as a cover for cocaine smuggling between South America and Europe 
was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan MacLaughlin, a former drugs squad detective in charge of  
the investigation, was quoted in the paper as saying the informers 
in the motor racing world had alleged that Formula One was being 
used as a front for cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the investigation, which ended in 1997, was  
looking into allegations that drugs were being stashed in car parts 
and equipment and loaded into containers before being transported 
from South America to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said MacLaughlin said Ecclestone telephoned him in  
November 1997 to offer full cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives had planned to ask former Formula One champion Nigel  
Mansell to help in a sting operation, the newspaper said. Mansell 
declined to comment to a reporter, the paper added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said a Formula One insider, who was not  
identified, said he had been interviewed by police investigating 
the claims. The paper also quoted another unidentified man as 
saying he believed he was the target of a police sting operation.

<HEADLINE> Dole Urges Bulletproof Vests Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth  
Dole called on Congress Saturday to double a $25 million grant 
program to help buy more bulletproof vests for police. 
</P>
<P>
	``As some of our government institutions have been tarnished in  
recent years, Americans have continued to retain high levels of 
support for our law enforcement community,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``And 
with good cause. They have maintained high standards of 
professionalism and have led the way as crime rates have been 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole on Saturday crisscrossed South Carolina with several  
quick stops to talk about the program and to greet supporters who 
wanted autographs and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Ketcham of Columbia brought her six children to meet her  
favorite candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with her being a real person,'' Ketcham  
said. ``She's down on our level. She understands what it's like to 
serve other human beings rather than her own interests and needs. I 
think a lot of politicians get lost in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary is considered an important  
early barometer for how candidates are likely to do in the 
conservative South. It follows Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Mrs. Dole issued a statement congratulating  
the U.S. women's soccer team for ``a job well done'' in winning the 
World Cup. She said the women ``have become America's team.''

<HEADLINE> Coach: China Still the Better Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- China's coach, Ma Yuanan, conceded  
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the American team is the winner, I still think the  
Chinese team is the best in the world,'' he said after the United 
States beat his charges 5-4 in a shootout following an 0-0 tie for 
the Women's World Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of the teams had great performances. The American team  
was luckier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the United States in two of their last three  
meetings, China couldn't do it Saturday when it counted most. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Sun Wen, the tournament's leading scorer with seven  
goals but who failed to connect until the shootout, agreed with her 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give congratulations to the American team,'' said Sun, who,  
like Ma, spoke through an interpreter. ``The American team was more 
lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, Ma said, it got a huge assist from the record crowd of  
90,185 howling, cheering fans -- President Clinton included -- at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The many fans here wanted the American team to win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the two best teams in the tournament -- China outscored  
opponents 19-2 and the United States had an 18-3 margin -- these 
teams have created quite a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat the Chinese 2-1 for the 1996 Olympics gold  
medal and 2-0 for the '98 Goodwill Games crown. China had won two 
of three this year, including the championship of the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big one went to the Americans, and the series now stands  
12-5-5 for the United States, which also won the first World Cup in 
China in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give China's team credit,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``I  
hope everyone recognizes how much they contributed to the success 
of this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China went first in the shootout and Xie Huilin hit the left  
corner of the net. U.S. co-captain Carla Overbeck matched the goal 
to a huge cheer from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qiu Haiyan barely got the ball past the outstretched hands of  
diving goalkeeper Briana Scurry, and U.S. teammate Joy Fawcett made 
no mistake with her shot for 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ying's shot was in the middle of the net and Scurry got her  
hands on it to send it wide. Kristine Lilly then almost 
nonchalantly put hers in. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Ouying beat Scurry, but Mia Hamm scored. That brought on  
Sun, who put her shot to the left of Scurry for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Brandi Chastain, who made it 5-4, and then came the  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory almost belonged to the Chinese in the 100th minute.  
</P>
<P>
	A header by Fan Yunjie was headed off the goal line by Kristine  
Lilly with Scurry beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	China's brilliant midfielder, Yan Jin, created several chances  
in the extra periods, when China had a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's all they were. Chances.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Police Chief's Sons Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- Two police officers -- both sons of the  
local police chief -- face brutality charges over the beating of a 
man they arrested and allegedly took in handcuffs to a remote 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	The patrolmen, Rolando Jr. and Daniel Bolanos, surrendered  
Friday. They were accused of beating Yoel Pacheco in November after 
taking him to the lot near the Hialeah Park racetrack, and then 
trying to cover it up with false police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Bolanos, 22, was charged with three felony counts of  
official misconduct and one misdemeanor count of battery. His 
26-year-old brother faces one fewer misconduct charge. The felony 
charges carry possible five-year prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Raul Martinez reassigned them to desk duty, saying he did  
not condone any abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to understand they can feel safe,'' Martinez said.  
</P>
<P>
	What triggered the beating remains under dispute. Pacheco was  
trying to mediate a domestic dispute the officers were called to 
handle. On an arrest form, Rolando Bolanos Jr. wrote that Pacheco 
started a scuffle and threatened the brothers at police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacheco was charged with obstruction of justice and resisting  
arrest. After his complaint surfaced, eight other people came 
forward with similar complaints against one or both brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors examined police reports and personnel records and  
looked into allegations that the police chief gave his sons special 
privileges, including ignoring complaints against them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton joined thousands of  
soccer-crazed fans watching the United States defeat China in 
Saturday's finals of the women's World Cup, proclaiming it an 
``amazing'' day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most exciting sports event I have ever seen,''  
Clinton told the U.S. women's team in their locker room after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting yellow championship T-shirts, the players jumped up and  
down and chanted ``U.S.A'' as they posed for pictures with actors 
Arsenio Hall and Edward James Olmos before Clinton arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the women their winning performance in the  
double-overtime, penalty-kick shootout match was a lesson in 
``courage and endurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing day,'' Clinton said. ``We learned a lot  
today about soccer and about women athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by California Gov. Gray Davis, political  
adviser James Carville, brother Roger Clinton and his family, 
Hollywood producers and Arkansas friends Harry Thomason and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason and Christian Correy, the husband of American 
player Mia Hamm. Correy is a Marine based near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton greeted the Chinese team in their locker room.  
The players there crowded around him with their cameras and video 
recorders and lingered to have their pictures snapped with the 
president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to say to the whole team how much we admired your  
performance in the whole World Cup,'' Clinton told the Chinese team 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	As White House staffers began to herd the press away, Clinton  
outshouted them to call photographers back for one pose with the 
entire Chinese squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters later he had told the Chinese, ``We were  
very honored to have them in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ended a cross-country poverty tour on Thursday,  
but decided to remain on the West Coast for the championship game 
at the Rose Bowl. He headed back to the White House after the game, 
scheduling a post-midnight arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players invited the president to attend after Clinton,  
his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea saw a quarterfinal game last 
week outside Washington as the Americans defeated Germany to 
advance to the semifinals. The U.S. women later beat Brazil to move 
to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the first lady nor Chelsea attended Saturday's game.  
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tension of the championship game was a chilling of  
the diplomatic relationship between Washington and Beijing after 
NATO mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during 
allied airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, conspiracy theories surrounding the embassy bombing --  
which Beijing has refused to accept was a mistake -- have spilled 
over into the sporting arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Government-run media raised doubts about the evenhandedness of  
the referees for the championship game, saying officials in 
previous contests between the teams favored the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They also suggested U.S. organizers of the World Cup  
deliberately made the Chinese women trek back and forth across 
America and its four time zones in the competition's earlier 
rounds. But the U.S. women also played on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking in the game, Clinton relaxed in style in Los  
Angeles, staying in the Beverly Hills compound of supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle and golfing with actor Sylvester Stallone at a 
country club. 
</P>
<P>
	During the tour of poor areas in America, Clinton visited a  
coal-mining town in Kentucky, the Mississippi Delta and Los 
Angeles' Watts neighborhood. In South Dakota, where he toured 
dilapidated housing on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he stayed 
at the local Best Western.

<HEADLINE> Tax Repeal May Protect Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's often said that farmers are land rich but  
cash poor, which is why so many want Congress to repeal the tax on 
inheritances -- and why environmentalists say repeal could help slow 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the tax code has generous exemptions and special  
ways of valuing farmland, many farmers and ranchers are reluctant 
to spend a lot of money on lawyers and accountants for estate 
planning. It winds up costing them in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Most farm value is tied up in land and buildings. When a  
principal owner dies, some families must sell off part of their 
operations to pay federal estate taxes. If that land is close 
enough to a city, it can be subdivided into house lots or used 
commercially. Either contributes to suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a very disastrous problem,'' said Jerry Cosgrove,  
director of the northeast office of American Farmland Trust. ``If 
there hasn't been estate planning, the tax bill is unexpected 
because the land values have skyrocketed over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inheritance taxes range from 18 percent to 55 percent on estates  
up to $10 million, with everything above that taxed at 55 percent. 
The first $650,000 is exempt, doubling to $1.3 million if both 
husband and wife claim it for the same estate. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems like a lot, but Dale Moore of the National  
Cattlemen's Beef Association said even a small ranch easily can be 
worth $2 million or more. While estate planning offers protection, 
Moore said some cattle producers spend up to 10 percent of their 
gross income a year in lawyer or accountant fees and to pay for 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are not only hit with the tax when it occurs, but they're  
also hit with the year-in, year-out planning in order to protect 
against it,'' Moore said. ``For the most part, they need that money 
to put into working the operation and making it grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress are proposing a gradual phaseout of the  
estate tax that would lead to repeal in 10 years. Farm groups and 
small business owners are leading the charge for repeal of what 
they call the ``death tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear of having to sell off a lifetime's work to satisfy  
this ghoulish tax is very real among Main Street business owners, 
family farmers and ranchers,'' said Dan Danner, vice president of 
the National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea faces an uncertain future because it costs some $50  
billion and is opposed by many Democrats, who contend it primarily 
benefits the wealthy who leave huge estates. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet proponents have an unusual ally in some environmental groups  
who see repealing the tax as a way of protecting open space and 
wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bean, a wildlife specialist at the Environmental Defense  
Fund, said in a recent magazine article that the estate tax is 
``highly regressive in the sense that it encourages the destruction 
of ecologically important land in private ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Yokel, president emeritus of the Florida Audubon  
Society, put it this way: ``Wildlife is clearly an asset. But the 
farmer, and businessman, will not put himself out of business to 
protect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short of estate tax repeal, Cosgrove of American Farmland Trust  
said Congress could protect farmland with other tax changes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce or defer capital gains taxes on transfers of land that  
will stay in agricultural production. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide estate tax relief or increase other tax incentives if  
land remains a farm through the generations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eliminate capital gains taxes when a local government or other  
entity purchases conservation easements or deed restrictions aimed 
at keeping land from development.

<HEADLINE> Athletes a Superstitious Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Big league players superstitious?  
</P>
<P>
	Nah.  
</P>
<P>
	Just make sure not to step on the foul line coming into the  
dugout. And don't forget to touch first base on the way to the 
outfield. And wear the same clothes when the team is on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Locker Room Mojo,'' a new book, is an examination of the  
curses that athletes swear surround them and the cures applied to 
foil those forces of darkness and evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of players believe there is evidence that more than  
simple skills are involved in winning and losing ball games. So 
they seek recourse -- maybe a rabbit's foot, maybe a lucky penny, 
maybe something more drastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The placebo effect, the power of belief, is strong in  
everything,'' said co-author Nick Newton, who admitted he had a 
ritualistic way of taping his stick when he played hockey. ``I 
believe a lot of athletes focus on stuff to alleviate the anxiety 
of things they can't control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is the games are hard enough without tempting fate.  
So when you find a lucky charm, hang on to it. That's what John 
McGraw did. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw, the tough-guy manager of the New York Giants in the  
early part of the century, played no-holds-barred baseball. Once, 
when he was stationed at third base for the Baltimore Orioles, he 
employed a bit of defensive ingenuity by belting an unsuspecting 
base-runner in the jaw as the poor fellow rounded the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as tough as he was, McGraw would not defy the fates. He  
would pick up hairpins and pennies -- face up, only -- that he came 
across in his travels. Once he contracted with a local brewery to 
send a horse-drawn beer wagon with empty barrels past the Polo 
Grounds for 10 days because the first day it happened, one of his 
players collected a hatful of hits and the manager thought there 
might be a connection. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Charlie Faust, a farmer, approached McGraw in a St.  
Louis hotel lobby in 1911 and announced that a fortune teller had 
predicted greatness for him as a pitcher with the Giants, the 
manager arranged a tryout. Hey, as lottery players like to say, you 
never know. 
</P>
<P>
	Faust was awful and McGraw dumped him, but only temporarily. A  
resourceful fellow, the pitcher made his way to New York to pursue 
his destiny. His arrival coincided with a Giants winning streak and 
McGraw, taking no chances with destiny, had him fitted for a 
uniform. He even let Ol' Charlie pitch in a couple of games, 
throwing two uneventful innings in which he surrendered two hits 
and two runs and earned a place in the Baseball Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Faust hung around with players like Christy Mathewson and Rube  
Marquard, and the Giants won three consecutive pennants. A 
coincidence? Perhaps. The fact is, however, that in 1914, when the 
pitcher left the team to pursue other interests, New York finished 
in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Faust died in an asylum and the Giants didn't win  
the pennant again until 1917. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs learned a long time ago how powerful curses can  
be when they are administered in anger. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cubbies won the National League pennant in 1945, local  
tavern owner William Sianis decided to celebrate the event by 
taking his pet goat, Sonovia, to Wrigley Field for the fourth game 
of the World Series against Detroit. The Cubs, however, turned high 
and mighty on him, barring the billy goat at the turnstile. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Sianis had invested $7.20 for the goat's box  
seat. The fact is that during the regular season, Sonovia had 
accompanied his owner to Cubs games with no fuss. Sianis demanded 
an audience and explanation from team owner Phillip K. Wrigley, who 
told him that, well, frankly, the goat smelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged, Sianis cursed the Cubs, advising Wrigley that not only  
would they lose that Series but that they'd never even get into one 
again. And when Detroit prevailed, he sent Wrigley a telegram, 
saying simply, ``Who smells now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs, of course, haven't been back to the Series since then,  
despite occasional lifting of the curse by some of Sianis' less 
vindictive descendants and frequent peace overtures by the team. 
When they lost the first 12 games in 1994, the Cubs had Ernie Banks 
march another billy goat around Wrigley. Chicago won the next game 
but still finished fifth that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is,'' Newton said, ``my favorite Mojo.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves Phone Charge Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission says it  
will look into the minimum monthly charges that some long-distance 
companies tack onto the bills of consumers who make little or no 
use of their services. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4-to-1 vote on Friday, the FCC approved the inquiry, which  
will begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to be the least intrusive in terms of regulation,  
but at the same time I would like to be able to protect the 
low-volume users,'' said Yog Varma, the deputy chief of the FCC's 
Common Carrier Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge, typically $3, is tacked on to the phone bills of  
customers who subscribe to a basic-rate plan but whose 
long-distance calls total less than $3 a month. The minimum fee 
does not affect customers who make more than $3 in long-distance 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Two long-distance companies that impose the fee, AT&AMP;T and MCI  
WorldCom, told The Washington Post that competition forced them to 
add the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of servicing accounts have been increasing over the  
past few years, to the extent that's happening, we've instituted a 
minimum usage charge,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman for MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Varma told the Post that the minimum fees are partly the result  
of the FCC's reform of how long-distance carriers pay the local 
phone companies for using their networks. 
</P>
<P>
	While some consumers have seen their long-distance bills go  
down, the FCC said a small number of people who make few or no 
long-distance calls may have been harmed by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth voted against the FCC  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Commission's action demonstrates a refusal to accept the  
directive of Congress to refrain from intruding into competitive 
markets,'' he said in a statement. ``American consumers, not 
federal bureaucrats, can best choose whether the pricing plans 
offered by certain long-distance carriers suit their needs.''

<HEADLINE> Ball Hit By Fisk Fetches $113,273 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's outta here!  
</P>
<P>
	The ball hit by Carlton Fisk for the Game 6-winning home run of  
the 1975 World Series sold for $113,273 at a sports memorabilia 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th-inning homer, one of the most dramatic in Series  
history, is remembered for Fisk waving his arms frantically at the 
ball, as if trying to keep it in fair territory as it sailed toward 
the wall in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run gave Boston a 7-6 victory and tied the Series at  
three games apiece. Cincinnati won the series' final game the next 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's ball hit the foul pole, bounced back onto the field and  
was retrieved by Cincinnati left fielder George Foster, who had 
kept it since. Leland's, the auctioneer, declined to identify the 
buyer on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Winds Up Campaign Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used her first  
full-scale Senate campaign trip to begin establishing policy 
differences with possible Republican opponent Rudolph Giuliani as 
well as political independence from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In last week's three-day foray into traditionally Republican  
upstate New York, the first lady further staked out positions she 
figures will appeal to many New Yorkers even if they're not quite 
in line with Clinton administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in an interview in Cooperstown Thursday with 10 New York  
reporters that Mrs. Clinton began what aides expect to be a lengthy 
process of distinguishing herself from Giuliani, New York City's 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a question, suggested by a member of her  
entourage, Mrs. Clinton said she was ``committed to serving a full 
term in the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer served two purposes. It responded to Republican  
charges, from state GOP Chairman William Powers and others, that 
she wants merely to use the New York Senate seat as a stepping 
stone to run for president. It also served to set her apart from 
Giuliani, who earlier refused to take the same full-term pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked how she differs from the mayor on issues, she said  
``there will be plenty of time in the campaign to go into that,'' 
even though she had just spelled out one such difference. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome the next day, a dairy farmer asked her position on  
bringing New York into the Northeast Dairy Compact, a dairy 
farmers' cartel designed to bring them more money for their milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the dairy compact,'' she said quickly. ``From what I  
now know, it's a very important step for the dairy farmers, and, I 
would argue, over the long run for the entire population to have 
more price stability and more of fair return on investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, that seemed to put her at odds with Giuliani. His  
municipal administration has opposed the compact on the ground that 
it could mean higher prices for city consumers. On Friday, Giuliani 
was silent about his current position is on the dairy compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's support for the dairy compact also served to put  
some distance between her and President Clinton. He has been silent 
on the compact, but his administration is pushing an alternative 
not favored by northeastern dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president remains popular in New York, but some  
administration positions could hurt Mrs. Clinton as she campaigns 
for the Senate seat being vacated next year by fellow Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, New York's teaching hospitals could see less money  
under President Clinton's Medicare overhaul proposal. Their fight 
has been taken up by New York Sen. Charles Schumer, and he got Mrs. 
Clinton to join him at a recent White House meeting to press the 
hospitals' case. 
</P>
<P>
	At several points during her trip last week, Mrs. Clinton made a  
point of referring to New York's teaching hospitals as the ``crown 
jewels'' of the state's health-care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also on Thursday that a letter she had written to a New  
York Jewish leader became public. In the letter, she came out 
strongly for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and 
said she considers Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible 
capital'' of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In his campaign for the White House in 1992, Clinton also said  
Jerusalem should be recognized as Israel's capital. He did not 
follow through once in office, however, reconfirming U.S. policy 
that the city's future must be determined by Israelis and 
Palestinians in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's letter appeared designed to counter worries among  
New York Jews, a potent political force in the state, about her 
stated support for a separate Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will continue this week what she calls her  
summer-long ``listening tour'' with visits to the politically 
crucial suburbs around New York City, a region where the Senate 
race could well be decided.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Medicare Drug Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton promoted on Saturday his  
plan for making preventive medical care affordable to older 
Americans who rely on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care  
they need,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his proposal, co-payments and deductibles for preventive  
medical care such as hepatitis B vaccinations, colo-rectal and 
prostate cancer screening and diabetes management, would be 
eliminated for Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-payments would be waived for screening mammograms and pelvic  
exams. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare currently charges beneficiaries 20 percent of the cost  
of certain preventive services. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would budget about $3 billion over 10 years to make  
preventive services more affordable and to finance a public 
education campaign on the benefits of preventive care. Many 
Medicare beneficiaries do not know about all preventive care 
procedures the program covers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases  
earlier and more effectively than ever,'' Clinton said. ``And for 
millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full 
recovery and a bleak prognosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When detected early, the survival rate for prostate cancer is 99  
percent, but it plunges when caught later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many older people, who subsist on fixed incomes, can't  
afford even the co-payments and deductibles that come with 
preventive treatments. ``And that can cost lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton and congressional leaders of both parties are  
meeting on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Preventive-care proposals are a centerpiece of his package to  
``secure and modernize'' Medicare, the government's health program 
for older Americans. The other major component is an effort to help 
older Americans pay for prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans proposing new tax cuts, Clinton argued that the  
budget surplus should be spent instead on shoring up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts  
before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to 
all our families in the 21st century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's address was broadcast as he prepared to attend the  
Women's World Cup final against China at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE>  Iranians Want Hard-Liners Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- One day after a violent  
police raid on a Tehran University dormitory, thousands of 
demonstrators protested Saturday outside the school, demanding the 
resignation of powerful hard-liners in the Islamic government. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest and others that erupted Saturday around Iran were  
sharply reminiscent of scenes from the Islamic Revolution of the 
late 1970s that forced out the U.S.-backed shah and brought Islamic 
rulers to power. This time, however, the demonstrators were 
demanding democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to despotism! Death to dictators!'' protesters chanted  
in Tehran, according to witnesses who spoke on condition of 
anonymity by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Saturday, 25,000 people had gathered -- including  
students from other universities and ordinary Iranians. Their 
shouts of ``students unite'' reverberated in the night. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a demand that would at any other time have resulted in  
severe punishment, protesters shouted: ``Khamenei must quit,'' 
referring to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,  
monitored in Dubai, 1,000 university students converged in the 
northern city of Rasht. Protesters also gathered in the 
northwestern city of Tabriz, IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's protests were provoked by a violent and unauthorized  
police raid Friday on a Tehran University dormitory, apparently 
with the backing of the hard-liners. At least 20 people were 
hospitalized and 125 students were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments are the most serious in a strident power  
struggle between Khamenei's hard-line clergymen and allies of 
reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who wants to give more 
political freedom to Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cries of ``Khatami, Khatami we are behind you'' broke out when a  
senior Khatami aide arrived to speak to demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, students rushed to the Interior Ministry, not far  
from the university, and demanded to speak to moderate Deputy 
Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh. He promised that he and other senior 
ministry personnel would resign if officials behind the raid went 
unpunished, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police forces were apparently ordered to stay away to avoid a  
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Khatami presided over an emergency meeting of the  
powerful Supreme National Security Council, which issued a 
statement saying all detained students had been freed, and 
condemned officials who ordered the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident is by no means acceptable or forgivable,'' said  
a statement by the SNSC, Iran's top policy-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a committee had been formed to identify and punish  
officials who had ordered the raid and pledged to ``strongly 
confront'' vigilantes allied with the hard-liners who had attacked 
the students, reported Tehran radio, also monitored in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher Education Minister Mostafa Moin, a reformist, handed in  
his resignation Saturday to protest the raid. The assault on the 
dorm took place after 200 students demonstrated against an 
anti-press law and the banning of a reformist newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small victory for reformers, Khamenei's representative  
issued a statement Saturday saying the dorm attack ``has hurt the 
heart'' of Iran's supreme leader and other ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement ``strongly condemned'' the acts of several members  
of the police force and expressed sympathy for the injured, IRNA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But demonstrators refused to disperse even after the government  
said it would release the arrested students. 
</P>
<P>
	The police moved in before dawn Friday after hard-line activists  
began throwing stones at the student protesters. Officers entered 
the dorm without permission, assaulted the students, broke doors, 
set fire to one of the rooms and even fired gunshots, the Higher 
Education Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this bitter incident ... decencies were ignored and respect  
disregarded,'' the ministry said. It apologized to all students and 
academic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	While the demonstrators apparently have the hugely popular  
president on their side, Khatami has little power over key 
institutions like the armed forces, police, judiciary, the 
Intelligence Ministry and the radio and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	These are accountable to Khamenei, the unelected supreme leader.  
He has long been considered beyond reproach and anti-Khamenei 
slogans at the rally reflect the level of frustration among 
Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters also demanded the resignation of hard-line police  
chief Hedayat Lotfian. 
</P>
<P>
	Most protesters were students, but there were many others,  
including women and children, the witnesses said.

<HEADLINE>  Iranians Want Hard-Liners Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- One day after a violent  
police raid on a Tehran University dormitory, thousands of 
demonstrators protested Saturday outside the school, demanding the 
resignation of powerful hard-liners in the Islamic government. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest and others that erupted Saturday around Iran were  
sharply reminiscent of scenes from the Islamic Revolution of the 
late 1970s that forced out the U.S.-backed shah and brought Islamic 
rulers to power. This time, however, the demonstrators were 
demanding democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to despotism! Death to dictators!'' protesters chanted  
in Tehran, according to witnesses who spoke on condition of 
anonymity by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Saturday, 25,000 people had gathered -- including  
students from other universities and ordinary Iranians. Their 
shouts of ``students unite'' reverberated in the night. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a demand that would at any other time have resulted in  
severe punishment, protesters shouted: ``Khamenei must quit,'' 
referring to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,  
monitored in Dubai, 1,000 university students converged in the 
northern city of Rasht. Protesters also gathered in the 
northwestern city of Tabriz, IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's protests were provoked by a violent and unauthorized  
police raid Friday on a Tehran University dormitory, apparently 
with the backing of the hard-liners. At least 20 people were 
hospitalized and 125 students were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments are the most serious in a strident power  
struggle between Khamenei's hard-line clergymen and allies of 
reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who wants to give more 
political freedom to Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cries of ``Khatami, Khatami we are behind you'' broke out when a  
senior Khatami aide arrived to speak to demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, students rushed to the Interior Ministry, not far  
from the university, and demanded to speak to moderate Deputy 
Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh. He promised that he and other senior 
ministry personnel would resign if officials behind the raid went 
unpunished, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police forces were apparently ordered to stay away to avoid a  
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Khatami presided over an emergency meeting of the  
powerful Supreme National Security Council, which issued a 
statement saying all detained students had been freed, and 
condemned officials who ordered the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident is by no means acceptable or forgivable,'' said  
a statement by the SNSC, Iran's top policy-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a committee had been formed to identify and punish  
officials who had ordered the raid and pledged to ``strongly 
confront'' vigilantes allied with the hard-liners who had attacked 
the students, reported Tehran radio, also monitored in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher Education Minister Mostafa Moin, a reformist, handed in  
his resignation Saturday to protest the raid. The assault on the 
dorm took place after 200 students demonstrated against an 
anti-press law and the banning of a reformist newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small victory for reformers, Khamenei's representative  
issued a statement Saturday saying the dorm attack ``has hurt the 
heart'' of Iran's supreme leader and other ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement ``strongly condemned'' the acts of several members  
of the police force and expressed sympathy for the injured, IRNA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But demonstrators refused to disperse even after the government  
said it would release the arrested students. 
</P>
<P>
	The police moved in before dawn Friday after hard-line activists  
began throwing stones at the student protesters. Officers entered 
the dorm without permission, assaulted the students, broke doors, 
set fire to one of the rooms and even fired gunshots, the Higher 
Education Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this bitter incident ... decencies were ignored and respect  
disregarded,'' the ministry said. It apologized to all students and 
academic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	While the demonstrators apparently have the hugely popular  
president on their side, Khatami has little power over key 
institutions like the armed forces, police, judiciary, the 
Intelligence Ministry and the radio and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	These are accountable to Khamenei, the unelected supreme leader.  
He has long been considered beyond reproach and anti-Khamenei 
slogans at the rally reflect the level of frustration among 
Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters also demanded the resignation of hard-line police  
chief Hedayat Lotfian. 
</P>
<P>
	Most protesters were students, but there were many others,  
including women and children, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally blocked off large parts of Enqelab -- the Persian word  
for Revolution -- Avenue, said witnesses and journalists.

<HEADLINE> Gay, Minority Journalists Seek Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Leaders of a national gay and lesbian journalists  
group have proposed stronger ties with the country's largest 
association of minority journalists, saying the move would help 
secure fairer news coverage for all minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, leaders of the National Lesbian and  
Gay Journalists Association asked that Unity: Journalists of Color 
Inc. agree to several proposals, including joint efforts to promote 
accurate coverage of minorities and to fight workplace bias based 
on color, gender or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all going toward the same cause and that's to change the  
hearts and minds of the decision makers of this industry,'' said 
Leroy Aarons, founder of the gay journalists group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Unity board will take up the proposal in the fall,''  
Catalina Camia, Unity president, said Friday night. ``We felt it 
was not fair of NLGJA to take up the issue in the middle of the 
Unity convention. We're all very busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 6,000 minority journalists have been meeting here this  
week for the Unity '99 convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Unity includes the Asian American Journalists Association, the  
Native American Journalists Association, the National Association 
of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic 
Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Unity incorporated under the ``Journalists of Color''  
name. The gay journalists group said in a statement that Unity's 
name change discouraged ``hopes that the organization and NLGJA 
might ever merge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Louise Boothe, president of the gay journalists, estimated  
about eight percent of gay and lesbian journalists are also 
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Crew 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Henry Gutierrez set up one goal and  
scored another on a penalty kick as the Miami Fusion won 
back-to-back games for only the second time this year by beating 
the Columbus Crew 2-0 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Diego Serna scored in the 31st minute and Gutierrez converted  
his penalty kick in the 85th minute as the Fusion (6-12) moved past 
Tampa Bay into fourth place in Major League Soccer's Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (11-7) lost its second straight game and was shut out  
for the fourth time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez set a Fusion record with an assist in his fourth  
consecutive game, setting up Serna's 10th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The midfielder's pass to the top of the penalty area found  
Tyrone Marshall, who beat his defender to the corner of the box. 
Marshall crossed to Serna, who one-timed a shot past goalkeeper 
Mark Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez scored his fourth goal of the season with the penalty  
kick, coming after Ansil Elcock dragged down Welton in the penalty 
area. That gave Gutierrez 11 points in his last five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Garth Lagerwey made six saves to win his second consecutive  
start in place of the injured Jeff Cassar, who had minor knee 
surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagerwey's best stop came in the 65th minute when Robert  
Warzycha's free kick from just outside the penalty area curled 
around the wall, off Lagerwey's outstretched arms and off the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew's best scoring chances came early. Stern John shot just  
wide of the net from 15 yards out in the 15th minute. A few minutes 
later, John sent a backheel to Todd Yeagley, whose shot hit the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion also had more chances, but failed to capitalize on  
two excellent opportunities in the closing minutes of the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 42nd minute, Serna took a pass from Welton and easily  
dribbled around Dougherty to slot a dribbler toward the net. But 
Elcock raced back to clear the ball just as it approached the goal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a minute later, Marshall had only Dougherty to beat  
from 10 yards out, but his shot sailed right of the post.

<HEADLINE> Director Hall Joins Houston Faculty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Sir Peter Hall, one of the world's foremost  
theater directors, is going back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Houston School of Theatre announced Hall will  
join its faculty this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, founder of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, will take  
the Lyndall F. Wortham Performing Arts Chair left vacant by the 
February death of director Jose Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who joins three-time Pulitzer Prize-winner Edward Albee  
and Tony-winning Broadway producer Stuart Ostrow at the university, 
will teach courses on Shakespeare and directing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After nearly 50 years of directing, I would like to try to  
share what I have learned,'' Hall said in a statement issued 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a two-time Tony Award winner, directed the Royal  
Shakespeare Company until 1968 before directing the Royal National 
Theater from 1973-88. His credits also include recent years of 
directing at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the Old Vic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defeats China To Win World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The ball flew into the corner of the  
net, the World Cup was theirs -- and Brandi Chastain dropped to her 
knees and stripped. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not completely. After all, there were 90,185 fans at the  
Rose Bowl and millions elsewhere watching on television. 
</P>
<P>
	But after scoring the championship-winning goal against China on  
a penalty kick, she ripped off her jersey, swung it over her head 
and waited to be mobbed by her jubilant U.S. teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentary insanity,'' Chastain said after the Americans beat  
China 5-4 in the shootout following a 0-0 tie Saturday. ``I just 
lost my mind. I thought, my god, this is the greatest moment of my 
life on the soccer field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain's shot won the Women's World Cup for the team that  
captured America with its style and grace, and now has conquered 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hear any noise. I didn't get caught up looking at Gao  
Hong,'' Chastain said, referring to China's goalkeeper ``I just put 
it home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with Briana Scurry's one save in the shootout, it was enough  
for the U.S. team to bring home the most prestigious trophy in 
soccer before the largest crowd ever to see a women's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to stop just one and my teammates would put all  
of them in,'' said Scurry, who stopped Liu Ying on the third 
attempt in the shootout. ``I went totally on instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festive gathering that included President Clinton roared  
when she made the diving save to her left. Moments later, they 
roared even louder, their cheers reverberating off the San Gabriel 
Mountains, as Chastain won it. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, who was cut from the national squad in 1994 and had to  
work her way back onto it, posed for Gear Magazine in June with 
nothing but a strategically placed soccer ball hiding her naked 
body. This time, she revealed a black sports bra as she and her 
teammates leapt on one another in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the courage of the American team,'' U.S. coach Tony  
DiCicco said. ``They just fought and fought and fought. There are 
two champions here today, and only one is taking a trophy home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we win, it means all of America wins. They so much  
epitomize what America is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they won, the players jumped about with whatever energy  
they had left following two hours of exhausting soccer and then the 
tension-filled shootout. And after they received their championship 
medals, they jogged around the field carrying three huge American 
flags as the fans roared and chanted ``U-S-A, U-S-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cloudburst of confetti littered the field as Scurry ran to the  
stands to slap hands with fans. She then got down on both knees and 
saluted the crowd, which was chanting ``Scurry, Scurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams stood hand-in-hand for photos after sharing one of  
the most intense experiences in sports -- a shootout to decide a 
World Cup crown. Coincidentally, the men's World Cup final in 1994 
at the Rose Bowl ended in a shootout after a 0-0 tie, with Brazil 
beating Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	China shot first and Xie Huilin hit the left corner of the net.  
Co-captain Carla Overbeck matched the goal to a huge cheer from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qiu Haiyan barely got the ball past the outstretched hands of a  
diving Scurry, and Joy Fawcett made no mistake with her shot for 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu's shot was in the middle of the net and Scurry got her hands  
on it to send it wide. Kristine Lilly then almost nonchalantly put 
hers in. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Ouying beat Scurry, but Mia Hamm scored. That brought Sun  
Wen, the tournament's leading scorer, to the spot with the crowd in 
a frenzy. Sun put her shot to the left of Scurry for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Chastain.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dave Letterman told me to have her take one,'' DiCicco said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another savior was Lilly. In the 100th minute, in 90-degree  
heat, a header by Fan Yunjie was headed off the goal line by Lilly 
with Scurry beaten. The crowd sighed, then roared at Lilly's 
championship-saving play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kristine filled her role on that play,'' Chastain said. ``She  
was where she had to be and made the play she had to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another star was Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest of the  
Americans. She left the game with an injury in the final moments of 
regulation. When she played, she dominated the midfield, never 
allowing Sun to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
	China's brilliant midfielder, Yan Jin, finally got going when  
Akers left. She created several chances in the extra periods, when 
China had a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the two best teams in the tournament -- China outscored  
opponents 19-2 and the United States had an 18-3 margin -- these 
teams have created a scintillating rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat the Chinese 2-1 for the 1996 Olympics gold  
medal and 2-0 for the '98 Goodwill Games crown. China had won two 
of three this year, including the championship of the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big one went to the Americans, and the series now stands  
12-5-5 for the United States, which also won the first World Cup in 
China in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans arrived early and ready. By halftime of the third-place  
game, won by Brazil on penalty kicks, the stands were nearly 
filled. Just about everywhere youngsters with red-white-and-blue 
painted faces waved American flags. Chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A'' 
began even as Norway and Brazil were playing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American team marched onto the field, Akers jumped up  
and down like a schoolgirl as her teammates waved their arms above 
their heads and encouraged more cheering from a crowd already 
screaming its lungs out. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of sound, punctuated by a U.S. Navy F-18 fly-over at  
the conclusion of the national anthem, was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much to cheer about for most of the sloppy  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie was tested much, and the crowd's biggest reaction  
of regulation time was when the crowd booed as Clinton was shown on 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country was caught up in this, not only fans  
of soccer but young girls,'' Clinton said. ``In some ways, it's the 
biggest sporting even of the last decade. It's new and exciting for 
the United States. It will have a very far-reaching impact, not 
only for the United States, but for the world.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Testing New Air Traffic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- The future of air traffic control got a  
flight test Saturday as more than a dozen planes with 
satellite-positioning systems flew over Ohio and Kentucky while 
monitors tracked the exact location of each aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``November 40 confirms we see all the high traffic,'' said the  
pilot of a Federal Aviation Administration Boeing 727 as he flew 
26,000 feet over the Ohio River Valley. While clouds obscured the 
other planes from the eye, an airborne monitor clearly displayed 
the other test aircraft, cargo planes owned by United Parcel 
Service, FedEx and Airborne Express. 
</P>
<P>
	More accurate than radar and with a longer range than existing  
collision-avoidance systems, the ``ADS-B'' system simultaneously 
gave air traffic controllers and pilots an instant look at where 
the airplanes were and whether any were on conflicting courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both airlines and the FAA say such immediate, widespread,  
pinpoint information will be needed if they are to address 
worsening congestion in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Such knowledge will let controllers allow planes to leave the  
existing system of aerial highways that crisscross the nation and 
fly more direct routes chosen by pilots, a concept called ``free 
flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The present system requires everyone to go down the same  
tubes,'' said aviation analyst John Nance, a veteran airline pilot. 
``That limits the number of planes you can put in the sky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Phil Boyer, president of the Aircraft Owners &AMP; Pilots  
Association: ``It's about the most exciting thing and the only 
exciting thing in general aviation in the last 10 years.'' General 
aviation refers to private planes and helicopters, which also could 
use ADS-B. 
</P>
<P>
	Since cargo airlines are leading the developing of ADS-B, it  
also may address a lingering safety problem: the lack of 
collision-avoidance systems in the nation's burgeoning cargo fleet. 
Such equipment has been required in all but the smallest passenger 
planes since 1995, but cargo aircraft have been exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board has complained to the  
FAA for years. Cargo pilots renewed their demands in 1997 after a 
UPS jumbo jet flew about 1,000 feet above and three miles to the 
left of Air Force One as President Clinton flew to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 million people fly through the United States each  
year. That figure is expected to top 1 billion by 2012, raising the 
possibility of massive delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and private industry view free flight as a way to  
address the issue. But before it can take effect, a variety of 
technology must be developed or perfected. 
</P>
<P>
	One element already in place is the Global Positioning System,  
which features a constellation of satellites circling the globe. 
The system gives pinpoint position information to everything from 
nuclear missiles to wilderness campers. 
</P>
<P>
	A second critical part is a secure data link between the cockpit  
and the control tower. That will allow controllers and pilots to 
exchange messages via a type of e-mail, ensuring accurate 
transmissions and eliminating any language problems. A limited 
system will be deployed in Miami in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	A third element is the system that allows pilots, controllers  
and crews in other aircraft to know instantly the position of all 
airplanes in their area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cargo Airline Association, a trade group representing the  
nation's largest all-cargo carriers, has been working with the FAA 
and UPS Aviation Technologies on ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent 
Surveillance-Broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	ADS-B uses GPS signals to determine an airplane's speed,  
altitude and direction of travel. The information is updated 
several times a second, unlike the slower sweep of a radar scope. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is supplied to any other airplane or ground  
station in a 200-mile radius that has a similar unit, providing all 
with the same eye in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	ADS-B units also can also be placed on runways, airport  
terminals or airport vehicles, helping pilots avoid ground 
obstructions and controllers prevent runway collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skies are going to become more crowded and they're not  
making any more airspace,'' said Steve Alterman, president of the 
cargo association. ``The trick is to manage it better, and this 
tool let's us do that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Discuss China Bomb Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is sending  
officials to Beijing to discuss payments for 20 people injured and 
families of three killed in the mistaken U.S. bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Saturday that Undersecretary of State  
Thomas Pickering ``conveyed our willingness to provide a 
humanitarian payment'' when he visited Beijing last month to 
apologize for the ``awful tragedy'' of the May 7 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Department legal adviser David Andrews will head the delegation  
going to the Chinese capital this coming week, the department said. 
In addition to following up on the offer of payments, it said in a 
statement, Andrews' group will ``discuss issues related to property 
damage.''

	The administration contends a series of errors, including  
erroneous CIA maps pinpointing the embassy as a Yugoslav government 
building, led to the mistaken attack during NATO's air campaign to 
drive Yugoslav forces out of the Serbian province of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Gay Slaying Suspects Eyed in Arsons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- The investigation into arson fires at  
three Sacramento-area synagogues is focusing on two brothers 
suspected in the slayings of a gay couple, a sheriff's official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29,  
were arraigned Friday on charges of receiving stolen property, 
which prosecutors said was linked to the killings of Gary Matson 
and Winfield Scott Mowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Literature espousing white supremacist beliefs was found by  
deputies at the brothers' home outside Redding in northern 
California, said Shasta County sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson, 50, and Mowder, 40, were found shot in their bed July 1  
in their Happy Valley home about 180 miles north of San Francisco. 
Richardson said the department hopes to file murder charges against 
the brothers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said Friday that two men possibly connected to the  
synagogue fires had been arrested by Shasta deputies. It did not 
identify the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, the sheriff's department issued a statement saying  
the Williams brothers were ``the two individuals that the FBI in 
Sacramento are focusing on in their investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Nick Rossi declined to confirm the connection  
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Bee reported today that the Williamses' arrest  
led officials to discover a list of 32 names linking the siblings 
to the synagogue fires. 
</P>
<P>
	James Maddock, head of the FBI's Sacramento office, had said in  
the earlier FBI statement that the unidentified men had access to 
``substantial armament and ammunition'' and kept a list of names of 
people associated with the synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	``At present we don't know the purpose of collecting these names  
but obviously we are concerned about their safety and the public 
safety,'' he said. ``We have no evidence of any specific plan of 
any violent action against any specific individual or group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock declined to say whether the men would be charged in the  
arsons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those arrests led to additional searches which were monitored  
by this task force,'' Maddock said. ``Those searches yielded 
evidence of potential involvement in or knowledge of the arsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fires, set within minutes of each other early June 18,  
caused more than $1 million in damage at the Congregation B'nai 
Israel near downtown Sacramento, the Congregation Beth Shalom in 
suburban Carmichael and the Knesset Israel Torah Center in 
northeastern Sacramento County. 
</P>
<P>
	A leaflet blaming the ``International Jew World Order'' for the  
war in Kosovo was left behind at one of the synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center in Los Angeles, called the list of names an ominous 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``That follows a pattern of the original haters of the 20th  
century,'' he said. ``When the Nazis came to power, they took with 
them lists of names and addresses of key personnel of various 
synagogues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are examining whether the case is part of a wide  
hate-crime conspiracy and whether the Williams brothers were linked 
to the anti-Semitic World Church of the Creator, based in East 
Peoria, Ill., the Bee reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A former World Church member killed himself last weekend after  
targeting minorities in a shooting spree in Indiana and Illinois 
that left two dead and nine wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the gay couple and the Williams brothers knew each  
other, apparently crossing paths through horticulture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brothers were in the landscape business and one of the  
victims worked in a nursery at a big store and the other was a 
horticulturist at a local arboretum,'' Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Medicare Drug Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton promoted on Saturday his  
plan for making preventive medical care affordable to older 
Americans who rely on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care  
they need,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his proposal, co-payments and deductibles for preventive  
medical care such as hepatitis B vaccinations, colo-rectal and 
prostate cancer screening and diabetes management, would be 
eliminated for Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-payments would be waived for screening mammograms and pelvic  
exams. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare currently charges beneficiaries 20 percent of the cost  
of certain preventive services. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would budget about $3 billion over 10 years to make  
preventive services more affordable and to finance a public 
education campaign on the benefits of preventive care. Many 
Medicare beneficiaries do not know about all preventive care 
procedures the program covers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases  
earlier and more effectively than ever,'' Clinton said. ``And for 
millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full 
recovery and a bleak prognosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When detected early, the survival rate for prostate cancer is 99  
percent, but it plunges when caught later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many older people, who subsist on fixed incomes, can't  
afford even the co-payments and deductibles that come with 
preventive treatments. ``And that can cost lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton and congressional leaders of both parties are  
meeting on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Preventive-care proposals are a centerpiece of his package to  
``secure and modernize'' Medicare, the government's health program 
for older Americans. The other major component is an effort to help 
older Americans pay for prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans proposing new tax cuts, Clinton argued that the  
budget surplus should be spent instead on shoring up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts  
before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to 
all our families in the 21st century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's address was broadcast as he prepared to attend the  
Women's World Cup final against China at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Charged in Parking Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The fourteen men listed a smorgasbord of  
complaints -- knee and back injuries, asthma, Bell's palsy -- to 
justify requests for handicapped parking permits, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, they were arguably among the most able-bodied men on  
the UCLA campus: members of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, current and former Bruin players, won the permits by  
claiming fake injuries, investigators said Friday. They were 
charged Thursday with misdemeanors of illegally possessing the blue 
handicapped parking placards. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a maximum six months in jail and $1,000 fine.  
One person who allegedly obtained two placards was charged with 
four counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you think would less need something like this?'' said  
Maureen McCloskey of the Washington-based Paralyzed Veterans of 
America. ``What were they thinking? This is a moral outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players' applications to the state Department of Motor  
Vehicles claimed knee injuries, back injuries, back surgery, a torn 
ligament, Bell's Palsy and asthma. All of the claims were bogus, 
said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The players allegedly submitted applications with the  
signatures, addresses and medical license numbers of nonexistent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically if a doctor signs it, we accept it,'' DMV spokesman  
Evan Nossoff said. ``We do not have the medical expertise to do an 
independent evaluation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California law allows people with temporary or permanent  
disabilities to obtain permits to park in special handicap spaces, 
to use metered spaces for free and to park in limited-time zones 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The football players allegedly used the placards to avoid the  
$132-per-semester fee for parking on campus and to park in the area 
around the University of California, Los Angeles, where parking 
problems are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA said no one at the school knew about the alleged scam. The  
school begins football season Sept. 4 and several of the defendants 
are starters or key reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am embarrassed and disappointed for the young men who were  
involved in this problem,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``I have 
spoken to the team as a whole and to the individuals involved, and 
those individuals will be disciplined by me.''

<HEADLINE> Scurry Stops China's Penalty Kicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Briana Scurry charged left, grabbed the  
ball with her gloved hands and a record crowd of 90,185 fans 
roared. 
</P>
<P>
	Having given up China's first two penalty kicks, the American  
goalkeeper stopped Liu Ying with the score tied 2-2. Scurry pumped 
her arms, encouraging long, loud cheering that enveloped the Rose 
Bowl in Saturday's Women's World Cup championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kristine Lilly beat Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong to put the  
Americans ahead 3-2, a pumped-up Scurry stalked back to the goal 
line for her next challenge. She roamed left, then right before 
finally taking up her spot in the center of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry allowed two more penalty kicks before Brandi Chastain won  
the World Cup for the United States, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry ran into the stands for an embrace while her teammates  
piled on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry got a scare in the 100th minute of what was a scoreless  
tie. She fell to her knees trying to stop a header by Fan Yunjie 
that would have won the game for China. But Scurry wasn't the last 
line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly leaped up on the goal line and headed the ball  
clear, saving the game.

<HEADLINE> Three Jets Arrested in Long Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Two New York Jets football players and a  
former Jet were arrested Saturday after an altercation in a Long 
Beach bar and a scuffle with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Fabini, 24, and John ``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, both of the  
Jets, and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking 
at Bogart's Bar and Restaurant when they became rowdy around 12:30 
a.m., said Lt. Joseph Kearnes. Police were called and, after 
requesting assistance from backup officers, the three were 
arrested, Kearnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with  
Cincinnati three weeks ago, kicked out a window of a police 
cruiser, sending glass into the faces of the arresting officers, 
Kearnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with two counts of felony assault and was  
released on $50,000 bail. Elliott -- who pleaded guilty last year to 
driving while impaired -- was charged with disorderly conduct, 
public lewdness, harassment and assault and was released on $10,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm innocent,'' Elliott told WABC-TV. ``There were certain  
parties that were doing some things and just ran off, and I was 
left holding the bag, so to speak. But it's no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini was charged with disorderly conduct and was released on  
$100 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are scheduled to be arraigned in Long Beach city court  
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, former Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau was  
sentenced to 15 days in jail on Friday after being arrested on 
charges he violated a protection order obtained by his estranged 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge said Gastineau's arrest violated the terms of a  
conditional discharge in a separate harassment case involving a 
woman he dated before marrying his wife.

<HEADLINE> Identical Twins Reunited in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- One glance at Thomas Patterson told Steven  
Tazumi everything he needed to know: This stranger, from whom he'd 
been separated for nearly a lifetime, had to be his twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The identical twins, now 40, were reunited Friday night at  
Philadelphia International Airport amid a crush of friends and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1958 in a Japanese orphanage on the island of Kyushu,  
the two were adopted as babies by different families and raised in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson lives in Liberal, Kan., in that state's southwest  
corner, while Tazumi lives in Harrison Township, N.J., not far from 
the New Jersey town where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Tazumi's 20-year search for his twin ended last month when he  
found Patterson's adoptive father, Claude Patterson, in Liberal, 
and the two brothers quickly made plans to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport Friday night, Tazumi began laughing loudly when  
he saw his likeness walking toward him -- and he couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited, it's wonderful,'' Patterson said. ``I didn't  
realize he looked that much like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claude Patterson was an Air Force sergeant stationed in Japan in  
the late 1950s and early 1960s. He and his wife, Fujie Tomita, 
wanted to adopt both boys, but Thomas' brother had already been 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	While Thomas was growing up in a Christian household in Liberal,  
where he was the only Japanese-American resident, Steven was 
growing up as a Buddhist, the adopted son of Tatsuo and Terry 
Tazumi of Bellmawr, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Both twins knew about the other. Patterson and his wife, Carla,  
made several attempts over the years to locate his brother but had 
no success. They were told the orphanage had been destroyed in a 
fire and records were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Things changed last week when Claude Patterson received a letter  
requesting information about a Thomas Patterson of Japanese 
descent, who was born Nov. 25, 1958. ``His brother is desperately 
trying to locate him,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	That letter came from Shelley Engel of Huntington Valley, Pa.,  
twin sister of Gail Geonnetti of Voorhees, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Geonnetti, a fitness-training client of Tazumi, had decided to  
help Tazumi search for his twin, and enlisted her own twin in the 
effort. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Tazumi, a weightlifter, is not the only one in the fitness  
business. Patterson was a fitness trainer who owned a Liberal gym 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tazumi said he thought the day would never come.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been 20 years looking,'' he said. ``The nice thing is we  
haven't had a fight in 40 years.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jorge Dely Valdes' goal broke a tie in the  
74th minute as the Colorado Rapids beat D.C. United 2-1 Saturday 
night in a match between MLS conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes got a step on United defender Brian Kamler at the top of  
the penalty area. When Kamler offered little resistance, Valdes 
broke through and scored on a soft shot beneath goalie Tom 
Presthus. It was Valdes' seventh goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado improved to 6-3 on the road and has one more road  
victory than it did last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Conference-leading D.C. (12-7), which has lost four of  
six games, tied the game about two minutes earlier on a goal by 
A.J. Wood. Following Geoff Aunger's cross from the left side, Wood 
hit the last of a series of three headers, bouncing the ball into 
an open net to ruin Rapids goalie Ian Feuer's shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey DiGiamarino gave Colorado (12-4), which has won five of  
seven and leads the Western Conference, a 1-0 lead in the 61st 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes corralled the rebound of an errant D.C. corner kick from  
the left side and sprung DiGiamarino with a long lead pass. 
DiGiamarino sped past defender Jeff Agoos and converted a low shot 
from the top of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGiamarino's goal came about nine minutes after an apparent  
goal by D.C.'s Roy Lassiter was disallowed because Lassiter was 
ruled offsides. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Original Rocketmen Still Aim High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Rudi Beichel is still crunching numbers  
for a better rocket engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst Stuhlinger is still writing about rocket science. So is  
Gerhard Reisig. 
</P>
<P>
	And Konrad Dannenberg is still going to launches and organizing  
space confabs, only now they're really just reunions, and they are 
getting smaller and fewer each year. 
</P>
<P>
	These men are Apollo's rocketeers, old and overlooked but as  
passionate as ever about the frontiers they blasted open, with the 
world's first space shot in 1942, and then by helping put human 
beings on the moon 30 years ago July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	At best guess, only 30 of the 118 original rocket men who came  
here from Hitler's Germany are still alive. Many are too frail to 
leave home because of strokes and arthritis. Those who can -- 
Dannenberg, most notably -- speak for all when they say that what 
NASA needs is another Wernher von Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many of them fear there will never be another von Braun, the  
mastermind who led them to America and America to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	And even now, in their late 70s to early 90s, they have yet to  
outlive the Nazi taint, and they feel deprived of the recognition 
they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is that these scientists have led two very different  
lives: first as loyal subjects of the Third Reich, then as loyal 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wernher von Braun's wartime rockets indiscriminately killed  
thousands of people and were built with slave laborers provided by 
concentration camps. But as World War II ended, the Soviets and 
Americans found themselves in competition to acquire Germany's 
rocket expertise. The moral debate was sidelined and von Braun and 
his men were transformed from servants of Hitler's war machine to 
heroes of America's race to space. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Braun died of cancer in 1977, at age 65, without realizing  
his fondest dream: leading America to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of his team's sturdier souls gathered last month at the  
U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center in Huntsville, their adopted hometown 
and birthplace of the Saturn V moon rocket, to celebrate their 
achievements and reminisce in fluent but still German-accented 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	``This work we did changed the whole society, the whole life,  
the whole technology,'' said the small, smiling Beichel. At 85, he 
had traveled all the way from Sacramento, Calif., for the big event 
and was savoring every moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go to the moon, the biggest industrial revolution the world  
has ever seen ... and that's only the beginning, ja.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although as many as 400,000 Americans worked on the $24 billion  
Apollo program, the Germans contend that without them, the nation 
never would have put men on the moon by the end of 1969 as 
President Kennedy decreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was von Braun's initiative and his drive and motivation and  
his gift of persuasion, of interesting other people, which enabled 
us to go to the moon at that relatively early time,'' said 
Stuhlinger, also 85, who was von Braun's chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	As incredible as man's journey to the moon was, so too was these  
men's journey: launching the first rocket to skim space, the German 
V-2, V for Vengeance, in 1942; the first American satellite, 
Explorer I, in 1958; the first American into space, Alan Shepard, 
in 1961; the first men on the moon, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, 
who blasted off on July 16, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the launches, the one that stands out most for  
Dannenberg, an 86-year-old propulsion expert, was the first 
successful test flight of the V-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket took off Oct. 3, 1942, from Peenemunde, a German Army  
research center north of Berlin on the Baltic Sea. It soared 53 
miles high (space officially begins 50 miles up) and 118 miles 
downrange. The army officer in charge of rocket research 
proclaimed: ``Today the spaceship has been born!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, it was clear it would be used by the military,''  
Dannenberg explained. ``On the other hand, of course, it was a big 
step ahead and if you look at the V-2 today and see it next to the 
Saturn V, you probably think it's tiny. But for us, it was a HUGE 
rocket, much bigger than any amateur rocket I'd ever seen or even 
imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The V-2 was 47 feet tall. The Saturn V was 363 feet, more than  
twice the height of the space shuttle and the biggest, mightiest 
rocket that ever carried a human being. A 6.4 million-pound 
monster, it had up to 5 million parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months of the first successful V-2 launch, Adolf Hitler  
ordered the production of thousands of these ``wonder weapons'' and 
put the SS in charge. Production moved to an abandoned mine near 
the Harz Mountains of central Germany after Peenemunde was bombed 
by the Royal Air Force in 1943. Slave labor was used in the 
underground factory. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to lure him over from the army, the SS made von  
Braun an honorary second lieutenant, then major. He accepted for 
fear of retribution but stuck his SS uniform in a closet, 
Stuhlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gestapo, nonetheless, arrested von Braun in 1944. The  
charge: He intended his rockets for space travel, not weaponry. He 
spent only two weeks in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	By fall 1944, V-2's were being launched at Paris and London. But  
Germany was losing the war and in May 1945, following Hitler's 
suicide, von Braun and his team surrendered to the U.S. Army. That 
September, the exodus began under the code name Operation 
Paperclip; 118 Germans were brought to America along with 
blueprints and enough parts to build 100 V-2's. Twenty-four more 
Germans eventually followed. 
</P>
<P>
	They quietly settled in Fort Bliss, Texas and helped the Army  
launch rebuilt V-2's from White Sands, N.M. (One accidentally 
soared across the border into a hill next to a Mexican graveyard.) 
</P>
<P>
	When the rocket and missile effort moved to the Army's Redstone  
Arsenal in Huntsville in 1950, so did the Germans. They became U.S. 
citizens five years later. When NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center 
opened at Redstone Arsenal in 1960, von Braun was its first 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans' presence initially posed a public relations  
challenge to the U.S. government. On one occasion soon after their 
arrival, to avoid inflaming the fresh wounds of World War II, they 
were passed off as a Hungarian Gypsy band. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when von Braun emerged as America's top rocket scientist,  
Tom Lehrer, the satirical songwriter, lampooned him as an 
opportunist tailoring his loyalties to whoever employed him: 
``Don't say that he's hypocritical, say rather that he's 
apolitical. `Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come 
down? That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene Willhite was walking with her husband, a missile  
instructor, and their five children through a dark parking lot in 
Huntsville in 1957 when she first saw the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see this to this day: four long, black, leather coats.  
And I thought, they didn't even leave the coats behind,'' she 
recalled. ``I had total resentment. And I'll tell you the truth, 
only since I have come to work here, I know their contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here'' is the U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center, a visitor complex  
and Space Camp hub, where she has been the archivist for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	She counts the Germans as good friends, and they are entrusting  
their most valuable possessions to her: books, journals, anything 
to do with rocketry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reisig, 90, wants her to get a truck to empty his house.  
Stuhlinger and Dannenberg already have sent over loads of boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuhlinger published a definitive biography of von Braun in 1994  
and still writes scientific essays. Reisig recently published a 
book about rocket technology in German. Dannenberg is collaborating 
on a book about early rocketry. Beichel is a consultant for 
Aerojet, a California-based aerospace and defense company, and 
works on calculations for future generations of rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartons of their work crowd the hallway outside Mrs. Willhite's  
cluttered office. Some 3,800 books already fill ceiling-to-floor 
shelves. There are six V-2 parts, as well as the Army's microfilm 
of the translated V-2 documents and albums filled with photos of a 
smoldering Peenemunde. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of Nazis and World War II never came up during the  
space race, said Ed Buckbee, a NASA PR man in the 1960s who went on 
to direct the center. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until after the rocketeers had retired that stories  
resurfaced linking at least one of them to the slave labor at 
Mittelwerk, the underground V-2 factory. Old and ailing, Arthur 
Rudolph relinquished his U.S. citizenship and returned to Germany 
in 1984 rather than fight war crimes charges, which he denied. He 
died in 1996 at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the survivors, Reisig is most distressed by the accusations.  
He refuses to talk to reporters, saying he has been 
``back-stabbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation which is very depressing for us old-timers,''  
Stuhlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	After everything the Germans did for NASA and America, it seems  
terribly ungrateful, Buckbee thinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all working as a team, working day and night,'' he  
said. ``As von Braun used to say, 'Late to bed, early to rise, work 
like hell and advertise.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Heald was a young Army corporal assigned to von Braun's team  
in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I can judge genius. What I can judge is  
hard-working and thorough,'' said Heald, 71, a retired engineer. 
``Often a boss, particularly a big boss like von Braun, will sit in 
an office and act important. These guys never were sitting and 
doing nothing. They were always checking on every single little 
detail, asking questions. 'Is that right? Is that right?' Even in 
the shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They still take pride in their meticulousness. When name tags  
issued at the reunion kept falling off, 86-year-old rocketeer 
Dieter Grau remarked with a chuckle that they should have been sent 
to his lab for a checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	Their painstaking approach paid off in six moon landings from  
July 1969 through December 1972. Three additional missions were 
canned; President Nixon had had enough, especially after the 
harrowing Apollo 13. President Bush tried to resurrect the program 
on the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 in 1989, but his pitch for 
moon colonies and a Mars expedition went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing has been officially done -- or said -- since.  
</P>
<P>
	``To make it happen that somebody went to the moon and came  
safely back to Earth ... it was amazing that it all worked,'' said 
Ursula Mueller, 77, who worked with von Braun in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then what we have now is the shuttle to go a little bit  
around.'' She sadly shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mueller went alone to the reunion; her husband, Fritz, 91,  
one of the 118 original rocketeers, was under doctor's orders to 
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	The official reason for the get-together was a rare visit by von  
Braun's thirtysomething nephews (his niece, their sister, just 
moved to Huntsville), not to mention the 30th anniversary of that 
giant leap for mankind. 
</P>
<P>
	The real reason, Elizabeth von Braun confided, was that the only  
other excuse to gather the old-timers is a funeral, ``and we just 
felt that we need to get them together, as many as we can ... it 
may be the last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five rocketeers in attendance seemed as much a relic as the  
artifacts surrounding them, only far more fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saturn V rocket lay majestically on its side, collected  
piecemeal by von Braun in the late 1960s for exhibit at the Space &AMP; 
Rocket Center. Nearby, ground had recently been broken for a 
full-scale, vertical model. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the hall from the gathering was a recreation of von Braun's  
1960s office at Marshall Space Flight Center; two of his slide 
rules were displayed in a quaint, quiet reminder of the times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly any NASA brass attended the reunion, but Jim Dunn, one of  
two latter-day space station engineers who dropped by, couldn't 
help but marvel at the Germans' accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they did it without computers!''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Finale Caps Magic Run for US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Tiffeny Milbrett knew the women's World  
Cup was big. She didn't know how big until she saw tears streaming 
down the face of a young girl clutching a soccer ball and a pen. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett paused, wondering whether the girl waiting at Pomona  
College in Claremont, where the U.S. women were about to practice, 
had been passed over for an autograph. Then she realized they were 
tears of joy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' said Milbrett, a forward on the team, ``is when the  
enormity of all this suddenly hit me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A soccer fantasy that didn't seem possible three short weeks ago  
is being replayed in suburban parks and in the bedrooms of little 
girls across America as the World Cup came to a frenetic conclusion 
with Saturday's final between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls scream and cry out the names of their favorites. Mothers  
stand by flashing picture after picture. Even Dad and the boys come 
along for the ride in a frenzy of adulation reminiscent of 
Beatlemania. 
</P>
<P>
	And what a ride it's been, as a group of fresh-faced, talented  
and down-to-earth women carried the hopes of the United States and, 
quite possibly, the future of women's sports into 90 minutes of 
action before some 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer moms helped re-elect President Clinton, and he was  
returning the favor by attending Saturday, watching a team that 
actually features two 31-year-old mothers -- Carla Overbeck and Joy 
Fawcett. The squad dubbed ``Soccer Mamas'' by David Letterman, may 
finally be the spark needed to lift a sport already played by 8.6 
million Americans -- 2.5 million of them female -- to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
	But these pioneers would make less for winning the World Cup (a  
$12,500 bonus) than Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown gets 
for retiring one batter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy I want to leave is that no longer can anyone take  
women athletes lightly,'' Milbrett said. ``There are no more 
excuses. They can't say we can't draw or that we are not 
marketable. We have proved it from Game 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's game has become America's game, at least for a brief  
summer fling, thanks to the 20 women who can dribble and shoot with 
the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
	The response has been quite a contrast to the U.S. victory in  
the very first women's World Cup in China in 1991. That was greeted 
largely with yawns, partly because it was played halfway around the 
world, and partly because the sport had not yet attained the level 
of popularity it now has here. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, women's soccer wasn't deemed  
ready for prime time. There, the United States defeated China 2-1 
before 76,000, but NBC televised only 10 minutes of previously 
taped highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the women showed they were going to be a force right  
away, both on the field and at the gate. They beat Denmark 3-0 in 
the June 19 opener at the Meadowlands in New Jersey before a 
soldout crowd of 78,972 the largest ever to see a women's sporting 
event. Four more wins in packed stadiums -- Chicago, Boston, 
Washington, and Palo Alto, Calif., -- merely increased the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. team landed at the Los Angeles airport on Monday,  
young fans raced after arriving team members pleading for 
autographs and television camera crews jostled one another for 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	The hype hasn't waned, as ticket brokers reported prices of up  
to $1,000 a seat, and 4,000 extra seats were put on the market. 
Television ratings for the semifinal match against Brazil topped 
those for the deciding game of the Stanley Cup hockey finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the hard-nosed bookies in Las Vegas took bets on the games,  
and admitted to enjoying the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be on our biggest screen in the sports book and we'll  
be rooting them on,'' said Vinny Magliulo, who runs the sports book 
at Caesars Palace, where the U.S. team was an 8-5 favorite over 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be answered is whether the mini-boom will last longer  
than the red, white and blue paint on the faces of their young 
fans. Women's sports enjoyed a similar -- though less frenzied -- 
renaissance during the 1996 Olympics. But memories of gold medals 
won by the women's softball, basketball and soccer teams quickly 
faded. There was another brief spike when the U.S. women's hockey 
team won gold at Nagano in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to enjoy this while it is happening, because  
it's very special and might never happen again,'' Mia Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm is the star of the U.S. team, the goal-scoring whiz (though  
she hadn't scored in the World Cup heading into the finals) with 
all the endorsements, including a spot alongside Michael Jordan in 
a Gatorade commercial. She was perhaps the only player fans might 
have been able to name before 16 nations began the 32-game 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, players like Milbrett, Julie Foudy and Michelle  
Akers have become household names. And not just to the young girls 
who emulate their heroes on neighborhood fields, but to their 
families as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me the little girls are not dragging their  
parents to the games,'' goalkeeper Briana Scurry said. ``The 
parents are seeing how soccer has taken off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one of those games, a quarterfinal between Norway and Sweden,  
Jamie Loney and Laura Adams grinned, sweating behind American flags 
painted on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool!'' the 11-year-olds from  
Pleasanton, Calif., chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one magical summer, indeed that's true.

<HEADLINE> All-Stars Say Farewell to Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Injured or not, Tony Gwynn will make the  
cross-country trip to the All-Star game just so he can shag flies 
at Fenway Park for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get here just in time.  
</P>
<P>
	The oldest park in baseball is due for demolition. Although the  
Red Sox are still working on plans for a replacement, and community 
groups are fighting those plans, it's safe to say that the last 
All-Star game of the century will be the last one at Fenway as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go to the workout, you know, take some balls off the  
Green Monster, just for my own sake'' said Gwynn, a career Padre 
who has played in Tiger Stadium and Yankee Stadium in the World 
Series but has never played in Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're honored to be able to go and be voted in by the fans,''  
said Gwynn, who's nursing a strained left calf. ``But this time, I 
can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who earned his 11th starting All-Star spot and his 15th  
overall, will sit in the dugout and watch as NL teammates like Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa fire away at the Green Monster, the 37-foot 
high left-field wall that stands a tantalizing 310 feet away from 
home plate. For lefties like Ken Griffey Jr., there's Pesky's Pole 
-- just 302 feet down the line in right before the wall juts out to 
the bullpens. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if no one homers -- there was only one in the last  
All-Star game here, in 1961 -- the hometown fans will have something 
to cheer about: Two Red Sox players will start for the American 
League, the first time that's happened since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was voted in by the fans in a tight  
and controversial election over the Yankees' Derek Jeter, who will 
suit up as a reserve. And Pedro Martinez, who has a 15-3 record and 
2.10 ERA, will be the AL's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL starting lineup will also include catcher Ivan Rodriguez,  
first baseman Jim Thome, second baseman Roberto Alomar, third 
baseman Cal Ripken Jr., outfielders Griffey, Manny Ramirez and 
Kenny Lofton and designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to McGwire and Sosa, starting for the NL will be  
catcher Mike Piazza, second baseman Jay Bell, third baseman Matt 
Williams, shortstop Barry Larkin and outfielder Larry Walker. 
Gwynn's replacement won't be picked until closer to game time. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gwynn has never been to the ballpark that opened in  
1912, the same day as Tiger Stadium and the same week in which the 
Titanic sunk, McGwire and Sosa played there during their American 
League days. 
</P>
<P>
	In 55 games at Fenway while with the Oakland A's, McGwire hit 18  
home runs and 42 RBIs to go with his .260 batting average. Sosa, 
who played with the White Sox and Rangers before he emerged as a 
top power hitter, hit just one homer while batting .227 in 44 
career at-bats at Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	This game had been scheduled for Milwaukee, but it was moved to  
Boston when the opening of the Brewers' new field was delayed. The 
Red Sox had been hoping to host an All-Star game at their own new 
ballpark, penciled in just across the street, but they're still so 
far back in the planning stages that they couldn't be sure when 
that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	So that means baseball's stars will get a chance to see Fenway.  
</P>
<P>
	And say goodbye.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be fun for me to sit in that dugout for the  
first time,'' said NL backup first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who played 
in Fenway once -- in a college all-star game the same day he was 
drafted by the Red Sox. He was traded while still in the minors, 
before he ever got a chance to play for his hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when they traded me, the emotion of the business kind  
of went out of me. I learned at a young age that baseball is a 
business and you just never know,'' he said. ``After I got traded 
away, my feelings kind of got lost there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, not everyone is sentimental about the old ballpark.  
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams said he ``won't shed a tear'' when Fenway is  
replaced. And, when he was still putting on his uniform in Fenway's 
home clubhouse, first baseman Mo Vaughn regularly implored the team 
to ``blow it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most players, like Vaughn, are more concerned about amenities  
such as weight rooms and indoor batting cages. Fans want efficient 
concession stands, good sight-lines and plentiful bathrooms. Owners 
say these things are necessary to make the money needed to produce 
the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the lack of championship pennants fluttering above  
Fenway's leaky roof, Vaughn acknowledged that it might be time for 
Boston to join the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about tradition,'' he said. ``But where are the  
flags?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, after a few days of cramming into Fenway's cramped  
clubhouses, you may hear more players join the chorus that's 
calling for a new ballpark on Yawkey Way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like history. History is meant to be broken,'' said  
McGwire, who did a little of that last year. ``And records are made 
to be broken, too.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Honors 'Roots' Author </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday honored Alex  
Haley, Pulitzer Prize winning author of ``Roots,'' by commissioning 
a cutter in his name -- the first military vessel named for a 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``By seeking his own roots, Alex Haley enlarged the world for  
millions of Americans, connecting us with a history we thought was 
lost,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who was the 
key note speaker at an invitation-only ceremony at the Coast Guard 
yard in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance were members of Haley's family, Sen.  
Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and actors from the mini-series based on 
``Roots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, who died in 1992, spent 20 years in the Coast Guard,  
rising from ship's steward to become the first head of the Guard's 
public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
	The yard recently completed an 18-month, $20 million overhaul on  
the one-of-a-kind 283-foot cutter, formerly the Navy rescue and 
salvage vessel USS Edenton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex would have been so happy today because he loved the Coast  
Guard. And by honoring him, it shows you also loved him,'' said 
Doris Haley, wife of Alex Haleys brother George who serves as 
Ambassador to Gambia and couldn't be present for the ceremony.	   The commissioning of a vessel marks the entry or reentry of a 
Coast Guard cutter into the fleet. Names are usually selected from 
a category, such as cities or battles, that includes other ships of 
its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutter will be based in Kodiak, Alaska. It will be used for  
fisheries enforcement and search and rescue missions in the Bering 
Sea, Gulf of Alaska and the northern Pacific Ocean.

<P>
	Today is Sunday, July 11, the 192nd day of 1999. There are 173  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On July 11, 1798, the U.S. Marine Corps was formally  
re-established by a congressional act that also created the U.S. 
Marine Band. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1533, Pope Clement VII excommunicated England's King Henry  
VIII. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1767, John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United  
States, was born in Braintree, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1804, Vice President Aaron Burr mortally wounded former  
Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton in a pistol duel near 
Weehawken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1864, Confederate forces led by General Jubal Early began an  
abortive invasion of Washington, D.C., turning back the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, President Roosevelt became the first chief executive to  
travel through the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, the U.S. Air Force Academy was dedicated at Lowry Air  
Base in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee released volumes of  
evidence it had gathered in its Watergate inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the Medal of Freedom was awarded posthumously to the  
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, 216 people were killed when a tanker truck overfilled  
with propylene gas exploded on a coastal highway south of 
Tarragona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, the abandoned U.S. space station ``Skylab'' made a  
spectacular return to Earth, burning up in the atmosphere and 
showering debris over the Indian Ocean and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Actor Laurence Olivier died at age 82. The  
American League won the 60th All-Star Game, defeating the National 
League 5-3 in Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Famous N.C. Lighthouse Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- To the cheers of hundreds of tourists and  
the relief of those who have lived in its long shadow, the Cape 
Hatteras Lighthouse was gently nudged over the threshold of its new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's tallest brick lighthouse arrived at its new  
concrete foundation Friday afternoon after months of preparation 
work and a three-week journey that covered almost 2,900 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot-tall tower, which was just 150 feet from the  
crashing Atlantic surf a few weeks ago, is now 1,600 feet from the 
ocean's edge -- the same distance from that shoreline that it was 
when built 129 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service officials say the black-and-white striped  
tower should be safe from erosion for at least a century. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some that will say we've destroyed history,'' said  
Park Service spokesman Bob Woody, referring to those who opposed 
the move and advocated groins to protect the lighthouse at its 
original location. ``The people who will visit this lighthouse 100 
years from now will give us the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse began its journey on June 17, resting on a nest  
of steel beams mounted on rollers as it was pushed along rails by 
seven hydraulic jacks. Originally expected to take four to six 
weeks, the $10 million move took three. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Matyiko of Expert House Movers of Virginia Beach, Va., the  
moving subcontractor, exchanged high fives and handshakes with 
surveyor John Mayne when the tower came to a stop Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service later tested the lighthouse's twin beams, which  
were extinguished March 1 for the first time in 50 years. They are 
scheduled to be lighted on Labor Day, and officials plan to reopen 
the lighthouse to visitors next Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Ryan, a ranger with the Cape Hatteras National Seashore,  
jokingly gave the movers phony tickets for failure to stop and for 
exceeding speed for a lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I've enjoyed getting a ticket,'' said Joe  
Jakubik, project manager for general contractor International 
Chimney Co. of Buffalo, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Senior Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Come back next week to play the Des  
Moines Golf and Country Club and you'll get an extra stroke at hole 
No. 5. There are no such luxuries for the U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth is a 445-yard par-5 for club members on a par-73  
course. It was changed to a par-4 for the Senior Open, but no 
changes were made to the hole's layout. 
</P>
<P>
	Golfers have to hit their drives over a rise, and from there the  
fairway slopes uphill and to the left. Most golfers have had to 
play their second shot over a grove of ash trees, usually from 
about 160 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they didn't want a par-73 on the golf course, but,  
yeah, those trees are always going to bother you,'' said Frank 
Conner, who made par at No. 5 on Friday and Saturday after a double 
bogey in the first round. ``I was in the right cut and where they 
put the pin (Saturday) was back left. The trees were in my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hole cost leader Ed Dougherty a double-bogey Saturday, but  
defending champion Hale Irwin birdied it. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COOPERATING CONDITIONS:* Some golfers who barely made the  
weekend cut -- a two-day total of 150 -- were able to get at least 
within striking distance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Colbert and Conner both teed off in the afternoon Thursday,  
battling steamy temperatures in the 90s and beat-up greens. Colbert 
shot an 8-over 80, and Conner was 7-over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thursday, I wasted nine shots on the greens or around them,''  
Colbert said. ``It was by far the toughest day to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Colbert was at 148 and Conner at 150.  
</P>
<P>
	Conner shot a tournament-best 67 Saturday and went into Sunday's  
round at 1-over 217. Colbert drew to even-par with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there was a big advantage on the greens,'' Conner  
said. ``The greens are in perfect shape when we played. I played 
obviously better today than I have in the last couple of days. But 
really, I felt like I played pretty much good all week, even though 
I shot 79, I just putted horribly.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE WAITING GAME:* Before the first players teed off Saturday,  
Sandra Roberts and Cathy Courtney were in place at the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
	The cousins picked out choice, front-row seats in the bleachers  
at 8 a.m. and prepared to wait four hours for the first golfers to 
arrive. At 9:30, they were among a handful of people in the stands, 
and most of those folks were at the top of the bleachers, where 
they could see the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done the walk-around thing, I've kind of done it all, and  
this is how I wanted to do it today,'' said Courtney, who is from 
Knoxville, about 30 miles southeast of Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the week off work to come to the Senior Open every day,  
and she staked out the first tee at 7 a.m. Thursday to see Arnold 
Palmer's 12:50 p.m. tee-off. 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries along the first fairway early Saturday were four  
to five people deep. At the first hole, the crowd was 10-deep in 
places. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROUGHRIDING:* The Senior Open is leaving a lasting impression  
on the Des Moines Golf and Country Club -- especially its roads and 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Convoys of city buses shuttling spectators from outlying parking  
lots are tearing up the asphalt. A dump truck arrived Saturday 
morning with a load of gravel and added it to a 6-foot pile in what 
will again be the country club members' parking lot on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tuesday, crews have come out nightly to repair several  
torn-up patches. The largest stretches the width of the road and is 
about 20 yards long. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mason, the USGA's championship director, said the  
organization will pay the Des Moines Golf and Country Club for 
repairs. He said temperatures in the 90s early in the week, 
combined with the weight of the buses, are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ATTENDANCE:* Saturday's attendance was 47,200. It was the sixth  
straight day, including the practice rounds, the crowds have 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never witnessed those numbers,'' said Craig Smith, the  
tournament's media relations manager and a USGA employee since 
1989. ``When they told me, I said, `Are you sure?' It's pretty 
incredible.''

<HEADLINE> Pete Conrad To Be Buried With Honors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad, the  
third man to walk on the moon, will be buried with full military 
honors in Arlington National Cemetery on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad was killed in a motorcycle accident Thursday in Southern  
California. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Apollo astronauts plan to attend the graveside service,  
said Howard Benedict, executive director of the Astronaut 
Scholarship Foundation near Cape Canaveral. Details are still being 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members and close friends will gather Sunday at the  
Conrad home in Huntington Beach, Calif., said Benedict. The 
astronaut is survived by his wife, Nancy, three sons and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, a former Navy captain, flew in space four times: twice  
during the Gemini program in the mid-1960s, as commander of Apollo 
12 in November 1969, and as commander of NASA's Skylab space 
station in 1973.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Given Pacemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Elton John has had a pacemaker inserted to  
overcome what he called ``a minor imbalance in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving London's Wellington Hospital today, the 52-year-old pop  
star told reporters, ``I feel very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bit stiff, a bit sore but everything went really well,''  
he said before driving off in a chauffeured limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came as a bit of a shock, but the operation was a simple  
procedure, the only thing I really regret is canceling my shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had thought he was suffering from sunstroke after  
playing tennis at his house in Nice, France. He took ill on a 
flight to Ireland where he was to have performed at the July 4 
wedding of singer Victoria Adams, known as Posh Spice, and soccer 
player David Beckham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literally, I was on the plane to David and Victoria's wedding,  
but I was ill and had to have some tests. I was given the all-clear 
and went back to France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had continued to feel weak so came to London for tests, he  
said. He was admitted to the hospital Friday and had the pacemaker 
put in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will resume a normal lifestyle after a couple of months  
rest. Life will get back to normal,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his fans had been very supportive, and he promised that  
every canceled show would be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	He also issued a statement saying the only long-term effect of  
the heart problem ``is that I have to carry a card explaining why I 
set off the alarms when I walk through airport security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacemakers regulate the heartbeat by sending an electrical  
charge from a tiny lithium battery down a wire to the heart muscle. 
They are usually placed in a pocket under the skin of the abdomen 
or the collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Elton called his pacemaker a precaution against further  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the first the problem was diagnosed as a viral problem in  
the middle ear, but after a long series of tests it was also 
discovered that there was a minor imbalance in my heart,'' his 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a short and commonplace procedure,'' it said. ``I  
stayed in hospital overnight just for observation and I have now 
been discharged and later today I will be returning to Nice to 
recover and rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``My doctors have ordered me to rest for the rest of the month  
and I will not therefore be able to play at any of the concerts 
planned this month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had canceled three concerts scheduled for today, Sunday and  
Monday in southern England, and hours before the operation he 
announced he was pulling out of two concerts in northern England 
next weekend.

<HEADLINE>  India Clears Key Sector in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- After two months of heavy ground  
fighting, Indian forces say they pushed Pakistan-based Islamic 
guerrillas back across the cease-fire line in a key battle zone in 
Kashmir, but suffered heavy losses in another sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Fierce fighting raged Friday night and this morning in Mushkoh  
Valley, where India lost 48 soldiers in two days -- even as Pakistan 
was asking Muslim insurgents to help ``resolve the crisis'' in an 
apparent call to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time India claimed to have reached the  
cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now only a matter of a few days before the last of the  
Pakistani intruders are flushed out -- dead or alive,'' India's 
Defense Minister George Fernandes said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian troops cleared most guerrillas from Batalik, the  
easternmost of four battle sectors in the Himalayan mountains of 
Kashmir, and from a second sector, Dras, military spokesman Col. 
Bikram Singh said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian claims of spectacular victories in Batalik -- capturing  
eight mountaintop positions in less than 24 hours without losing a 
soldier-- came as the Pakistani Cabinet's defense committee was 
meeting in Islamabad to ask insurgents for help resolving the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the rebels retreated from Batalik in  
response to political and diplomatic efforts, or whether their 
positions crumbled under the pressure of Indian fire. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, top Pakistani commanders met the leaders of 11  
militant groups fighting in Kashmir to discuss a withdrawal, a 
government official said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is expected to brief his  
Cabinet today on his visit to Washington, where he promised 
President Clinton he would take ``concrete steps'' to end the 
fighting. He is scheduled to make a statement in parliament Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mushkoh Valley, thousands of Indian paratroop commandos who  
specialize in high-altitude warfare milled about an army base 
today. An atmosphere of gloom prevailed as 79 wounded soldiers were 
brought down the mountains on horses, stretchers and helicopters 
Friday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Narendra Singh, hobbled down a snowcapped hill for  
five hours, supported by two soldiers, before he reached a field 
medical unit with a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I climbed on a boulder and shot three people. Suddenly 10 to  
12 people emerged from behind a rock and fired a machine gun at us. 
I jumped down 20 feet and was badly hurt,'' Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers said they saw shell-proof bunkers on the top of the  
mountains. One covered in aluminum sheets decorated with a crescent 
was used as a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are leading 700 to 800 fighters in  
Kashmir, a border region divided between the two countries and 
claimed in its entirety by both. 
</P>
<P>
	But Islamabad says the fighters are Kashmiri insurgents who  
receive only moral support from Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said 639 Pakistani soldiers and more than 150 Islamic  
guerrillas have been killed in the fighting since early May, while 
321 Indian soldiers have died, 451 were wounded and 10 were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, religious groups rallied in major cities Friday  
against Sharif's pledge to withdraw the militants fighting Indian 
troops in Kashmir, shouting ``Down with Nawaz Sharif'' and 
``Traitor Nawaz Sharif.''

<HEADLINE> Lower Copper Demand Spurs Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Larry Nelson is sure he'll never find another job  
paying him nearly $18 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last month, he was earning the wage as a pipe fitter at  
the Broken Hill Property Co.'s sprawling copper mining, smelter and 
refining operation in San Manuel, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Nelson, a 25-year company employee, is among its 2,200  
laid-off workers scrambling for new work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm adjusting to the fact that I'll be making less money than  
before,'' said Nelson, 48, president of the local United 
Steelworkers of America chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed demand and prices have recently caused producers in  
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas to shut down entire 
operations and scale back production. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June, three major copper producers have announced layoffs.  
Broken Hill is shutting down operations in San Manuel and Nevada; 
Phelps Dodge Corp. is laying off 1,650 workers in Arizona, New 
Mexico and Texas; and Asarco Inc. is cutting 150 people in Arizona 
-- a 17 percent reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, previously home to 12 active copper mines, produces  
two-thirds of U.S.-mined copper. But the 4,000 lost jobs have cast 
uncertainty on the mineral's fate in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs cut at Ascarco and Phelps Dodge, for instance, could return  
if demand increases and the industry returns ``to a little 
normalcy,'' said Marshall Vest, a specialist at the University of 
Arizona's Division of Economic and Business Research. Yet the jobs 
at Broken Hill would be costly to bring back, even if another 
producer takes it over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's expensive to shut a plant down, and even more expensive  
to reopen it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper prices slid from $1.18 a pound in 1996 to an average of  
65 cents this year, partly because of overproduction and a slowdown 
in construction demand in the shrunken economies of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are part of a strategy to lower production in hopes  
of increasing prices, said George Leaming, an Arizona mining 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuts appear to be helping somewhat, he said. Reduced production  
is boosting copper prices to around 75 cents a pound, last year's 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the price coming back up, the producers can make a little  
money,'' Leaming said. ``It's not the death of the industry by any 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the layoffs and reduced production will be a  
drag on the Arizona economy. The state could lose up to $35 million 
in tax revenue alone, Leaming said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks aren't unilateral. Copper producer Cyprus-Climax  
Metals, which employs 2,000 at two mines and a smelter, has said it 
plans no layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it remains an uncertain time for industry workers.  
</P>
<P>
	``All these corporations have mines all over the America, and  
these mines have the highest costs,'' said Ian Robertson, president 
of the Southern Arizona Labor Council and an Asarco employee. 
``It's cheaper for them to keep a mine open in Chile.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Bankers Say Reform Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Although Asia has started to recover from its  
economic crisis, the pace of financial reform is slipping, central 
bankers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with executives from the Bank for International  
Settlements, or BIS, Asian central bankers raised concerns about 
the way reform in the international financial system is proceeding, 
Andrew Crockett, general manager of the BIS, told reporters after 
the closed-door meeting.

	The Basel, Switzerland-based BIS is regarded as the central  
banker for central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian stock markets have rallied in recent weeks, though some  
analysts wonder whether traders have overestimated the actual 
prospects for a recovery. Some blue chip indexes have soared to 
levels unseen since before the Asian crisis spread in the autumn of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers also said they want a larger role in the BIS'  
Financial Stability Forum, an organization of central banks and 
regulatory agencies led by the Group of Seven countries and headed 
by Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
	Crockett said he would raise the bankers' concerns at future  
forum meetings. But he stopped short of promising broader 
participation by Asia's smaller economies, noting that Hong Kong 
and Singapore have been invited to participate because of the size 
and importance of their financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of the 11 top central bankers from the region were  
concerned with the BIS proposal for changing bank lending 
guidelines. They were worried that the new system would rely too 
much on the views of credit ratings agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Crockett and other BIS member bankers are to convene their next  
meeting Monday in Shanghai where he expects further discussion on 
the stability forum. The region's economies and banking reforms 
will also be discussed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their Friday meeting, the region's bankers stressed that  
reforms are still needed to ensure a sustained return to financial 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian monetary bosses came from Australia, China, Hong Kong,  
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.

	Rebels Spurn Congo Truce  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Squabbling rebels refused to sign a Congo  
peace accord today, dashing hopes for a speedy end to the 
continent's biggest current conflict. But six warring countries 
signed the deal and agreed to carry out a cease-fire within 24 
hours. Even so, Olivier Kamitatu, a leader of the Congo Liberation 
Movement, said there's nothing to prevent the three squabbling 
rebel groups from continuing to fight. ``It is not binding so long 
as we have not signed,'' he said of the peace accord.

hesitate to get the preventive care they need.'' He wants to

<HEADLINE> New Market To Compete With Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Scrambling to meet a challenge by the operator of  
the Nasdaq Stock Market, Japan's largest stock exchange will also 
set up a new market for smaller start-up companies, a newspaper 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange will open the new market early next  
year with relaxed listing requirements to attract smaller, lesser 
known companies that are now unable to raise money on Japan's 
financial markets, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was available at the Tokyo Stock Exchange to take calls  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes less than a month after the National  
Association of Securities Dealers Inc., which runs the highly 
successful Nasdaq market in the United States, and a Japanese 
software company announced they will open a similar market in Japan 
by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	No such market currently exists in Japan, a fact many economists  
here blame for the country's failure to keep up with the 
technological innovation going on at companies in places like 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq has grown into one of the world's largest stock  
markets largely because of its success in directing investors' 
funds to rapidly growing start-up companies. 
</P>
<P>
	With Japan struggling through its longest recession since World  
War II, economists have called for the establishment of such 
capital markets here to put the bounce back in Asia's largest 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Jeter Hits Cleanup for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter moved into the cleanup spot of the  
New York Yankees' batting order for the first time in his career, 
going 0-for-4 in Saturday's 9-8 loss to New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, whose average dropped from a league-leading .377 to .373,  
had batted second in 71 games this year and hit third 11 times. He 
also batted leadoff once. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a plan. He goes up there and gives us his money's  
worth,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``He's probably been the 
most consistent of any of our players this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter struck out in the first, grounded out in the fourth, flied  
out in the sixth, was intentionally walked in the seventh and 
grounded out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said earlier, you're only your number in the order in  
your first at-bat,'' he remarked, saying the switch didn't mean 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was designed to get Bernie Williams back to the No. 2  
spot. Williams, the Yankees' cleanup hitter in recent years, hit 
second last month when Jeter was dropped to third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time we put him there, it seemed to put us on fire,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch remained in the leadoff spot, Paul O'Neill hit  
third and Tino Martinez batted fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I could split the left-handers up was to do  
this,'' Torre said, a reference to O'Neill and Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre pulled Jeter aside when the Yankees arrived at Shea  
Stadium about 2 1/2 hours before the first pitch. Williams didn't mind 
the shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he was hitting second, he said, `OK.' If I told him  
he was hitting fourth, he'd say, `OK,''' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter lost out to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra in fan voting for  
the starting AL shortstop in Tuesday's All-Star game at Fenway 
Park. Garciaparra missed his eighth straight game Saturday after 
injuring his groin July 2 against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't play in these next two games, what do we do  
here?'' said Torre, the American League's manager. ``But I'm going 
to wait for someone to tell me. I'm not going to make that 
decision.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the Mets and Yankees slugged it out on the  
field at Shea Stadium on Saturday, some fans took the fight to the

	Several supporters of the longtime rivals clashed during the  
game, which the Mets won 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point players left the dugout to watch brawls on the  
stadium's upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a couple of good fights out there,'' Mets catcher  
Mike Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued 93 summonses for a variety of violations, from  
disorderly conduct to drinking in public, said Detective Joseph 
Pentangelo, a department spokesman. No arrests were made, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nominees Caught in Senate Battles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a system that invites delays, Richard  
Holbrooke ``is simply caught in the middle,'' according to one of 
the Republican senators blocking his confirmation as ambassador to 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Effectively, Holbrooke's long-stalled nomination is hostage to  
disputes that don't involve him. But that's the way it works in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had his own problems after this all began, when  
President Clinton announced more than a year ago that he was 
sending the veteran diplomat to the United Nations. That got 
snarled in the clearance process over an anonymous complaint that 
Holbrooke had improperly blended private and government roles. Then 
questions were raised about his financial disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	So the formal nomination wasn't even sent to the Senate until  
Feb. 10, eight months after Clinton chose Holbrooke to succeed Bill 
Richardson, now energy secretary, in the U.N. post. 
</P>
<P>
	That put it before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where  
its chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is no fan of the United 
Nations and was in no rush. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee finally approved him unanimously for confirmation  
by the Senate, but by then there were new roadblocks, all part of a 
process that invites holdups and disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, announced on June 24 that he was  
putting a hold on the Holbrooke nomination. That means he won't let 
it go to a vote, and certain confirmation, not because he opposes 
it, but because he has another complaint with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Mr. Holbrooke,'' Grassley said. ``He is  
simply caught in the middle.'' Grassley's complaint is over the 
reassignment of a budget officer who had been a congressional 
whistleblower about waste and mismanagement at the United Nations. 
She was reassigned -- Grassley says to silence her, the State 
Department says for unsatisfactory job performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said he'll let the nomination go ahead when she is  
reinstated or gets another acceptable settlement. ``The hold gets 
lifted when there's an agreement in writing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turns out he is not the only senator trying to use the  
Holbrooke nomination for leverage on another grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Sen. Mitch McConnell,  
R-Ky., put publicly undisclosed holds on the nomination in an 
effort to force Clinton to appoint the man they want to one of the 
three Republican seats on the bipartisan Federal Election 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the choice of GOP leaders would be heeded; but in this  
case, the White House has urged campaign reform advocates to say 
``no,'' arguing that the nominee the Republicans want is on record 
against the election finance laws the commission oversees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, also has put a hold on Holbrooke,  
because of policy concerns and to make sure there is a roll call 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a certain irony on all of this. The Senate practice that  
lets any member put a hold on a nomination or bill, meaning it 
can't be acted upon until the senator says so, is a custom, not a 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	It began as a courtesy, enabling a senator with particular  
interest in an issue to avoid missing a debate or vote on it. Holds 
were secret, unless a senator wanted to say that he or she had 
registered one. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``senatorial courtesy'' has become a potent legislative  
weapon, a pressure point against this administration, as it was 
against Republican administrations when Democrats ran the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last Congress, there was an effort, led by Grassley and  
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., to end the secrecy. That was blocked, at 
one point by anonymous holds, but Senate leaders agreed early this 
year to end secret holds. 
</P>
<P>
	In lodging his hold on the Holbrooke nomination, Grassley  
followed the rule he advocated, announcing it on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's was secret, until word of it leaked. When he said on July  
2 that there were problems to be worked out over anonymous holds on 
the nomination, he didn't mention his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system he and Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader,  
agreed to, a senator imposing a hold must notify the committee 
involved -- and also his or her party leader. Lott would have been 
telling himself. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Farmer Was Voice for Civil Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- At the end, James Farmer had long since  
lost sight in the eyes that had beheld so much injustice and 
witnessed the pivotal moments in America's struggle for racial 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes stilled the legs that had walked treacherous miles on  
the roads of the hostile South during the Freedom Rides of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	But, oh, that voice!  
</P>
<P>
	Right up to his final days, nothing had muted the mighty,  
flowing baritone that helped mold and inspire the civil rights 
movement for one generation, then brought it back to life for 
college students of a later time. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer died Friday at Mary Washington Hospital in  
Fredericksburg, Va., after years of failing health. He was the last 
of the 1960s' Big Four civil rights giants -- the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr., NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League leader Whitney 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer helped found the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942 and  
later led Freedom Riders deep into Dixie in a nonviolent but 
perilous effort to desegregate interstate buses and bus terminals. 
In 1964, three young men he had recruited into CORE were killed in 
Neshoba County, Miss., and buried in an earthen dam. 
</P>
<P>
	One time, a bus loaded with Freedom Riders was burned to the  
ground and its occupants barely escaped. Farmer spent 40 days and 
40 nights in Mississippi jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	He lived with fear but never gave in to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who said he wasn't afraid during the civil rights  
movement was either a liar or without imagination,'' Farmer said in 
a 1991 interview. ``I was scared all the time. My hands didn't 
shake but inside I was shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Farmer led a march in Plaquemine, La., and was  
confronted by mounted troopers and the Ku Klux Klan. The marchers 
sought refuge in a church, and the Klan surrounded it, shouting 
``Where's Farmer?'' The demonstrators hid Farmer in a hearse that 
was parked behind the church. The hearse spirited him off to New 
Orleans on a frightening four-hour ride over Louisiana back roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to kill him. They looked everywhere for  
him,'' said Val Coleman, an aide to Farmer in those days. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer later turned to politics, losing a congressional election  
in New York in 1968, then serving in the Nixon administration as an 
assistant secretary in the Department of Health, Education and 
Welfare. Disillusioned, he left government two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Farmer moved to Virginia and began writing about the  
civil rights struggle in his autobiography, ``Lay Bare the Heart.'' 
It was a way to ensure that the movement's gains were not forgotten 
or relinquished, a concern that abided with Farmer throughout his 
life and eventually led him to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was quite worried that we have a long way to go with race  
problems in this country,'' said Philip Hall, who met Farmer in 
1985 and soon hired him as a history professor at Mary Washington 
College in Fredericksburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer worried that racism still thrived -- albeit quietly -- in  
America and that its only remedy was education, said Hall, the vice 
president for academic affairs and dean of the faculty at the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he brought to us was living civil rights history,'' Hall  
said. ``Why, you can just imagine. It was like having Robert E. Lee 
lecturing on the Civil War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall and Farmer became good friends. Hall would watch him  
lecture, spellbound by Farmer's oratory just as the students were. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had this wonderful, deep preacher's voice and a way of  
storytelling that was quite special,'' Hall said. ``He was the man 
who had actually done the Freedom Rides. He had been there. He'd 
lived with the fear and with the hate, and he had done special 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Davies, Fredericksburg's former mayor, also became a  
friend of Farmer's. When he visited the ailing man in the hospital 
three weeks ago, Farmer was alert despite his medications. 
Together, the two men said a prayer, Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mind was clear until the very end,'' Davies said. ``He was  
still living life to the fullest that his health would allow.''

<HEADLINE> World Cup Soccer a Hot Ticket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- They came 90,185 strong -- fans flush  
with patriotic paint on their faces, giddy teen-age girls and their 
soccer moms, the president, a man gussied up like George 
Washington, even young players on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	They became part of the biggest women's sporting event in  
American history Saturday -- the 1999 World Cup final between the 
United States and China at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After the United States won it in a shootout, fans poured from  
the stadium, screaming, sweating and smiling as they waved flags 
and smeared the glistening red, white and blue paint from their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's way down, down, down, down,'' fans chanted, led by  
Jason Armheim, 26, of Upland, Calif., who was shirtless but wore a 
perspiration stained flag around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing great the whole time, but our goalie, man, she  
really won it for us,'' he shouted as the group ran into the 
parking lot, paying noisy tribute to American goalie Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	A few groups of Chinese fans wandered through the gates, folding  
their flags and posters, shaking their heads and shrugging their 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzan Shi, 30, from the San Francisco area, said she hoped to  
leave the stadium waving her Chinese flag in victory but was 
instead using it to shade herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if the team had played in China, things would have been  
different,'' she said. ``There was a real hometown advantage, but 
both teams played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-year-old Kristie Chavez from Tucson, Ariz., wiped her damp  
cheek, obliterating the American flag painted there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never boring,'' she said as she bounced and waved a  
flag. ``We didn't score for a while, but the end was very, very 
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the teen-age girls who filled the majority of seats at  
the stadium sported crutches, casts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game because it's rough and intense,'' said Alyssa  
Finkle, 15, as she limped into line wearing a mechanical leg brace. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister also plays,'' the young athlete said. ``And she has  
a rod in her leg now instead of a bone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of four moms and four daughters came from Tulsa, Okla.,  
to be as rowdy as they could, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer has screaming, yelling, jumping, kicking and  
hollering,'' said Becky Stewart, 16, vowing to do her share. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and her three teammates were quick to point out their  
team won the Oklahoma state championship and, like so many at the 
game, they have World Cup aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These girls on the field today give our girls heroes, people  
to look up to,'' said Lisa Price, 45, one of the mothers on the 
trip. ``We can go to football and baseball and enjoy it, but now, 
with women's soccer, we have people to relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Quezada, 33, of San Francisco, wore a white George  
Washington wig, a three-cornered hat and an American flag cape. The 
getup, along with his face paint, he said, was to make it as 
obvious as possible which team he was rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started putting all this together at midnight before I left  
and haven't been to sleep since,'' the ebullient fan said between 
blasts on a plastic trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great. I love seeing people get so excited about  
something that a lot of people haven't paid attention to before. 
Women's soccer is finally catching on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister wore a matching costume, while his father opted for a  
rubber Statue of Liberty mask. His mom chose to go as herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Red, white and blue were the dominant colors in the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	The American team arrived carrying three roses -- a bud in each  
color. They swapped those roses for the brass ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans didn't care about two-plus scoreless hours, saying the  
entire game was tense and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Non-soccer fans don't get it,'' said Wayne Isham, who ran  
through the parking lot cheering at game's end. ``From beginning to 
end, it was so tense it was non-stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Face painters, charging $1 for each American flag, said they  
transformed nearly 2,000 faces in the parking lot during the two 
hours before the gates opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Millea and her Manhattan Beach, Calif., soccer  
teammate Evie Pitts, both 13, chose the do-it-yourself approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, they took turns lying on the ground and  
covering their faces with their hands while the other spray-painted 
their hair the colors of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to paint our faces too, but we're waiting until  
the USA team starts playing,'' Millea said. ``Otherwise, we'll 
sweat and ruin it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Goodyear blimp flying overhead added to the patriotism  
with a flag on the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ate popcorn in a luxury box and called the  
game the ``biggest sporting event in the last decade,'' noting that 
more than 1 billion people were watching on television. Jennifer 
Lopez sang pregame songs and Hanson harmonized on the national 
anthem as four F-18s flew over the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	For beer vendors, it was unlike any other Rose Bowl sellout in  
memory. There was not a single buyer in line at Andy Zuniga's beer 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot younger people here, so we're not selling that  
much,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 feet away, at the souvenir stand, customers were lined  
up 20 deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Rose Bowl, police arrested 35 people for scalping,  
one for being drunk in public and two on warrants, police Cmdr. 
Mary Schander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Capt. Calvin Wells said 66 people were treated at first aid  
stations around the stadium. Nine were taken to area hospitals, he 
said, eight with heat-related problems and one with a heart 
problem. Wells said dehydration was the most common complaint and 
most of the victims were middle age to elderly.

<HEADLINE> Defense Contractor May Escape Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The Pentagon says it will excuse  
millions of dollars in fines against Lockheed Martin if the defense 
contractor can improve the performance of a new missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin faced $15 million in fines for failing to  
deliver a working defense system on time. But the Pentagon modified 
the company's contract to allow the company more time to fix the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent was not to penalize them,'' Jennifer Canaff,  
spokeswoman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense 
Organization, said Friday. ``The attempt was to gain more 
information and more data on how to make this missile system 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile  
defense system failed in March for the sixth time to intercept a 
flying target missile. 
</P>
<P>
	But company and Pentagon officials said the contract for the  
$3.8 billion system was changed after the fifth failure to allow it 
to escape penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those changes, the $15 million penalty for the March  
failure would be waived if it manages three successful intercepts 
by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Ashdown, spokesman for the Washington-based Taxpayers for  
Common Sense, criticized the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are allowed to fail as long as they get it right in the  
end,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Player Shot at Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Jimmy Robinson, a senior wide receiver for  
Kentucky, was shot twice during a party near the campus. He was 
hospitalized in good condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was shot in the upper left arm and left thumb, breaking  
both bones, a statement from the university said. Team physician 
Scott Mair said Robinson would be re-evaluated for further 
treatment during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Hal Mumme was out of town and could not be reached for  
comment, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington police said as many as 300 people attended a party at  
University Commons apartment complex swimming pool around midnight 
when a group of strangers crashed the party and fighting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that people were thrown into the pool and  
a man pulled out a handgun. Multiple shots were fired in the 
parking lot area, police Lt. James Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was the only person shot. He was hospitalized at UK  
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman left the scene and no arrests have been made, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, of Stone Mountain, Ga., played the last two seasons  
for Kentucky after transferring from Georgia Military College in 
1997. Last season, he caught 26 passes for 285 yards and two 
touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> State Wants Kevorkian Assets Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The state treasurer has filed a lawsuit  
against assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian in an attempt to 
charge him for the cost of keeping him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Oakland Circuit Court, asks the  
court to freeze all of Kevorkian's assets and to appoint a receiver 
-- in this case, the prison warden -- to control Kevorkian's funds, 
The Oakland Press reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint says Kevorkian is believed to have assets of  
$77,176 in a corporate bank account plus another $31,155 in another 
bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the 71-year-old Kevorkian was convicted of  
second-degree murder for the injection death of Lou Gehrig's 
patient Thomas Youk, and sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison. He 
is being held at the Oaks Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth told The Oakland Press he  
was aware of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to get it resolved,'' Morganroth said.  
``I think we are going to work this thing out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the state can take up to 90 percent of Kevorkian's  
assets to pay for prison, said Chris De Witt, spokesman for 
Attorney General Jennifer Granholm.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazi Parade Blocked in Idaho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Members of the Aryan Nations paraded  
through downtown streets Saturday under the protection of a federal 
court order, but were outshouted by protesters who forced the 
marchers to detour. 
</P>
<P>
	Four protesters were arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 20-minute parade, a few of the two dozen Aryans  
saluted their supporters in the crowd with the Nazi straight-arm 
salute before they got into their vehicles to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had urged people to ignore the march, but  
thousands of opponents gathered along the parade route, chanting 
``No Nazis! No KKK! No fascists! USA!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And three blocks into the parade, about 20 demonstrators sat  
down on Sherman Avenue and halted the march. Police immediately 
routed the Aryans on a one-block detour down a side street, then 
let them finish on a street they were detoured to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's that white power, guys?'' shouted protester Brad  
Nelson of Coeur d'Alene. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations, based in nearby Hayden Lake, is the political arm  
of the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which holds that God has 
ordained the formation of a whites-only homeland in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said four protesters were arrested on misdemeanor charges  
and released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department assigned 30 to 40 officers to monitor the  
parade, said police Capt. Carl Bergh. 
</P>
<P>
	The police force already was stretched thin because of a weekend  
hot rod rally and motorcycle show. The town has a year-round 
population of about 25,000, which can swell to as many as 100,000 
in the summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar parade in Coeur d'Alene a year ago, about 90 Aryan  
Nations marchers clashed with some 1,400 counter-demonstrators. Two 
dozen counter-demonstrators were arrested; some of them later won 
an $80,000 settlement from Kootenai County after claiming civil 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge rejected a move by  
municipal officials to move the march out of the downtown area and 
to a route beside a former garbage dump, ruling that it would be an 
unconstitutional infringement on free speech. The American Civil 
Liberties Union supported Aryan Nations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whites still have the right to speak as of this date,'' Aryan  
Nations leader Richard Butler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the city's pleas that people ignore the parade, the  
Coalition Against Nazis quickly promised to show opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing we want to do is send a message that the type  
of white supremacist violence that happened in Illinois will not be 
allowed to happen in the Northwest,'' said coalition member Ann 
Slater of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist Benjamin Smith went on a killing rampage  
through Illinois and Indiana last weekend, attacking blacks, Jews 
and Asians. Two people were killed and nine others were injured 
before Smith shot himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, there was shoving and shouting as about 80 white  
supremacists rallied in Coeur d'Alene City Park and were met by 
about 200 counter-demonstrators. No one was arrested.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Attends World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton joined thousands of  
soccer-crazed fans watching the United States defeat China in 
Saturday's finals of the women's World Cup, proclaiming it an 
``amazing'' day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most exciting sports event I have ever seen,''  
Clinton told the U.S. women's team in their locker room after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting yellow championship T-shirts, the players jumped up and  
down and chanted ``U.S.A'' as they posed for pictures with actors 
Arsenio Hall and Edward James Olmos before Clinton arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the women their winning performance in the  
double-overtime, penalty-kick shootout match was a lesson in 
``courage and endurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing day,'' Clinton said. ``We learned a lot  
today about soccer and about women athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by California Gov. Gray Davis, political  
adviser James Carville, brother Roger Clinton and his family, 
Hollywood producers and Arkansas friends Harry Thomason and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason and Christian Correy, the husband of American 
player Mia Hamm. Correy is a Marine based near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton greeted the Chinese team in their locker room.  
The players there crowded around him with their cameras and video 
recorders and lingered to have their pictures snapped with the 
president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to say to the whole team how much we admired your  
performance in the whole World Cup,'' Clinton told the Chinese team 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	As White House staffers began to herd the press away, Clinton  
outshouted them to call photographers back for one pose with the 
entire Chinese squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters later he had told the Chinese, ``We were  
very honored to have them in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ended a cross-country poverty tour on Thursday,  
but decided to remain on the West Coast for the championship game 
at the Rose Bowl. He headed back to the White House after the game, 
scheduling a post-midnight arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players invited the president to attend after Clinton,  
his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea saw a quarterfinal game last 
week outside Washington as the Americans defeated Germany to 
advance to the semifinals. The U.S. women later beat Brazil to move 
to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the first lady nor Chelsea attended Saturday's game.  
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tension of the championship game was a chilling of  
the diplomatic relationship between Washington and Beijing after 
NATO mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during 
allied airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, conspiracy theories surrounding the embassy bombing --  
which Beijing has refused to accept was a mistake -- have spilled 
over into the sporting arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Government-run media raised doubts about the evenhandedness of  
the referees for the championship game, saying officials in 
previous contests between the teams favored the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They also suggested U.S. organizers of the World Cup  
deliberately made the Chinese women trek back and forth across 
America and its four time zones in the competition's earlier 
rounds. But the U.S. women also played on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking in the game, Clinton relaxed in style in Los  
Angeles, staying in the Beverly Hills compound of supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle and golfing with actor Sylvester Stallone at a 
country club. 
</P>
<P>
	During the tour of poor areas in America, Clinton visited a  
coal-mining town in Kentucky, the Mississippi Delta and Los 
Angeles' Watts neighborhood. In South Dakota, where he toured 
dilapidated housing on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he stayed 
at the local Best Western.

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Warning on Raw Sprouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raw alfalfa, clover and radish sprouts are  
good sources of nutrients, but the Food and Drug Administration 
warned Friday they also carry the risk of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the FDA advised consumers to be aware that raw  
sprouts can be contaminated with salmonella and E. coli 0157 
bacteria, either of which can cause serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those persons who wish to reduce the risk of foodborne illness  
from sprouts are advised not to eat raw sprouts,'' the statement 
said. The warning is particularly important for people in high-risk 
categories, such as children, the elderly and those with weakened 
immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA first warned about risks from raw sprouts in a health  
advisory issued last August, and sprout growers have been acting to 
avoid spreading the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all these efforts to make raw sprouts safer, we  
continue to receive reports of illnesses associated with raw 
sprouts,'' the FDA Commissioner Jane Henney. ``Consumers need to 
understand that, at this time, the best way to control this risk is 
not to eat raw sprouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help control the contamination, the FDA said inspectors will  
test water used by commercial growers to produce sprouts and will 
monitor how well the industry adopts new, cleaner production 
techniques that the agency recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidelines also are being revised. These will focus on microbial  
testing, sanitation and seed quality and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new warning was prompted by a series of outbreaks in  
foodborne illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, 30 cases of food poisoning were reported in California  
and 70 cases in Colorado between March and May, blamed on the 
consumption of contaminated clover sprouts. During the first three 
months of the year, another 90 people were infected with salmonella 
in Oregon, Washington and California after eating alfalfa sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the illnesses were linked to alfalfa and clover  
sprouts, the FDA warned that ``all raw sprouts may pose a risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy adults usually recover from salmonella and E. coli 0157  
infections, but the illnesses can be quite serious among those 
susceptible including AIDS patients or cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy. E. coli 0157 can cause kidney failure, while 
salmonella can cause diarrhea, nausea, cramping and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that even raw sprouts grown in a home garden are  
risky, because some outbreaks of disease have been traced to 
contaminated seeds. Bacteria in the seeds can multiply among 
sprouts grown in clean conditions, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other FDA recommendations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Cook sprouts before eating them. This will reduce the risk  
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check for raw sprouts in sandwiches from restaurants and  
delicatessens, often used as garnish.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles Hold Ocean Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A flotilla made up of dozens of Cuban  
exiles conducted a memorial in international waters off Havana on 
Saturday to mark the five-year anniversary of the sinking of a 
tugboat filled with people trying to flee the communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democracy Movement, a Miami-based anti-Castro exile group,  
organized the flotilla to remember the ``13 de Marzo, a tugboat 
from Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans seeking to leave the island hijacked the tugboat, which  
was capsized by Cuban border patrols on July 13, 1994. Forty-one 
Cubans drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Several boats left from Key West early Saturday to the area  
where the tugboat sank, stopping 12 1/2 miles north of Havana, just 
outside Cuba's territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
	In past flotillas participants have thrown wreaths and flowers  
into the sea, prayed and sung the Cuban national anthem. Exiles 
Saturday also used mirrors to send signals to the people on the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard ship reported that people on the island were  
signaling back at the exiles, said Jeff Murphy, a U.S. Coast Guard 
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Comeback Welcome, Reassuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From old-fashioned semiconductor makers to  
newfangled Internet companies, the high-tech businesses that 
dominate the Nasdaq composite index are on a roll. They propelled 
the index to six new records over the course of seven recent 
trading sessions, and show no signs of flagging. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 21.21 to close at 2,793.07, a modest  
gain, but enough to lock in the latest record high close. The 
index, as important as the Dow Jones industrials to many investors, 
has tumbled and soared over the past year, but this past week's 
broad-based advance offered welcome reassurance that despite the 
youth of many of its companies, the Nasdaq remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Records are being set and smashed with stunning frequency in the  
continuing bull market, but the Nasdaq's gains are noteworthy 
nonetheless, for in the two months leading up to the streak, the 
index saw some dark moments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq struggled through much of May and June as investors  
moved their money away from technology shares and toward more 
conservative investments. The culprit? The threat of higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-growth, often high-priced technology companies that  
often feed the Nasdaq's growth faltered as the Federal Reserve 
debated whether to raise rates. Higher rates can endanger any stock 
by boosting the cost of borrowing and cutting into corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the technology companies that may post meager earnings on  
the promise of future growth are especially vulnerable, said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``When interest rates are high, I'm less likely to take a chance  
on a company that promises me results someday'' rather than now, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed ended the suspense June 30, raising interest rates a  
modest quarter-percentage point. And then a funny thing happened: 
Companies began dropping hints about their second-quarter earnings, 
and high-tech companies were able to entice investors by indicating 
they actually could deliver good results right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're through the preannouncements, and we got through with  
relatively few blowups,'' said Curt Rohrman, a fund manager and 
assistant vice president at USA Imco Equity Investments in San 
Antonio. ``The quarterly numbers should be very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! offered confirmation this past week, announcing it had  
earned 11 cents per share in the second quarter, above the 8 cents 
per share forecast by First Call Corp., and even surpassing the 
rumored 9 or 10 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock did slip a bit, as investors locked in profits after  
bidding it higher in the days leading up to the announcement. But 
Yahoo! has clearly helped the Nasdaq's gains, rising from 120 in 
early June to a peak of 178 1/8 July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	That high price illustrates one of the ironies of the Nasdaq.  
The index, which traditionally listed the smallest and youngest of 
the publicly traded companies has seen many fledgling firms balloon 
in size. Some have moved to the New York Stock Exchange in search 
of a higher profile, but high-tech powerhouses like Microsoft and 
Intel still trade through Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Those industry leaders are driving the recent runup, Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had very good relative performance, right across the  
board,'' he said, pointing to semiconductor makers like Intel, 
networking companies like Cisco Systems and Internet retailers like 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell joined the high-tech celebration Friday as Goldman, Sachs &AMP;  
Co. added the company, the nation's largest direct seller of 
personal computers, to its list of recommended stocks for private 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the recent gains heartens analysts, who last year  
bemoaned the soaring valuations of Internet stocks that showed few 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is maturing,'' Johnson said. ``Investors are now  
gravitating toward companies where there's a good chance the 
earnings will be better than estimates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq ended the week with a gain of 52.05 points, or 1.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials average set a record of its own Friday,  
rising 66.81 points to close at 11,193.70. The blue-chip index rose 
54.46 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 12.06 for the week, picking  
up 8.86 Friday to close at 1,403.28, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite was up 2.56 for the week,  
rising 3.63 Friday to 657.68. The American Stock Exchange composite 
picked up 10.31 on the week and closed at 812.73, rising 4.04 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of  
small-company stocks, inched up 1.47 for the week to 457.98, having 
risen 3.23 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $12.84 trillion, up $102.56 billion from last 
week. A year ago, the index was $10.88 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Takes 3rd in Soccer Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Brazil, considered the most improved  
women's team in the world, took third place in the World Cup on 
Saturday by beating Norway 5-4 on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in the last World Cup game Brazil played in the Rose  
Bowl, the 1994 men's final, a 0-0 tie led to a shootout. The 
Brazilians won that over Italy to take the crown, and they did the 
same thing to the Norwegians. 
</P>
<P>
	But they needed to go one extra round after the teams were tied  
4-4 through the required five shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ann Kristin Aarones, Norway's dangerous striker, put the  
ball over the net. That left it up to Formiga and the Brazilian 
midfielder sent a low shot into the right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil won the first shootout in the three Women's World Cups  
without the help of stars Pretinha and Sissi. Pretinha shot over 
the net on Brazil's first try, and Sissi didn't even shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	After Formiga won it, the Brazilians sped toward her and  
goalkeeper Maravilha, burying both of them in a pile of celebratory 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the early scoring chances were by Norway, which lacked  
marksmanship. While Brazil couldn't even get into the penalty area 
with the ball, the defending champion Norwegians often flowed 
quickly upfield. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they got in position, nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the Brazilians came alive, sparked by speedy winger  
Pretinha. Her breakaway effort was saved by a diving Nordby in the 
71st minute. Moments later, Sissi, who scored seven goals in the 
tournament, sent a left-footed shot from a sharp angle just past an 
unguarded net. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to the shootout -- FIFA suspended the 30-minute extra  
period for the game -- and Brazil's victory.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Looks at Events He Shaped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sitting in his 26th-floor Park Avenue office,  
against a backdrop of photos of himself with many of the 20th 
century's most influential people, Henry Kissinger looks out at a 
world drastically different from the one he shaped as America's top 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no recollection of what the Cold War was like,''  
Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep hearing about how tough foreign policy is now, but (in  
1969) we had a thermonuclear adversary with 15,000 nuclear weapons. 
When we came into office -- the administration under which I served 
-- there were 400 dead a week'' in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now when we have one dead, or there is one prisoner taken, we  
have a national emotional breakdown,'' he added in an interview 
with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it is U.S. relations with China and Russia, the peace  
process in the Middle East, ethnic conflict in Africa and 
southeastern Europe, or human rights abuses in Chile, Kissinger had 
a hand in all of it a quarter century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In his third and final volume of memoirs, ``Years of Renewal,''  
Kissinger aims to remind the world of the role he played in 1973-76 
as secretary of state for Presidents Nixon and Ford and of the 
context in which he made decisions that still reverberate today. 
</P>
<P>
	Where U.S. policy was successful, Kissinger gives credit to Ford  
and himself. Where the administration failed, he blames the 
Democrat-controlled Congress or other outside forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Kissinger candidly assesses world leaders -- Nixon  
(flawed), Ford (authentic), Mao Tse-tung (determined), Leonid 
Brezhnev (envious), Yitzhak Rabin (wise), Augusto Pinochet 
(necessary), Mobutu Sese Seko (ostentatious). 
</P>
<P>
	And he gives an insider's view of detente with Russia, expanded  
relations with China, shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, the 
division of Cyprus and civil war in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these issues remain major challenges for President  
Clinton and his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of relations with China has been heated up by  
claims its agents stole U.S. nuclear secrets, but China is now a 
major American trading partner. Such things must be kept in 
perspective, Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are the world's most advanced technologically, you  
are expected to be spied on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental issue, whether we want to stop China from  
becoming a strong power, we don't admit to ourselves. On this we 
need to debate because if we go down that road, you are in an 
endless confrontation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Chile, Kissinger denies allegations the United States was  
behind Pinochet's 1973 coup and says that while he welcomed the 
overthrow of Salvador Allende's Marxist government, he told 
Pinochet the general's record on human rights complicated relations 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger declined to comment on Spain's criminal torture  
charges against the former Chilean dictator, who is currently under 
arrest in London fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do think the procedure, where a magistrate in one  
country -- where the alleged crimes did not occur -- can issue an 
arrest warrant for a former leader of a country elsewhere and that 
they then become criminalized through the extradition procedure is 
extremely dangerous,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No senior American official would be safe if this became an  
accepted practice, because anybody can be accused of something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon first appointed Kissinger to be his national security  
adviser in 1969 and then promoted him to secretary of state in 
September 1973. Kissinger remained in that post after Nixon 
resigned and served under Ford until President Carter took office 
in early 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	A refugee from Nazi Germany, Kissinger taught political science  
and international affairs at Harvard University before entering 
public life and now runs an international consulting firm, 
Kissinger Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookshelves in his office sag under the weight of thick  
autobiographies, many written by his contemporaries. Kissinger 
himself has been prolific -- his two previous 1,000-page memoir 
volumes, ``The White House Years'' and ``Years of Upheaval,'' put 
his combined autobiography at more than 3,000 pages, or more than a 
page for every day in office. 
</P>
<P>
	He still carefully observes U.S. foreign policy and sees some  
parallels between the Vietnam War and the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The similarity is in the sense that the Kennedy and Johnson  
administrations went into Vietnam thinking that they could win with 
technological superiority, not assessing the element of endurance, 
and this is clearly true in Kosovo and the Balkans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you use military force, and you are not willing to suffer  
casualties, then you get into the dilemma we are now in Kosovo. And 
when the only way to win is to make the population of the adversary 
suffer for it, that is a strange definition of morality and of 
humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger said U.S. presidents must always remain focused on  
what is in the national interest, something he contends Nixon 
understood well and Clinton does not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not accept this concept of humanitarian foreign policy.  
In specific, horrible cases like (the 1994 genocide in) Rwanda, I 
could say that the conscience of mankind is so offended that one 
really cannot be in a world where that happens,'' he said. ``In 
Kosovo, I believe we could have prevented the worst of ethnic 
cleansing by diplomacy, and I think we started down this path at 
least prematurely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for improving relations with Russia, Kissinger said there  
is a danger in today's Russia of communists and nationalists 
joining forces to oppose the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the war in Kosovo contributes to this because it has  
created a public reaction (in Russia) that everyone agrees goes far 
beyond the Moscow elite,'' he said. ``So I think there is a danger 
of something similar to National Socialism in Germany, which is 
what the Nazis were.''

<P>
	ELLSWORTH, Wis. (AP) -- Four children were killed Saturday when a  
fire engulfed their grandparents' house. The mother of three of the 
children was also killed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was reported around 12:40 a.m. at the home David and  
Nancy Beyer, both 58, of the town of Salem in the northwest part of 
the state. They escaped the blaze with their 10-year-old 
granddaughter Jordana Beyer, the sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was in serious condition Saturday. The Beyers were not  
injured.

</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst fire I've seen since I've been here for 13  
years and just looking at the ages of these children, it's hard to

<HEADLINE> Cuban Migrant Boat Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. Coast Guard crews searched the waters off  
Florida today for a migrant Cuban woman missing after a boat 
collided with a Coast Guard cutter and sank. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorized 25-foot wooden boat carrying 12 Cubans toward  
Florida's shores collided with the cutter at about 11 p.m. Friday 
while attempting to evade the Coast Guard, said Jeff Murphy, a 
Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were rescued and awaited Border Patrol officials  
aboard a cutter today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, four helicopters, four cutters and a few small boats  
were helping look for the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're searching along the shoreline and expanding outward ...  
I think so far they've covered 200 miles,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans' boat was attempting to cut across the bow of the  
cutter 10 miles east of Hillsborough Inlet, which is about 36 miles 
north of Miami. The collision sank the boat in six minutes, Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash comes amid tension between Cuban exiles in Miami and  
the Coast Guard in the wake of an incident June 29, when eight 
Coast Guardsmen used pepper spray and fire hoses on six Cubans 
trying to make it to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Live television broadcasts of the incident enraged many of  
Miami's Cuban community, who protested by blocking traffic on two 
major roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Coast Guardsmen were removed this week from law  
enforcement duty pending an internal investigation.

<HEADLINE> Four More Satellites Put in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Four more Globalstar communication  
satellites rocketed into orbit today in the second launch of its 
kind in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing Delta II rocket took off at 4:45 a.m. The satellites --  
worth about $15 million each -- separated in pairs about an hour 
later. High wind had forced a two-day launch delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Globalstar, based in San Jose, Calif., plans to begin providing  
wireless telephone service this fall. Today's launch boosted the 
number of Globalstar satellites in orbit to 28; altogether, 48 
satellites are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Globalstar launch is planned for later this month and  
yet another in August, also aboard Delta rockets. Four satellites 
were placed in orbit June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's launch cost about $115 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral  
Space and Communications Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.

	BOSTON (AP) -- It's the stadium where Carlton Fisk waved a home  
run fair in the 1975 World Series, the same stadium where Bucky 
Dent's three-run homer carried the New York Yankees over the Boston 
Red Sox in the 1978 AL East playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the stadium that will be on a national stage again Tuesday  
night when baseball's best gather for the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's the stadium that, a few years from now, may not exist.  
</P>
<P>
	It's 87-year-old Fenway Park, where the Green Monster, 37 feet  
high but just 310 feet down the left field line, turns pop flies 
into homers and vicious liners into wall-banging singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk and Dent hit their balls over that wall. On Tuesday,  
sluggers Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and others will take aim at it 
just as opposing sides have been swinging away in the battle over 
renovating or replacing the park that opened on April 20, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Red Sox want to look at it as somewhat of a  
farewell party,'' said Michael Governor, spokesman for Save Fenway 
Park!, which has an architect-designed plan to renovate the 
stadium. ``The true all-star this coming Tuesday is Fenway Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials have met with the preservationists but say the  
plan doesn't have a chance of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really does not,'' said Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for  
the club. ``We understand the emotion that pushes people to 
renovate Fenway Park. No one loves Fenway Park more than the Red 
Sox. We looked at renovation for a long time but it clearly is just 
not feasible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's national spotlight could point out the stadium's  
shortcomings -- narrow seats and aisles, outdated restrooms and too 
few concession stands. St. John said bringing the stadium into 
compliance with handicapped-access regulations makes renovation 
even less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Red Sox have proposed a $545 million stadium  
project just across Yawkey Way from the current one. Groundbreaking 
could begin in the fall of 2000, with the first game possible in 
the 2003 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be worked out is financing. The Red Sox say they'd like  
to keep public aid to a minimum. But they may need $200 million for 
infrastructure work besides the $350 million they plan to spend on 
the stadium. They also must obtain land now occupied by 24 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be about 100 luxury boxes, and the current capacity  
of 33,871, lowest in the majors, would be boosted to about 45,000. 
That would provide money for a team that hasn't won the World 
Series since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	The current infield, part of the grandstand and the third-base  
dugout would be preserved, and the Green Monster would be moved 
closer to the shortstop area. All that would serve as part of the 
entrance to a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is using All-Star events to show off its plan. A model  
of the new stadium is on display at FanFest, where thousands of 
fans flock to exhibits. Television monitors there show a web page 
in which fans can comment on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball commissioner Bud Selig has said renovation can't  
work, the preservationists are taking advantage of the national 
spotlight as well. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned rallies in conjunction with Sunday's Futures Game  
involving top minor-league prospects, Monday night's home run derby 
and Tuesday night's main event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all kinds of banners and signs,'' Governor said. ``I  
don't know if you necessarily want to call it a protest march. It's 
a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The All-Star game represents a wonderful opportunity to take  
this campaign of ours national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if, in the end, the Red Sox get their way.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you go through the list of what everybody wants to  
change, you cannot bring this ballpark to a modern facility without 
tearing it all down,'' St. John said. ``By the time we've done 
that, we haven't preserved anything.''

<HEADLINE> China Stays Up to Watch World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In the end, it was the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite its billing as a grudge match between two countries with  
lots of animosity, China's loss to the United States in a grueling 
women's World Cup showdown brought admiration from hardened Chinese 
soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams played their best. Finally it came down to luck,''  
said Meng Xianyu, one of 60 soccer enthusiasts packed into the 
smoky Soccer Buff's Cafe. ``The American team just outlasted the 
Chinese team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer fans throughout Beijing spent a sleepless night Saturday  
waiting to watch their team take on the Americans in the World Cup 
final, shown live on nationwide television starting at 4 a.m. local 
time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome -- a loss on penalty kicks after two overtime  
periods-- drew huge cries of disappointment. Americans beat China 
5-4 in the shootout following a 0-0 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that match was not fair. That ball went in,''  
said office worker Xu Li, referring to a header by Fan Yunjie. She 
cried when the Chinese lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just too tragic, too tragic,'' said Ma Zhengmei.  
</P>
<P>
	China's state-run media fanned suspicions that referees favored  
the Americans in earlier clashes between the two teams. Newspapers 
worried that the Chinese team was weak, unable to find real Chinese 
food and having been made to crisscross the United States in 
earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. arranged it this way for the final battle,'' said  
Wang, the businessman. ``We feel we haven't gotten enough respect'' 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of possible trouble, a busload of 30 police  
waited by the side of the U.S. Embassy, which was stoned by tens of 
thousands of Chinese for four days after the May 7 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Heightened emotions in China's capital, however, were mainly  
channeled toward the game. On the contest's eve, the Beijing Youth 
Daily reported that more than nine out of 10 people in the 116 
households it surveyed said they would watch the game live, despite 
the hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's late hour meant news of the loss did not make it into  
Sunday newspapers. But state television broadcast the results 
repeatedly. National dailies printed a brief account of President 
Jiang Zemin's telephoned encouragement to the Chinese team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have demonstrated fully the aspiration to win honors for  
the motherland,'' Jiang said in comments carried by the official 
Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you win or lose, the whole nation and the people will  
extend their warmest greetings to you,'' Jiang added. 
</P>
<P>
	A refined appreciation for the game and the importance of the  
moment prevailed at the Soccer Buff's Cafe. Many fans debated the 
strengths of the opposing teams: the Americans had the physical 
strength while the Chinese had experience and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny Sichuan restaurant in a working-class south Beijing  
neighborhood was festooned with balloons, red for Chinese national 
team and green for Beijing's top men's soccer club, Guo'an. 
Cigarette-filled ashtrays, watermelon rinds and beer bottles 
littered the tables. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal thing to lose on penalty kicks. Even Italy's  
greatest star Baggio missed a penalty kick in a World Cup. That's 
not so bad,'' said Wang Zhanjun, an unemployed factory worker and 
frequent present at the cafe. ``It's an honor for the Chinese 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the men's team has never qualified for a World Cup,  
soccer in China has largely been viewed as a male sport. The 
success of the women's team is helping win them some long overdue 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our dorm, we only have posters of male soccer players.  
There aren't any posters or photos of women soccer stars,'' Ren 
Liping, a 21-year-old member of the Beijing women's soccer team, 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This might change that. Now, maybe someone will take pictures  
of us,'' teammate Luo Ting said.

	Clinton Urges Preventative Medicare  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton today said preventive  
medical care must be made affordable to older Americans who rely on 
Medicare. ``No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive 
care they need,'' the president said in his weekly radio address. 
Under his proposal, co-payments and deductibles for preventive 
medical care such as hepatitis B vaccinations, colo-rectal and 
prostate cancer screening and diabetes management, would be 
eliminated for Medicare beneficiaries.

downtown streets. But they were outshouted by protesters who forced 
the marchers to detour. Four protesters were arrested. After the 
20-minute parade, some of the two dozen Aryans saluted supporters 
in the crowd with the Nazi straight-arm gesture. City officials had 
urged people to ignore the march, but thousands of opponents 
gathered along the parade route, chanting ``No Nazis! No KKK! No

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Acknowledging slow progress in deploying

today that NATO has plans to respond with force if Serbs resist. 
Amid growing signs of tension between Serbia and Montenegro and 
daily outbreaks of violence in Kosovo, the arriving Kosovo 
peacekeeping force, or KFOR, is prepared for trouble. ``We have 
contingency plans in the event there were any action taken by 
Milosevic against KFOR,'' Cohen said after talks with Nordic and

monitors tracked the exact location of each aircraft. The ``ADS-B'' 
system, more accurate than radar and with a longer range than

across the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir. Pilots flying 
French-built Mirages and Russian-made MiGs dropped as much as 15

hostile Catholic turf. The Northern Ireland Parades Commission's 
decision to lift its earlier ban came after leaders of the Orange

<HEADLINE> China Stays Up to Watch World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Soccer coach Cheng Wenkuan planned to stay up all  
night, hoping to see his former team members vanquish the 
Americans. In Li Yan's restaurant, the party was just getting 
started when most people would usually be in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Beijing seemed set to spend a sleepless night watching  
their women's soccer team clash with the U.S. team in the World Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be open all night. Who could sleep anyway?'' said Li  
Yan, manager of the Soccer Fans restaurant in south Beijing. Her 
tiny Sichuan restaurant, with its soccer ball-motif floors, was 
packed with fans, players and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese sports fans disappointed by the failure of their men's  
team in international competition are hoping for vindication in 
Saturday's match. Rancor over the NATO bombing of Beijing's embassy 
in Belgrade has left many eager to see their team give the 
Americans a good trouncing. 
</P>
<P>
	China's state-run Central Television planned to carry the game  
live on two of its national channels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beijing Youth Daily reported that more than nine out of 10  
people in the 116 households it surveyed said they would watch the 
game live, despite the hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better Watch Our Sisters!'' the China Sports Daily said in its  
lead article Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese team is determined not to let the nation down. It  
will show its standards, its style, matching the U.S. side in 
skill, strategy, ability, mentality, fight, teamwork, fortitude, 
murderousness, and grit,'' said a front-page article in the Beijing 
Morning Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Beijing women's soccer team seemed elated by the  
prospect of the national team's victory as they lightheartedly ran 
drills in a muggy, dragonfly-ridden stadium in the southern part of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	To the great disappointment of many Chinese, the men's team has  
never qualified for a World Cup, let alone been in position to win 
one. Yet soccer in China has by-and-large been viewed as a man's 
sport. The success of the women's team is helping win them some 
long overdue recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our dorm, we only have posters of male soccer players.  
There aren't any posters or photos of women soccer stars,'' 
complained Ren Liping, a 21-year-old member of the Beijing squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``This might change that. Now, maybe someone will take pictures  
of us,'' teammate Luo Ting chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of the Chinese national squad started with the  
Beijing team. Coach Cheng said he hopes to see at least several 
more move up. 
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Han Jianrong fretted that as the visiting team,  
China might not get a fair match. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a great match, but only if it's a fair one,'' Han  
said. ``It's always different for the visitor and the host.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's state-run media has fanned suspicions that referees were  
biased in favor of the Americans in earlier clashes between the two 
teams. The atmosphere of mistrust following the Belgrade bombing 
has accentuated them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her doubts, Han said she expected China to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides have their strong points. The American's are  
physically strong. But our team is better in skill, strategy and 
spirit,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- James Farmer, who served alongside  
Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights giants of the 1950s 
and '60s, died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, a founder of the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942,  
was considered one of the Big Four civil rights leaders in the 
1960s, with King, NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League head 
Whitney Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer's most celebrated accomplishment as head of CORE was to  
lead the 1961 Freedom Rides, a nonviolent effort to desegregate 
interstate buses and terminals. However, participants encountered 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer helped recruit CORE members James Chaney, Andrew Goodman  
and Michael Schwerner, all of whom were murdered in Mississippi in 
1964 during the Freedom Rides. Their slayings were the subject of 
the 1988 movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer moved to the Fredericksburg area in 1980 to write his  
autobiography, ``Lay Bare the Heart.'' The book charted his 
involvement in that struggle, and also his personal observations 
about gradually going blind from a rare ailment called retinal 
vascular occlusion. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last year presented Farmer with the  
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ronny Graham, who wrote episodes of  
``M-A-S-H'' and ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' died Sunday. He was 
79. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also collaborated with Mel Brooks on such films as ``The  
Inquisition,'' ``History of the World, Part I,'' ``Spaceballs'' and 
``To Be or Not to Be.''

	LONDON (AP) -- Pipe Major Angus MacDonald, considered one of the  
world's best bagpipers, died June 25. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The place and cause of death were not given.  
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald won the prestigious title Piobaire Os Cionn Chaich, or  
``piper above all others'' in 1981. Throughout his 27-year military 
career in the Scots Guards, MacDonald served as household piper to 
Queen Elizabeth II, a personal piper to the governor of Edinburgh 
Castle and a senior instructor at the Army School of Piping. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire  
in 1983.

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Bill Owens, a former play-by-play  
announcer who broadcast Florida State's national title games in 
baseball and basketball during the early 1970s, died Wednesday of 
pancreatic cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens was at the microphone in Florida State's 2-1 loss to  
Southern California in the 1970 College World Series and the 
Seminoles' 81-76 loss to UCLA in the 1972 NCAA basketball title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens left his radio play-by-play duties after the 1972 season,  
but continued to work as a color commentator in football through 
the 1974 season and did occasional TV play-by-play through the 
1970s.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Torch singer Roberta Sherwood, known for her  
recordings ``Up a Lazy River'' and ``You're Nobody 'Til Somebody 
Loves You,'' died Monday of heart failure and cancer. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sherwood was a popular singer on the vaudeville circuit  
from age 11. When she married Broadway showman Don Lanning in 1938, 
she confined her singing to the Miami nightclub they ran for nearly 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Comic Red Buttons and columnist Walter Winchell began touting  
the singer, and she was eventually booked in clubs from New York's 
Copacabana to Las Vegas' Frontier Hotel and Hollywood's Mocambo. 
</P>
<P>
	She gained a recording contract and appeared on such TV shows as  
``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ``The Steve Allen Show,'' ``The Jackie 
Gleason Show,'' ``The Garry Moore Show'' and Edward R. Murrow's 
``Person to Person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other favorites she recorded were ``Make Someone Happy,''  
``How Deep Is the Ocean,'' ``These Foolish Things'' and ``Stormy 
Weather.''

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Backs Indian Fund Oversight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While defending in a civil lawsuit his plan to  
correct widespread problems with a $500 million Indian trust fund 
program, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt says some court 
supervision of the trust accounts are justified and welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt resumed testifying today after more than eight hours on  
the stand Friday in the month-old trial of a lawsuit filed by 
American Indians demanding the courts overhaul the trust fund 
system. Under the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the system has been 
plagued by shoddy bookkeeping and missing records. 
</P>
<P>
	Insisting he is a longtime supporter of Indians dating back to  
his work 30 years ago as legal adviser to the Navajos, Babbitt 
clashed repeatedly with plaintiff attorney Elliott Levitas over how 
aggressive Babbitt has been in dealing with Indian trust fund 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Levitas cited a Senate hearing transcript from January  
1993, when Babbitt, then only five days into his job as interior 
secretary, promised action ``in 60 days'' to look into trust fund 
accounting problems. At the time, the transcript showed, the remark 
was greeted with laughter, noted Levitas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth was expected to hear closing  
arguments late next week, although it's not certain when he will 
issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, the closing government witness in the case, said Friday  
that he would favor a court-appointed advisory committee to oversee 
and settle dispute as the government overhauls the management of 
the trust fund system. But he insisted it would be wrong to take 
responsibility for the accounts from the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
in the Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The involvement of the court is very important,'' he said.  
``It sends a message that's heard in Congress, particularly on the 
budget issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt defended a plan he put in place a year ago aimed at  
correcting decades of problems in administration of the Indian 
trust fund which the government concedes includes a record-keeping 
morass that has made it impossible to determine how the money, 
involving more than 300,000 personal accounts, should be 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned by the plaintiffs' lawyer, Babbitt acknowledged  
that his plan would not resolve all of the problems, but using a 
nautical metaphor he insisted, ``We are proceeding toward the safe 
harbor. ... We're almost there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Elliott Levitas suggested to Babbitt that ships have  
been known to sink close to shore and that his plan falls short of 
ensuring that tens of thousands of Indians, many of them poor, will 
receive the trust fund money due them. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress directed in 1994 that the management problems be  
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit are asking Lamberth  
to appoint a special master to take over the program from the BIA, 
and eventually turn management of the accounts over to a private 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BIA has a poor track record,'' Elouise Cobell, a member of  
the Blackfeet Nation and the lead plaintiff in the case, said 
during a break in the trial Friday. She said she has no confidence 
in Babbitt moving aggressively to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobell said the government, in addition to straightening out the  
trust fund records, should reimburse Indian account holders the 
money that has been lost over the years because of the problem. 
``It's at least into the billions of dollars,'' she maintained, 
although the government has argued such estimates are broad 
exaggerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is limited to issues on how to correct problems in the  
Indian trust fund management system. Lamberth has left the question 
of whether the government must reimburse Indians any money -- and if 
so, how much -- to a second trial, probably later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has acknowledged the Indian accounts are in  
disarray. Incomplete receipts and disbursement records are 
scattered in more than 100 BIA offices and many of the accounts are 
only a few dollars -- a few pennies in some cases -- because holdings 
over the years have been splintered as inheritances moved through 
generations of Indian families. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from rent, royalties and other income from 11  
million acres of land owned by individual Indians, many of whom are 
very poor. The lawsuit address only accounts held by individuals. 
The BIA also controls an additional $2.5 billion in trust funds 
that belong to tribes, but that is not at issue in the case.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Town Evacuated After Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- A 4-foot-diameter water main ruptured in a  
towering spout of water Saturday, and residents were evacuated by 
rubber raft as their neighborhood flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	Water flowed 2 1/2 feet deep in the streets of a five-block area.  
</P>
<P>
	``The water is shooting 100 feet in the air. It looks like the  
Old Faithful geyser,'' said John Blake, whose home was not among 
those flooded. ``The houses are really getting pounded. It must be 
millions of gallons of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency personnel used rubber rafts to evacuate people whose  
homes were flooded. The geysers was reduced to a trickle by late 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported. Local officials had no immediate  
explanation for the break, but Blake said the city had been working 
on old water mains in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the break happened, my power went out and when I went  
outside I could barely see across the street because of the water 
spout,'' said Bob Dowgos, whose house escaped damage. ``I've seen a 
lot of water main breaks since I work for a plumbing company but 
nothing like this.''

<HEADLINE> Rivals Working for Gore Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bob Squier and Carter Eskew, once partners in  
a top Democratic consulting firm, had a bitter parting of the ways 
before Al Gore's presidential campaign brought them back together. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials see the reunion of the two bitter rivals  
as good politics; Republicans call it an act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier is both a close adviser and friend to Gore and a  
specialist in political advertising for the campaign. Eskew, who 
has described Squier as his mentor and has known Gore for years, 
was hired last week to help refine Gore's message. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair split up more than six years ago. And they have given  
conflicting reasons for Eskew's departure, although Eskew 
acknowledges leaving the firm without talking to Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line on this is we are already working together  
with the common goal of getting Al Gore elected president,'' Squier 
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``One of my partners just met 
with him. We're all working together to get the vice president 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic consultant Geoff Garin said Eskew and Squier have ``a  
lot of history'' to work through. ``They've been put in a difficult 
position, but they're both professionals. My bet is they're going 
to work through it, but it's going to take some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said Eskew's hiring should  
not be taken as a sign that something was amiss with the vice 
president's campaign. ``It's a sign that we are building a strong 
media team to get the vice president's message out to the American 
people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans portrayed it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is desperate,'' said Mike Collins, a spokesman for the  
Republican National Committee. ``He has Bill Clinton 
second-guessing him, Hillary Clinton upstaging him and Bill Bradley 
nipping at his heels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is leading in the race for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, but Bradley has raised enough money to challenge him. 
In a head-to-head matchup with the Republican front-runner, Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, Gore trails by as many as 15 percentage points 
in recent national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier said he and Eskew didn't talk with each other after Eskew  
left their firm because ``there wasn't any reason for us to talk 
together. Now there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to go into details about their dispute and said the  
media was making too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story Friday, The New York Times quoted Squier as saying he  
had not talked publicly about Eskew's reasons for leaving the firm 
``because it would be harmful to Gore if I did.'' He later called 
the newspaper back to say Eskew left in a money dispute. Eskew told 
the Times he left the firm because he needed to establish himself 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew declined a request for an interview Friday, as did  
campaign manager Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's huge bad blood,'' said Dick Morris, a former  
consultant to President Clinton and now a frequent critic of the 
administration. ``Even if these guys were best friends, you don't 
bring in two rival firms to do your media and your polling -- 
certainly you don't bring in two sworn enemies. It's like hiring 
the Albanians and the Serbs to work on your campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said a rivalry between the two aides that is played out  
in the media could undermine a Gore campaign that already ``is 
struggling badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew is a longtime confidant of Gore and worked on Clinton's  
1992 campaign. He has been a partner in the issues advocacy firm of 
Bozell Eskew. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew's clients include pharmaceutical manufacturers, a life  
insurance foundation and Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield, New York 
state's largest health care company. He also produced a 
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for the tobacco industry 
that is credited with helping kill the Senate's tobacco bill last 
year. The American Lung Association protested his hiring by the 
Gore team.

<HEADLINE> Will Women's Soccer Now Prosper? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Now that the Women's World Cup has been  
a rousing success financially and artistically, the questions 
begin: 
</P>
<P>
	What does it all mean? Will women's soccer prosper, both here  
and abroad? Is a professional league on the U.S. horizon? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is sure, but riding the euphoria of the last three weeks,  
everyone is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some small way, we have all been a part of history,'' says  
Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee and the 
guiding force behind the most successful women's sports event ever. 
``This tournament has demonstrated how our sport is growing all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift and the way the tournament  
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a 
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say, 
`That event is responsible for the development of women's 
sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The development of women's soccer is the more pertinent topic  
right now. Another showcase is coming up, in Sydney next September. 
Australia also is bidding for the 2003 Women's World Cup and has no 
competition right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a difficult act to follow the great tournament the  
U.S. has been able to stage,'' said Basic Scarsella, chairman of 
Soccer Australia. ``It will come following the 2000 Olympic Games 
and that will give us some interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings for U.S. team games have surpassed those for the  
Stanley Cup, and a sellout crowd of 90,000 for Saturday's 
championship match between the hosts and China helped push the 
average attendance to more than 38,500 for 17 tournament dates. 
</P>
<P>
	With a much smaller population, Australia might expect to  
average 15,000 fans at each game, although Scarsella noted that his 
nation may have deeper soccer roots than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the organizing committee in the United States has been  
able to do is market to a different audience,'' Scarsella said. 
``They've tapped a market that's never been tapped before, and 
great credit should go to the organizers for being able to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it must continue doing that, leading the way, if the legacy  
of WWC '99 is to be a lasting one. 
</P>
<P>
	``American companies are doing a great job of promoting the  
athletes,'' Messing said. ``The media has provided an avenue to the 
public and to make them accessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, though, it is their talent that is the deciding  
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That talent, at least in this country, needs a steady place to  
exhibit itself. The national team almost certainly will stage a 
tour of exhibition games against other countries later this year. 
When the Olympic squad is chosen, it, too, will be on display in 
numerous exhibitions and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after the 2000 Olympics, a U.S. league of some sort becomes  
a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is to have a league of our own,'' Brandi  
Chastain said. ``We really don't have a place to stay sharp. 
Without a place for our young players to play, it will be hard for 
us to be as successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, with the way women's soccer abroad is improving, the  
Americans' spot among the elite no longer is so secure. Although 
college programs are strong, those players -- especially ones who 
are not quite at the national team level -- must have a place to 
hone their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer already has begun studying a plan for a women's  
league. Just as with the startup of Major League Soccer, which 
didn't occur until two years after the 1994 men's World Cup was 
held here, the establishment of a women's league won't be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a necessity for us to stay successful,'' says Lauren  
Gregg, the longtime U.S. assistant coach and a former head coach at 
North Carolina and Virginia. ``What we classified as professional 
and nonprofessional and successful and unsuccessful may be 
different than the traditional professional league. For us, a 
professional league needs to be something that pays our players a 
salary to train the way they need to train, and develops our 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could pay our best players to play and train year-round and  
take the onus off U.S. Soccer, which has made a huge investment in 
this team. That's why we're successful, but they're not in the 
long-term position to pay our players. At the same time, if we 
don't have a league, our schedule is so demanding they have to pay 
them, because the players are basically full-time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't a lot of money in women's soccer, either. The U.S.  
players will make a bonus of around $12,500 each for the World Cup. 
While Chastain, Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and a few 
other veterans will do just fine with endorsements and personal 
appearances after the tournament, some of the others aren't likely 
to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our younger players have to choose, `Do I go into  
another career, or do I starve and stay in soccer forever?''' Gregg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option is to play in the few women's pro leagues that  
exist, in countries such as Brazil and Germany, or are developing, 
particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty uncertain,'' Foudy said. ``There's a lot of  
questions. We know we'll get back together for some games, go to 
residency (camp), then have some games before the Olympics. And 
then ... then what?''
