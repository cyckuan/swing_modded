<HEADLINE> China's Largest Oilfield Endangered by Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DORBOD (Heilongjiang), August 12 (Xinhua) -- Daqing city in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province is taking emergency
steps to protect Daqing Oil Field, the country's largest, from
being flooded.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, floodwaters overflew the Haila Embankment along the
Nenjiang River in the city's Mongolia Autonomous County of
Dorbod, as the river's water level has been continuing to rise.
</P>
<P>
The city mobilized nearly 40,000 people, including 3,000 oil
workers, to reinforce the embankment, and collected more than two
million sandbags, 110,000 square meters of cloth, 20 tons of iron
wires, and 7,800 wooden piles for the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
Daqing Oil Field produces more than 50 million tons of crude
oil annually, accounting for more than one-third of the nation's
total petroleum output.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cotton Crop Suffers From Prolonged Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The lingering drought and
other problems in the southern part of this country is likely to
reduce the U.S. cotton output by 24 percent this year as compared
with 1997, the Agriculture Department projected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers had already planted less cotton due to a three-year
decline in prices. The extreme dry weather and heat in Texas, the
top cotton-producing state, has slashed this year's expected
harvest there by 40 percent, or more than 2 million 480-pound
bales, compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
Blamed for the bad weather, about 1.9 million acres of cotton
have been abandoned in Texas, or about 37 percent of the acres
planted this year.
</P>
<P>
In the second largest cotton-producing state, California, the
prolonged wet weather that triggered soil fungus disease has also
caused problems in cotton production. That state's cotton crop is
forecast at 1.8 million bales, down 32 percent from a year
earlier, as planting and growth were well behind their normal
pace.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the cotton harvest is estimated at 14.3 million bales,
as compared with 18.8 million bales last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ideal weather elsewhere means the fall soybean
harvest remains on track to set a record, the corn crop figures to
be the second-largest ever and wheat yields are forecast to reach
an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Corn production is forecast at 9.59 billion bushels, which
would be 2 percent more than 1997 and second only to the 1994
harvest of 10.1 billion bushels (a bushel of corn is about 25.42
kilograms).
</P>
<P>
The soybean harvest is projected at 2.82 billion bushels, up 4
percent from 1997 and the third record in as many years (a bushel
of soybean is equivalent to some 27.216 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
Production for all types of wheat is estimated at 2.55 billion
bushels, up 1 percent from last year largely because of record
yields of 43 bushels per acre (a bushel of wheat is some 27.24
kilograms).

<HEADLINE> African Leaders to Visit Uganda, Rwanda for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi Wednesday said a verification team comprising
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania would visit Uganda and
Rwanda to establish the facts behind the tension in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Mahachi said
the team would visit the two countries to establish the extent of
their involvement in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-Tutsi Banyamulenge within the DRC military rebelled
against DRC President Laurent Kabila on August 2 in the eastern
part of the vast central African country, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has since spread to other areas while relations
between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Kabila, and lately
between the DRC leader and Rwandan leader Pasteur Bizimungu, have
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi denied that Zimbabwe had sent troops to the DRC to
help Kabila's government against the rebels, saying such reports
were only "imaginations of the press".
</P>
<P>
He, however, said Zimbabwe was willing to help the DRC if it
requested for military aid.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed as untrue reports that Harare had
deliberately left out South Africa from the emergency meeting
held in Zimbabwe's northern resort town of Victoria Falls last
Friday and Saturday to discuss the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by seven heads of state and
government from southern and eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"For one Museveni was responsible for all the invitations, we
were just a host country, and anyway our president and the South
African President (N24son Mandela) do not have any conflict going
on," said Mahachi.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Prices Pick Up in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. homes prices rose
more quickly than inflation in most of the nation's metro areas in
the second quarter, the National Association of Realtors reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nationwidely, the median home price increased to 131,100
dollars during the April-June quarter, 6 percent higher than a
year earlier, as compared with an inflation rate in consumer
prices of just 1.7 percent over the same period, according to the
association.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that the healthy gains in home values could
help support consumer confidence that is being threatened by the
stock market's Asia-inspired gyrations.
</P>
<P>
Of the 132 metro areas surveyed by the real estate association,
only nine reported price declines. The worst came in Trenton, New
Jersey, where the median dropped 5.4 percent to 135,400 dollars;
Albany, New York, down 3.9 percent to 103,200 dollars; and Canton,
Ohio, down 2.1 percent to 92,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, 23 cities reported gains of 10 percent or better. They
were led by Charleston, South Carolina, up 19.7 percent to 121,100
dollars; San Francisco, up 16.6 percent to 329,400 dollars; and
Bradenton, Florida, also up 16.6 percent, to 104,900 dollars.
</P>
<P>
By region, gains were strongest in the Midwest, up 7.9 percent
to 114,000 dollars, followed by the West, up 7.5 percent to
172,900 dollars, and the South, up 7.1 percent to 115,900 dollars.
The increase in the Northeast was 3.5 percent, to 151,100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The markets with the highest median prices were San Francisco,
followed by Honolulu, 305,000 dollars, and Orange County,
California, 261,500 dollars while the lowest prices were in Ocala,
Florida, 69,100 dollars; Waterloo, Iowa, 71,500 dollars; and El
Paso, Texas, 75,200 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Medical Teams to Kenya, Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday ordered to dispatch a medical team to Kenya and Tanzania
respectively to help treat the victims in the twin bombings of
U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the teams are made up with veteran surgeons and
specialists and take "all necessary medical equipments and all
types of medicines," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The doctors will be flown shortly by charter planes to Kenya's
capital Nairobi and Dar es Salaam to work under the direction of
Health Minister Ismail Sallam.
</P>
<P>
Egypt sent urgent medical assistance to Nairobi in the past
three days.
</P>
<P>
A three-tonne batch of medical equipment was shipped at dawn
Monday to Kenya and the same amount will be shipped to Tanzania on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 people were killed and nearly 5,000 injured in the
explosions taking place minutes apart at the American embassy
buildings in both capitals last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scores of U.S. medical, forensic and disaster relief experts
continued to arrive at the blast sites, joined by rescue teams
from Israel, India, Japan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
As the hunt for the culprits intensifies, senior aide to the
Egyptian president said Sunday that it would be "dangerous" to
accuse any party of involving in the explosions at the present
stage and called on all sides concerned to wait for the outcome of
the investigations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Still Ready to Secure Regional Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe remains ready to
undertake missions within southern Africa to maintain peace and
stability in the region, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said
in Harare Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people on Defense Forces Day, Mugabe
who is Commander-in-Chief of Zimbabwe Defense Forces said,
"although we are enjoying peace and stability in Zimbabwe, there
are ominous developments which appear to threaten stability and
tranquility in our region."
</P>
<P>
He said, "these developments enjoin us to remain ready to
undertake missions in sister republics who will have lost their
peace."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's comments come on the back of escalating conflict in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) alleged to be engineered
by neighboring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean leader chaired the two-day summit attended by
seven heads of state and government in the northern resort town
of Victoria Falls last week to find ways of easing tension
between the DRC and Rwanda since the start of the Tutsi-inspired
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the situations in Angola, Somalia, Guinea Bissau,
DRC and Sierra Leone were cause for great concern as those
conflicts only served to create misery and deaths.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that the border conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea has not degenerated into a full-fledged war. It is my
hope that parties to the conflicts in these two countries will
make every effort to settle their differences amicably and begin
once more to have peaceful co-existence," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He commended the defense forces for playing a pivotal role in
maintaining and consolidating the peace which enabled Zimbabwe to
pursue its development objectives.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Taleban Agree to Resume NGO's Aid Work in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
the Taleban, a war faction of Afghanistan, had reached an
agreement which allows non-governmental organizations to resume
their humanitarian aid work in Kabul, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Taleban had agreed to allow the
international non-governmental organizations (NGOS) to return and
start their activities immediately from the existing offices.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said a Taleban-NGOS commission had been established to
discuss the related issues on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said there still remained a number of outstanding issues
for which the negotiation between U.N. and the Taleban was going
on, and it was hoped that progress would be made on matters
including a mutual acceptable solution to the female employment
and female's access to education and health care.
</P>
<P>
A report is also expected from the Taleban on the killing of
two U.N. aid workers last month, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban last month told 35 non-governmental aid agencies to
leave Kabul after they had refused to comply with an order from
the militia to move to a derelict college dormitory building.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban emerged in Afghanistan in late 1994. They have
vowed to establish the world's purest Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Tear Gas Fails to Disperse Lesotho Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tear gas fired by Lesotho
soldiers failed to disperse several hundred protesters gathered
at the royal palace in Maseru Wednesday afternoon, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a palace source as saying that soldiers fired one
or two tear gas canisters in an attempt to disperse the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remains tense though. People are still there in
front of the gates, singing".
</P>
<P>
The source said the protest was legal because permission for
it was sought and granted.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said opposition parties spokeswoman Monica Mopeli's claim
that the soldiers fired stun grenades could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who are supporters of opposition parties, have
camped outside the palace since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They claim the results of the May 23 general elections were
rigged to return the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) to
power. The LCD took 79 of 80 seats in Lesotho's National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded King Letsie III to personally
intervene in the political impasse. But the king, who undertook
to be away from political life when he was restored as king in
1996, refused to be involved and asked the government and
opposition parties to sit down and talk.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, troops took up positions around the palace
after army chief Lieutenant-Colonel Makhula Motakeng ordered the
protesters to disperse in a message broadcast by a radio station
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The protesters ignored the order.
</P>
<P>
Before the tear gas shooting, Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili called for calm and restraint.
</P>
<P>
He said LCD supporters should refrain from doing anything that
could worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to them to exercise restraint until the peaceful and
legal process agreed by the political party leaders and the
government is completed. The truth shall prevail," Mosisili said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an agreement between his government and
opposition parties on the establishment of a multi-national
committee to probe into election fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki flew to Maseru to mediate Monday. The committee,
composed of experts from the three guarantors of peace in Lesotho
in 1994 -- South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe -- was supposed to
report its findings in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
However, it appeared that the agreement failed to appease
protesters in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Basotho National Party official Bareng Sekhonyana
said earlier Wednesday that there were a number of issues that
needed to be resolved before the protesters could be dispersed.
</P>
<P>
These included the representativeness of opposition parties in
the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) panel that is to
re-count the votes of the general election.
</P>
<P>
"We want representatives in the IEC because if they re-count
the votes alone, they would just confirm the (initial) results of
the elections," Sekhonyana said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also wanted protection for protesters
against "LCD armed gangs", who were assaulting opposition party
members, Sekhonyana said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties were also opposed to the involvement of
the army in what they say a political dispute.

<HEADLINE> Land Imbalances Threat to Social Stability: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has warned that continued racial imbalances in land use
and ownership posed a real threat to social stability in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In his foreword to the 24-page land reform and resettlement
program phase two policy framework document, Mugabe said the land
problem was central to the attainment of social stability and
economic development in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Documents on the policy framework and phase two of the land
reform and resettlement program, are being released by the
government to all cooperating partners ahead of the international
conference on land to be held in Harare from September 9 to 11,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe needs to mobilize at least 1.9 billion U.S. Dollars
to finance land reform over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said reforms would begin in earnest before the end of
this year to rectify the racially skewed distribution of land
ownership and use as a result of the colonial legacy of forceful
alienation of the black majority by minority British settlers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the majority of the nation's poor, particularly
rural black families, depended on access to land for their survival.
</P>
<P>
Key nations which brokered Zimbabwe's independence negotiations in
1979, he said, promised to provide finance needed for land
acquisition and redistribution.
</P>
<P>
"However, inadequate international support and limited
national resources for land purchases and a number of legal,
administrative and logistical constraints limited the pace and
quality of land distribution," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government planned to acquire an additional five
million hectares for redistribution to about 91,000 families
between now and the year 2004.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev expressed his doubts Wednesday on Russia's plan to
transfer to a professional army by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a decree on the transfer by President Boris
Yeltsin, Sergeyev said the target is difficult to implement for
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
"It is doubtful that we will be able to carry out this decree
during the fixed term," the defense chief told a press conference
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said an additional 6 billion rubles (about 970 million U.S.
dollars) will be needed for the task.
</P>
<P>
On the country's military reform, Sergeyev said that 10 units
on round-the-clock alert will be established in the army by the
end of this year. The units will comprise three general-purpose
divisions, three airborne divisions and four general-purpose
brigades, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The dates for restructuring the army into the air-land-sea
force have not been determined yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The date for re-organizing the Strategic Rocket Force by
merging it with the Military Aviation Force will depend on the
process of reducing strategic offensive weapons and implementation
of related agreements," he added.

<HEADLINE> Food Program Benefit 2.5m Ethiopian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.5 million Ethiopian
farmers have been direct beneficiaries of the nation-wide
extension program which was launched in 1995 in only certain
regions with a membership of 66,000.
</P>
<P>
Belay Ejigu, Head of Extension Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture, said the extension program with an aim to achieve
self-sufficiency in food, has now become an integral part of the
nation's agricultural activities as it covers all parts of the
country, the Ethiopian News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said, this year the program has included the afar region
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this year's extension program, the head said the
supply of agricultural inputs including fertilizers and select
seeds has been improving both in quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
The program will also include new packages such as apiary,
forestry and natural resources conservation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 development workers have been trained to provide
professional assistance to farmers, according to the head.

<HEADLINE> UK House Repossessions on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of house repossessions
in Britain is up 18 percent over last year, which suggested that
the UK property market remains somewhat buoyant, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, based on court petitions, show that 19,478
homes were taken back in the three months to June this year. This
is nearly a fifth more than the same quarter in 1997, though just
a third of 1991 levels.
</P>
<P>
Those follow figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders last
month that showed a 10 percent increase in repossessions in the
first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The large increase in mortgage-payers being evicted is further
evidence that lenders are "getting tough on customers after
difficult years of negative equity and a stagnant market,"
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide rise in house prices, up more than 6 percent on
average last year, has almost eradicated negative equity. But
higher mortgage rates, in line with increasing interest rates,
have made repayments for many difficult to meet.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bank of England left the interest rate unchanged
at 7.5 percent, both Nationwide and Bradford &AMP; Bingley, the UK's
biggest building societies, have increased their rates, while
other mortgage-lenders had already moved up rates to about 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of Britain's biggest building societies converted to banks
last year, paying out billions in windfalls to their members as
they listed on the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Informer Confesses to Helping Israeli Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- An employee of one of Russia's
top weapons plants has confessed that he sold information on the
country's state-of-the-art Black Eagle tank to Israeli agents, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Security Service (FSB), Alexander
Sakov, who worked in the capacity of head of the technical bureau
at the Transmash defense plant in Omsk, has confessed that he
gathered information for the Israeli Nativ secret service "not for
free," Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Nativ is acting under the cover of the immigration section of
the Israeli embassy in Moscow, Tass said, quoting the FSB press
service.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Savchenkov, deputy head of the FSB's department in the
Omsk region, said Sakov, 46, had access to classified information
on the Black Eagle tank.
</P>
<P>
"He was the first informer of Nativ detected by Russian
counter-intelligence. Since then the Omsk regional FSB department,
in cooperation with federal counter-intelligence bodies, has
revealed the whole network operating in Russia," Savchenkov said.
</P>
<P>
He did not say how many informers they have dug out.
</P>
<P>
The FSB press service said Sakov repented his activities during
what it called a "prophylactic conversation" with
counter-intelligence authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli special service Nativ has created a network of
paid informers from among Russian citizens," the press service
said.
</P>
<P>
The informers were ordered to collect information concerning
the social, political and economic situation in the country,
inter-ethnic relations, manifestations of nationalism and
anti-Semitism, as well as specific issues critical to the pace and
scale of emigration to Israel, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that in Israel, "there is a controversial
attitude towards Nativ's activities."
</P>
<P>
Nativ has repeatedly been criticized by the Israeli Foreign
Ministry for using diplomatic cover and creating a situation
fraught with the deterioration of Russian-Israeli ties, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Arrested on Nairobi Bomb Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) - Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said Wednesday that a number of people have been arrested on last
Friday's car bombing which killed 247 people and injured nearly
5,000 in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
"A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the bomb blast," Moi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement gave no more details of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work ended Wednesday with a grieved memorial service
held on the rubble from Friday's bombing by hundreds of
multi-national rescuers and Kenyans with a common will to have
the cold-blooded bombers punished.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of a pick-up van, in which the bomb was believed
to be installed, was seen removed from the debris on the rear of
the U.S. embassy, where was said the embassy's parking place, by
the FBI experts at noon on the day.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have claimed that they saw a covered van,
three Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car
bomb blew up.
</P>
<P>
Moi said Tuesday that Kenya is working closely with Tanzania
on several clues. Another car bomb blast in Tanzania's capital
Dar es Salaam killed 10 people within minutes of the Nairobi
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The attack was an act of terrorism which transcended
international borders, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here also said that Tanzanian police have
arrested 14 foreigners -- six Iraqis, six Sudanese, a Somali and
a Turk -- in their search for those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Washington has posted a reward of two million U.S. Dollars for
information leading to the conviction of the bombers.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group calling itself the Islamic Army for
the Liberation of Holy Places has claimed responsibility, but
there has been no evidence to support the claim.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Upbeat About Winning Reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
Wednesday that he is upbeat about his chance to win reelection in
September with voters increasingly convinced by the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we would be able to win the elections
and that the current ruling coalition will remain in place," Kohl
said at a news conference in Bonn Wednesday, at which the final
part of his party's election platform was presented.
</P>
<P>
The "excellent" economic data showed that the government's
reform policy was feeding through, which would also help lower the
country's high unemployment, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
In a remark which surprised the journalists, Kohl Wednesday
stated clearly for the first time that he would quit from the post
as chairman of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which
he has kept for the past 25 years, if he failed to lead the CDU to
an election victory in September.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite logical that I would give up the party
chairmanship if I missed the election goal," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The German general elections scheduled on September 27 will put
Kohl, who has been German chancellor since 1982, against a new
face from the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD),
Gerhard Schroeder, who is currently premier of the western German
Lower Saxony state.
</P>
<P>
Although Kohl said that he saw his public support improving at
the moment, an opinion poll issued Wednesday, at least, pointed to
the different direction.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Allensbach polling institute showed
that the leftist SPD would chalk up 43.8 percent of the vote
compared with only 33 percent for Kohl's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
This poll, however, conflicted with another issued by the Emnid
institute earlier this week which showed that Kohl was narrowing
the massive lead enjoyed by the SPD earlier this year to about 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
With less than 50 days to go before the general elections,
there is growing speculation now in Germany that Kohl's party
might have to settle with a so-called grand coalition with the SPD
finally.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, again resolutely rejected the possibility
Wednesday, saying that it was only a trick played by Schroeder to
woo centrist voters.

<HEADLINE> Most EU Citizens Condemn Child Sex Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- More than nine in every 10
European Union citizens have been found by a union-wide survey to
be condemning child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey, published Wednesday by the European
Commission, demonstrated an almost universal (92 percent) moral
condemnation of the practice which was deemed illegal by 88
percent of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
Yet less people considered child sex tourism to countries other
than EU member states to be illegal. Respondents who marked child
sex tourism to other countries as illegal accounted for 74
percent.
</P>
<P>
A small but significant proportion of those questioned claimed
to have encountered the problem of child sex tourism on their
holidays.
</P>
<P>
These people accounted for 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
A large proportion (85 percent) of those questioned were aware
of the problem, with those regarding the problem as widespread
accounting for 63 percent and those regarding the problem as on
the increase globally accounting for 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most Europeans condemned child sex tourism and placed greater
emphasis on punitive and preventive measures than on helping child
sex victims.
</P>
<P>
Most agreed that action at European Union level is desirable.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey, conducted by the European
Commission between April and May this year, provided useful data
for all those involved in tackling child sex tourism, commission
officials said.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner in charge of tourism Christos Papoutsis
said that the findings of public opinion are further encouragement
to step up efforts to provide a practical response to the concerns
clearly expressed by Europe's citizens about the evil type of
tourism based on sexual exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 83 percent of the reported child sex
tourism found their way to Asia while Latin America got 69 percent
of found child sex tourism, followed by central and eastern Europe
(68 percent) and Africa (67 percent).
</P>
<P>
Child sex tourism, the survey also found, is generally seen in
the European Union as being linked to poverty, child sex abuse,
international trafficking in children, social exclusion and
extreme forms of child labor.

<HEADLINE> Israel Increases Defense Spending in 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday
approved the 1999 state budget of about 59 billion U.S. dollars,
which included an increase of its defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget plan submitted by Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman, although the 217 billion shekel budget cuts the overall
spending by 2.2 billion shekels (598 million dollars), it
increases the defense spending by about 2 billion shekels (543
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is first increase in defense spending in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that the
defense spending increase was aimed at coping with mounting
threats from Israel's sworn enemies of Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed deep concern about Iran's recent test of
the Shahab-3 missile, which has a range of 1,300 kilometer and can
hit targets in Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, the anticipated deficit will total
7.8 billion shekels (2.1 billion dollars) in 1999, or 2 percent of
the gross domestic product, down from 2.4 percent of the current
year.
</P>
<P>
The target of economic growth in 1999 is set at 2.5 percent, 1
percent more than this year, and the inflation target is set at 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate will stay high at 9 to 9.5
percent, although investment in infrastructure will be increased.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Neeman promised the cabinet that if it
passes his ministry's budget for 1999, Israel could pull its
economy out of recession and resume its rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to crease more jobs opportunities in this year
by increasing investment in industry and infrastructure to
maintain the inflation at a low level.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli economy has started to slow down since 1996 after
the Likud-led government came to power and implement a policy of
austerity.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth slowed to 4 percent in 1996 after nearly
one decade of rapid expansion, with an annual average of about 7
percent, that was spurred by a wave of immigration from former
Soviet Union since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate further slid to about 2 percent in
1997, and is expected to further decline to 1.5 this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pakistan to Secure Release of Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday called on the
Pakistani government to adopt immediate measures to secure the
release of Iranian diplomats held by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Iranian judiciary chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi made the call
at a meeting with the head of Pakistan's Inspectorate General
Organization Abdulshakur Salam, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Salam assured Yazdi that his government would make efforts to
help release of Iranian diplomats, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban had assured Islamabad of the safety of
Iranian diplomats before capturing Mazar-e-Sharif, the main
stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
"But after capturing the city, the Taliban told us that there
had been no one in the Iranian consulate general," Salam said.
</P>
<P>
Iran claims that the Taliban militia captured 11 Iranian
diplomats, an IRNA correspondent and 32 Iranian drivers Saturday
after seizing Mazar-e-Sharif and transferred them to Qandahar, the
Taliban's headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Tehran said Pakistan, which is believed to
be a supporter of the Taliban, must be responsible for the safety
of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Salam said that Pakistan had sent messages to Qandahar to make
sure of the safety and the return of the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan considered Iranian diplomats as their
own diplomats, believing that they would be safe whether they had
been in the consulate or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Taliban has said they knew nothing about the
diplomats, but claimed to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming their enemies.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, capturing the capital Kabul and ousting Rabbani in
1996, now virtually controls all of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yazdi also called on Islamabad to
seriously deal with the terrorists who had killed several Iranian
nationals in Pakistan over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Salam assured Yazdi that his government would punish those
responsible for such incidents, saying that relationship between
the two countries would be improved because it was based on
Islamic roots.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Slash Grain Export by 80 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia will export only 400,000
tons of grain this year, down 80 percent from last year's 2.4
million, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cut was attributed to the country's expected lower harvest
as a result of drought, which damaged 12 million hectares of
fields.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 65 million tons of grain will be harvested this
year, down from 88.5 million tons of last year, the Agriculture
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Viktor Semyonov said that the drought, the
worst in 100 years, had cost Russia 9.2 billion rubles (about 1.5
billion U.S. dollars), two times greater than the damage recorded
in the most arid year of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drought, Russia will not import grain this year,
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said at a session of
the government's ad-hoc commission.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said this year's harvest, together
with an estimated 20 million tons of grain stocked from last year,
would be sufficient to meet the country's needs.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Bank Revises Growth Downward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada cut
Wednesday its estimate of Canada's second-quarter growth to 2.5
percent from 3 to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Recent data suggest that real GDP increased by about 2.5
percent in the second quarter, somewhat less that anticipated,"
the bank said in an update to its summer review.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, "Our current estimate is that the various
strikes and other production disruptions lowered second-quarter
real GDP growth by about half of a percentage point."
</P>
<P>
"Thus, in the absence of these disruptions, growth would have
been closer to 3 percent," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the degree of uncertainty surrounding the
international situation and its implications for the Canadian
economy remains high.
</P>
<P>
But the underlying momentum in the Canadian economy continues
to be positive, with business investment remaining strong, retail
sales climbing and employment and income continuing to grow.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted that Canada's core inflation will
remain in the lower half of its 1 to 3 percent inflation-control
target range for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"While the effects on the price level from exchange rate
depreciation will be working to raise inflation, offsetting
factors, such as excess supply in the economy and price
competition from Asian producers, will keep overall inflation
pressures subdued," the bank said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Show Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
higher Wednesday in the wake of rallies staged by the Asian
financial markets and a rebound in Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
While not all of the losses suffered by the markets this week
were made up, the rally was considered significant enough.
</P>
<P>
British blue-chips ended firmer but the scale of the rally was
hampered by the unwillingness of institutions to become involved
in an increasingly volatile environment, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
"There is no conviction in the market because of the hefty
falls we have seen recently," Andrew Bell, a strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston, was quoted as saying. "When you see this sort
of volatility it is best to wait until the dust settles."
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 Index, which was boosted by a mild rebound in New
York, gained 29.4 points to 5,462.2, and gainers and losers were
evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
This came after weaker-than-forecast average earnings results
and predictions of slowing growth in the bank's latest inflation
report.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's Dax crept higher in the afternoon,
lured by a jump on Wall Street, but the index came off its highs
as the jittery market lost faith in the benchmark Dow Jones
Industrial average's rebound.
</P>
<P>
Dealers doubted the Dax had escaped the weakness which Tuesday
led it to a three-month low.
</P>
<P>
The Dax index, based on floor trading, closed 2.54 percent
higher at 5,402.37 points while the electronic Xetra Dax finished
up 1.91 percent at 5,386.94 points.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Dax slipped under the 5,400 points level and
struggled to break over its resistance. Hopes of a firmer start to
trade in New York helped it nudge through the resistance but
dealers warned it needed a more substantial grip.
</P>
<P>
Paris, which had come a cropper in the first two sessions this
week with losses of 2.53 percent and 2.37 percent, clawed back
2.59 percent as the CAC 40 index finished at 3,945.70 points.
</P>
<P>
Firmer overseas markets and a recovery in the Japanese yen
contributed to an early rally on Wall Street, but as the Dow pared
its early gains, French brokers warned the CAC too was still
jittery, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a technical rebound, and it's not clear what's
going on in Asia," BBC quoted one market source as saying.

the car bomb raid, which targeted the U.S. embassy at one of the
busiest and densest commercial areas in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Weary rescuers from Kenya, Israeli, France and the United
States had been working round-the-clock for 136 hours to search
survivors. Only one person was pulled out alive from the debris.
</P>
<P>
The alive, a middle-aged Kenyan named Gatili Nganga, was out
Saturday night after the Israeli team had burrowed through the
unstable rubble for more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
The only other supposed-to-be survivor, a woman identified
Rose Wanjiku, was found already dead under tons of debris after
rescuers had battled four days and nights to reach her. Her body
was hauled out before dawn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The woman was trapped behind a safe which had remained intact
after the explosion and formed a tiny space among broken concrete
and twisted steel. She was not hurt but just got no access to
food and water.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of her death, with her the rescuers had kept
talking for hours by Monday, extinguished the last glimpse of
hopes of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Kenyan mother and her son were rescued to safety
from an extensively-damaged 22-storey skyscraper right next to
pile of debris, which originally was an old five-story building.
Neither the mother nor the son was injured but deeply scared.
</P>
<P>
As the rescuers are leaving the bomb site later Wednesday
afternoon, the probe into the blast is gearing up by both the
Kenyan police and dozens of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) here.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Wednesday in a statement
that a number of people have been arrested in connection with the
bombing by the Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that Kenya is working closely with Tanzania on
several clues. Another bombing at the U.S. embassy in Tanzania's
capital Dar es Salaam killed 10 people within minutes of the
Nairobi explosion.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of a pick-up van, in which the bomb was believed
to be installed, was removed from the debris on the rear of the
U.S. embassy, where was said the embassy's parking place, by the
FBI experts at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an FBI official told Xinhua by phone they may issue
some investigation results later this week. However, the probe is
expected to have to take months.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have claimed that they saw a covered van,
three Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car
bomb blew up.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses said that just minutes before the bombing, they
saw several Arab-looking men with a canter van trying to enter
the parking place between the extensively-damaged U.S. embassy
and the leveled Ufundi-Cooperative House.
</P>
<P>
Joash Okindo, a Kenyan guard at the U.S. embassy, was quoted
by local press as saying that he and his colleagues engaged the
"Arab-looking men" with a van in a brief argument and physical
confrontation that led to a shoot-out just before the detonation.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group self-declared as the Islamic Army
for the Liberation of Holy Places has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Washington has posted a reward of two million U.S. Dollars for
information leading to the conviction of the bombers.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever we can to bring the murderers to
justice," said U.S. President Bill Clinton following the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Shakes Northern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A moderate earthquake with a
preliminary magnitude of 5.4 (ML) rocked the San Andreas fault in
Northern California Wednesday morning, swaying buildings and
halting trains in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said it happened at 7:10 a.m.
and was centered near the historic mission town of San Juan
Bautista, 140 km from San Francisco. Local sheriff said that no
major damage was found to the town's historic mission or other
buildings in the area. A smaller quake, measured at 3.1, struck
the same area eight minutes earlier, the USGS said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the area said that local people felt strongly the
rolling type of motion.
</P>
<P>
The USGS said that the quake's epicenter is a seismically
active area and this was the biggest quake there for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The quake opened several cracks in Highway 101 but the freeway
remained open. It also caused a rolling sensation for several
seconds in San Francisco's high-rises. The Bay Area Rapid Transit
district briefly stopped trains to check for damage.
</P>
<P>
The geological survey defines magnitude 5 earthquakes as
moderate temblors that can potentially cause considerable damage.
But factors such as the type of rock and soil in the area, the
location of the fault and the size of buildings can minimize the
danger.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Soldiers, Police Jointly Fight Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Six highly skillful
soldiers have joined some 80 policemen in tracking down armed
Somali bandits who are terrorizing Ngorongoro District in north
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed Wednesday that the soldiers from the
Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) have been sent to beef up
operation against the bandits and other foreigners threatening
peace in Ngorongoro and its vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The Somali bandits a fortnight ago killed the police chief of
the district, Issaya Kong'oha, and disappeared in the bush. The
bandits, about six, also shot dead a ranger of the Ngorongoro
Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) last week and made away with
an AK-47 submarine gun.
</P>
<P>
The operation against the bandits, most of whom are cattle
rustlers, has been difficult because they are sheltered by some
crook people of the Massai Tribe in the area who are colluding
with them.
</P>
<P>
The rampant activities of Somalis in the area has been a thorn
in the flesh for the past one year. Efforts by the police and
elderly Massais to keep at bay the bandits last year did not
prove effective.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the area complained to President Benjamin
Mkapa who last month toured the district.
</P>
<P>
The president promised that joint security organs of Kenya and
Tanzania would work closely to nab bandits harassing residents
there.
</P>
<P>
The police are currently holding 21 people, all Massais, in
connection with the killing of the Ngorongoro OCD.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has strengthened
the security in its northern regions bordering Kenya in the wake
of last Friday's bomb attack at the Embassy of the United States
which claimed 10 lives and injured more than 80 people.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner of the northern Arusha Region said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that important spots like the
Kilimanjaro International Airport and international hotels have
been put under high alert.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ole Njoolay said that special measures have been taken
for the famous Arusha International Conference Center, which
hosts the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR), the Secretariat of the East African Cooperation
and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Passengers through the Namanga Border Post between Tanzania
and Kenya are checked very carefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
The security program was agreed Monday at a high-level meeting
between Njoolay and his counterpart in the neighboring
Kilimanjaro Region, Philemon Sarungi.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian police have so far arrested 14 suspects, all foreign
nationals, in connection with the Friday bombing in Dar es
Salaam, a police spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These suspects, six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Turk and one
Somali, are still under questioning for any evidence linked with
the bombing which killed nine Tanzanians and one Kenyan and
injured more than 70 Tanzanians and seven staff members of the
U.S. embassy.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Meets Foreign Mediation Team on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni met with a foreign mediation team on the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) in northern district of Gulu Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office revealed this.
However, it did not mention the contents of their talks.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is made up of foreign ministers of
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia, was agreed upon when presidents of
seven African countries recently met in the town of Victoria
Falls in west Zimbabwe to discuss the situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will assess the situation in the country
and offer some suggestions as to how to resolve the armed
conflict between the army loyal to President Laurent Kabila and
the Banyamulenge Tutsis in the army.
</P>
<P>
The senior diplomats, who arrived in Uganda Tuesday night,
have also had a meeting with their Ugandan counterpart Eriya
Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the first collective efforts by the African
countries to try to end the worsening conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, some Tutsi-led troops began their rebellion
against Kabila in Kinshasa following his order to drive the Tutsi
soldiers, who helped propel him to power over one year ago, back
home to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The fight quickly spread to other parts of the country,
especially the eastern part of the country. Several towns there
have fallen into the hands of the Tutsi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of
being behind the rebel army, a charge the two neighbors flatly
denied.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Army spokesman Shaban Bantariza Wednesday denied DRC's
latest accusations that it was aiding the rebellion and that it
sent armored vehicles into DRC.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Send Relief Supplies to Kenya, Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait decided Wednesday to
send urgent relief supplies to Kenya and Tanzania to help treat
victims of the recent bombings of two U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made under instruction of Emir of Kuwait,
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the official Kuwait news agency
Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not dislose the amount of the medical and food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
It said the Kuwaiti Air Force will fly the relief supplies to
Kenya and Tanzania under the supervision of Prime Minister and
Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Al-Sabah's office said the Kuwait Red Crescent
Society would send volunteers to take part in the distribution of
the medical and food supplies.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the move was in conformity with Kuwait's
solidarity with people of Kenya and Tanzania and its condemnation
of the two bombings in Kenya's capital Nairobi and Tazania's
capital Dar es Salaam last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 people have been killed and some 5,000 others injured
in the two powerful blasts, which rocked the two U.S. embassies in

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
allocate 1.3 million pounds to help victims of the conflict in
Northern Ireland, a minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Junior Northern Ireland minister Adam Ingram said in Belfast,
capital of Northern Ireland, that the move marked a further
significant stage in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The aid is a vital part of the Northern Ireland agreement
reached in April by the eight major parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
Ingram said some of the money will be used to establish a
scheme to provide educational assistance to children who have lost
a parent in the violence. But most of the aid will go to a new
memorial fund to provide support to victims who have suffered
financial hardship as a result of the troubles.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that these initiatives will provide much needed
support to victims where it is most needed," Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a comprehensive package which targets some major areas
of disadvantage for victims and their families," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Meeting With Top Aides on African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton held a
meeting with his foreign policy advisers in the White House
Wednesday to assess the situation following the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last Friday, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
The president received "an update on the situation," spokesman
P.J. Crowley said, including rescue efforts as well as the hunt
for the bombers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also involved an assessment of "what actions might
be taken... both short-term and long-term," Crowley added. He said
the talks included a discussion of security steps that need to be
taken at various U.S. facilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 240 people, including 12 Americans, were killed in
the blast at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and over 5,000
people were wounded. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the blast claimed
10 people's lives and more than 75 were injured.
</P>
<P>
The United States has offered a 2 million dollar reward for
information leading to arrest and conviction of those who were
responsible for the bombings in the two East African countries.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks have forced U.S officials to reassess the
security needs of U.S. diplomats abroad. The Clinton
administration has called for upgrading security at embassies
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department also announced temporary shutting of
half a dozen embassies for security adjustments. And some missions
would be relocated.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright earlier Wednesday flew to
Germany to accompany the remains of 10 of the 12 American victims
back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Clinton would speak at the memorial
service for the victims Thursday when they were brought back.

<HEADLINE> Malfunctions Reported in Docking System of Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mulfunctions were discovered in
the automatic docking system of Russia's Mir space station, the
Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The space station's crew first found mulfunctions Friday while
testing the Kurs system, which was installed in the docking unit
of the Kvant module.
</P>
<P>
The unit is to receive the Soyuz TM-28 spaceship that will
bring the next batch of crew to Mir, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Star City mission control near Moscow and the
Energia Rocket and Space Corporation were analyzing the situation
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin performed a
static test on Kurs Tuesday. The Progress spacecraft was later
undocked from Kvant to allow for a dynamic test on Kurs.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted specialists as saying that the docking system
still does not function well.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control planned to move Progress TM-28 up to five
kilometers away from Mir and the station crew would use a laser
range finder and dock Mir with Soyuz manually if Kurs failed, the
training center said.
</P>
<P>
Mir does not have a reserve automatic docking system.
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz spaceship with the new crew, commander Gennadi
Pakalka, flight engineer Sergei Avdeyev and researcher Yuri
Baturin, is scheduled to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome
Thursday. The docking of the spaceship with Mir is slated for
Saturday at 14:18 Moscow time (1018 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Baturin, 49, was a former national security assistant to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He will work for 12 days on board the station and then return
to earth on August 25 together with Mir's current crew.
</P>
<P>
The mission of commander Padalka, however, will last 201 days.
He is scheduled to return to Earth in February and plans to make
two space walks during the mission.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not Snubbed at Regional Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was not
deliberately excluded from the Victoria Falls summit arranged by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to discuss the situation in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South African Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was reacting to reports that South Africa had
been snubbed by Mugabe because of a long-standing dispute between
Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela over the
chairmanship of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
organ on defense, politics and security.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a media statement that South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was fully briefed on the agenda of
the summit by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at a regional
conference in Swakopmund, Namibia's resort town at the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
It also denied that President Laurent Kabila of the DRC was
opposed to South Africa's participation at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Kabila had in fact asked South Africa to become involved in
mediation efforts, hence it made the decision to send Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise to Lubumbashi
to meet with him, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"A report on the meeting was communicated to the Victoria
Falls summit in an effort to complement its own deliberations,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa would continue to support
regional efforts to consolidate the transition process in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion, therefore, that South Africa's
non-participation in the Victoria Falls summit is at odds with
regional mediation efforts and is also somehow linked to the role
of the SADC organ on politics, defense and security, is
incorrect," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
South African media quoted Zimbabwe's state-controlled Herald
newspaper as saying on Monday that South Africa's exclusion from
the summit was because of a difference of opinion between South
Africa and Zimbabwe over the SADC organ.
</P>
<P>
At a SADC summit last September, Mugabe demanded to be made
permanent chairman of the organ. But Mandela insisted that the
leadership of the organ should rotate.
</P>
<P>
"It will be recalled that the decision to suspend the work of
the organ was taken by the SADC summit in Blantyre in September
1997, because of uncertainty surrounding the mandate of such an
organ," the South African statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Subsequent to that decision, a meeting of SADC heads of state
in Maputo in March 1998 requested the presidents of Malawi,
Namibia and Mozambique to canvass all the members of SADC on the
role of the organ and then to make proposals which are expected
to be put to the forthcoming summit in Mauritius on September
13-14, 1998."

<HEADLINE> Buckingham Palace Says New Diana Book "Pure Fantasy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Buckingham Palace on Wednesday
condemned a new book about Princess Diana's death and dismissed it
as "pure fantasy".
</P>
<P>
"We treat this book with the contempt it deserves," a palace
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The (book's reported) reaction (to Diana's death) by the queen
is particularly inaccurate," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The book, "The Day Diana Died", by American journalist
Christopher Andersen, said Britain's Queen Elizabeth was only
concerned about retrieving any royal jewels the princess might
have had when she died and showed no emotion to Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
It said a British diplomat was sent to the Paris hospital where
Diana's body lay after the car crash in the French capital and
said to a nurse: "The queen is worried about the jewellery. We
must find the jewellery quickly."
</P>
<P>
Andersen said the book was based on months of interviews with
hospital personnel, Buckingham Palace staff and sources in high
places.

<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The bomb blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Tanzanian capital Dar es salaam last Friday has
seriously affected neighboring Nigerian embassy there, according
to Nigerian Ambassador to Tanzania Yinusa Paiko.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the official News Agency of
Nigeria Sunday, Paiko said that two officials and six local staff
of the embassy sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
"The officials and the local staff had to be literally pulled
out of the debris, with injuries all over their bodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Paiko said that the Nigerian embassy, which has a common
boundary with the U.S. embassy, had its main building badly
destroyed, with the roof and wall shattered, and another block
housing the finance department also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Vehicles within the embassy complex were also destroyed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador claimed that "I would have been killed if I was
inside my office because my office was totally destroyed and from
it, you could see the sky."
</P>
<P>
He said the Nigerian government has been informed the incident
and will send a delegation this week to commiserate with the
embassy staff and assess the extent of damage.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A team of Egyptian experts on
water hyacinth control and lake blockage has come to Uganda to
help the country remove the blockage of a flooding lake.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe met with the Egyptian
delegation Wednesday morning at the Parliamentary Building here,
Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Kyoga, some 200 to 300 kilometers north of Kampala,
has been blocked, resulting in serious flooding in the whole
area.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ahmed Khettab, who headed the Egyptian delegation,
said the blockage can be removed by using explosives as a
short-term measure.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, a Draft Document for 3.8 million U.S. Dollars
is ready, in addition to procurement of a dredger in three to
four months' time.
</P>
<P>
The water hyacinth in Lake Victoria has flown into River Nile
and further into the Lake Kyoga, blocking the flow of water in
the lake into further northern stretches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The flooding in the Lake Kyoga area has already damaged many
roads and displaced thousands of families.

In the letter, they said "despite all the advances in our
civilization, the 20th century is, unfortunately, replete with
instances of genocide, the latest of which the world witnessed
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
"In some parts of the world, concentrations camps, mass
extermination and ethnic cleansing -- horrors which never should
occur again after the Second World War -- continue to recur,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, there is a need to take a fresh look at
the convention to try to determine why the world is still
witness to genocide and to discuss the ways and means of
prevention and punishment," they added.

<HEADLINE> Maize Production Declines in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Maize production in Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries in the current
farming season is forecast at about 16 million tons, a six
percent decline from last season's total harvest of 17 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Food Security, a latest quarterly bulletin published by SADC,
showed that this production is below SADC's average production
output of 17.66 million tons in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Production is forecast to have decreased significantly in
Botswana by 91 percent, Namibia 72 percent and Lesotho 65
percent, Zimbabwe 33 percent and Zambia 32 percent, said the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The decline in harvests is attributed to the poorly
distributed rains which are caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
However, the national level increases in Maize production were
recorded in the usually low production countries -- Angola,
Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, maize output rose from just over one million
tons to 1.12 million tons, an increase of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's harvest is expected to increase by 50 percent to
2.75 million tons while expectations are for a 36 percent
increase in Angola, 31 percent in Malawi and 26 percent in
Swaziland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Forty generals of former Zairean
armed forces have offered their services to President of the
Democratic Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila, whose army has been
fighting Banyamulenge rebels since August 2 in the country's
eastern area.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Kabila signed by General Amela Bahati, the 40
officers who remain in the country after the fall of late Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997 said that they are ready to cooperate with
the president, according to a report of Pan-African News Agency
PANA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, PANA did not mention when the letter was rendered to
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Some officers of the Mobutu regime have not yet been
reintegrated in the country's new army despite their stated
allegiance to the new authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Didier Mumengi, Congolese information minister and
government spokesman, said Tuesday in Kinshasa that the rebels
have been cornered in Moanda and Banana, around the mouth of the
Congo River.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are not fighting on any front but are adopting
hit-and-run tactics," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
PANA quoted Mumengi as saying that the Congolese government is
planning an air raid on Bukavu on the eastern front, a city which
is under the control of the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Romania Gets Ready For 1999 Full Solar Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 12 (Xinhua) -- "The total solar eclipse
expected to occur on August 11, 1999 is a chance for Romania to
improve its image in the international media, and also to relaunch
its tourism and national economy as a whole," daily Ziua on
Wednesday quoted the Romanian Minister of Tourism Sorin
Frunzaverde as saying.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is extremely rare, happening once in about 350
years. Of the 10 European countries traveled by the eclipse -
Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Romania, Romania is a
privileged one in that the 2-minute-and-23-second path of totality
will be visible from here.
</P>
<P>
Bucharest will be the only European capital city to be right in
the centre of the totality path and also has the only solar
telescope in Europe that can be used during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
For the series of events it has in mind to this end, the
Tourism Ministry enjoys the financial and logistic support of the
Tourism Promotion and Development Fund, which will allocate 12
billion lei(about 1.38 million U.S. dollars) for the unfolding of
the events.
</P>
<P>
According to the Director of the Astronomic Institute of the
Romanian Academy Magda Stavinschi, the 1999 Eclipse international
association would try to mount all the national and international
efforts so that the eclipse may be seen under the best conditions
and Romanian astronomic instruments brought into line with
international standards by 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Romanian decision-makers are currently trying to get the
necessary money for the buying of a one-metre heigh telescope,
stronger than the existing one, and the refurbishment of the
buildings of the the Bucharest Astronomic Observatory, of the
Planetarium buildings, the astrophysical observatory at Teisani
and the expansion of the Timisioara Observatory," Stavinschi
added.
</P>
<P>
Romanian astronaut Dumitru Prunariu informed that a world
congress of the international association of space explorers would
be held in Bucharest over the eclipse and that 100 of the 200
world's astronauts would attend.

<HEADLINE> DRC's Situation May Engulf SADC Region: Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu
Sampa said here Wednesday that the unfolding situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the potential to engulf
not only the Great Lakes region but also the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Officiating in Lusaka at a two-day defense sub-committee of
the SADC Inter-state Defense and Security Committee, Sampa said
that there is need to find a lasting solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, said the Zambian defense minister, comes at a
time when the region is faced once again with a serious security
situation which threatens peace and stability in the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
Sampa also exonerated the Zambian government from the rumors
in the media that Zambia is supporting Angola's former rebel
movement, the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), and that the Angolan government is furious with the
Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
"My government is fully committed to the full implementation
of the peace program in Angola as contained in the Lusaka
protocol and therefore urges UNITA to comply fully with all the
provisions of the peace agreement reached here in Lusaka," said
Sumpa.
</P>
<P>
He added that the reluctance by UNITA to abide by the
remaining program of the Lusaka protocol reached in 1994 is a
cause of great concern.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was chaired by Zambian Army Commander
Lieutenant General Solomon Mumbi is expected to discuss problems
including finding solutions to instability in the region,
peacekeeping training within SADC region, formation of a conflict
resolution mechanism and establishment of an African center for
security studies and etc.

WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will
hold talks in San Francisco early next month, a Treasury
spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As Finance Minister Miyazawa said yesterday, he and
Secretary Rubin will be meeting the first weekend in September,"
the spokesman said in a brief statement read to reporters.
</P>
<P>
He did not say what would be on agenda, but Japanese
officials disclosed earlier in Tokyo that the two will discuss
foreign exchange movements, the Japanese economy and issues
concerning Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes at a time when Japan is in deepening
recession and the yen deteriorating, which has raised growing
doubts about the Japanese government's ability to revive the No.
2 world economy.
</P>
<P>
The yen sank to an eight-year low of 147.35 to the dollar on
Tuesday but recovered overnight after Japanese warnings about
potential intervention. It was trading around 145.77 at noon on

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Closer Cooperation with S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat Wednesday proposed a closer relationship
with South Africa in various areas including economy, technology,
health education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South African Institute of International
Affairs in Pretoria, Arafat reiterated his call for South Africa
to assume a greater role in the Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Palestine saw a need to develop its historic
relationship with South Africa along the major tracks of economic
and commercial cooperation as well as technical and specialized
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian government was willing to discuss with its
South African counterpart the possibility of grants, cooperation
with businessmen, free trade agreements, investment insurance,
avoiding duality of customs and joint ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see the signing of economic partnership agreements
between the two countries guaranteeing free trade and leading to
the establishment of free trade zones," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also pledged to encourage his people to
make joint investment with South Africans in such sectors as
industry, agriculture, services, air transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Palestine is facing a severe water problem, noting
that his country would be interested in studying water
desalinization and alternative sources of water with South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Other possible fields of cooperation would include the
training of medical staff, exchanges of students, and modern
farming techniques, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statehood of Palestine, Arafat assured that
it would be a state of peace, stressing that international
recognition of the state would be decisive in promoting lasting
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The State of Palestine with a population of about 5.75 million
was established in November 1988. Although the country has not
delimited its boundary because of Israeli occupation, it has been
recognized by many countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of building a democratic state in all of
Palestine will remain a far-fetched, but not an impossible one, "
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader arrived in Cape Town, the legislative
capital of South Africa, on Monday night for a three-day official
state visit, which was the first of its kind since the two
countries established diplomatic ties in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is due to return to South Africa at the end of the
month for a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit meeting in Durban,
during which South Africa will assume the chair of the NAM.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believed that Arafat during his current
visit is very much likely to ask South African leaders to address
the Middle East peace process at the NAM Summit.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Germany to Bring Back Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived in Germany Wednesday evening to bring back the
remains of U.S. victims of last week's embassy bombing in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
After visiting nine of those U.S. embassy staff injured in the
bombing at a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl in southwest
Germany, Albright said Washington would not bow to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by
people who do not like what we stand for," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. military spokeswoman, there are 11 Kenyans
and one American undergoing treatment at the U.S. military
hospital in Germany for injuries from last Friday's bomb attack in
Nairobi, which killed more than 240 people, including 12
Americans, and injured well over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday from a nearby U.S. air force base in Ramstein,
Albright is due to escort back 10 bodies of those Americans killed
in the bombing to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, where
memorial services are to be held. U.S. President Bill Clinton is

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Troops Back Off, Crowds Grow: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho soldiers backed
off later Wednesday afternoon from a standoff with protesters in
front of King Letsie III's palace in capital Maseru, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers have pulled back to a safe distance," SAPA
quoted opposition Basotho National Party (BNP) leader Evaristus
Sekhonyana as saying. "The crowds are growing immensely."
</P>
<P>
The soldiers reportedly fired tear gas and stun grenades to
disperse crowds earlier Wednesday afternoon. Sekhonyana
described the situation in Maseru as "still a bit tense."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said vigilante groups of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) were stoning taxis
transporting opposition party members to the palace.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party members have been protesting in front of the
palace gates since last Tuesday against the May general election
results which they claim was rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
King Letsie has so far refused to become involved in the
election dispute, and last Saturday called on the government and
main opposition parties to sit down and negotiate.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have refused to disperse until a number
of issues have been resolved. These included opposition parties'
representativeness in the Independent Electoral Commission panel
that was to re-count votes cast in the May election.
</P>
<P>
The parties also wanted protection for protesters against "LCD
armed gangs", who were assaulting opposition party members, a BNP
official said.
</P>
<P>
Through the mediation of South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, the Lesotho government and opposition parties Monday
agreed to the establishment of a three-nation committee to
investigate the election fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement failed to bring calm to the Lesotho capital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Japan to Further Open Car Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged Japan to take concrete steps to improve U.S.
access to its auto market, saying Japan's recession was
compounding problems faced by the three big U.S. car makers.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's recession is compounding the trade and regulatory
barriers that have long impeded U.S. auto and auto parts sales to
Japan," Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive regulation and barriers to competition blocked U.S.
exports and hurt Japan's own efforts to restore growth and
prosperity," she added.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky urged the Japanese government to take additional
concrete steps to improve market access under the 1995
U.S.-Japanese trade agreement, despite Japan's recession.
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual review of the 1995 trade agreement, the U.S.
Trade Representative's office said Japan's weak yen currency was
reducing imports into Japan as the strong U.S. economy and dollar
caused booming car sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Such a divergence in macro-economic variables has had direct
effect on trade flows in key sectors, including auto products,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. three big auto makers -- Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp. -- had hope the 1995 trade agreement
would help to increase more car and part sales in Japan, But after
a promising beginning of the agreement, an increase in consumer
taxes and an economic slowdown have made the Japanese market
shrinking, and U.S. carmakers again have lost their share there.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the Japanese government and major Japanese
car manufacturers to eliminate "restrictive business practices
that persist in this sector."

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Legal Defense Fund Exceeds 2 Mln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
new legal defense fund has raised more than 2 million dollars in
six months, The New York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Frustration with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
four-year-old investigation of Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
has fueled the fund's growth, supporters told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Legal Expense Trust was established in late
February, five weeks after Starr started his inquiry into
allegations about Clinton and former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons' personal legal bills are estimated at 6 million
dollars and could increase to 10 million dollars, officials told
the Times.
</P>
<P>
A direct mailing generated contributions ranging from one
dollar to 10,000 dollars from more than 8,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
Another defense fund for Clinton was closed out last December
because of strict limits on donations and controversies over
campaign financing. That fund raised 1.3 million dollars over a
three-and-a-half year period.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president to accept donations to pay for
his legal bills while in office, the Times said.

<HEADLINE> State Council Calls for Protection of Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
cabinet, recently issued an emergency circular calling for greater
protection of forest resources and forbidding the opening up of
new lands at the expense of forests.
</P>
<P>
An overall quantity control system is to be established across
the country, and the total amount of forest resources will be
increased. Also, all forest land used by construction projects are
to be frozen for one year effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the occupation of forest land needs direct
approval from the State Council, the circular stressed.
</P>
<P>
As a country short of forest resources, China faces the urgent
task of stepping up forest cultivation, and harsh measures should
be taken to stop the chopping down of foresets to open up new
lands, the circular emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The country's forest resources are rapidly dwindling due to
over-exploitation of land resources in some forest regions, it
pointed out, adding that the situation will become worse if this
trend is not reversed, leading to a decline of basic living
conditions in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The protection and cultivation of forests is vital to
ecological and environmental protection, and economic growth
should not be achieved at their expense, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to ferret out all activities involving
the destruction of forest resources, and governments at all levels
should ensure that some occupied land revert to forests by the end
of 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
Crimes involving the destruction of forest resources should be
severely punished, the circular stressed.

The Clinton administration said that as part of the settlement
the plaintiffs agreed to drop a major suit against the

The deal also depended on state and local government officials

the Swiss.

The final amount of the settlement is considerably less than

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday
postponed again a meeting of his inner cabinet on the talks with
the Palestinians on Israeli troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the Prime Minister's Office as announcing
that the inner cabinet, which also members National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, will not meet until
Sunday on the redeployment.
</P>

Netanyahu and the three ministers had been scheduled to meet
Wednesday to discuss the talks with the Palestinians, which aimed
to reach agreement over an American proposal calling for an
additional 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>

But the meeting was canceled because of the full cabinet had to
discuss the national budget for 1999, which was approved following
a stormy debate among the ministers. It was reportedly postponed
to Thursday instead. (Israel-Palestinians-Talks)

BAGHDAD -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy

to persuade Iraq to comply with U.N. requirements in arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification
Center, Shah said he would hand over a letter from Annan to Iraqi
leaders and hold meetings with Iraqi officials to discuss the
current Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>

On August 5, the Iraqi government announced suspension of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in
Iraq (UNSCOM), complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting
to prolong the arms inspections.

World Youth Forum, and left with a firm message from the

<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Limited (HACTL) announced here Thursday that it will
resume all its export air cargo handling services from midnight
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This, together with the resumption of the processing of all
import air cargo earlier on July 30, means the full resumption of
all cargo handling services by the company using both Super
Terminal 1 at the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and Terminal 2 at
Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the full resumption of the cargo handling services
ahead of the company's recovery program, a government spokesman
said, "It is hoped that HACTL will proceed with the final phase of
its recovery program and resume full services at Super Terminal 1
before the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the government and the Airport Authority
will continue to offer necessary assistance to the industry to
facilitate a smooth recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
Partial cargo handling services were once suspended because a
series of problems had appeared after the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok started its operation on
July 6 this year. So the Terminal 2 at Kai Tai has to be used
again.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong/Guangdong
Cooperation Joint Conference will hold the second meeting in late
September, a government spokesman announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In response to press inquiries, the spokesman stressed the
great importance that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) government has attached to cooperation with the inland
area.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to strengthen cooperation between Hong
Kong and Guangdong Province, the Hong Kong/Guangdong Cooperation
Joint Conference was first held in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of Hong Kong and Guangdong have held three
meetings in Shenzhen or Hong Kong to prepare for the September
meeting, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A total of six expert group meetings have also been held
between departments of both sides to discuss at the working levels
the possible agenda of the next meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Hong Kong/Guangdong
Cooperation Joint Conference led by Administrative Secretary Anson
 Chan and Vice-Governor of Guangdong Province Wang Qishan will
continue to explore areas of cooperation and put forward
innovative views and suggestions to further more comprehensive
cooperation between HKSAR and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the joint conference, the spokesman said, there
are also other channels of cooperation between the governments of
Hong Kong and Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
They include the effective Cross-Border Liaison System and
other liaison mechanisms set up specifically for cross-boundary
operational matters.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Hong Kong/Mainland Cross Boundary Major
Infrastructure Coordinating Committee is studying the feasibility
of many cross-boundary infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said senior officials of the HKSAR government
realized the importance of maintaining a close link with the
inland area.
</P>
<P>
"The continuous economic growth in the inland area will bring
great advantages to Hong Kong and can expedite Hong Kong's
recovery from the economic turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the prospect of economic cooperation between
Hong Kong and the inland area is promising, adding that Hong Kong
and the inland area will continue to actively develop their
beneficial relationship in order to further the economic
development of both sides.

People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers and paramilitary forces
are working on the embankments of the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province to protect their safety.
</P>
<P>
Historic flooding at the two rivers hit many parts of the
province, including the provincial capital of Harbin, the major
industrial city of Qiqihar, and China's largest oil field at
Daqing.
</P>
<P>
So far, PLA soldiers have evacuated 79,000 flood-affected
people, and rescued 5,444 stranded by the flood. They have also
repaired 680 meters of breaches and reinforced 208,800 meters of
embankments, which remain safe after three flood crests.
</P>
<P>
Many high-ranking officers including generals are participating

<HEADLINE> Sharp Rise in TB Cases in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Emergence of the HIV/AIDS
scourge has partly contributed to the dramatic increase in
tuberculosis (TB) in most African countries, a Zimbabwean
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Health and Child Welfare Ministry, Paulinus
Skosana, told a two-day Southern African Tuberculosis Control
Initiative (SATCI) conference in Harare that of all the recorded
statistics of TB cases in Africa, the 11 SATCI member states take
about 275,000 cases every year.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had experienced a sharp rise in the incidence
of TB with the disease increasing from 93 per 100,000 people
eight years ago to 355 per 100,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the overall purpose of the initiative is to promote
a strong foundation for effective TB control throughout member
states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)."
</P>
<P>
SATCI which comprises southern African countries was formed in
Windhoek, Namibia, in 1995 to coordinate the fight against TB on
a regional basis.
</P>
<P>
Its main objectives are to facilitate the assessment of the
state of TB in SADC member states and the sharing of resources
and expertise among them.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe
are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
TB, once considered to be a disease of the past, has emerged
again as a major public health threat and has been declared a
global emergency by the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Beef up Security on Southern Tajik Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to reinforce
security in the Tajik-Afghan border area in an effort to keep at
bay any threat to Tajikistan's southern border area by heavy
fighting among sectarian forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are interesting in our own security. Therefore, our
further efforts will be aimed at reinforcing the Tajik-Afghan
border," Boris Pastukhov, first deputy foreign minister, told
reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov said Moscow had no intention of military interference
in war-torn Afghanistan's affairs, but was mindful of "the
position of neighboring states."
</P>
<P>
"Russia has enough ways to ensure its security and that of its
allies," he said. Russia would take definite measures with
military and border interference in the Tajik territory.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Tajikistan are partners in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), a bloc formed by 12 member states of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting was renewed early this week in northern
Afghanistan between the Taliban movement, the hardline Islamic
militia, and the anti-Taliban alliance. All the provinces in
North Afghanistan are fully or partially controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov noted: "Afghanistan may turn in no time into one more
seat of international terrorism, unless a due assessment of the
situation is made and aggressive aspirations of the Taliban
movement are restrained.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there are moderate and constructive forces in
the Taliban movement, and not only those which preach aggressive
Islamic extremism."
</P>
<P>
These forces should express their opinions and make a
constructive contribution to a search for peace and settlement in
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official called on all sides involved in the Afghan
conflict to hold a dialogue on settlement of the long and
fratricidal conflict.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary in the interests of peace and national accord
in Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia was urging the international community to stop the
"ethnic massacre" in Afghanistan, Pastukhov said. "The
destabilization of the situation in the region will do no good to
anyone."
</P>
<P>
But Moscow was opposed to any external intervention into the
matter, he added.

the gross domestic product for fiscal 1998 "is unlikely to be
achieved."
</P>
<P>
Hayami said Japan would manage to avert zero or minus growth at
best, even if it began picking up in the fall.
</P>
<P>
In order to support the Japanese corporate sector's financial
needs for mid-term book settlements in September, Hayami said the
central bank would make sure of maintaining ample funds in the
market.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank would strive to prevent a sudden
collapse of Japan's top 19 commercial banks because of the
magnitude of the effects of such failures at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We must avoid sudden failures of the top 19 banks," he said,
adding that the BOJ would do everything it could to avert the
worst scenario.
</P>
<P>
On the yen's exchange rate, the central bank chief said the yen
was a little too low against the U.S. dollar since Japan's current
account surplus had been increasing steadily.
</P>
<P>
The yen would strengthen when the government's stimulus
measures and steps to restore financial systems started showing
favorable effects, he said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait is developing a cost-saving anti-osmosis
system in water desalination, Kuwait Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research said that
the new system can save the country 3.6 U.S. dollars per
1,000 gallons of desalted fresh water.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Israel has agreed to greatly reduce tariffs on some
commodities imported from Jordan, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting between Jordanian

The commodities enjoying tariff reduction are air-conditioners,
TV sets and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Israel will soon resume the negotiations on
Israel's building of a 80 million dollars worth of bromine plant
in Jordan, the Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Roey Gilad, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Jordan, said
Jordan dropped out of the negotiations with Israel's Dead Sea
Bromine (DSB) Group in May and reached an accord with a United
States company to establish such a plant.
</P>
<P>
The DSB, terming the Jordanian-U.S. project as "economically
illogical", has been making efforts to reach a contract.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks to Pay 1.25 Billion Dollars to Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's leading banks
reached agreement with Jewish groups Wednesday night on a 1.25
billion U.S. dollar settlement over long-lost assets of Holocaust
victims and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
The settlement funds are to be paid out over three years, with
the first installment of 250 million U.S. dollars to be paid 90
days after Judge Edward Korman of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
formally approves the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The banks involved are UBS, recently formed by the merger of
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank, and Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration said that as part of the settlement
the plaintiffs agreed to drop a major suit against the
government-owned Swiss National Bank, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The deal also depended on state and local government officials
including those in New York dropping plans for sanctions against
the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
The final amount of the settlement is considerably less than
the 20 billion U.S. dollars sought by the class action suit, which
started two years ago, but sources familiar with the process said
no one really expected to get that much.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed by Jewish groups and elected officials
as providing long-delayed justice for the victims.
</P>
<P>
"I am tremendously pleased and gratified to announce that we've
reached a historic agreement," said Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who
led the move to press the Swiss banks to provide money for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
New York City and New York State had plans to impose sanctions
on the Swiss banks on September 1 if a settlement was not
reached. However, the move was opposed by the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
In a statement late Tuesday night, Under Secretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat said that the accord represented a major step in
achieving justice for Holocaust survivors and strengthening
American-Swiss relations.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
posted a year-on-year 52.9 percent rise in the January to June
period, to hit 7573.3 billion yen (about 51.5 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This marked the third straight half-year period of increase,
the Japanese Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade jumped 140.6 percent to
4,591.7 billion yen (about 31.2 billion dollars), the ministry
said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in merchandise trade for the first half grew
47.2 percent to 7,587.8 billion yen (about 51.7 billion dollars),
with exports up 1.5 percent to 24,446.1 billion yen (about 166.3
billion dollars), and imports down 10.9 percent to 16,848.3
billion yen (about 114.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Imports declined for the first time in eight half-year periods
because of slow domestic demand, the ministry said. The weakness
of the Japanese yen was also a discouraging factor.
</P>
<P>
In services trade, Japan had a deficit of 3,006.1 billion yen
(about 20.5 billion dollars), down from a deficit of 3,253.4
billion yen (about 22.1 billion dollars) a year earlier, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of goods and services
into and out of thew country, as well as investment income and
other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, Japan's current account surplus surged 46.2
percent from a year earlier, to 1,444.1 billion yen (about 9.8
billion dollars), extending its expanding streak to 15 months, the
ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Clarification of Maternal, Infant Health-Care Law Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Health
plans to offer some clarifications of a few articles in the
Maternal and Infant Health Care Law, a Chinese social scientist
said today.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was issued in 1994 to improve women and
children's health in China, has raised inquiries about some ethical
questions because of the ambiguity of some articles, said Professor
Qiu Renzong with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who is
one of the interpreters of the law.
</P>
<P>
The tenth article of the law concerning "genetic diseases" can
hardly be implemented since it does not specify which genetic
diseases are serious and therefore considered inappropriate for
child-bearing, Qiu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The clarifications will include the naming of serious genetic
diseases in accordance with the authoritative opinions of
geneticists both at home and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the law requires people with certain infectious diseases
including AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis and leprosy to postpone
marriage, it could be mentioned in the interpretation that this
delay need not apply to HIV-positive people, said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the international principle of "informed
consent" be added to the General Principle of the law, which means
that men and women who have been diagnosed with genetic diseases
should be fully informed of the medical opinion, and should have
the right to decide themselves before undergoing any medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Legislative Affairs of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee has already accepted this and other
scientists' suggestions on the law, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists attending the 18th International Congress on
Genetics in Beijing have affirmed the positive role of the law in
improving women and children's health and preventing the abuse of
genetic diagnoses. They also showed special appreciation for the
article banning sex determination.

<HEADLINE> Should We "Play God" on Mars? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- While some scientists are
studying the possibility of setting up an ecosystem on Mars, one
Canadian biologist raised the question here today that if it is
feasible to develop life on Mars, do humans have the right to
"play God" on the red planet.
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Haynes, a distinguished research professor of biology
at York University in Canada, said here today at the ongoing 18th
International Congress of Genetics that humans will conduct a
thorough study on the feasibility of establishing an ecosystem on
Mars next century, and then moving on to Mars will no longer be
limited to science fiction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the US-spacecraft Pathfinder landed on Mars and sent
back a huge amount of data and pictures demonstrating that the planet
is more similar to Earth than had been previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Scientists now believe that water once existed on Mars, and
that the current atmosphere of the planet contains carbon dioxide
and nitrogen, prerequisites for supporting life.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-seventies, speculation on the possibility of
implanting life on Mars has focused on scientific feasibility and
possible technological approaches.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have considered methods of warming the planet to
release water and produce a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere as a
step toward setting up an ecosystem suitable for life.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to technological feasibility, ethical, political
and legal issues also need to be considered," said Haynes, who has
been engaged in the study for many years with Christopher
P. McKay, a research scientist with the Space Sciences Division of
NASA.
</P>
<P>
"To put it simply, do humans have the right to "play God" on
another planet?"

<HEADLINE> Should We "Play God" on Mars? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some scientists are now arguing against implanting life
on Mars because it is still impossible to prove conclusively
that Mars is totally devoid of life; so the project should not
be initiated for fear of extinguishing some already-existing life
form.
</P>
<P>
Some worry that if something goes wrong in the course of the
project it could open a Pandora's box that could damage Mars
beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
"Humans have made such a bad job of managing Earth that it is
presumptuous to imagine that they can become wise and successful
planetary engineers," one scientist said
</P>
<P>
Scientists also fear that if the project is successful, Mars might
become a tempting target for military and economic exploitation,
and this could generate even more socio-political problems on
Earth than we have at present.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in favor of a feasibility study on the establishment
of an eco-system on Mars say such an undertaking could generate
a great wealth of new scientific and technical knowledge. Much of
this information also would be relevant to understanding Earth's
biosphere.
</P>
<P>
"Locally generated biomass would be an important source of
energy, food and perhaps other useful materials for
astronauts. And a salubrious Mars would provide a refuge for life
on Earth in the event of prolonged nuclear winter or other global
catastrophes," one said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the technology of implanting life on Mars is still
far away from us, relevant ethical and philosophical issues need
to be considered beforehand," professor Haynes pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 guerrillas belonging to
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are expected to
surrender to the government this month, the Philippine News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Major General Rolando Bautista, chief of
the Army's Sixth Infantry Division, following the surrender of 20
MILF guerrillas to the 57th Infantry Battalion in Datu Piang, the
southern province of Maguindanao on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said they making necessary preparations for the
particular surrender and the only hindering factor now is the lack
of money to pay for some 180 firearms expected to be turned over
by the guerrillas whom he refused to identify.
</P>
<P>
Under a government program for the rebels, each firearm turned
over will be paid a corresponding amount to help those who
surrender in their livelihood projects in preparation for their
eventual reintegration into the society.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the surrender rites for the 200 guerrillas will
be conducted as soon as the Army has collected the needed amount
to pay for their firearms.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace treaty with the government
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Donations for China Flood Victims Exceed 100 Million Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs
has to date received more than 100 million yuan (about 12 million
U.S. dollars) in donations for China's flood victims, the Ministry
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, domestic and overseas donors had provided over
92.3 million yuan in relief funds and relief materials valued at
some 8.43 million yuan for the victims of the serious summer
flooding that has been inundating China since early June, said the
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Early this summer, a dozen provinces and regions south of the
Yangtze River were hit by the heaviest rainstorms in decades,
causing serious flooding and enormous losses.
</P>
<P>
Since July, the Yangtze River basin has been under attack by
the worst flooding since 1954, and provinces at the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze, including Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi,
are continuing their desperate efforts to protect the major dams
along the river from disastrous breaches.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs put the
death toll caused by this year's summer flooding at more than
2,000, adding that over 200 million people across the country are
being affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry, which opened a hotline and special bank accounts
for flood-relief donations on Monday, said that most donations
have come in over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong tycoons Li Ka-shing and Kuok Hock Nien donated 50
million and 10 million Hong Kong dollars, respectively, to the
flood-stricken areas, according to a Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Domestic donations came from a variety of provinces and
regions, including Beijing, Hebei, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jilin and
Guangdong, and a fairly large proportion of these were contributed
by enterprises and business groups, the official added.

<HEADLINE> German Pollsters See Kohl's Chances Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- With just seven weeks left before
Germany's general election in September, opinion pollsters have
seen a growing chance of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl winning
re-election.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is more open than two months ago," said Renate
Koecher, a manager of the German Allensbach Polling Institute, in
an interview published by the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The strong support enjoyed by the Social Democratic Party
(SPD) early this year already made way for a less emotional public
sentiment," she said.
</P>
<P>
The German national vote, scheduled for September 27, will put
Kohl and his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party
against a new face from the leftist SPD, Gerhard Schroeder, who is
minister-president of the western German Lower Saxony State.
</P>
<P>
According to Koecher, the perceived threat by Schroeder of
always having the better answers on all problems was fading away,
with voters starting to think of their political roots and make a
more sober comparison of the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
A opinion poll released by the Allensbach Polling Institute on
Wednesday showed that fewer German voters expected the elections
would bring a change of government in Bonn. This belief was
supported by a drop in support for Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
But the survey still put support for Kohl's CDU more than 10
percentage points behind the SPD.
</P>
<P>
Another survey issued by the German Emnid Institute earlier
this week, however, put SPD's lead only at three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
While expressing optimism that voters would turn to his present
ruling coalition in the final weeks, Kohl made clear on Wednesday,
for the first time, that he would step down as CDU party chief if
he lost in the elections. Kohl has been German chancellor since
1982.

SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial

The agreement calls for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of

"The move is aimed at granting more credit to investment in
fixed assets, and it is expected to promote business and

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Plummet to Five-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks slumped
Thursday amid worries about the weakening Japanese yen and rising
interbank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index dived 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent
Thursday to 6660.42, the lowest since April, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Turnover shrank slightly to 5.141 billion HK dollars (659
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The stock market opened lower Thursday, accumulated a loss of
four percent at midday, and recovered some lost ground before the
end of the day. The 33-blue chip index moved between 6,855.31 and
6,544.79 points during the day.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares plunged some 372 points, or 3.5 percent Thursday
to bore the brunt of an all-round retreat on the Hong Kong market.
Property, commerce and industry counters all lost more than three
percent, while utility stocks shed one percent.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Thursday: "The stock
market will move up and down as a reflection of the investors'
confidence in the area, and in the region as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong stock market continued to work very
smoothly in terms of settlement and clearance.
</P>
<P>
In response to rumors about further attacks on the Hong Kong
dollars, Tsang said that the government would deal with
speculators decisively.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Rescheduled in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of low-level talks
between the Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) has been moved from August 18-21 to August
25-27, the Philippine News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the talks has also been transferred from Notre
Dame University, Cotabato City, to Da'wah Center in Sultan
Kudarat, Maguindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chair for political affairs, said
highlight of the forthcoming meeting will be the signing of an
agreement of intent between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He said Philippine President Joseph Estrada may not be able to
attend the signing ceremony following a recent verbal message they
received from the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Estrada and MILF Chair Hashim Salamat are
to meet for the first time at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The low-level talks between the government and the MILF were
temporarily halted due to the holding of the national elections in
May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro
Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace treaty with the
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government has been negotiating with the MILF since January
1997, but the two sides have so far failed to open formal peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Cash Shortage Likely to Deepen South Korea Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean business groups
Thursday urged the government to sharply increase the money supply
to help lower interest rates in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) and the Korea Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) appealed to the government to
quickly end the restructuring of the financial sector to help
minimize market uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
After a survey of South Korea's 500 largest industrial
corporations, the FKI said corporations which are anxious to cut
financial costs will try to repay huge debts in the coming
months. This will further deepen the overall capital crunch.
</P>
<P>
In a report on policy recommendations, the KCCI said the
government should ease its capital adequacy ratio requirements on
local banks to quickly restore their financial brokerage functions.
</P>
<P>
About 39 percent of the surveyed corporations said corporate
finances would continue to deteriorate while only 22.7 percent
predicted a gradual improvement, said the FKI.
</P>
<P>
Most of the surveyed said the average second-half yields on
three-year corporate bond, a yardstick for interest rates, would
decline about six points from the first half, hitting 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporate managers are concerned that the
government's flexible money supply policy may be countered by a
fresh credit crunch caused by the current financial institution
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the corporations recommend an 11.6-percent bond
yield as the optimum interest rate, said the FKI.
</P>
<P>
Shrinking turnover, rising financial costs, bank loan's
retrievals and surging prices of raw materials are the factors
which worsen the credit collapse, the polled corporations said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Foreign Exchange Rate Approaches Upper Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of the
Vietnamese dong hit 13,907 dong to the United States dollar on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move has pushed Vietnam's foreign exchange rate toward its
possible upper limit, said the Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam,
the Vietcombank.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Central Bank adjusted the official exchange rate by
10 percent and narrowed the upper limit of the dong's trading band
from 10 percent to seven percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But spot quotations by commercial banks on the southern
interbank foreign exchange market climbed the rate to 13,894.37
dong to the dollar early this week.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the dong against the dollar has led to sales
of foreign currency by many enterprises and soaring prices of many
goods.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Vietcombank said many enterprises had
registered to sell foreign currency to his bank following the
depressing performance of the dong.
</P>
<P>
The prices of goods sensitive to the fluctuations of foreign
exchange rates, including gold, motorcycles and household electric
products, have risen drastically while the demand for such items
remains flat.

<HEADLINE> Detained U.N. Staff Proved Innocent in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The police has freed a
staff member of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) who was detained by mistake in the Tanzanian capital in
connection with the U.S. embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR external relations assistant, Tonga Margaret George,
told Xinhua Thursday in Dar es Salaam that the member of Somali
origin was released Wednesd@5 after he had been found innocent.
</P>
<P>
The member was detained without legal documents to prove his
identity in the Star Light Hotel in Dar es Salaam Sunday,
following the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Tanzania last Friday
which left 10 dead and more than 70 others injured.
</P>
<P>
George explained that the UNHCR staff member's documents at
that time were at Tanzania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation for the handling of relevant
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The member, which she declined to identify, was among 14
foreign suspects the police announced to have seized following
the blast. Other suspects held up were six Iraqis, six Sudanese
and a Turkish.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, media reports quoted a UNHCR spokesman in Geneva as
saying that the member, with Australian nationality, had just
arrived in Tanzania and was prepared to go to the town of Kigoma
to take up his post as the agency's regional health coordinator
of west Tanzania. He was previously in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> China Convicts Customs Officers In Border-Crossing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Intermediate People's Court
of Shenzhen in south China today convicted two customs officers of
the Luohu Border Check Station on charges of taking bribes and
helping others cross the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
He Xiugong, director of the Luohu Border Check Station linking
Hong Kong, received a death penalty with a two-year probation; he
was also deprived of political rights for life.
</P>
<P>
Xie Wenzhou, the other Luolu customs officer, was sentenced to
15 years imprisonment. All their illegally gotten property will
also be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
An investigation revealed that He and Huang both took huge sums
in bribes from Hong Kong and mainland gangsters to allow fake
one-way permit holders to pass through the border check in
1993. The gangsters forged the one-way permits to Hong Kong and
Macao and sold them at a high price on the black market.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated property of He included 1,713,550 HK dollars
(about 220,000 U.S. dollars), 151,400 RMB yuan (about 18,000
U.S. dollars), an apartment worth 760,000 HK dollars and several
other bribes. The illegal bribes taken by Xie include 873,000 RMB
yuan and 7,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kaiyi, a gangster involved in the illegal border
crossing, was also sentenced to 3 years in jail and fined 10,000
HK dollars today.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Calls for Well-Organized Flood Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Donation activities by members
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
for the flooded areas should be encouraged and well organized,
said Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC's National Committee.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks here today during a briefing meeting on
donation activities for flood-stricken areas along the Yangtze
River. Li spoke highly of the ongoing philanthropy, and urged that
all necessary conveniences be provided for the effort.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has a fine tradition of aiding the needy and
doing charitable work, and people's lives have improved
considerably since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy
two decades ago. So, organizing massive and voluntary donation
activities on a proper scale will not only bring material strength
to fight natural disasters, but also consolidate all ethnic
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, CPPCC departments and members have
donated more than 800,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's eight non-communist parties and
the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce today sent a
letter to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters
extending their best wishes to the flood-fighters along the Yangtze.

<HEADLINE> EU to Scrutinize Cross-Border Phone Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EU)
announced on Thursday its intention to further investigate
international telephone prices in seven member countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission's directorate general for market competition
will investigate prices for international calls paid to seven
dominant operators in Greece, Austria, Luxembourg, Finland,
Ireland, Italy and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The directorate general opened investigation late last year at
the initiative of European Competition Commissioner Karel van
Miert.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary assessment of the first round of investigation
contained suspicion that accounting rates or transfer prices
charged by operators for cross-border calls might result in
excessive margins.
</P>
<P>
Originally accounting rates were set at a level intended to
cover the total cost of sending the telephone calls. As a result
of technological improvements and consequent reductions in cost,
it is widely believed that the accounting rates no longer reflect
the true cost of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
Accounting rates, therefore, have an important influence on the
prices end-users pay for international phone calls, and reductions
in accounting rates should lead to substantial price reductions
for consumers in the future.
</P>
<P>
The interest of users in the EU, both consumers and commercial,
demands that the price of international telephone calls be brought
down to a fair and adequate level, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
An accounting rate is the charge agreed between the
telecommunications operator in the country where the call
originates and the telecommunications operator in the country
where the call terminates, for carrying a call of a duration of
one minute from its origin to its destination.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Ericsson-Nokia-Psion Telecom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
said on Thursday that it had approved an alliance of Ericsson,
Nokia and Psion to produce operating systems for wireless
information devices.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Verros Constantin told the press that the
joint venture, to be known as Symbian, will develop software for
use in wireless information devices which combine the features of
pocket computers with mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland will initially hold 30
percent of the joint venture shares. Psion, a British pocket
computer maker will take 40 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
As the executive body of the 15-nation European Union, the EC
believed that the deal would not give rise to a dominant position
because of the numerous competitors.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson and Nokia are the world's leading makers of mobile
phones. Psion is a small British independent with a turnover of
235 million U.S. dollars, but it has been very successful with its
organizers and pocket computers.

<HEADLINE> No Illegal Bangladeshi Nationals in India: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
said here Thursday that there are no illegal Bangladeshi nationals
living in India and so there is no question of repatriating
Bangladeshis from India, the national news agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
The question of sending back Bangladeshis from India does not
arise "since there are no illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in
India," Azad was quoted as saying at a press briefing for members
of Diplomatic Correspondents Association of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
India has not told Bangladesh "officially regarding the matter
(illegal Bangladeshis). We came to know this through the media,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
There was no recent incident of Bangladesh nationals entering
India in large numbers and Bangladesh hoped that India would not
do anything unilaterally on this issue, said the foreign minister.
"We value our ties with India very much and wish that this would
continue undisturbed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the influx of Bangladeshi nationals to India during
the liberation war (in 1971) has been settled and so is the issue
of tribals from the Chittagong Hill Tracts who went to India in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the present Indian government would
not do anything that would jeopardize the "excellent relations"
existing between the two countries. "We hope that they would
continue with the relations of cooperation, friendship and
understanding between India and Bangladesh," he said.
</P>
<P>
India is the country with which "we have most of our borders,"
and "we had many problems with that country, some of which have
already been solved and others remain to be sorted out," the
foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation, the sharing of waters of other common
rivers and removal of trade imbalance are some of the issues to be
addressed for further improvement of bilateral relations, he said.
Bangladesh and India signed the Ganges water sharing treaty in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the deputy chief minister of the government of
southwestern India's Maharashtra state said his government would
expel "illegal" Bengali-speaking residents from the state to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference early this month, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina denied that there were any illegal Bangladeshis in India.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said there was no scope for India to deport any
Bangladeshi nationals as no illegal Bangladeshis were living in
India. "We do not accept that there is any Bengali or Bangladeshi
national living in India. So the question of deporting any
Bangladeshis by Indian government does not arise," she said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong To Tackle Youth Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government will take new initiatives
to tackle youth unemployment, a senior official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang chaired a meeting of the Task
Force on Employment Thursday to focus on such issues as preparing
young people who just graduated from middle schools for
employment.
</P>
<P>
After the three-hour meeting, Tsang told a media briefing:
"Specifically, we have focused on Secondary 5 graduates leaving
school for further education and employment, and we are fully
aware of the community's concern about their prospects in the
prevailing economic climate."
</P>
<P>
More than 87,000 students aged between 15 and 19 completed
Secondary 5 study this year, and only 20,000 can pursue further
education in government preparatory schools, according to the
Education Department.
</P>
<P>
The rest will have to either attend private schools, or repeat
their Secondary 5 study, or go to the job market at the moment
when the second-quarter unemployment rate hit 4.5 percent in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the government will provide a
year-long full-time vocational training program for 1,000
Secondary 5 graduates, increase about 400 places in construction
training program for them, and fund 1,000 more students who want
to repeat secondary 5 study in government middle schools.
</P>
<P>
"We hope these measures will help those young people who are
unable to find jobs immediately to get appropriate training to get
better jobs when the employment market improves," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government had already advanced the
commencement of 18 public works projects, which would create some
2,100 new jobs by the end of 1998.

signed a number of agreements with Syrian and Saudi Arabian
companies to import bottled mineral water.
</P>
<P>
The water will be marketed soon at the state-owned stores under
the Civil Servants Consumer Corporation, he said. The import was
meant to cover the current shortage of mineral water supply in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage appeared last month when people rushed for
locally-made mineral water over the week-long tap water pollution
in western Amman.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt, Libya and Tunisia have agreed on the formation
of a joint company for international trade exchanges with a

<HEADLINE> Weizman Supports Forming National Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Thursday expressed his support for the formation of a national
unity government in Israel, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in northern Israel, Weizman said a
national unity government is the best way to solve the country's
problems, particularly the one of pushing forward the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
If a national unity government can not be formed, then the
best option for the country is to hold early general elections,
Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's remarks were apparently in reaction to the reported
recent secret meetings between Prime Minister Banjamin Netanyahu
and the opposition Labor party Chairman Ehud Barak, in which the
two discussed the possibility of forming a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings held at Israel's intelligence organization
Mossad headquarters, Netanyahu and Barak reportedly reached some
understandings on the formation of such a government.
</P>
<P>
Barak was offered to take the posts of deputy prime minister
and defense minister and both the ruling Likud and Labor could
share the equal number of "secret cabinet" ministers.
</P>
<P>
But the leaking to the press of the meetings caused uproar
among both the ruling and opposition parties. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai strongly opposed this move while the key members
of the Labor party took the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
Barak called off a meeting of key party members scheduled
Thursay afternoon to discuss this issue, saying that the
formation of a national unity government is not on the party's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the key Labor party members support an early
elections in the country instead of forming a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has not been happy with the current government's
non-compromising policy towards the peace talks and called for
early elections in the past.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Strains to Meet Economic Growth Target (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China has responded to
difficulties facing the nation's economic locomotive by adopting a
series of measures to ensure the annual economic growth target of
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
China recorded an economic growth rate of seven percent during
the first half of this year. However, the worsening impact of the
Asian financial crisis has raised concern as to whether China
can achieve its annual economic goal.
</P>
<P>
China faced a difficult task in achieving seven percent
economic growth and steadfastly refusing to devalue its currency
at a time when many Asian countries are engulfed in serious
economic recessions.
</P>
<P>
However, the achievement failed to reach the targeted figure
and statistics showed a decline in exports and negative growth
during the month of May.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the situation to the Asian financial crisis
and bearish world economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, internal factors, such as sluggish market demand and
continuing industrial inefficiency, as well as heavy flooding in
the Yangtze River Valley and along northeast China's Nenjiang
River, have created new "bottlenecks" hindering economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China decided to achieve its target by
mainly intensifying investments in infrastructure construction and
stimulating demand on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Chinese economists agreed that the two measures will
have a positive impact on China's economic growth in the second
half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Protesters Block Roads around Maseru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition party
supporters blocked main roads leading to Maseru Thursday,
enforcing a work stay-away in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Sekoateng Serabeli said that no violence had
been reported in the ongoing protest by hundreds of opposition
party supporters against the results of May's general election,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no fighting though, they are just searching
cars and preventing people from going into the city," Serabeli
said.
</P>
<P>
He said factories and shops in Maseru were closed, but
government departments were still open.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the civil servants are also unable to come to work
because they rely on taxis, which are not operating as a result
of the stay-away."
</P>
<P>
However, opposition Basotho National Party official, Bereng
Sekhonyana, said contrary to police reports, everything had come
to a halt in Maseru, including government departments.
</P>
<P>
He said Maseru was beginning to run out of food.
</P>
<P>
"However, non-governmental organizations under the
chairmanship of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Maseru are
meeting at the moment to try and address the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the situation is hard to control.
</P>
<P>
"It is really difficult for the police to bring the whole
situation under control. As soon as we prevent this group, they
simply move to another place."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very hard to normalize the situation."
</P>
<P>
Police were working hand in hand with the army in an effort to
bring matters under control.
</P>
<P>
Other protesters continued their vigil outside King Letsie
III's palace in Maseru, where they have camped since last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claim that the election was rigged in favor of
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy, which won 79 of 80
seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho army reportedly fired tear gas and stun grenades
WednYJ2ay afternoon to try to disperse protesters in front of the
palace, but in vain. The army had to back off later that
afternoon and the crowds began to grow.

<HEADLINE> Lanzhou Stepping Up Efforts to Become Commercial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Since 1994 Lanzhou, capital of
Gansu Province, has stepped up efforts to become a commercial
center in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
So far, 326 markets have mushroomed across the city, including
27 major ones with an annual business volume exceeding 100 million
yuan (about 12.05 million U.S. dollars) each, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Wholesale Market, which used to be a marketplace
with several pairs of business stalls, has now grown into a major
center with 18 trading halls after four years of construction
efforts where more than 5,000 traders from across the country are
doing businesses with an annual volume amounting to 3.5 billion
yuan (about 422 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, an important commercial center on the ancient Silk
Road, has been treated as an important base of raw materials,
energy and heavy industry since New China was founded on October
1, 1949. It is also a national railway hub in northwest China and
an important city on the Eurasian continental bridge.
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts to build more markets, the city has
also been trying hard to develop agriculture and industry and
expand local economic development by way of promoting the service
trade. It produces a group of high-quality commodities, seven
kinds of which are designated as major items for export, with an
annual export delivery volume exceeding 70 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Lanzhou generated 24.4 billion yuan of gross domestic
product (GDP), chalked up 12.2 billion yuan in sales of consumer
commodities, and scored a market transaction volume of 14.7
billion yuan, all showing marked increases according to comparable
figures of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the commercial center has given impetus to
accelerating the opening-up of Lanzhou, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the city has approved 1,146
overseas-invested businesses with contracts involving 748
million U.S. dollars of overseas funds. In addition, Lanzhou is
also home to 1,500 domestic agencies and business offices operated
by institutions and companies outside Gansu Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's vanadium production
capacity reached a record high with the recent opening of the
Panhong Vanadium Co., the largest venture of its kind in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The company has an annual production capacity of 4,200 tons of
vanadium trioxide and 3,200 tons of high ferrovanadium, according
to an unnamed senior manager. He noted that the company will help
transform China into the world's third largest vanadium producer.
</P>
<P>
Panhong, located in Panzhihua in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, is operated by the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Group, one
of the countries major iron and steel enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The company was set up against a backdrop of rising
international market prices for vanadium products. Equipment for
the new facility was purchased from the German-based Metallurgical
Materials Group, the largest European vanadium manufacturing
enterprise. The installation and testing of equipment commenced in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Panzhihua Group exported vanadium
products valued at 40 million U.S. dollars in 1997, up 34 percent
on the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
China's 13.81 million tons of vanadium reserves account for
18.95 percent of the worldwide total. More than half of China's
vanadium reserves are found in the Panxi Region which is home to
Panzhihua.

<HEADLINE> China Pushes for Reestablishment of Committee on Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China has urged the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) to reestablish an Ad Hoc Committee on outer space
in accordance with a United Nations General Assembly resolution.
</P>
<P>
China fully subscribes to the U.N. resolution which recognizes
that "negotiations for the conclusion of an international
agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space
remain a priority task," China's Ambassador to the CD Li Changhe
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement or agreements should assure that outer space
be explored and exploited by all countries solely for peaceful
purposes and for the benefit of humanity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, there seems to be a view that there does not exist an
arms race in outer space at present and therefore, 'the prevention
of an arms race in outer space' should not be a priority for the
CD," Li said, stressing that the Chinese delegation cannot agree
with this opinion.

"The fact is that the series of activities of all-out
developing and testing of outer space weapons or weapon systems in
recent years have already given rise to concerns in many countries
around the world," he said. "Prevention of an arms race in outer
space has become an actual and urgent task for the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Li said that many of the technologies developed in the 1980s
for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), known as the Star
Wars, have been switched to some other outer space weapon programs
which are currently under research and development by some
countries.
</P>
<P>
As recently as last October, Li said, some countries conducted
the first test of using high-energy chemical laser to attack
satellites, which gave rise to world-wide concern.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that all the CD members will demonstrate
necessary political will and flexibility, so as to enable the
relevant consultations to bear early and positive results, and the
CD could begin its substantive work on the effective prevention of
an arms race in outer space as early as possible and live up to
the high expectation of the international community," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy back in Baghdad on Iraq-U.N. Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's special envoy Prakash Shah returned to Baghdad Thursday
with a mission of trying to persuade Iraq to comply with
U.N. requirements in arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification
Center, Shah said he would hand over a letter from Annan to Iraqi
leaders and hold meetings with Iraqi officials to discuss the
current Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the Iraqi government announced suspension of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in
Iraq (UNSCOM), complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting
to prolong the arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt announced on Tuesday that at
the weekend Shah went to Portugal, where Annan was attending the
World Youth Forum, and left with a firm message from the
U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Brandt declined to go into details of Annan's message to the
Iraqi leaders. He only said that it is not very different with
Annan's latest public statements.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Iraqi decision was "unacceptable." However, he
urged the U.N. Security Council to engage Iraq more closely in
finding ways to resolve the differences as he judged that Iraq's
position is not a closed one.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called the Iraqi decision "totally
unacceptable" and urged Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Currently, U.N. monitoring work is going on normally in Iraq as
Iraq had promised it would not block U.N. monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has set conditions for U.N. arms inspection work to
resume. These conditions include recomposing UNSCOM, restructuring
UNSCOM's administration, transferring New York headquarters of
UNSCOM to Geneva or Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision came as a result of the breakdown of talks
between UNSCOM and Iraq on August 3. During the talks, UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler rejected the Iraqi demand that he report
to the Security Council that Iraq has destroyed all its prohibited
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
been free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Official Urges More IT-Related Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Thursday called for greater emphasis on
training programs in new disciplines such as the information
technology (IT) in line with the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
"The training aspect must be given due attention, more so
during the current economic slowdown," he said when presenting
prizes at the Ninth National Skills Competition here.
</P>
<P>
The move is important to mold Malaysians to be knowledgeable in
the development of software technology which could be used to
disseminate positive information, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has allocated 1.2 billion ringgit
(about 300 million U.S. dollars) under the Seventh Malaysia Plan
(1996-2000) to provide training for 31,000 people in 149 public
skills training institutions and to build 66 more such
institutions which could accommodate 22,000 trainees.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the trainees must have the motivation to upgrade
their skills which would help the government reduce its reliance
on semi-skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's MSC is a 50 kilometer by 15 kilometer area
stretching south from Kuala Lumpur especially designed for the
development of multimedia technologies and services.

XINING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 25 billion yuan of
investment will be used in an ambitious plan to help improve the
ecological environment of northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The sources of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, located in
the province, are the major beneficiaries of this gigantic plan
which comprises 96 projects and is scheduled to be completed in
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the central government will provide some
14.7 billion yuan of investment, local governments will offer 5.39
billion yuan, and the other 5.01 billion yuan will come from local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Bai Enpei, governor of Qinghai Province, said the plan should
be implemented as soon as possible because the deterioration of
the ecological environment in Qinghai, home to the sources of the
two major Chinese rivers, has caused a serious impact on economic
development and the lives of the people living at the middle and

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Meeting on Pullback Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday postponed again a meeting of his inner
cabinet on the talks with the Palestinians on Israeli troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the Prime Minister's Office as announcing
that the inner cabinet, which also members National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, will not meet until
Sunday on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and the three ministers had been scheduled to meet
Wednesday to discuss the talks with the Palestinians, which aimed
to reach agreement over an American proposal calling for an
additional 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting was canceled because of the full cabinet had
to discuss the national budget for 1999, which was approved
following a stormy debate among the ministers. It was reportedly
postponed to Thursday instead.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks, which resumed last month after
a 16-month stalemate, stalled again in the last few days because
the Israelis failed to bring any proposal conforming with the
American initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been opposed to Israel's idea that 3
percent of the propose scope be designated as a "nature reserve"
where the Palestinians will only have limited powers.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides continued contacts by telephone
but the Palestinians are refusing to come to further meetings and
the U.S. is not prepared to send an envoy to the region to mediate
at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, winding
up a three-day visit to South Africa, Wednesday called on the
U.S. and Europe to impose effective economic sanctions against
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had fulfilled their obligations, but Israel
had turned its back on peace deals struck in Oslo and Madrid,
Arafat said.

CANBERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Asian worries wiped almost
three quarters of a U.S. cent Thursday off the value of the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
By the close the local dollar was at 59.14 U.S. cents from
59.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Australian dollar had remained focused on the
Japanese yen and external issues for a large part of the day.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen lost ground against the U.S. dollar as
speculation about intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the
ailing currency died down.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, foreign exchange dealer of Colonial State Bank,
said the Australian dollar had been driven by the weak Japanese
yen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Have New Government in Days: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Thursday that a new government will be
formed in a few days with the induction of the opposition
Communists.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a face-to-face program organized by the Reporters
Club of Nepal, Koirala said he has had positive response from the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) to his
invitation to join the government.
</P>
<P>
"I was pushed to forge an alliance with hard-line Communists by
political realities obtaining in the kingdom," he said. But he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), the largest opposition party in the
parliament, has tried to stall the proceedings in the Lower House
of the Nepali Parliament by registering two adjournment motions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said teaming up with an opposition party to
run the government is expected to bring more political stability
to the country which has seen five governments in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress led by Koirala, which has 88 seats in the
205-seat lower house, is the single largest party in the
parliament after the CPN-ML broke away from the CPN-UML in March.
</P>
<P>
With the CPN-ML joining his minority government, Koirala will
enjoy a comfortable majority of 128 seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, who came to power in mid-April, said he is sure that
he will remain in charge till the next general elections which he
has said are scheduled for April/May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Opposition Helps Afghan Taliban: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Members of an Iranian opposition
group were found to be helping the Afghan Taliban militia in
western Afghanistan, leading Iranian newspaper Tehran Times
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) has sent
members to the Afghan city of Herat close to Iran's border to help
the Taliban fight against the opposition Northern Alliance, an
informed source in Peshawar, Pakistan, told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO, one of the main groups which toppled the
former shah's regime during Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, was
outlawed in 1982 due to its political differences with the ruling
mullahs.
</P>
<P>
The source said the Taliban had close contact with the MKO and
a bombing at a Tehran court in June was launched by MKO members
stationed in Herat.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the Afghan Northern Alliance headed by the ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was driven out of the capital
Kabul in 1996 by the Taliban, a student militia.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian source Wednesday said that MKO's presence in
Afghanistan may prompt Iran to intervene militarily in Afghanistan
since Tehran has repeatedly emphasized that it reserves the right
to strike the group, listed as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
Iran so far has not made official comment on MKO's reported
involvement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But in a move to show Tehran's determination to safeguard its
borders, Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Yahya
Rahim Safavi Monday inspected the northeastern borders with
Afghanistan and warned of decisive answers to any aggression.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, believed to be close to the Foreign Ministry,
said that Iranian troops are carrying out maneuvers in the border
areas.

account of the victims' situation, and do something within our
reach, " she said.
</P>

Meanwhile, Vietnam Airlines will re-open the Ho Chi Minh City-

The airlines is falling into even deeper financial distress due

<HEADLINE> Forex Inflows Into Zambia Declining: Citibank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange inflows into
Zambia are reported to have continued declining with the Bank of
Zambia only receiving total inflows of 5.7 million U.S. Dollars
during the three weeks ending July 24.
</P>
<P>
According to the July issue of the Citibank Treasury Letter
secured Thursday, latest statistics available from the central
bank indicated that foreign exchange inflows into Zambia have
remained weak and declining.
</P>
<P>
Total payments on the other hand are reported to have amounted
to 24.6 million Dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
Citibank further disclosed that of the total payments,
however, 20.7 million Dollars or 84 percent went toward servicing
the country's debt that stands at 7.2 billion Dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
This unfavorable balance between inflows and outflows created
a deficit of 18.9 million Dollars which had to be settled using
the country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, Citibank estimated Zambia's reserves have
dropped down to 110.3 million Dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the letter also revealed that Zambia's import cover
has also been dwindling since January this year and indications
are that the country is going toward a critical level.
</P>
<P>
Citibank noted that the current level of reserves represent
approximately four and a half weeks of import cover at the 1997
level of import into Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Protest Continues in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Lesotho
opposition parties would prevent members of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) from entering the capital Maseru, an
opposition party spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Basotho National Party (BNP) official Bereng Sekhonyana said
thousands of opposition supporters were making their way to the
eastern side of Maseru Thursday morning to "literally prevent"
LCD members from coming to town, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sekhonyana suggested this was an act of self-defense. "What do
you do when armed gangs want to attack your area? Don't you go
out and meet them before they attack you?" the report quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Lesotho police said they had no knowledge of attempts by
opposition party supporters to deny LCD members access to the
city. They said the traffic was scarce and the situation remained
calm.
</P>
<P>
Sekhonyana said about 200 protesters were still in front of
King Letsie III's palace in Maseru, where opposition supporters
have been protesting since Tuesday last week to demand a recount
of the votes in the May general election.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claims the election, which saw the LCD return
to power with 79 of the 80 seats in the National Assembly, was
rigged.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the army tried to disperse the crowd at the
palace gates with tear gas, which incited the crowd and the
soldiers had to back off. The crowd thickened to about 5,000
people Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Early on Thursday, BNP executive member Moletsane Monyake said
they were not expecting the same "disgraceful" action from the
army again, as army chief Makhula Motakeng had been greatly
embarrassed after the Wednesday incident.

<HEADLINE> ICU to Establish Medical Check System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Cycling Union
(UCI) will establish a "medical follow-up" on cyclists since
testing during races can't always detect banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We're not even going to increase the number of checks during
races because the problem is with non-detectable products," UCI
President Hein Verbruggen told Europe 1 radio from Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "let's at least guarantee the health of the
riders. There would be a system of medical follow-up, that we
force cyclists to be tested."
</P>
<P>
The federation was to announce its anti-doping statement later

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Annuls Highway Contracts with Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Public
Works and Housing Roberto White has announced that his government
decided to annul two contracts on highway rehabiliation with an
Italian company, the Astaldi.
</P>
<P>
The contracts are related to two highways in central
Mozambique's Zambezia and Sofala provinces, the Noticias
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White said Wednesday in Beira, Sofala Province that the
decision was made after his four-day working visit in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the annulment, he said, is that the Italian
company "Astaldi" has failed to accomplished its work on time as
stipulated in the contract.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the poor quality of other two highways in
southern Mozambique was also done by the Italian company.
</P>
<P>
The annulment measures, said White, are aimed to reduce
Astaldi's participation in the country's projects for fear of the
danger posed by the poor quality work.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government will hand over the two projects to
other companies which win the public tender, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Astaldi is among the very few foreign companies now
contracting with the Mozambican government to work on the
country's highways. The company won several tender projects from
the government early last year.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Chop-shops Breeds Hijackings in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Recent figures of vehicle
crime cases in South Africa show that car hijacking syndicates
are increasing in the country because of the rise in chop-shops
dealing with hijacked cars.
</P>
<P>
The cases have also shown that police and business people are
involved in the syndicates, Sowetan paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures indicated that 4,889 cars were forcibly taken from
their owners in South Africa during the first three months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located, was
still the leading province in car hijackings with 2,693 cases
reported, or 55 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by KwaZulu-Natal, the most populous province
on the Indian Ocean coast, with 929 car hijackings, the central
province of Free State with 432, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In most hijacking cases, victims had tried to resist the
hijackings, thereby causing harm to themselves. Some have even
been killed as a result, police said.
</P>
<P>
However, a Gauteng provincial police spokesman said despite
the findings, hijackings have stabilized in the province this
year compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the tracker system was introduced in October 1996,
police units have successfully cracked down on motor vehicle
syndicates, raiding 13 chop-shops and exposing 23 vehicle theft
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Some cars were recovered from local scrap-yards, which police
suspected were working as chop-shops for stolen and hijacked
vehicles in Gauteng, the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,990 cars valued at more than 40 million Rand (6.3
million U.S. Dollars) were recovered and 2,400 suspects,
including police officers, were arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hijackers were targeting cars such as Toyota Corollas, BMWs,

ATHENS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Air Force pilot died after
his bomber jet crashed Thursday morning into the Messinian Gulf, in
the southwestern Peloponnesos peninsula, during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
The single-seat Corsair A-7 plane, which had taken off from the

<HEADLINE> 5 Held as Kenya, U.S. Probe Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Five suspects have been
detained over last Friday's bombing in Nairobi as Kenya and the
United States are tightly united in pursuing the bombers.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mbuvi, the spokesman of Kenya's Criminal Investigation
Department (CID), said Thursday that the five were held "because
of their special activities" when the deadly bomb went off. None
of them has been charged so far, neither was their nationalities
revealed.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects was identified by a U.S. security officer
who was at the U.S. embassy when the bomb blew up, said Mbuvi at
a joint press conference with the U.S. Fede2aw Bureau of
Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
"A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the bomb blast," Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 247 people including 12 Americans were killed in
the bombing targeting the U.S. embassy in a very busy commercial
area in the Kenyan capital. Over 5,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member team consisting of one Kenyan police officer and
an FBI special agent has been set up for the blast probe, Sheila
Horan, the FBI spokeswoman, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said the FBI had held talks with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi and police leaders and that the two sides have agreed
with "strong determination" to cooperate in efforts to bring the
perpetrators to justice.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police have pledged to share information on the
bombing with the U.S. anti-terrorism experts, said Horan.
</P>
<P>
"We are working jointly every day. We are very very close,"
Mbuvi added.
</P>
<P>
Horan said the investigation is divided into two general
areas.
</P>
<P>
One is to have interviews with various people -- witnesses,
the wounded, the neighborhood of the bombing site and others.
</P>
<P>
"Those (people to be interviewed) are massive in numbers.
We'll take a very long time to get through those people... to
extract the great amount details (as) a small detail could be
very valuable. We are concentrated very very heavily," she said.
</P>
<P>
The other area is to look for forensic evidence. Now certain
parts of the vehicle, in which the deadly bomb was installed, has
been sent to Washington for further examination, said Horan.
</P>
<P>
They also watch closely over the probe development of another
bomb blast in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam which killed
10 people within minutes of the Nairobi explosion.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have claimed here that they saw a covered
van, three Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a
huge car bomb blew up, leveling a five-storey building and
extensively damaging the U.S. embassy next door.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group self-declared as the Islamic Army
for the Liberation of Holy Sites has claimed responsibility for
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Washington has posted a reward of two million U.S. Dollars for
information leading to the conviction of the bombers.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Ertan Hydropower Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The long-cherished dream of
Chinese water conservancy experts was initially realized with
yesterday's partial opening of the Ertan Hydropower Station.
</P>
<P>
The idea to build China's largest hydropower station by the end
of the 20th century was envisaged in the early years of new China
when experts pondered ways to make full use of abundant water
resources in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Sichuan Province, one of China's most
densely-populated provinces, accounts for close to 25 percent of
the nation's water resources.
</P>
<P>
Surveys carried out in the 1950s revealed that the Yalong River
in Sichuan provided an ideal site for a large hydropower facility.
</P>
<P>
The State Council granted preliminarily approval for the Ertan
location in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the project have continued uninterrupted, with
related continuing throughout the turmoil of the Great Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Ertan is located near the city of Panzhihua, one of the leading
steel production bases in China. Large-scale exploration for iron
ore resources in the 1960s and 1970s proved highly beneficial to
preparations for the power station project.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on the Ertan location was completed in
1973, with the project formally placed on the central government
agenda at the end of 1979 when China introduced the policies of
economic reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A team of Chinese experts from scientific research institutions
led by then Vice-Premier Fang Yi commenced a technical feasibility
study in 1980. And the preliminary design plan was completed a
short five years later.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the project was listed in China's Seventh Five-Year
Plan in 1987 and preparatory projects for the power station were
initiated in September that same year..
</P>
<P>
The World Bank announced its decision to grant loans for the
project in 1991 and construction of the main project commenced

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Set up Panel on Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will soon
set up a national committee on the global computer problem known
as the Millennium Bug, the head of state, General Abdulsalam
Abubakar has said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the statement in a written speech read at a
national workshop on the Millennium Bug Wednesday in Nigerian
capital Abuja, according to media reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the government has approved one billion Naira
(about 10 million U.S. Dollars) as initial take-off grant for the
proposed committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, he said, would facilitate the rectification of
all government computers and also provide necessary assistance to
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar expressed the government's determination to solve the
problem by the end of June next year. He also sought the
cooperation of the private sector in funding the activities of
the committee, saying the cost is too high for the government to
bear alone.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reiterated his administration's resolve to attain
self-reliance in the computer industry within the shortest
possible time, saying provisions would be made in next year's
budget for the establishment of a pilot scheme in collaboration
with the private sector for local manufacture of computer
components and units.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the difficulties encountered by Nigerians in
gaining access to the Internet, disclosing that the government
had directed the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology and
that of Communications to collaborate with the Nigerian Internet
Group to develop proper guidelines for Internet connectivity in
three months.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Cracks Fake Computer Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 400, 000 U.S. dollars
have been stolen from Zambia's Education Ministry through a
sophisticated syndicate in which money was channeled to a
foreign account in the U.S. for fake computer purchases.
</P>
<P>
One suspect has been arrested and several others from the
ministry's accounts section have been questioned over the money
which was purportedly for the purchase of Apple B computers from
a U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe confirmed the theft and
arrest, saying that investigations have been intensified, Times
of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said unscrupulous employees forged the
ministry's Permanent Secretary Sichalwe Kasanda's signature
purporting that he had authorized the payment of 412,750 Dollars
on June 1 to a U.S firm, Norsk Hydro, through a bank transfer.
</P>
<P>
The money was transferred for the purchase of 65 complete sets
of computers with accessories. However, they were never
delivered and the ministry never made such an order, according to
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The payment was done using a foreign payment voucher and was
authorized by the Ministry of Finance, where the officials were
under the impression that the payment was genuine.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Education officials reported the matter to the
police when the racket was detected as they tried to make a money
transfer from the Bank of Zambia to the Zambia National
Commercial Bank.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Opposition Leader Dies Natural Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The death of Nigeria's deceased
opposition leader, late Moshood Abiola, has been confirmed a
natural one following the announcement of the final report on the
autopsy of his body.
</P>
<P>
James Young, the leader of a five-member international team of
pathologists who conducted the preliminary autopsy in Nigeria,
announced in Canada Thursday that they found "no traces of
poisons or toxins."
</P>
<P>
"Extensive laboratory tests confirmed natural causes" and
there were no "extraneous circumstances" on the cause of Abiola's
death, said Young, quoted by press reports here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential
election which was annulled by the then military government, died
on July 7 this year at a meeting with an American delegation on
his release from four years of detention in the Nigerian capital
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Abiola's family, the foreign doctors were
invited to carry out the autopsy. The preliminary report of the
autopsy said the late politician died of heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's death threw the country into turmoil as an angry mob
took over the southwest in protest, demobilizing and looting
property.
</P>
<P>
He was buried at his Lagos residence in a peaceful atmosphere
on July 11 after the autopsy according to Moslem tradition.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unveils Tax Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello Thursday unveiled their
carefully-planned and much-talked tax reform package in a bid to
reform the nation's 70-year old tax system.
</P>
<P>
The package, which has yet to be approved by the Australian
parliament, has been the focal point of attention in Australia as
the introduction of reform plan will have impact on the
expenditure of every Australian and business.
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes will come into force in July, 2000, well
after the first term of the Howard government, which expires next
March.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes a goods and services tax (GST) set at 10
percent on most purchases, with guarantees the rate will not rise
unless all state and territory leaders agree.
</P>
<P>
But health, childcare, education, nursing home services,
council rates and charities will be exempted from the GST
taxation.
</P>
<P>
The guarantees and exemption are some of the measures the
Howard government has introduced to win public support for the
reform as the next federal election is likely to be called as
early as this October.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include offers to low-income families and
pensioners as the introduction of a GST will lead to a slight
increase in living expenditure as prices of many goods and
services will go up.
</P>
<P>
The price of buying and building a home will also go up because
of the GST, but first home buyers will receive a 4,200-U.S.-dollar
lump sum payment from the government to offset the cost.
</P>
<P>
The package, titled A New Tax System, includes more than 7.8
billion U.S. dollars worth of tax cuts, as well as extra family
payments which the government said would put about an extra 30
U.S. dollars in the pockets of an average family with two
children.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government will scrap the existing
wholesale sales tax, as well as a range of other taxes and duties
including the financial institutions duties (FID), state based
bank debits taxes, stamp duties on mortgages, shares and rental
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Pensions will increased by four percent, or up to 15 U.S.
dollars a fortnight for couples and 9.3 U.S. dollars a fortnight
for singles.
</P>
<P>
Business and self-funded retirees will also benefit through the
abolition of provisional tax.
</P>
<P>
Australia's national newspaper The Australian said more than
one million small business and farmers will benefit from the
abolition.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said the goal of the tax reform was
to give Australia a stronger, more secure, more optimistic move
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"It will boost the growth and the strength of the Australian
economy, it will generate more jobs, it will historically reform
commonwealth-state financial relations."
</P>
<P>
The Australian newspaper described the reform package as the
last card of the prime minister to boost public support before the
coming election, which must be held before March, 1999.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Gulf, Less Western Tourists Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to Jordan
from Arab Gulf states rose by 36 percent and that from Europe and
the U.S. fell by 19 percent in the first seven months of 1998 from
the same period last year, a cabinet minister has said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Times newspaper Thursday quoted Minister of Tourism
Aqel Beltaji as saying that the rise on the side of the Gulf
states almost offset the decline on the side of Europe and the
U.S. in earning hard currencies for the kingdom's tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not provide the exact number of these tourists
and subsequent incomes for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Arab Gulf nationals used to stay away for months to escape
sweltering summer heat and most of them would like to spend a few
days in Jordan, which boasted summer breeze and cool, before
flocking to Syria and Lebanon, said Beltaji.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise in the number of tourists from Gulf
countries to that for the first half of this year, especially this
summer, the temperature in most Gulf states were above the average.
</P>
<P>
However, the picture was different for European and U.S.
tourists, who often bought a package tour in the Middle East and
included Jordan as one of their favorite stops, Beltaji said.
</P>
<P>
Regional political uncertainty, arising from the Israeli
government's hardline policy on the peace process and Iraq's brief
stand-off with the United Nations in February, kept European and
U.S. visitors away from the kingdom, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of German tourists decreased by 41 percent,
Austrians by 39.5 percent, Finnish by 27 percent, Britons by 24
percent and Swiss by 23 percent in the first seven months of the
year compared with the same period of 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government understands the dividend of tourism
as a bridge to peace, then it would change to a less hardline
stance, Beltaji added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been Jordan's pillar industry. Before the Middle
East peace process was deadlocked, its usually fetched more than
500 million Jordanian dinars (about 706 million U.S. dollars) a
year, or 37 percent of its annual foreign currency earnings and
11 percent of its gross domestic products.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Upset over U.S. Statement on Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is upset over the
United States statement that there may be a threat to U.S.
interests in this country following the recent bombings of the
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The statement could be misinterpreted by others including
foreign investors wishing to invest in Malaysia, tourists, and
sports fans who planned to come here for the Commonwealth Games
next month, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told
reporters after a social function here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was commenting on the statement by a U.S.
State Department spokeswoman that Washington had received
information that there might be a threat to American interests in
Egypt, Yemen and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said if it was the U.S. that was facing a problem, it
should seek to resolve it and not make statements that would
attract reactions adverse to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Where we can help, we will help... but we don't want
statements which can cause alarm, or that can be misinterpreted by
Malaysians or others wishing to come to Malaysia for whatever
purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister acknowledged Malaysia had the
responsibility to offer assistance and cooperation to foreign
embassies here facing security problems.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Malaysia's security was always under
control and the government was confident that nothing that could
affect the country's stability would happen.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
described U.S. fears of a threat to its interests in Malaysia as
baseless.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Police are beefing up security at the U.S.
embassy here after Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli
Ghazali Wednesday assured the U.S. embassy staff of their safety.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani Vows to Continue Fight against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani said Thursday that his forces would continue
to fight against the Taliban, a student militia that has won
control over most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"War in Afghanistan has not ended but rather entered a new
phase," Rabbani said from Badakhshan, northern Afghanistan after
his opposition lost more strongholds to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue fighting off the Taliban, towns and
mountains will be our battlefields in the war against them," he
told the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's Northern Alliance suffered serious setbacks during
the past few weeks, losing several key towns including the
headquarters Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan in the
protracted civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic government of Afghanistan is the legal government
of the country and this administration considers its duty to
defend the territorial integrity and people of the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who was driven out by the Taliban from the capital
Kabul in September 1996, said that the war would cease only
through negotiation and formation of a national and broad-based
government.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise the country will never see peace again, he said, the
Taliban might rule by force and by intimidating people but they
know well that they have no popular base.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani also accused Pakistan of flagrant intervention in
Afghanistan's domestic affairs and of broad support for the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He urged international forums to exert pressure on Islamabad,
forcing it to stop meddling in Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Although it has lost most of the country to the Taliban,
Rabbani's government is still recognized as the legitimate ruler
of Afghanistan by rest of the world, with the exception of
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> China's Passenger Traffic Still Up In Spite Of Railway Disruptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The 74 sections of China's
railway lines, which were broken by serious flooding in July, were
fortunately repaired in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Railways carried 2.575 million passengers daily on average last
month, representing a year-on-year rise of 1.2 percent. The number
of people traveling more than 500 km on a single journey was up by
5.6 percent to 676,000, according to the Railway Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials attribute the increase to railway bureaus'
response to market demands, the addition of temporary trains,
improved service, and the success in getting college students back
home for the summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
Trains pulled 15,900 trucks of urgently needed disaster-relief
goods in July. On average, there were 66,500 trucks of goods per
day last month, 8,500 trucks fewer than the goal. Of these, coal
accounted for 25,500 wagons, 4,500 fewer than the target.
</P>
<P>
Oil, metallurgical materials, cement, timber, chemical
fertilizers, and cereals failed to make up for the gap.
</P>
<P>
Since the flood season set in this year, a total of 130
sections of 43 major railway lines in on the Beijing-Kowloon,
Lanzhou-Urumqi, and Chengdu-Kunming lines have been disrupted,
causing a delay of 1,827 train hours, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Israel Yields to Jordan's Demand on Industrial Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel has agreed to cut its input
into products manufactured in Jordan's Qualified Industrial Zone
by 3.7 percent to satisfy the kingdom's demands, the Jordan Times
daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held in Israel Wednesday between Hani Mulqi
and Natan Sharansky, trade ministers of Jordan and Israel, the
Jewish state agreed to slash its input to 8 percent from 11.7
percent, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal between Israel and Jordan signed last November,
products manufactured in the zone could be exported to the U.S.
duty-free on condition that they include at least 11.7 percent of
Israeli input.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen at the industrial zone in Irbid, some 80
kilometers north to Amman, demanded last month that Israel reduce
its input in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts attributed the reduction of Israeli
share to the consent of the U.S. administration, which also played
a role in persuading Israel to accept the Jordanian request in a
bid to keep the two neighbors on good terms.
</P>
<P>
Washington, the leading sponsor of the Middle East peace
process, strongly supports the industrial zone deal which was
designed to bring economic dividends to Jordan which sealed peace
with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will make up for the reduction of Israel's input. This
will help Jordan earn a larger revenue from the industrial zone in
a shorter time.
</P>
<P>
For Jordan, the industrial zone deal means new markets and it
has created more than 2,000 job opportunities for its growing
unemployed population.

<HEADLINE> Students Contribute Wisdom for Cleaner Suzhou River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 students from nine
Shanghai-based universities have just completed a survey of the
polluted Suzhou River flowing through Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The students walked along the 120-kilometer river, contacted
more than 110 enterprises and institutes and more than 160
neighborhood committees on both sides of the river, talked with
more than 1,000 boat dwellers and farmers living along the river,
and distributed and reclaimed some 2,800 questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
The project lasted a dozen days. Each day the students walked
30 kilometers under a scorching sun. Very often, temperatures
surpassed 36 degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation reports made by the students will serve as
important reference materials for the municipal government," said
a senior official with the city's leading group on the
comprehensive control of the Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River had an abundance of fish in the last century,
when fishing from the riverbank was commonplace in Shanghai, but
the river became more and more polluted as industry flourished in
the city.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Says Not to Enter SLA-Controlled Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has said that it would not enter the area its
staunch foe of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) is controlling, the
Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary-general, made the
remark Wednesday during a meeting with Ali Aqil Khalil, who heads
the International Forum for Media in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said Hezbollah has no intention of taking up
positions in the country's Christian-dominated town of Jezzine,
facing the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon, in the event of
an Israeli and SLA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to recent accusations by Lebanese Christian
leader Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir and Jezzine's parliament
members that Hezbollah is trying to drive out Christian residents
of Jezzine and control the town by carrying out bombings.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a 12-year-old girl was killed by a Hezbollah's
roadside bomb in Jezzine which was planted targetting the SLA
militiamen. Last month, a five-year-old boy was also killed due to
the same cause.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Suleiman Kenaan has threatened to lead
Jezzine's 35,000 inhabitants to launch a civil disobedience mutiny
unless the government steps in to neutralize the area.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah knows how to plant bombs and hunt SLA and Israeli
troops," Nasrallah said, adding "we will protect the people of
Jezzine who are our people and safeguard our co-existence."
</P>
<P>
He noted that responding to calls for ending the resistance in
Jezzine and other areas would be tantamount to consolidating the
occupation and its agents.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in an effort to oust the
2,000 Israeli troops and its allied, 2,500-strong SLA from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer, self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985, allegedly to protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- British High Commission in
Uganda reopened Thursday morning for full service after its
closure last Friday following disastrous bomb blasts in U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The commission opened a few hours Wednesday to assess the
situation in preparation for full service, the New Vision daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The commission... is going to be in full service. At this
stage everything will be as usual from now on," Simon Bond, an
information officer with the embassy, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission shares the same building with the
U.S. Embassy on the Parliament avenue here in the Ugandan
capital. Both have closed for days for fear of bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, police authorities sealed the avenue to all
vehicles except those belonging to the two embassies and Tourism
and Trade Minister Moses Ali, whose office is on the same street.
</P>
<P>
Heavily-armed government soldiers and police have been
stationed in surrounding areas of the two embassies following
terrorist threats to blow up the two foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
The two separate explosions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
killed over 250 people and left more than 5,000 others injured.
Several U.S. embassies in Africa have closed under similar
circumstances.

<HEADLINE> 131 Inmates Detained for Rioting in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Police detained 131
trainees of the drug rehabilitation center in Sungai Petani in the
northern state of Kedah Thursday for rioting Wednesday night,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 15 inmates who had escaped with 41 others
during the commotion had also been recaptured, the reports said
quoting police officer Mohamed Ariffin Ahmat.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ariffin said that during the operation to round them
up, police recovered implements used in the rioting like axes,
scissors, sharp metal objects, screwdrivers, saws and hoes from
the scene.
</P>
<P>
The inmates, aged between 18 and 25 years, were being remanded
at the Kuala Muda police station to facilitate investigations into
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The center houses 441 inmates and those not involved in the
riot were not detained.
</P>
<P>
In the riot, the inmates set fire to the administration office,
guard room, a motorcyle and computers and broke the windscreens of
several vehicles belonging to the center, causing damages of an
estimated 100,000 ringgit (about 25,000 U.S. dollars), according
to the police officer.
</P>
<P>
"The riot is believed to have been sparked by the inmates'
dissatisfaction with the management and administration of the
center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ariffin said some of the inmates rioted again at about
5:50 Thursday morning by destroying part of the dining room and
medical store.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profitable "Green Industry" in South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, one of the country's industrial powerhouses, has found a
gold in its forests.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of the province's forestry has surpassed
22.6 billion yuan, accounting for more than one-tenth of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
A senior provincial official attributes the booming forestry
industry to the development of valuable tree-planting areas which
cover an area of some 900,000 hectares and produced more than ten
billion yuan of output value in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The timber processing industry is also prospering across
Guangdong. In 1997, total furniture sales in Guangdong reached
11.7 billion yuan, ranking it first in China.
</P>
<P>
Forest tourism is another promising industry in
Guangdong. Statistics show that the province now boasts 13
state-level forest parks and 21 provincial level forest parks
which attracted some 1.5 million tourists in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the breeding of wild animals has been rapidly
developing in the province. At present, Guangdong has more than 30
wild animal breeding centers with an annual output value of 1.5
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Unity Government Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A national unity government in
Israel appears unlikely, at least in the near future, despite
recent secret meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak to explore the possibility.
</P>
<P>
The secret meetings were held at the Israel's intelligence
organization Mossad Headquarters and the offices of both Barak and
Netanyahu described the meetings as "merely tentative."
</P>
<P>
News about the meetings were leaked to the press earlier this
week by Netanyahu's office, which said the two had reached several
understandings during their meetings, including that Barak would
be deputy prime minister and defense minister in a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
It was also said that the Labor would have six or seven
ministers in the unity government, and the "security cabinet"
would include an equal number of the ruling Likud and opposition
labor ministers.
</P>
<P>
Barak was furious with Netanyahu for "tricking " him again by
promising complete secrecy, then leaking word to the press of the
meetings. Barak did not inform other party leaders about the
meetings with Natanyahu from the start.
</P>
<P>
During the last two days, Barak was forced to brief other
Labor leaders about the meetings and told them he had reiterated
to Netanyahu about the Labor's demand that early elections come
first and consideration of a unity government afterwards.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Barak called Hanan Porat, chairman of the
Knesset (parliament) Law and Constitution Committee, to his Tel
Aviv office and asked him to speed up the committee debate over
the bill calling to dissolve the Knesset for elections. The bill
passed its preliminary reading during the Knesset's last session
before the summer break on July 29.
</P>
<P>
Barak told Porat that the government headed by Netanyahu has
brought the state to a dead end in all aspects. "It is no longer a
political issue, but a national one. A government which has
brought on the increase of crime and the unemployment of 210,000
people and the danger of war has come to the end of the road and
has no right to exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reports of the secret meetings on a unity government
aroused concern not only in the Labor party, but also among a
number of Likud ministers, including Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai met with Netanyahu for hours at a time over the past
two days and insisted his objection to the formation of such a
government, at least at present.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he discussed this possibility
with Barak, but that in practical terms a national unity
government is not on the agenda and he has no plans to hold early
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Within the Labor, all key party members, except former prime
minister Shimon Peres, oppose the idea of forming a national unity
government with Likud.
</P>
<P>
Peres insisted that he supports the idea, because Israel's
final-status agreement with the Palestinians could only be adopted
by both major parties in a broad national consensus.
</P>
<P>
The leaking of the secret meetings have also caused anger
among other Labor lawmakers. They accused Netanyahu of
"manipulating" the Labor party, saying his actual goal was to
threaten his right-wing coalition partners by showing he has an
alternative to them.
</P>
<P>
They said that move was merely to pressure existing coalition
partners who are threatening to bolt the government in case of a
second stage troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a national unity government is not easy to be
realized soon, largely because the majority of the Labor leaders
and key members are against this idea.

<HEADLINE> South China's Zhongshan City Striving to Boost Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zhongshan, a city in south
China's Guangdong Province, has been trying hard to expand local
economic growth by practicing a policy of cutting prices for
electric power to businesses exceeding specified monthly
consumption levels.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Aug. 1, Zhongshan started giving price cuts to
industrial enterprises after their monthly power consumption
exceeded 150,000 kilowatts/hour (kwh), according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Service companies involving tourism, catering and entertainment
will also receive price cuts after their monthly power consumption
exceeds 100,000 kwh.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, certified high-tech enterprises and new
businesses financed by investors from outside Zhongshan will also
receive price cuts for power.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Pearl River Delta, Zhongshan, which used to
suffer power shortages, has invested heavily in improving
infrastructure, especially facilities for power generation and
transmission.
</P>
<P>
The city's power shortage ended in 1995. The daily power supply
volume of the city is 20 million kwh. It saw a rise of 12.1
percent in power supply in the first six months of this year
according to comparable figures of last year.
</P>
<P>
A local official explained that the new policy was designed to
reduce the burdens on enterprises, though local power companies
will likely see a drop of 50 million yuan in earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Regional consumer markets
throughout China recorded different growth rates for the first
half of this year, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show retail prices for consumer goods rose by 7.2
percent in developed eastern regions, with central regions
witnessing price hikes of 6.8 percent and the figure for western
areas ending the period at 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed the disparities to different
economic levels of these areas, and pointed out that the solution
to problems surrounding laid-off workers centers on boosting the
consumption power.
</P>
<P>
They noted that expanding consumption will require the
establishment of more industrial and agricultural goods markets in
major townships in underdeveloped areas.

<HEADLINE> Harbin Issues Flood Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, declared a flood alert at noon
today warning of the possibility of major flooding along certain
sections of the city's levees.
</P>
<P>
The increasing velocity of the flood crest moving downstream
along the Nenjiang River has created rising water levels along the
Songhua River, the lower reaches of the former.
</P>
<P>
The Songhua River Hydrological Station near Harbin reported the
water level hit 119.02 meters by 08:00 this morning, some 0.02 of
a meter above the warning level. The station also reported a water
flow rate of 8,380 cu.m per second.
</P>
<P>
Water control experts predict that two flood crests will hit
the Harbin section of the Songhua River over the next 10 days
as a result of the increasing velocity of water flowing downstream
along the Nenjiang. Experts are also predicting major flooding
along the Songhua.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued
a noon curfew announcement designed to strengthen security along
levees and protect the health and well-being of local
residents. The 24-hr curfew, which applies to the Shijiu Street
section of the levee at the Zhengyanghe Hydrological Station,
strictly limits traffic in the section to emergency vehicles and
flood control personnel.
</P>
<P>
Commercial stalls along streets behind the levee have also been
closed to expedite the movement of emergency vehicles and
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Harbin Mayor Cao Guangliang presented a televised speech urging
local residents to remain on alert and prepare for possible major
flooding.

<HEADLINE> New Homes Rise from Rubble after Earthquake in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGJIAKOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Scattered amid lush
sunflowers, rows of newly-built brick houses stand in the
earthquake-stricken Malianwa Village in Shangyi County of north
China's Hebei Province. The houses were built with the efforts of
villagers and the help of people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of her seven-room flat among the new brick
buildings, Zhou Zhan'e seems to have forgotten the damage caused
by a quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale which completely
destroyed her house on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have five rooms for business and the other two left for
my family," Zhou said with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
"Relief building materials from the government are more than
enough," she added.
</P>
<P>
Building materials lay next to her house in a high heap, which
is covered with blue canvas with white characters saying "the
Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We allocated 16,000 bricks, four tons of cement and an
allowance of 500 yuan to villagers to build two rooms each," said
Pang Bingyi, village head.
</P>
<P>
"Villagers have built stronger houses to resist the quake," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of some 130 households with more than 400
villagers in Malianwa. On January 10, almost all the houses were
destroyed by the earthquake. Some of the villagers were injured.
</P>
<P>
After the earthquake, Shangyi County received relief funds and
materials from all over the country, including more than 10
million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) from Hong Kong, said Hou
Fuhai, a county official.
</P>
<P>
The county distributed relief funds and materials to 200
villages for reconstruction. The work went on slowly because of
bad weather earlier this year, Hou explained, adding that the
county would speed up the rebuilding work by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Another villager took out a photo of a collapsed house and
said, "My new house is much better than my old one."
</P>
<P>
With a confident smile, he said, "Earthquakes no longer scare
me."

<HEADLINE> Remote-Sensing Satellite Technology Used for Weather forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China has improved its weather
forecasting by using microwave remote-sensing satellites to
monitor changes over flooded areas on the upper and middle reaches
of the Yangtze River during the summer flood season.
</P>
<P>
The remote-sensing satellite ground station under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences borrowed two Canadian radar satellites passing
through China's flooded areas for three or four days in July, the
Beijing Evening News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The satellites are among the world's most advanced, requiring
sophisticated receiving technology. Only six satellite ground
stations in five countries are capable of receiving and processing
the data, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences was
formed to process the satellite data. In this way, data can be
turned into pictures in four-to-seven hours -- six days shorter
than before.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that satellites were used to conduct
high-resolution and near real-time monitoring over a large tract
of flooded areas. the paper said, quoting Pan Xizhe, head of the
satellite ground station.

<HEADLINE> Hefei's Industrial Output Value up 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- This capital of east China's Anhui
Province registered 12.7 billion yuan (1.53 billion US dollars) in
industrial output value in the first half of this year, up 19
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The significant growth has been mainly attributed to increased
efforts to restructure different industrial sectors and to improve
the product mix.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Hefei invested more than 200
million yuan (24 million US dollars) in industrial renovation in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Asset restructuring will result in 1.4 billion yuan (169
million US dollars) in added industrial sales, according to
official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Hefei also has taken effective measures to boost the
development of overseas-funded enterprises and private firms,
which generated 3.5 billion yuan (422 million US dollars) in
combined industrial output in the first half of this year, a surge
of 30 percent from the same period last year.

<P>
HOHHOT, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 70 percent of the people
stranded by floods in the eastern part of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region have moved to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
However, another 113,600 are still stranded in flooded
areas. Efforts are being made to evacuate them, an official from

<HEADLINE> Circular Warns Cowardly, Corrupt Officials of Flood Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Top disciplinary bodies for the
Chinese Party and government officials warned in a circular that
those cowardly or corrupt officials who leave their posts during
the ongoing anti-flood battles or misappropriate relief funds will
face resolute and severe punishment, the People's Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The circular was jointly released Wednesday by the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) and the Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
In general, CPC members and Party officials have formed "an
unbeatable dike" along the overflowing Yangtze River together with
the army, the police and residents of the area, the circular
states.
</P>
<P>
"But," according to the circular, "there have been a small
number of Party officials who failed to stand the test at the
critical juncture, some sneaking away to cravenly cling to life
instead of braving death, and some others refusing to execute
orders from above for fear of affecting interests in the locality
under their control without taking the general situation into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"Those Party officials, once found, have been disciplined,
because they have had an adverse influence on the public and Party
members, even though they are only few in number," the order
states.
</P>
<P>
The flood-control battle along the Yangtze River is at its most
critical moment, and all the party officials in the areas affected
by the flood must set themselves as examples for the public and
lead them in the battle, the order states.
</P>
<P>
Party officials in areas not suffered from flooding should
actively engage themselves in collecting relief funds and
materials and organizing donations to help the anti-flood efforts,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Party and government disciplinary bodies, while participating
in the flood-control efforts, must ensure that all the relief
funds and materials are handed down to the most needy flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
"Officials found to have misappropriated relief funds and
materials must be given harsh penalties, and those who break the
law must be handed to the judiciary," the circular states.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Detect Acid Rain at South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
have detected acid rain at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
The scientists measured a 5.46 pH value during a recent
rainstorm at China's Great Wall Station in the South Pole. They
noted that international standard for determining acid rain is a
pH value of 5.6 and below.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain has been detected in the area on eight separate
occassions over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the acid rain might result from prevailing
southeasterly winds from South America and the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
No acid rain has been detected in winds blowing in from the
east and south, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
"This means that atmospheric circulation brings pollutants to
the South Pole," said one scientist.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of acid rain in the region, once believed to be
"pristine land", has affected the ecology, construction materials
and the health of people and well-being working in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Dormitories and weather towers at China's Great Wall Station
have sustained serious erosion over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"Erosion has resulted in the abandonment of some facilities,"
said one station worker, adding that three additional coats of
paint have been applied to protect the building structures.

<HEADLINE> Rising Demand for Foreign Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing banks handling foreign
currencies witnessed a 121.7 percent rise in sales during the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 20 percent rise in foreign exchange settlements with
the banks suggests a sharp increase in demand for foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that local banks handled sales
transaction for some 4.9 billion U.S. Dollars, some 559 million
U.S. Dollars more than the settlement in the period.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the increase, at least in part, to the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia which lowered local
exports. However, they point out that imports continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange settlements by local foreign-funded
enterprises have dropped due to the devaluation of various Asian
currencies, the Japanese yen in particular
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also witnessed declining investments from Asian
countries and regions, especially funds coming from Southeast
Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Toxic Metals Found in Mediterranean Fish: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Inordinately high levels of
toxic heavy metals, including cadmium, mercury and lead, have
been found in samples of fresh fish and shrimp from the
Mediterranean Sea sold in Israeli markets.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that officials in Israel's
Health Ministry, praising the Israel Consumer Council (ICC) for
taking the samples, said it will launch a "major drive" very soon
to test fresh fish from the sea.
</P>
<P>
The ICC found in its sample test that some fish had up to 176
percent more cadmium than permitted. Very high lead and cadmium
levels had been found in the shrimp, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mercury poisoning in enclosed seas like the Mediterranean is
almost due to industrial contamination, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mercury can accumulate in the human body over a period of
months, and large amounts can cause serious harm to the central
nervous system, blindness, imbalance, loss of control on the motor
nerves and genetic damage in fetuses.
</P>
<P>
Cadmium is very poisonous when it accumulates over several
months in the liver, kidneys, spleen and various glands. It can
also cause drastic increases in blood pressure and trigger the
development of cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
Lead can cause damage to the digestive system, the blood and
the female reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will decide after conducting its own test
whether it is necessary to prohibit marketing of certain types of
fish.

<HEADLINE> Kigali Accuses Kinshasa of Abusing Its Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed its anger over the alleged "persecution of Rwandans and
all Congolese (K) related to them," Radio Rwanda reported.
</P>
<P>
"The government protests against the persecutions of Rwandans
and other Congolese nationals opposed to the discrimination of
any kind," the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted a statement issued
by the Rwandan government Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Rwandan Foreign Affairs Minister
Anastase Gasana charged that Rwandans have been targeted by
"persecution, beatings, lootings, and executions" committed by
President Laurent Kabila's supporters, both military and
civilian.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda also appealed to international
humanitarian organizations, notably the International Committee
of the Red Cross, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the
U.N. High Commission for Human Rights "to intervene and save the
victims."
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the international community "to
condemn these executions and the regime of President of Laurent
Desire Kabila, which is responsible for these atrocities."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government wants the international community to
put pressure on Kabila to "put an end to the Human rights
violations in the DRC," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kinshasa and Kigali turned sour after
Democratic Congo accused Rwanda of invading the country and
backing a Tutsie Banyamulenge rebellion in the east which broke
out since August 2, but Kigali denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwanda has reopened its border with the DRC at the
level of Gisenyi-Goma, the RNA reported Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, the border between Rwanda and south Kivu has yet been
reopened, eyewitnesses told RNA.
</P>
<P>
As the situation normalizes in the territories under rebel
control in eastern Congo, the residents on both sides of the
border have continually complained that the closure of the border
was affecting trade activities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to reopen the border because of the growing
suffering of the population on both sides," a senior government
official in Gisenyi told RNA.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the prayers will demand a credible, fair
and international investigation committee to uncover the truth
about the May and other on-going racist violence in Indonesia, to
prosecute and punish all the military criminals and their
masterminds under the appropriate human rights and other laws
accepted by the United Nations and the world community.
</P>
<P>
"We also demand the Indonesian government abolish all
discriminatory laws and policies oppressing the ethnic Chinese
minority of Indonesia, and guarantee all their civil, political,
cultural and religious rights as co-equal citizens," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the prayers will also call for the worldwide boycott
on all trade and other economic exchanges with Indonesia until
justice is given the victims and until full civil, religious and
cultural rights for the Chinese minority are respected.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the organizers distributed duplicated
photos showing ethnic Chinese women being raped, tortured or
killed in May in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's State Woos Visitors With CyberDining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A CyberDining system was
introduced in Sarawak, the largest state of Malaysia, Thursday to
woo not only tourists but also industrialists to invest in the
state.
</P>
<P>
CyberDining, which enables hotel and restaurant reservation to
be made through the Internet, could put Sarawak on the
international map by encouraging not only tourists but also
industrialists to visit the state, the state's Industrial
Development Minister Abang Johari Tun Abang Openg said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This latest electronic technology can be an enticement for
industrialists to invest in Sarawak, he said in the state's
capital of Kuching Thursday while launching Kuching Hilton's
CyberDining On-line Fax reservation system, Malaysia's national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
"The website is not only an excellent source of information for
potential visitors to our cities, visiting tourists and locals but
also promotes our country's colorful and diverse food industry,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hilton Kuching is the first hotel of more than 150
establishments in Malaysia to utilize the internet facility. The
E-system allows a person anywhere to make reservations through the
hotel's six food and beverage (F&AMP;B) outlets's web pages which can
be accessed at Malaysia's premier F&AMP;B electronic directory and
comes up with the estimated price of selections from the
Interactive Menu.
</P>
<P>
CyberDining located at http://www.cyberdining.net is a project
of Vensara Sdn Bhd, a Sarawak-based Internet development company,
whose membership currently covers only restaurants, cafes, pubs,
bars and lounges in Kuching and the federal capital city of Kuala
Lumpur.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks, Jewish Group Reach Agreement Holocaust Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Jewish groups, Swiss banks and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors on Wednesday reached agreement on
claims to assets worth 1.2 billion dollars lost during World War
II, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The money will be paid out over three years for the release of
all claims including dormant account claims against two commercial
banks -- UBS AG and the Credit Suisse -- plus the Swiss National
Bank, other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry,
the AP quoted Marc Cohen, a lawyer for the banks, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe, expecting to retrieve
it later.
</P>
<P>
Survivor Gisella Weissehaus originally sued the banks on
Oct. 2, 1996. Litigation grew into class-action suits representing
31,500 plaintiffs worldwide after Swiss bank employee Christoph
Meili in January 1997 rescued Holocaust-era documents from a
shredder room at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The settlement comes after Jewish leaders on June 19 rejected
an offer by the Swiss banks to pay 600 million dollars to settle
the claims.
</P>
<P>
The first payment of 250 million dollars will be made 90 days
after the U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman grants his
approval.

<HEADLINE> India Currency Rupee Under Heavy Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite repeated interventions
by the Reserve Bank of India, Indian currency rupee has been under
heavy pressure and sank below the psychological level of 43 per
U.S. dollar in hectic volatile trading on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rupee opened on a week note at 42.91-93 a U.S. dollar and
improved to 42.84-86 in early transactions. However, it was soon
overwhelmed by heavy corporate dollar buying, both in the spot and
forward markets and declined to 42.95-98 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of India, the major player in foreign exchange
markets in the country, sold some U.S. dollars around 42.98 a
dollar, but could not stem the fall. As soon as the bank went out,
the rupee nose-dived to hit the all-time low of 43.35 per dollar
in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepped in to shore up the
rupee and sold U.S. dollars in three installments. The
intervention by the apex bank helped the Indian currency recover
partially to 42.97-43.05 at the close.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on the rupee has been building up for long and the
sentiment continued to be weak against the rupee. The rupee would
continue to be under pressure in the days to come, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty at home, currency crisis in East Asian
countries and sheer panic pulled the local currency rupee down,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Price Falls Cost Argentina Heavily in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Lower prices in grain,
flour and crude oil cost Argentina 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in
export revenues in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Based on last year's prices, estimates had valued exports at
500 million U.S. dollars more in grain, 460 million dollars more
in flour and 300 million dollars more in crude oil, a government
report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the total value of exports reached
13.433 billion dollars, a 3.6 percent increase over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase would have been 13.3 percent before prices fell,
the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the Asian financial crisis for the fall of
prices in the international markets.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Vasco scored
two first-half goals to beat Ecuador's Barcelona in the first leg
of the South American Libertadores Cup final on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Donizete opened the account with a long-range drive with seven
minutes into the game before striker Luizao added the second off
a pass from Mauro Galvao.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Vasco failed to convert more goals despite
a number of chances, but they still enjoyed a comfortable margin
into the second leg in two weeks time in Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
In the Libertadores Cup, ties are decided by aggregate score
but the rule of away goals is not to be applied and penalties
will decide the winners without extra time play once both squads
tied in their home-and-away games.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, aiming to become the first club from their country
to win the tournament, suffered a severe blow with Donizete's
goal, which came after one of their defenders slipped and lost
the ball to the Vasco player.
</P>
<P>
Luizao, who returned to Brazil to join Vasco after six unhappy
months with Spain's Deportivo Coruna last year, increased the
lead in the 34th minute after defender Mauro Galvao flicked the
ball to him between two defenders in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona had plenty of possession in the first half but were
let down by an ineffective performance in attack from Colombian
World Cup player Anthony de Avila.
</P>
<P>
Vasco, who have never won the trophy, made more chances in the
second half but were repeatedly thwarted.

of Switzerland ousted Croatia's Iva Majoli in straight sets at
the 450,000 U.S. dollars Acura Classic tennis tournament in
Manhattan Beach, California of the United States Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Hingis, who began the quest for her first title in

Preparing to defend her U.S. Open title in three weeks, Hingis
made her summer hardcourt debut at last week's Toshiba tennis
classic, but lost to Mary Pierce of France in the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Minimum Wage Only Good for Half Food Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's current minimum wage
in Venezuela of 100,000 Bolivares (about 176.68 U.S. dollars) is
only good for 50.9 percent of a family's basic food requirement,
said the Center for Documentation and Analysis for the Workers
(CENDA).
</P>
<P>
A study published by the center on Wednesday said the salary
can only cover 25.5 percent of the needs of a 5.2 member family,
which include food, health services, housing and education.
</P>
<P>
The services cost 392,964 Bolivares (about 694 dollars) and the
food needs 196,482 Bolivares (about 340 dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the basic foods increased 3.01 percent in the first
two months of 1998 and 5.84 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
In March and April, the minimum wage was only enough to buy
40.72 percent of the basic family requirements, said the CENDA.

night.
</P>
<P>

the Washington Mystics 75-55 tonight.
</P>

</P>
<P>

three-game losing streak and improved to 4-3 under interim coach
Orlando Woolridge. Los Angeles limited Charlotte to seven
baskets and opened a 21-point lead in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects No Improvement in Investment While </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will see no improvement
in its investment environment so long as most of Asia remains in
economic turmoil, the Bangkok Post Thursday quoted the country's
Board of Investment (BoI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon Phasukvanich, Deputy Secretary-General of the BoI,
was quoted as saying that Thailand's slump could continue for up
to seven years if, in the worst case, the economy in the United
States slows down while Japan fails to solve its problems.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan's investment is especially crucial to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The BoI has seen a drop of 12.1 percent to 407 in the number of
applications for promotional privileges in the first half of this
year compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total value of projects proposed recorded a sharper drop of
48.1 percent to 148.7 billion baht (3.6 billion U.S. dollars),
according to a BoI report.
</P>
<P>
Given the long lead time between the filing of an application
and the actual startup of a venture, the long-term outlook is
poor.
</P>
<P>
The number of BoI-promoted factories opened in the first half
totaled 326, worth 102.1 billion baht (2.49 billion dollars),
compared to that of 236 plants worth 148.5 billion baht (5.94
billion dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 403 project approved by the BoI in the first six
months of this year, Japanese companies topped the list of foreign
investors with 114 projects worth 35 billion baht (854 million
dollars), but most of the investment was in expanding existing
factories.
</P>
<P>
European investors followed the Japanese, holding 52 projects
worth 27.8 billion baht (678 million dollars), while Americans
came third with 51 projects worth 16 billion baht (390 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investment in light industries, electronics, electrical goods
and agro-industries showed growth, while services and
infrastructure, chemicals, paper, automobiles and plastic recorded
slowdown.

</P>
<P>
But he predicted that grain exports will total about 3 million

Experts attributed the drop to bad weather, drought in eastern

Output of Animal products increased by 2.7 percent compared with

BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports in July
totaled 520,000 tons, worth 7 billion baht (about 173 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of the year, Thailand's rice

billion U.S. dollars). In dollar terms, exports rose 11 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted Thursday by
the Bangkok Post as saying that world demand remains strong but
major producers have seen lower output. India and Pakistan have
lower inventories for export, while Vietnam continues to restrict
shipments.
</P>
<P>
As a result, several markets have switched to more imports from
Thailand, especially Africa and Latin America. In the third
quarter, exports are forecast to average no less than 450,000 to

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Secret Japanese files have been
found in Hailar, Hulun Buir League, in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, providing new evidence concerning
Japan's invasion of northeast China during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The files reveal Japanese military activities in the
occupied area, such as sending troops to suppress
resistance, extracting forced labor from ordinary Chinese, and
establishing brothels for the Japanese armies.
</P>
<P>
They also record espionage activities aimed at the Eighth Route
Army and other resistance forces in northeastern China. Some of
the documents reflect the political, cultural, and social lives of
the people in the occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
These files, which are marked "secret", "highly secret" or
"most secret," were found two meters below the ground of a
construction site in the city's western district.
</P>
<P>
The local cultural relics department concluded after thorough
investigation that the files belonged to Japanese military,
police, and espionage organs.
</P>
<P>
These files were partially burned and hastily buried on the eve
of Japan's surrender to China in August 1945, an official with the
city's cultural relics department said, adding that work on the
collation and protection of these documents is underway.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Advertizing Must Abide by Law: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) said that tobacco advertising must
abide by the relevant stipulations of the Advertising Law, the
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette and tobacco ads are banned from newspapers,
television and certain public places in china such as airports,
waiting rooms, on highrises and in cinemas, according to the
advertizing Law.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements can be put on billboards and automobiles, said
Dong Jingsheng, a division chief of the SAIC.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, many local governments have tried to ban nearly
all cigarette ads in direct contradiction with the law, spurred by
a yearly National Sanitary Metropolis appraisal.
</P>
<P>
As the appraisal approaches each September, local governments
have tried to get rid of cigarette ads in bus stations and
streets, one of the ten conditions for qualifying as a sanitary
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Dong said local governments should be consistent in
implementing the law on cigarette ads to avoid disputes with
advertizers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said many local governments want both a reputation as a
clean city and the profits from selling space for cigarette
ads. Big profits to be made from cigarette ads tempt local
officials to skirt the law by selling even more space than legal.
</P>
<P>
That inconsistent application of the law must stop, Dong said,
adding that offenders must be punished.

</P>
<P>
"At present, if you don't take them to court, they can post
bail," Mercado said. "In the new bill, it is immediate
deportation."
</P>
<P>
Mercado himself filed a similar bill in 1996 when he was still
a senator but this did not prosper after human rights groups
attacked it for restricting civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
The move to resurrect the measure was spurred by last week's
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed
more than 200 people and wounded thousands, according to Mercado.
</P>
<P>
Controversial provisions in the 1996 bill that would allow
police to tap telephones and freeze bank accounts are not included
in the new version.
</P>
<P>
Defense Assistant Secretary Ruben Carranza said the bill would
specifically confront international terrorism carried out by
foreigners whether or not in conspiracy with Filipinos within the
Philippines or outside.
</P>
<P>
"It (the bill) would also strengthen Philippine cooperation in
international efforts at combating terrorism worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, foreign embassies and their
facilities in Manila have been given added police protection.

SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first manufacturer of
sealed, service-free batteries for automobiles has begun
operations in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Delco International Battery Co. Ltd. is a joint

<P>
The batteries produced by the joint venture do not need such
maintenance as adding water and recharging, and their service life
is three-to-four times that of ordinary batteries.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, with a designed annual production of more
than 1.4 million batteries, is expected to produce more than

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Allocates 77 Million U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
allocated funds totaling one trillion rupiah (about 77 million
U.S. dollars) for next year's May general election, a Home Affairs
Ministry official was quoted by the local press Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Funds needed for the election depend on the system to be used.
If we use the combination of district-proportional system, for
example, we will need about one trillion rupiah," the ministry's
Secretary General Feisal Tamin said.
</P>
<P>
Tamin was speaking to reporters after reading a prepared speech
from Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid at a meeting held to
prepare for the next general election on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by secretaries of the provincial
administrations from across the country.
</P>
<P>
Tamin said the government, through the Ministry of Finance and
the National Development Planning Board, has made the funds
allocation.
</P>
<P>
The government spent 1.4 trillion rupiah for the last general
election.
</P>
<P>
While details of the funds allocation for the upcoming general
election were not specified, based on the previous election
experience, they will be used to underwrite the cost of the
election itself as well as provide some assistance to all parties
participating in the election.
</P>
<P>
Next year's general election is to be held in three stages,
Tamin said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage is to be used for preparation, and will run
from July to December this year.
</P>
<P>
The second is the implementation of the general election
itself, from January to July 1999, while the third stage from July
to December 1999 will include the holding of a general session of
the people's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
One important agenda during the general session of the MPR is
to elect the president.

<HEADLINE> Italian Interior Minister Defends New Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano Wednesday played down concern over the recent influx of
illegal immigrants, saying detained illegal immigrants would soon
be repatriated to their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Italian Radio, Napolitano defended the new
immigration laws drawn up in March and said the police would
fingerprint unidentified immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"Once they are deported, they will no longer be allowed to
enter either Italy or Europe legally, so it is in their interests
to cooperate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Italian law, illegal immigrants are detained in
holding centers for 30 days, while authorities establish their
identity. If at the end of this period, no papers have been found,
the immigrant leaves the center with an expulsion order which must
be honored within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition and even some members of the ruling Olive
Tree coalition have criticized the law, terming it as
"ineffective, impractical, and differing little from the old
system."
</P>
<P>
They argued that the law has provided the immigrants with
enough time (a two-week period of grace) during which they can
disappear into the surroundings, or make their way to other
destinations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano admitted that the new law doesn't work in every
respect, but the government is ready to listen to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
"We know we are facing substantial difficulties, but we can see
no alternative to the policy which we are following," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 illegal immigrants have landed on Italy's
shores since July.

</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the municipal government as
saying that the city is to establish a high-tech investment fund
to provide capital support for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In co-operation with the Ministry of Science and Technology and
the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the city is eager to
get excellent high-tech firms to float stocks in domestic and
international markets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A service center has been opened to help improve information
exchanges between technical inventors and investors in the Beijing
Economic and Technology Development Zone. A similar center will
also be set up in the Beijing High-tech Development Pilot Zone.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the municipal government has worked out 10 special
favorable policies to help private high-tech firms, and the city
is ready to transform some large scientific research
institutes into high-tech firms in accordance with related state
institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its high-tech firms which mainly focus on
information technology, electronics and machinery and new energy
industries, the municipal government is also encouraging
development of the biological and medical sectors,
environmental protection, and new materials industries.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Invalidates Agreement With Costa Rica. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government has
declared a two-week-old border agreement with Costa Rica "invalid
and non-existent" in a dispute over the movement of armed forces
along the boundary line.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, covering a 300-kilometer stretch of the Rio San
Juan river which separates the two countries, was signed on July
30 by Nicaragua's Minister of National Defense Jaime Cuadra and
Costa Rican Minister of Public Security Juan Rafael Lizano.
</P>
<P>
Under current treaties, the waterway is under Nicaraguan
sovereignty, but Costa Rica has the right of free navigation.
</P>
<P>
A conflict arose last month when Nicaragua forbade Costa Rican
armed forces from navigating the river with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last month's agreement allowed Costa Rican police officers to
keep navigating the river carrying weapons, but only after they
informed Nicaraguan authorities of their plans.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, however, met with strong opposition in
Nicaragua's political circles, resulting in a claim by President
Arnoldo Aleman that it was just a simple "press release."
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Republic of Nicaragua, after having
reviewed and analyzed very carefully the mentioned document, has
been able to conclude that, according to our political
constitution, the agreement has no legal validity, so it does not
admit any regulations and the government of Nicaragua has to
consider it null and non-existent," said Nicaraguan Foreign
Affairs Minister Roberto Gurdian Debayle in a diplomatic notice.
</P>
<P>
He added that Nicaragua was willing to try to resolve the
dispute under international law so that both nations remained
cooperative and friendly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Engineer Vows to Save Leaning Tower of Pisa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Leaning Tower of Pisa can be
saved from destruction and restored to its original slant of 600
years ago, says a Chinese engineer who spent 30 years studying the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul of the world-famous tower, which was on the verge
of collapse, could be finished within 10 months, Cao Shizhong said
here amid mounting criticism that previous methods to save the
tower only made the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
He said with his method, the spiral tower could be back to its
original incline of 2.1 meters off center when it was completed in
1350.
</P>
<P>
The eight-storey Leaning Tower, which is 54.5 meters high, adds
an average of 1 mm a year to its 4.5-meter lean and has been
closed to the public since 1990 for safety and conservation
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese expert, who has been studying the Leaning Tower for
30 years, refused to reveal his rehabilitation plans based on his
Chinese-patent technologies, but said that a principle for the
plan would be "to conquer hardness with softness".
</P>
<P>
He said he would take a comprehensive approach to save the
monument, including reinforcements, slanting correction, treating
the main body of the tower, and lessening the huge pressure on the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Saving the Leaning Tower of Pisa has become my life work,"
said Cao.
</P>
<P>
The engineer added that his methods had worked with some 80
leaning structures in China, including the Cyan Pagoda, or the
so-called "Pisa Tower in Shanghai", which had been slanting 1.56
meters.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities have spent 22 million U.S. dollars on
preservation measures, but have been criticized by the art
protection agency, Artwatch International, for further endangering
the structure.

COLOMBO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police are hunting
islandwide for an explosives-laden truck despatched by Tamil

the Island newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>

The truck reportedly despatched from Valachenai in the North
East had slipped into Southern province and after entering
Kataragama in the deep South during the annual Esala Festival it
had made use of the heavy traffic and disappeared.

According to Police, the truck was carrying 15 rebel cadres in
addition to arms and ammunition and was targeting VIPs and
government installations in the South, the Island said.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing the registration number of the blue truck whose
driver has been identified as Nagendran, all police stations in
Eastern province have been alerted and also sought public
cooperation to trace the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan police have stepped up patrolling and set up
additional checkpoints to track it down, the paper added.

TIRANA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) mission
called on both groups involved in the military clashes in Kosovo
to stop fighting and resume the search for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The mission, consisting of members of the European Parliament

The EU was studying all possible autonomy options for Kosovo,

the mission told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
It would be a tragedy if the clashes also flared up in
Macedonia, the mission said.
</P>
<P>
Any military intervention could be carried out only if it were
in accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The mission also urged Kosovo refugees to return home, saying
the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees could ensure
their safety.
</P>
<P>
Since February, it is estimated that there are 250,000 to
300,000 Kosovo refugees on the run. Albania and Macedonia are two
of their main temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
In his recent talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised to prepare for the
returning refugees, including rebuilding their homes which have

well last week."
</P>
<P>
Her spot in the 28-player draw was taken by "lucky loser"
Elena Tatarkova of Ukraine who eliminated Basuki 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in
San Diego.

<P>
Pierce has flown back home to Florida to receive additional
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials Deny Rumors of Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian leaders Wednesday
dismissed the rampant rumors of impending unrest this weekend
ahead of the August 17 Independence Day celebration, the Jakarta
Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie, Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung and National Police Chief Lt. Gen.
Roesmanhadi promoted a sense of calm and appealed to people not to
be stirred by unfounded rumors.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said Wednesday he could understand that people may
still be traumatized by the riots which hit major cities in May,
but maintained there was no reason to doubt the security status.
</P>
<P>
"Let us jointly fight the rumors spread by irresponsible
people", he said when meeting 100 Protestant leaders at the
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, the country saw the worst looting and
rioting in decades in Jakarta, Medan and Solo. More than 1,000
lives were claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Feisal Tanjung also dismissed rumors of unrest as "nonsense".
"It is very easy to disseminate such rumors," he told reporters
prior to a weekly Cabinet meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi urged people not to be agitated by rumors as the
police guaranteed the safety of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces also flexed its muscle here Wednesday as it
gathered 12,500 personnel in what it described as a routine check
on preparations for the independence celebrations, which will
include several state ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances, the paper said, many people appear to
be bracing themselves for the worst as word-of-mouth speculation
has sown anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Travel agents in the capital reported unusually high demand for
ticket reservations to overseas destinations for this time of year
and in the economic crisis. Destinations to Bali, Singapore, Hong
Kong and Australia were said to be in high demand.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that major cities such Jakarta, Surabaya,
Bandung and Medan have been gripped by fear of nationwide rampage
around August 17.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found 30,000-sq meter historical sites dating back to 3,000 years
ago in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Local archeologist Fan Changsheng noted that three historical
sites dating to the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th Century B.C.)
were discovered last month during construction of a north-south
highway near Zhangshu.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed pieces of ancient pottery from
sites which were near peanut fields, according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
"The number of records and relics concerning the history
in the southern section of the Yangtze River is limited", said
Fan, adding that the recently unearthed pottery will provide
valuable clues for further studies on the region's culture and
development.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists discovered a number of tombs dating to the Shang
and Western Zhou dynasties (11th Century B.C.-771 B.C.) in the
area between 1973-1990.
</P>
<P>
The most recent discovery includes sites dating to the same
historical period as the tombs, said Fan.

<HEADLINE> Jones Wins, Bailey Injured in Golden League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world champion Marion
Jones won the women's 100 meters while Olympic champion Donovan
Bailey injuried at the Zurich international meet, a part of the
Golden League series in Switzerland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
American Jones clocked 10.77 seconds for the sixth fastest
time of the year to remain unbeaten this season, leaving the rest
of the competitors in her dust.
</P>
<P>
However, her winning time was above her personal best of
10.71, not to mention the world record of 10.49 set by Florence
Griffith Joyner.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100 meters, Canadian Bailey was trapped in misery
after injuring his left leg with 60 meters into the race.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, 30, lay down to the ground before being helped off the
field and was taken to hospital by ambulance. Doctor Roland
Biedert said Bailey would be out from two-to-four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100 meters was won thus by Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya,
with a personal best of 9.96.
</P>
<P>
Jones' compatriot Chryste Gaines finished second by 0.27
seconds behind, followed by Ukrainian Zhanna Pintusevich in 11.07.
</P>
<P>
Early, the 22-year-old Jones also won the women's long jump by
leaping 7.31 meters to increase her harvest to one win in 60
meters, 14 in 100 meters, five in 200 meters, one in 400 meters
and seven in long jump in her 28 contests of the year.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Zurich's track failed to produce any world record against
three last year despite a bonus of 50,000 US dollars and a field
of all world's elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Michael Johnson was the favorite to
break the 400 meters world record, set by Butch Reynolds on the
same track a decade ago, but the American could only improve on
his season's best.
</P>
<P>
Johnson crossed the finishing line in 43.69, short of his
personal best of 43.39 and nowhere near Reynolds' 43.29.
</P>
<P>
Americans Alvin Harrison and Tyree Washington were second and
third in 44.19 and 44.42 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Haile Gebrselassie also failed to produce a world mark in the
5,000 meters which the Ethiopian won in 12:54.08.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to run under the world record but it wouldn't work,"
said Gebrselassie, who has improved the 5,000m and 10,000m world
records this season, "The last two kilometers were a little
difficult."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,500 meters, Hicham El-Guerrouj failed to break
his own world record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last month, but still
posted the second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's Maria Mutola also ran a season best in the
women's 800 meters, crossing in 1:56.11.
</P>
<P>
Four athletes are still in contention for the 1 million U.S.
dollars jackpot shared by those who remain unbeaten in certain
events in the six Golden League meets and the Grand Prix final in
Moscow on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Jones are El-Guerrouj, Gebrselassie and 400m
hurdler Bryan Bronson of the United States.

hypothyroiditis here on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is taken after the United Nations has warned

</P>
<P>
Hypothyroiditis is caused by a lack of iodine after suffering
goiter diseases, and it sometimes can cause severe mental
retardation or neurological problems.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will start in Buenos Aires and will move to
six other cities in Argentina before going to Chile,
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Maintain High Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has refused to lower its overnight rates that were
raised twice this week even though the peso strengthened to close
at 43.15 pesos per U.S. dollar Wednesday at the local foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted Thursday by
the Philippine Journal as saying there is still a considerable
amount of speculation in the market as shown by total trades of
192.5 million dollars although lower than Tuesday's total trade of
311.55 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the central did not intervene by selling some of its
dollars to meet market demand.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the interest rate hike worked as planned as the
peso opened firmer Wednesday at 43.48 pesos per dollar from its
previous closing rate of 43.61 pesos "buoyed by the interest rate
hikes and the stronger Japanese yen."
</P>
<P>
The weakness of the Japanese yen earlier boosted speculation
that the peso will fall further than it actually has.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by a sharp fall of the peso Monday, the central bank
raised its overnight borrowing rate and lending rate by five
percentage points, respectively, within two days. The borrowing
rate was hiked from 13 percent to 18 percent, and the lending rate
from 15 percent to 20 percent.

BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's restaurant business
maintained rapid growth in the first half of this year, the State
Statistics Bureau says.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales of the sector were 128.4 billion yuan (15 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first six months, up 16.1 percent from the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth exceeded that of the wholesale, retail, and
manufacturing sectors, and contributed 1.3 percentage points to
the increase in consumer goods sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the increase to the improved standard of
living, the quicker pace of urban life, and increased tourism.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Exploration Company to Withdraw from Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. company Atlantic
Richfield Co. (ARCO) will withdraw from Myanmar after sinking 50
million U.S. dollars into a project off the coast of Myanmar, a
company spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Changing investment priorities, "not protests or events inside
Myanmar," influenced ARCO's decision not to renew its exploration
projects in October, said the spokesman Al Greenstein.
</P>
<P>
ARCO has spent about 50 million dollars since it began
exploring for gas off the southern coast of Myanmar two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company allowed one of two exploration
leases to expire in June and will allow the second one to expire
in October without renewing.
</P>
<P>
ARCO's acquisition of Houston-based Union Texas Petroleum
Holdings Inc., another U.S. oil and gas company with worldwide
operations, led the company to rethink its global priorities,
Greenstein said.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts believe that ARCO may be forced to
leave Myanmar after the Clinton administration last year imposed a
ban on new investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Greenstein said ARCO still believes that punitive economic
sanctions end up hurting only U.S. firms that are unfairly kept
out of promising markets while their foreign competitors move in.
</P>
<P>
"We believe engagement is preferable to isolation and companies
like ARCO are a constructive force in poor countries like
Myanmar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following ARCO's withdrawal, The only one major U.S. firm still
in Myanmar is Unocal Corp., which is a partner in a multinational
consortium developing a 1.2-billion-dollar pipeline. That project
is due to begin operation in December.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Leather Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua)-- China has formulated a long-term
strategy of promoting itself as the world's leading leather
producer in the coming century, according to the China Leather
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes raising the output of major leather products
by 5 percent, and sales and exports by 7 percent annually in the
coming 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Leather products earned 10 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
exchange for China in 1997, becoming the largest foreign exchange
earner in the light industry.
</P>
<P>
The world's leather consumption is estimated at 2 billion
square meters in 2000, up 33 percent from the 1991 figure. The
demand for leather shoes alone is expected to increase to 11
billion pairs.
</P>
<P>
The higher demand will pose both chances and challenges to
China, association experts said. As Chinese leather exports
featured low-grade items in the past, experts urged improved
quality control and more technology input to sharpen the
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Also under the plan, the number of medium and large enterprises
will account for 10 percent of the total and their sales should
make up 45 percent of the total by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The industry is also asked to be more export-oriented and to
create more internationally recognized name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
Special emphasis is being put on market promotion through
information dissemination and trade fairs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Public Sector Behind in Dealing with Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Computer systems of the
U.S. public sector continues to be less prepared for the Year
2000 problem than those in the private sector, says a new study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the technology services and consulting
group Cap Gemini America, also found that among the nation's
biggest corporations are behind in dealing with the Year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
The problem stems from a programming shortcut that reads years
as just two digits. When the decade flips, computers affected by
the problem will read 2000 as 1900, creating useless data or
crashing altogether.
</P>
<P>
The Cap Gemini survey consisted of interviews of information
technology managers at 116 U.S. corporations and 14 government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of the biggest U.S. corporations cleansing the
Y2K glitch from their computer systems are those in the software,
financial services, computer hardware, manufacturing and
telecommunications, following by businesses in the aerospace, oil
and gas, pharmaceutical and distribution industries.
</P>
<P>
On the 0-to-100 preparedness scale with 100 being most
prepared, the local, state and federal government sector scored a
67, while private sector scores ranging from 80 for the health
industry to 88 for the software industry.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of Year 2000-related system crashes is expected
to rise significantly next year, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents said they plan to accomplish the bulk of
their Year 2000 work during 1999. With just more than 500 days to
go, only 15 percent expect that more than three quarters of their
critical systems will be "completely tested and compliant" January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of the respondents expect at least 76
percent of these systems to be compliant by January 2000.

<HEADLINE> Russian National Hockey Team Has New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian National Hockey Team
on Wednesday elected Alexander Yakushev as the chief coach, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Ice Hockey Federation President Alexander
Steblin, Yakushev is a very quite and good-tempered man, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Yakushev told reporters that he would not rely only on players
employed by the National Hockey League or active in the Russian
championships.
</P>
<P>
Those "in the best shape at the time of the games will play
for the national team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yakushev, 52, played for Spartak Moscow and the USSR national
teams. The USSR national team won two Olympic golds in 1972 and
1976. It also won the world and Europe championships in 1967,
1969, 1970 and 1979, Interfax said.

GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has been accelerating development of its private
businesses by pursuing a series of preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The private sector now accounts for more than 65 percent of the
output value generated by enterprises in Guzhen Town in the city
of Zhongshan.
</P>
<P>
Both the number and business scope (scale) of private
enterprises in Humen Town in Dongguan City have caught up with the
corresponding figures of the collective sector.
</P>
<P>
Human Town now has more than 300 private firms, each with
capital exceeding 10 million yuan, and four with 100 million yuan.

Private businesses also have increased exports of the
province. Guangdong now has at least 4,000 private companies
dealing with exports.
</P>
<P>
Private companies in Shantou handled one billion U.S. dollars
of exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The private sector is expected to become a booming economic

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Decides to Sell Wellington Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
has decided to sell its shareholding in the Wellington
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The decision was contained in a media release from the Prime
Minister's Office, which was issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the release, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said
that her cabinet had discussed the matter of the airport fully and
agreed to execute a sale.
</P>
<P>
"The sale will be subject to details being finalized and as
soon as those details are established, I would expect a public
announcement to be made," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington International Airport is the joint property of
the NZ government and the Wellington City Council with the former
owning 66 percent shareholding in it.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington City Council decided last week not to sell its
stake. It has also appealed to the central government to maintain
its shareholding.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the airport, the coalition government formed by
the National Party and the NZ First has held rounds of
discussions. The National Party headed by Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley is determined to push for the sale, but its minority
partner in the coalition government the NZ First led by Deputy
Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters opposes the sale.
</P>
<P>
A special Cabinet meeting was held yesterday to force a
showdown over the sale of the Wellington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers, NZ First leader Peters and three
of his cabinet colleagues "stalked out" of the meeting last night
as a decision was about to be taken on the future of the
government's shareholding in the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, said that Winston
Peters walked out on Jenny Shipley last night, "throwing the
coalition government into Turmoil".
</P>
<P>
"Such a walk-out is unprecedented in the experience of New
Zealand government," Shipley said in the release.
</P>
<P>
"I view this as terribly serious in terms of the credibility of
our country and also the credibility of this coalition government,
to continue to deliver good government," she added.
</P>
<P>
The sale struck at one of NZ First's founding principles in
terms of guarantees over New Zealand ownership, Peters told
reporters after walking out of the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We will not sell the public assets of this country into
foreign ownership, nor will we sell our principles and beliefs
purely for the positions of public office," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peters said that he would write to Shipley suggesting the issue
be referred to the Coalition Disputes Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion commented that the walkout, which follows weeks of
ill feeling, "spells the almost certain end of the coalition."
</P>
<P>
"Whether Mrs Shipley can remain in office will depend on
whether she can muster enough votes from other parties and NZ
First defectors," the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Robson Blasts "Pathetic" Hoddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Bryan Robson has described as
"pathetic" England manager Glenn Hoddle's revelations of his
clashes with Boro midfielder Paul Gascoigne in the build-up to
France 98.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough manager Robson criticised the revelations
reported in The Sun, which is serialising Hoddle's book.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people living off the back of Gazza's
reputation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle is accused of making money at Gazza's expense, Robson
is particularly angry that Gascoigne is not being allowed to put
his difficulties behind him.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is pathetic the way everyone is jumping on the
Gazza bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a slanging match with Glenn Hoddle,
because Gazza will let his football do the talking.
</P>
<P>
"The annoying thing is that people won't write about Paul
Gascoigne the footballer."
</P>
<P>
The England manager described in detail Paul Gascoigne's
reaction to being told he was dropped from the World Cup squad.
</P>
<P>
He said Gazza smashed his fist into a large lamp and ranted
and swore "like a man possessed".
</P>
<P>
He appeared to be dealing with the situation but then flew
into a rage and kicked out at a chair with his bare foot.
</P>
<P>
"He was a different person now. He had snapped," writes
Hoddle. "I stood there and he turned as if to go again, then came
back with a barrage of abuse."
</P>
<P>
Paul Gascoigne's agent Mel Stein said on Tuesday that they
were "obviously disappointed that the England manager has gone
public on this issue".
</P>
<P>
The Football Association will find it hard to take any action
against Hoddle, as FA press officer David Davies is credited as
having helped Hoddle with his book.

<HEADLINE> Study: Left Breast Radiation May Affect Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Women who have radiation
treatment for left breast cancer appear to run an increased risk
of fatal heart attack, said a study published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the latest issue of the Journal of
Clinical Oncology, said that a team of researchers led by Lawrence
Paszat of Kingston General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, have
compared the incidence of fatal heart attacks among more than
200,000 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1973
and 1992 and subsequently underwent lumpectomy.
</P>
<P>
Overall, women who received postoperative radiation treatment
for left-sided breast cancer ran a 17 percent higher risk for
fatal heart attack than those who had radiation for right-sided
breast cancer, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that those under age 60 who had
postoperative radiation for left-sided breast cancer ran nearly twice
the risk of fatal heart attack as peers given radiation treatment for
right-sided breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
But women over age 60 who had radiation treatment for
left-sided breast cancer had no higher risk of fatal heart attack
than those with right-sided cancer, Paszat and colleagues reported.
</P>
<P>
The researchers urged more studies to evaluate the results.
</P>
<P>
"Further study would help to identify the characteristics of
women at the greatest risk for this event, and treatment
characteristics associated with substantially increased risk for
cardiac morbidity after postoperative radiation therapy," Paszat's
team said.

<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Former European champions Bayern
Munich, Inter Milan and Benfica all virtually secured their
places in the Champions' League when they trounced respective
rivals in the European Cup second round qualifying first leg ties
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several former winners of the European Cup
struggled, including 1988 champions PSV Eindhover who lost to
Slovenia's Maribor Teatanic 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Two teams from Britain claimed victories at home, with
Manchester United beating LKS Lodz of Poland 2-0 in Manchester
and Celtic edging Croatia Zagreb 1-0 in Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
Top scorers of the night were Benfica who crushed Beitar
Jerusalem 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich brushed aside the challenge of Obilic Belgrade
of Yugosalavia 4-0, while Inter beat Skonto Riga of Latvia by the
same score.
</P>
<P>
Spartak Moscow also booked their place in the Champions'
League with a remarkable 5-0 away win against Liteks Lovech of
Bulgaria, with all five goals coming in the final 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Inter, the UEFA Cup holders, stormed into a 3-0 lead against
Skonto Riga after just 21 minutes with goals by Ivan Zamorano,
Diego Simeoni and Nicola Ventola.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio, on his competitive debut for Inter, added the
fourth in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Steaua Bucharest, European champions in 1986, twice came from
behind to draw 2-2 at home with Panathinaikos of Greece while
Dynamo Kiev, who lost in the quarter-finals to Juventus last
season, may not even reach the group stages this time after they
were surprised 1-0 at home by Sparta Prague. Miroslav Beranec
scored the vital away goal after just five minutes.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Sturm Graz matched the big guns by thrashing
Hungary's Ujpest 4-0 in Austria, Georgian side Dynamo Tbilisi
beat visiting Spaniards Athletic Bilbao 2-1 while HJK Helsinki
notched up a good win, 1-0 over Metz of France.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Safety Assessment for U.S. Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with his foreign policy advisers on Wednesday and called for a
quick report on security assessment of U.S. diplomatic sites
abroad following twin bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met in the White House Situation Room with senior
officials, including Defense Secretary William Cohen, Attorney
General Janet Reno, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger,
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and FBI Director Louis
Freeh.
</P>
<P>
The president asked for an assessment of what it would cost
to rebuild the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and the
price tag for emergency response teams sent to the two
countries, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for "a list of the priorities for improving our
security, particularly at high-risk posts around the world,"
Crowley told reporters, noting that such a report was to be
presented in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Based on the report, the president will ask Congress for an
emergency supplemental appropriation, he added.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton assessed security needs with his top aides,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright departed earlier on
Wednesday for Germany to bring back to the United States the remains
of 10 of 12 U.S. victims of the bombing at Nairobi embassy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton plans to preside over a ceremony for the victims at
Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, when they are brought
back.

<HEADLINE> Arms Inspections in Iraq Will Be Delayed: Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chief U.N. arms
inspector said Wednesday that under the current circumstances his
commission is not able to "provide the same level of assurances"
of Iraq's compliance with its obligations in arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
"A number of inspections planned in the chemical, biological
and missile fields will be delayed pending resolution of the
current situation," said Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council president, dated
August 12, Butler said Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with
UNSCOM brings to a halt all of the disarmament activities and
places limitations on the rights of UNSCOM to conduct its
monitoring operations.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament inspections are designed to dismantle banned
weapons while monitoring is to ensure that banned activities are
not resumed.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's position that all disarmament activities must cease has
forced the commission to suspend, throughout Iraq, all such work
as it requires the cooperation of Iraq," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"This includes discussions at the political and technical level
aimed at resolving outstanding issues," it said.
</P>
<P>
"These discussions and inspections were aimed at bringing to
closure outstanding disarmament issues which need to be resolved
if the commission is to be in a position to report that Iraq is in
compliance with its disarmament obligations, as established by the
council," it continued.
</P>
<P>
Butler's letter came a day after the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Organization (IAEA) sent a similar letter to the
Security Council president. Both letters call for instructions and
guidance from the council.
</P>
<P>
A week ago Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM,
requesting a restructure of it to eliminate what it calls American
influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses the U.S. of deliberately prolonging the
disarmament process required to be completed before the 15-member
Security Council will consider lifting sanctions imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>

Both U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the council regard
Iraq's decision as "unacceptable". Annan calls on the council to
engage more closely Iraq in finding the way to resolving the
differences, while sending his special envoy to Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Answer All Questions, Says Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said on Wednesday that President Bill Clinton was
sticking to his promise of two weeks ago to testify "completely
and truthfully."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said he took this to mean Clinton would answer all
questions. "That's what it suggests to me, yes," he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been some speculation that Clinton could say he had a
right to privacy and refuse to answer specific questions about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky is at the heart of a federal grand jury investigation
into whether Clinton had sex with her and then urged her to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
She testified last week to the grand jury and reportedly
admitted an affair with Clinton and said they discussed "cover
stories" to hide the relationship but that he did not directly
tell her to lie.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has already denied having sexual relations with her.
</P>
<P>
The White House has given no indication that Clinton will
change that version.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been holding regular sessions with his private
lawyers to prepare for his testimony on August 17, which will be
transmitted by closed-circuit television to grand jurors closeted
at a federal courthouse several blocks away from the White House.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Says It Faces Restrictions in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Organization (IAEA) has told the U.N. Security Council that
its on-going monitoring and verification (OMV) of Iraq's nuclear
program had encountered "restrictions".
</P>
<P>
The accusations were made by Director-General of the the
Vienna-based IAEA Mohamed ElBaradei in a letter dated August 11
and addressed to the council president. A copy of the letter was
made available here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter says the restrictions have resulted in the
discontinuation of the implementation of a joint inspection
program of Iraqi sites between IAEA and UNSCOM, the U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sites, it says, are judged to be able of "conducting work
on some aspect of weapons of mass destruction".
</P>
<P>
"The activity contributes considerably to the effectiveness of
the OMV to detect attempts to conduct activities proscribed by
the Security Council's resolutions," it went on to say.
</P>
<P>
The official says Iraq's refusal to cooperate in any activity
involving investigation of its nuclear program makes it impossible
for the IAEA to investigate the remaining questions and concerns
relevant to that program.
</P>
<P>
"The limited activities currently undertaken in Iraq by the IAEA,
under the restrictions imposed by Iraq, fall far short of full
implementation of the OMV plan and result in a significantly
reduced level of assurance than would be provided through the full
implementation of that plan," the letter concluded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Wednesday decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
until it is "restructured" to eliminate what it calls American
influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses the U.S. of deliberately prolonging the
disarmament process required to be completed before the Security
Council will consider lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Both U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council
regard Iraq's decision as "unacceptable". Annan suggested to the
council that Iraq be engaged more closely in finding the way to
resolving the differences.

<HEADLINE> Solar Satellite "on The Road to Recovery" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Ground controllers have acquired
blocks of temperature and electrical data from the "lost" solar
satellite, which is "on the road to recovery", the European Space
Agency (ESA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Telemetry data giving the spacecraft's on-board status were
acquired late Saturday night, 8 August, six days after receiving
the first signal from the dormant Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO).
</P>
<P>
Following analysis of the expected on-board conditions,
engineers managed to partially charge the on-board batteries and
commanded the spacecraft to send information about its status.
</P>
<P>
Further details on the on-board conditions were obtained the
following day. Data gathered included information on temperature
and voltages for payload instruments, which are currently being
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
"I am truly satisfied with the information the data we acquired
gives us. Conditions on-board are as good as we expected them to
be." ESA's Francis Vanderbussche, who is in charge of the SOHO
Recovery Team, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At the moment the team is working on the next series of
procedures, which will try to thaw the on-board hydrazine fuel,
currently at zero degrees Celsius, to enable attitude control of
the spacecraft to be re-established.
</P>
<P>
This will be attempted once full charge can be established in
both on-board batteries later this week.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best news I've heard since we lost contact with
SOHO," said Roger Bonnet, ESA's Director of Science.
</P>
<P>
Radio contact with the one-billion-dollar SOHO satellite, a
joint mission of the ESA and the U.S. National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), was interrupted on 25 June.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Presents Videotapes on Aziz-Butler Disarmament Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday
presented to members of the U.N. Security Council videotapes on
last-week's disarmament talks between Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz and UNSCOM's Executive Chairman Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
A Council diplomat said some Council members had watched the
videotape which lasted about four hours.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said it is the usual practice by Iraq to circulate
videotapes on meetings between the Government of Iraq and U.N.
regarding to disarmament talks, and there is nothing special.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament talks between Aziz and Butler collapsed last
Monday due to the sharp differences between them on Iraq's
dismantling of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Iraq announced to suspend the cooperation with
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and and the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scraping Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last Thursday adopted a resolution which
called Iraq's decision "totally unacceptable."
