DEFENDING RECORD AS MISUNDERSTOOD DAMATO MEETS WITH GAY GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen &UR; . &LR;  Afonse D'Amato met privately Monoday with
leaders from several major gay organizations, some of which have
been among his sharpest critics, to defend his positions on
homosexual issues and to ask for their support in his campaign for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   People who attended the meeting at a private club in midtown
Manhattan said by telephone that D'Amato, a Republican who is
seeking his fourth term this year, had asked to meet with the
groups because he felt that his record on gay rights was deeply
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting showed how far D'Amato has come in his willingness
to anger the conservatives that represent his political base to win
votes from moderate to liberal voters. The senator will be running
on the Conservative Party line in November and is seeking the
nomination of the Right to Life Party as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it doesn't help him with individual conservative
voters in New York,'' said Michael Long, chairman of the state's
Conservative Party. ``But I really don't see conservatives
deserting Senator D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the organizations represented at the meeting are
nonprofit groups that do not give political endorsements, several
people who attended said they thought that D'Amato was not just
seeking support from gay voters, but also trying to burnish his
image as a moderate among swing voters, including suburbanites and
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a race where you are going to be attacked as an extremist,
it's an inoculating thing to have a good record on gay and lesbian
issues,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin
Republicans, a group representing gay Republicans. ``It's hard to
call you a extremist when you are a lead co-sponsor on a
nondiscrimination bill for gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is a co-sponsor of legislation that would prohibit
employment discrimination based on sexual preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who attended the meeting said it was frank and
open, as many of the advocates pressed D'Amato, whose own record on
gay rights is considered relatively strong, to be more forceful in
pushing his fellow Republicans to stop blocking such legislation,
particularly in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good meeting, and it remains to be seen whether it
was a good beginning,'' said Richard Burns, executive director of
the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, a nonprofit agency
in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disconnect between Senator D'Amato's positions in
Washington and the Republican Party here in New York state,'' he
continued. ``The local party has institutionalized homophobia on
many fronts, and we look to him as a Republican leader to help
shape the future behavior and thinking of the New York State
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato did not return phone calls for comment on the meeting.
``Senator D'Amato was happy to discuss his strong record on civil
rights issues with community leaders today,'' said his spokeswoman,
Lisette McSoud Mondello.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting were about 20 people representing about 10
organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, a political
organization; Empire State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group; the
Stonewall Democratic Club, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit
organization, and the Hetrick-Martin Institute, an agency serving
gay youths.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has supported gay rights more in recent years, many
advocates say. In 1993, he spoke on the Senate floor in support of
gay men and lesbians in the military. He has also pushed for
federal financing for AIDS services. And this year, he wrote a
sharply worded letter to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott,
R-Miss., urging him not to block the Clinton administration's gay
nominee for ambassador to Luxembourg, James Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats contend D'Amato's shifting views on gay rights
fit a pattern of his taking moderate positions near election time.
But associates of D'Amato's contend his positions have been
influenced by his friendship with gay people and his opposition to
discrimination in general.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups have complained bitterly that D'Amato, who is widely
viewed as the most powerful Republican in New York State, has not
done enough to pressure the Republican majority leader of the state
senate, Joseph L. Bruno, to stop blocking a sweeping bill in the
senate to guarantee rights for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who have been critical of D'Amato left the
meeting pleased with his receptiveness, but still skeptical about
his willingness to be their advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think he heard our request,'' said Matt Foreman,
executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda. ``But politics
really is about results, and not promises.''

CANDIDATES FOR MAJOR OFFICES WIND UP NEW YORK CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scrambling for attention in the shadow of a
presidential visit, Democratic candidates for Senate and governor
brought their primary campaigns to a quiet close Monday, ending
contests that was notably short on acrimony and appeared to stir
little interest with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates fanned out to traditional last-day campaign stops
_ subway stations and shopping malls, homes for the elderly and
television studios _ on a day when New York City was in the grip of
a visit by a president in the midst of a political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the candidates were resigned to winning only the
scantiest of attention on the final day of the race _ and then only
when answering questions about President Clinton's problems, or
appearing with Clinton at one of the Democratic fund-raisers staged
in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Democratic primary voters will select candidates to run
for governor, senator, lieutenant governor and state attorney
general this November, and both major parties have primaries in
some local races as well. The contests that have drawn the most
attention have been to choose challengers to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
and Gov. George Pataki, both Republicans seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In this unusually subdued atmosphere and with party leaders
predicting that the primary would be distinguished by a low turnout
of voters, the candidates did what they could Monday to remind
voters that there is, in fact, an election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the 72nd Street subway stop on the Upper West Side Monday
night, in the heart of a Manhattan neighborhood that has displayed
an unwavering interest in Democratic politics for almost 50 years,
they campaigned almost elbow to elbow, handing out literature to
people streaming up the narrow steps and onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, everybody, I'm Chuck Schumer,'' Rep. Charles Schumer
said, his shirt rumpled and without the jacket he had worn to one
of Clinton's receptions. The congressman from Brooklyn who is
running for Senate shared the small strip of sidewalk with James L.
Larocca, a candidate for governor, and Charles King, a candidate
for lieutenant governor, along with four television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am basically a meat-and-potatoes Democrat,'' Schumer said,
summing up his race at another stop earlier in the day. ``I talk
about issues that matter to people in their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, another Senate candidate,
Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, slipped behind a
cash register at a local supermarket and began bagging groceries.
``I have been outadvertised and outfamed,'' Green said, referring
to Schumer's heavy television advertising and the celebrity of the
third candidate, Geraldine A. Ferraro. ``But I have not been
outworked or outissued.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Ferraro, a former congresswoman, spent the day
warning that she could be hurt if there wa a low turnout Tuesday.
She said repeatedly and publicly that her natural supporters, whom
she identified as elderly, minority and upstate voters, were less
likely to turn out automatically, especially if the weather was bad
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones who hug you, they're the ones who say, `We
really need you,' '' Ms. Ferraro said. ``But are they the ones who
always go to the polls? No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ends up being a primary decided in Manhattan, I'll be
standing with my microphone in my hand the day after tomorrow,''
said Ms. Ferraro, who was a television commentator before she began
her second race for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a relatively hectic day, Schumer, Ms. Ferraro
and Green all took time to join Clinton as he helped national
Democrats raise close to $4 million in New York, a gesture that the
president took appreciative note of in his remarks at one of the
fund-raisers, an early dinner for 400 people at the Supper Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of the candidates for the United States Senate in
New York on our ticket tomorrow have come here tonight,'' Clinton
said. By contrast, he made no mention of the four gubernatorial
candidates, presumably because only one of them _ Betsy McCaughey
Ross _ had planned to join Clinton Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Peter F. Vallone, the city council speaker and the best-financed
of the candidates for governor, said he was skipping Clinton's
fund-raisers because of the press of preprimary campaign demands.
But Vallone's public schedule listed no evening events, and the
speaker, talking to reporters, suggested another explanation for
his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to relax with my wife,'' Vallone said.
``It's not that I'm too busy to go. Everything I'm doing is geared
to my primary. The big thing for me is having dinner with my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocca, a former state commissioner, and the other Democratic
candidate for governor, Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district
attorney, also skipped the event.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Democratic candidates had objected to Clinton's
visiting New York on the eve of the primary even before they knew
that he would be coming three days after the release of the report
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, detailing allegations
about Clinton's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The original concern was that Clinton would siphon money out of
the state that could go to the gubernatorial and Senate races, as
well as obscure the candidates for office in the final hours of the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton's political situation so volatile, and with the
president historically popular in New York _ particularly among
Democrats _ some of the Democrats actually seemed to be going to
modest lengths Monday to actually align themselves with him.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, for example, made his way to the front of the receiving
line where, the congressman later told reporters, he offered words
of support to the president. ``I told the president what I heard on
the street the last few days, which was far more support for him
than detraction of him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green, speaking to reporters after campaigning in Great Neck on
Long Island and then riding the Long Island Rail Road back into New
York City made a point of announcing that he would squeeze in a
visit with the president between subway stops and his own less
ambitious fund-raiser, which featured Chinese food and a
performance by Peter, Paul and Mary at the home of Peter Yarrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my friend, he's my president,'' Green said. ``He erred,
he acted inexcusably but not impeachably.''

 &HT;    Knees or not? Nicole Miller goes for cover-up
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which came first: the ``chicken'' or the leg?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: Are women prone by nature to prefer the modest
look of long skirts, or are the lower hemlines that will carry over
from this fall/winter season into spring/summer merely a designer
dictate women follow against their wishes?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question to ponder now that the spring/summer '99
women's wear previews are under way. And it's a question Nicole
Miller appears disinclined to answer definitively.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's show Monday led off this week of presentations by a
splinter group of New Yorkers daring to unveil their collections
before the Europeans get their chance. And rather than make a
declarative statement on hemlines, Miller sought a compromise
between her own preference for shorter skirts and the industry's
fixation with length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing a lot of longer looks,'' Miller's national sales
manager, Lisa Brigham, said, ``but we're not giving up on short.''
</P>
<P>
   If she's not giving up, Miller's collection of skirts and
dresses cut to the knee or midcalf indicate she's giving in. The
abundance of satiny ballerina shoes that Miller's models wore was
another sign that the designer who'd scoffed at flats during a
recent visit to her Lenox Square boutique can't resist following
the trends entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's main fabrications were synthetics, and her colors of
choice were blue (pale, Pacific and ink), pistachio green and
pomegranate red. Her prints were floral, reptilian or wafflelike.
She designed a number of simple separates in stretch denim,
loosened the silhouette of Capri pants to make them look more like
gauchos and offered a large sampling of sweater sets with eyelet
detailing.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers showing collectively Monday at the Fashion
Coterie trade show were much more resolute in their adherence to
dominant trends.
</P>
<P>
   Clingy knit tops and dresses _ in cutting-edge synthetics or
cashmere _ and long skirts as well were everywhere. Rebecca
Danenberg, a New Yorker who's developed a star-studded clientele
that includes Courtney Love, Claire Danes and Jennifer Lopez,
showed knits that featured plunging necklines, sheer tanks under
matching, buttonless cardigans, hooded short-sleeved pullovers and
strapless body dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Diane von Furstenberg, who _ according to daughter Alexandra _
is ``still in discussion'' over whether to stage a runway show in
November, showed her trademark temptress dresses in subtle prints
shaded blue or pastel pink in either silk or jersey knit. Most
dresses were long enough to skim the calf, and all sleeves were
cropped just below the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweaters are tighter, skirts are looser and pants are
shorter,'' Julie Chaiken of Chaiken &AMP; Capone announced as she
sifted through racks of knits colored pink, purple, mint and
yellow, A-line skirts with elastic waistbands and drawstring pants
cropped at the ankles. ``Since skirts are getting roomier, you need
that tight sweater so you have something fitting close to the
body.''

LOS ANGELES MAYOR CALLS SCHOOL BOARD `EVIL,' `CRIMINAL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mayor Richard Riordan has stepped up his attack
against the Los Angeles Board of Education, calling the current
system ``evil (and) criminal'' in failing to educate children as he
seeks candidates to run against four incumbents in next year's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 crime in Los Angeles and California today is our
education system,'' Riordan said Monday. ``We need to find people
who are willing to put children ahead of politics. The only policy
we should have is what is best for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said the four members he wants to replace _ David
Tokofsky, George Kiriyama, Jeff Horton and Barbara Boudreaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, I like them,'' said Riordan. ``But they aren't
giving enough authority to (Superintendent) Ruben Zacarias. We
don't know if Zacarias is a good superintendent, because he isn't
given the authority to manage the district.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the mayor unveiled his plan to reform the LAUSD, many
civic and school leaders were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Former Assemblywoman Paula Boland, who is leading the movement
to break up the LAUSD, says the mayor's efforts won't fix the
district's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD is broken, period,'' said Boland, chairwoman of
Finally Restoring Excellence in Education. ``Change is needed, but
chewing gum and bailing wire will not be enough to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said the mayor's push for reform will only be
significant if it becomes a debate on how children are educated,
not governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes in power will do nothing to help kids do better in
school,'' said Tokofsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan believes the first step toward reform is empowering
the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board should just rubberstamp his proposals and deal with
the broader issues. They shouldn't be bothering him with getting
kids in one school or interfering with his running of the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's prime example is the board's refusal to allow Zacarias
to discipline principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a principal and you know the superintendent doesn't
have any authority over you, you're not going to listen to him,''
said Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the administrators' union has complained that
principals are not given enough authority, but are being placed on
the front lines of accountability for a school.
</P>
<P>
   But, Eli Brent, president of the Associated Administrators of
Los Angeles, said he doesn't trust Riordan's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the mayor is looking to give control and get
control,'' said Brent. ``I think the mayor should be more concerned
about running the city and doing that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent disagrees with Riordan's assessment that Zacarias has not
been given enough authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that the superintendent has asked for that
the board has not given him,'' said Brent. ``The board has told the
superintendent: Do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyama agreed and said he has urged the superintendent to
discipline and dismiss poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are not doing their job, the superintendent should
get rid of them,'' said Kiriyama. ``My thoughts about this are
well-known, and I hope it's a sentiment that is shared by the rest
of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he and the coalition debated but then dismissed
the idea of pushing through changes in the state constitution that
would empower the mayor to choose school board members. Instead,
they modeled their changes on what's been done in the troubled
Sacramento school district, where that city's mayor headed a
successful effort to oust a majority of the board. Now, Sacramento
school officials say the district is on the right track, with a
reform plan in place and a new superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he will be setting up a special telephone line for
people interested in running for office to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   He said the task force of business leaders he has formed will be
expanded to include other interested people to decide on a final
slate of candidates for next April's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is decide on who we think could be the best
person to begin the revolution we need in our school system,'' said
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Details on how the final candidates will be selected are being
worked out, but Riordan said he has been overwhelmed by the public
response he has received since reports of his plans surfaced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the No. 1 issue for people,'' said Riordan. ``This is
what they are concerned about. I've had parents come up to me and
tell me they aren't waiting for Goals 2000 that the state wants.
They want to take care of their kids here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said improving the school system is his top priority in
promoting the area's economic competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that keeps the middle class in Los Angeles
is having a good education system,'' said Riordan said. ``If they
don't think their children will get a good education they won't
stay here and they won't move here.''

CARDS THINKING ABOUT EXECUTION  
 PICKING UP BLITZ MAY EARN A REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does a coach do when his 0-2 team has given up an average
of 35.5 points a game and is facing a must win in its home opener?
</P>
<P>
   Does he cure mental malfunctions by taking the troops to the
practice field and pounding the heck out of the them?
</P>
<P>
   Does he make changes aimed at catching their attention?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin, whose Cardinals meet NFL East foe
Philadelphia, also 0-2, on ESPN's Sunday night game, is thinking
execution _ i.e. blitz management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure just going out and beating up each other in
practice is the answer,'' Tobin said. ``We'll have a good practice
Wednesday. Whether it's more intense, I don't know. The goal is
high intensity on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make any changes we'll make them on Wednesday, but to
make a change, you have to feel you're changing for the better.
We're not at a point where we have to shake things up. The worst
thing is to panic and make wholesale changes in search of something
positive. It's better to be positive, look at the things we did
well and those we did poorly, and work on correcting them with
better execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cardinals are looking at a four-game stretch
against four opponents _ Philadelphia, St. Louis, Oakland and
Chicago _ with a combined 1-7 record and can see reason to harbor
hopes of being 4-2, naysayers see the two embarrassing losses and
wonder why the season must be so long.
</P>
<P>
   While rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth overstated his own
play as horrible in Sunday's game, he isn't about to throw in the
towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season,'' said Wadsworth, who never lost more than
two games in a season during his career at Florida State. ``There
are 14 games left and people can say we're going to have a losing
season, but until those 14 are played out, there's a chance we'll
only lose two this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with optimism is it's wasted on youth, but
inexperience isn't. Most of the Cardinals problems against Seattle
centered on a young quarterback and an offensive line that knew
when and where Seattle was blitzing, but didn't have the cohesion
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The net result was seven sacks of quarterback Jake Plummer,
whose 11th start saw him throw two touchdown interceptions _ one
while being sacked by his own blocking back _ and fumble the ball
away once.
</P>
<P>
   `We're a bad offense right now,'' said Plummer, who labeled the
first interception return by Willie Williams as a dumb play on his
part. ``If you look at the game tapes, we're not that good. But
we're close to being real efficient. Just one or two plays here or
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer claims it's a fine line between being good and mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize what that is and get it done in practice,''
he said. ``Then go on the field and get over that hurdle and make
those third-and-five blitz pickups happen. Make a big play to break
a team's back if it wants to blitz us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive thing though, in the fourth quarter we were
getting our butts kicked and they were still blitzing, but we were
still busting our butts and learning. The effort is there. We need
the execution.'' &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It's not exactly a category Arizona State strives
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   After two games, no one in the Pac-10 has more penalties or
penalty yards. The Sun Devils have 22 for 200 yards. By contrast,
Arizona has 10 for 90 and Washington State 15 for 114.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties have plagued ASU during Coach Bruce Snyder's reign,
and Saturday's loss to Brigham Young was no exception. The Sun
Devils committed 11 for 105 yards; five of the infractions were
personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really dislike stupid penalties,'' Snyder said. ``The stupid
ones kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU never has finished better than seventh in league penalties
in the past six seasons. In four of those seasons, it has finished
ninth or 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are on a worse pace this year than the previous
six, although teams tend to commit fewer penalties as their play
improves over the course of the season. The low-water mark for that
span is 982 penalty yards, accumulated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   How much it affects their success is debatable. They accumulated
more penalties during their 1996 Rose Bowl season than during a 3-8
season in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Snyder said, is that he coaches his teams
to play aggressively and to hit hard. Blitzing, which often leads
to offsides penalties, is a big part of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really a fine edge there,'' he said. ``I admire BYU.
They play hard, and they hit right at the end of the play. I like
that, and that's the way you should play the game. You've got to
figure out when that whistle blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Phil Snow said he often has this
conversation with his players:
</P>
<P>
   Snow: ``If a runner is running down the sideline inbounds, what
do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Player: ``Hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's out of bounds?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not sure?''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said: ``You have to hit him. We tell them they have to be
smart ``and'' aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snow also said ``a lot of penalties are reputation anyway.
Because we've hit hard over the years anyway, it's `They play
physical.' Well, we played liked BYU.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said free safety Mitchell Freedman may be a victim of his
reputation as a hard hitter. If a play is borderline, the call
probably is going to go against him.
</P>
<P>
   The five personal fouls in the BYU game included a roughing the
passer and roughing the punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game (against Washington) _ I'm not as concerned . .
. because most are things that can be corrected,'' Snyder said.
``But this game, we were more frustrated because of the game, the
crowd, some of the dialogue on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Kealy said: ``The penalties are simply mental
errors, lapses in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Snyder doesn't like them. And the team is getting an
earful this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one way,'' he said. ``If it's really habitual, you can
change players.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff will be re-examining all facets of the team
before ASU hosts North Texas on Saturday, from personnel to
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to square one,'' Snyder said. ``We've got to
make sure and not assume anything.'' &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
Gov. Jane Hull has sent a letter to running back Gerald Green,
commending him for overcoming adversity in his life. ``You are an
example to all of us of what can be achieved through determination
and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   With Randy Leaphart sidelined because of a knee injury, redshirt
freshman Scott Peters will start at left guard. Word on Leaphart's
status is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy said ASU's 0-2 start is a definite wake-up call. ``It may
be just the kind of thing we need to get going. We may have been up
in the clouds a bit. That brought us down to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the blame for the team's early struggles should be
shared. ``It's not just the players. I, we, need to coach better.
All of our fingerprints are all over this game.'' &QL;

HOPE IS LOST IF CARDINALS FAIL SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - So, after two full seasons, after a grace period
and a lost cause, after 34 games to clean up the wreckage and get
the truck back on the road . . .
</P>
<P>
   Here it is. The first must-win game of his tenure. The week when
you'll learn everything you need to know about Mr. Beige.
</P>
<P>
   Because if this football team can't beat the Philadelphia
Eagles, there is no hope.
</P>
<P>
   Not for this season, a year in which Jake Plummer predicted 10
victories, minimum. And not for the future of Vince Tobin, who
probably needs to win seven games to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is. Sunday night on ESPN. The beginning of a new era. Or
the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this game is over, there are still 13 left,'' said
Tobin, proving if nothing else, his math skills are still intact.
``But it's a very important game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pavement becomes littered with fans leaping off the
bandwagon, remember that nothing is lost just yet. The defeat in
Dallas was understandable. Getting blistered by a revved-up Seattle
Seahawks squad full of mercenaries was completely expected. So
they're 0-2, just like 10 other teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But now they must turn the corner, put up a fight. They must act
like a team on the rise, not in reverse. As the Cardinals go from
the deep end of the schedule into the baby pool, a four-game
winning streak would be nice. Three out of four would be
satisfactory. Anything less would spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it would signal serious underachievement somewhere
along the ranks. And it always starts with the coaching staff. &QL; 
Mind control &QL; 
``Obviously, our confidence is not as strong as it was going into
the season,'' Tobin said. ``They felt like we were going to get out
of the gate and be 2-0 at this point in time. And we're not. And we
haven't played close to the expectations we had for ourselves, and
I'm sure that affects them.''
</P>
<P>
   You will learn much about Tobin because some psychological
tweaking is necessary. His players are hurting emotionally,
wondering if things will ever change. It's Tobin's job to address
that problem, to change the mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   You will learn much about Tobin because, well, the coaching
hasn't been exactly stellar up to this point. Week 1 was a
three-and-out debacle. Week 2 wasn't much better, raising questions
about the effectiveness and implementation of Marc Trestman's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the offensive line had its troubles, and Plummer
hasn't had a good game yet. But when a team is blitzing every other
down, you have to counterattack. There must be simple plays to burn
an overzealous defense. So far, the Cardinals have shown no
intuition, no clue how to handle such pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there has only been this tell-tale sign of desperation:
In the second quarter, Tobin took over the offense. He ordered his
``Tens'' package on the field. A combination of Michael Pittman,
Jarious Hayes and two tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't call the plays,'' Tobin insisted. ``I just called the
formations.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is splitting hairs. If the head coach inserts
that foursome into the game, there aren't many options other than
handing off to Pittman. And even if he isn't calling the plays, a
new offensive coordinator is likely to get the hint. &QL; 
Righting a sinking ship &QL; 
Tobin's choice isn't the issue because Pittman deserves some
playing time. What's troubling is the lack of faith _ and results _
from Trestman's offense.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is more troubling than this: Trailing,17-0, at the
two-minute warning of the first half, the Seahawks had a first and
goal from the 5. The Cardinals never called a timeout. The Seahawks
kicked a field goal as time expired, and the Cardinals kicked off
to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Either a terrible coaching blunder or a staff that didn't want
the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't all gloom and doom,'' Tobin said. ``There are some
positives to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the schedule. And starting Sunday, it could either save the
season or sink the coach. &QL;

TKACHUK HOLD OUT MAY SPUR LEGAL FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -  &UR; Keith Tkachuk already has lost more than
$30,000 because of his holdout, but he possibly could lose more,
according to a scenario suggested by Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Should Tkachuk, the team's captain and leading scorer, decide to
sit out the 1998-99 season, he still might be obligated for the
final two years of his contract, which is worth $2.8 million this
season and $3 million the next.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the star left wing could be facing the same
situation a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly going to be our position, and that of the
lawyers at the NHL, that if Keith sits out the entire year, at
year's end, he'll still have two years left in his contract,''
Smith said Monday, the third day of Tkachuk's holdout. ``It's
something that could happen after a certain number of games, too,
before the season is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this is something Keith and the Players Association
will file a grievance over, but we'll be prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bob Murray, Tkachuk's Boston-based agent, could not be reached
for comment. Earlier in the day, however, he talked for the first
time about his client's suspension on Saturday and daily forfeiture
of pay, which reached $30,543 through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised by the Coyotes' course of action,'' Murray
said. ``We were fully prepared for them to do what they did. The
team had a choice, and they decided to act within the rules of the
league's (collective bargaining agreement).''
</P>
<P>
   Murray hedged when asked whether Tkachuk, third-leading goal
scorer in the league (205) the past five seasons, was prepared to
sit out the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not comment on that,'' he said. ``All I'll say is
the Coyotes have taken a position where they keep threatening Keith
in the media, and we've refrained from doing that. We'll keep
refraining because threats are counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this, Bob Smith's statement that he he doesn't
intend to have any more (negotiations) with Keith, I find a little
bizarre. Don't they want this guy in their lineup?'' &QL; 
JR on mission &QL; 
Star center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick punctuated his first day of camp by
saying he will have no comment on the Tkachuk situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not. That's because I have my own job to do this
year,'' said Roenick, who missed the opening day of camp to tend to
personal business in Boston. ``I have high expectations of myself,
and I'm sure lots of other people have high expectations of me. I
can't be worried about who's getting what or what's happening
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to do what I need to do. I have to prove to myself
and I have to prove to a lot of people that I'm still a great
player, and I can still do a lot of damage in this league. I've
worked hard physically, and now I'm working hard mentally in a lot
of different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick's goal and point totals have dipped in each of the past
three seasons, including to a career-low 24 and 56 last season. &QL; 
Happy camper &QL; 
The biggest surprise in camp has to be  &UR; Adam Dewan, a non-drafted
left wing from Peterborough of the Ontario Hockey League, who was
given a tryout and got invited to stay with the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to stay, but I'm the happiest kid alive right
now,'' said Dewan, 18, a teammate of Coyotes draft pick  &UR; Robert
Fancz who scored 14 goals and 32 points last season in 62 games.
``Whatever happens, this is going to help my confidence, and I can
just take all this experience back to the OHL and have a good
season.''
</P>
<P>
   And he can get decent autographs while he's here, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, most definitely,'' Dewan said, laughing. &QL;

YANKEES SHUT OUT RED SOX, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees won 100 games faster than any
team in history because they were scared. They played hard because
they feared what would happen if they did not play hard.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost half their games in the last month, and this
scares them.
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances, then, would Yankees Manager Joe Torre
relieve Orlando Hernandez on Monday night. Torre intended to use
his bullpen in the late innings, but Hernandez had stifled Boston,
and the Yankees needed some reassurance. Hernandez finished his
first complete-game shutout, a three-hitter with no walks and nine
strikeouts and a badly needed injection of pitching excellence at
just the right time for the Yankees, who ended their three-game
losing streak. In beating Boston by 3-0, they beat Pedro Martinez
(18-6) for the second time in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drew a crowd of 42,735, pushing their season total
to 2,657,785 and eclipsing their single-season record of 2,633,701,
established in 1988. The Yankees (104-44) have nine home dates
remaining in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   From Torre to Bernie Williams to Hernandez, the Yankees talked
about how this was an important victory. The Yankees are 104-44 and
lead the American League East by a club-record 21 games, and they
were saying that this was an important victory. Because of the
fear: the Yankees do not want to win 110 to 115 games and then
crumble in the playoffs because of a late-season pitching slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to have all phases of our game sharp for
the playoffs,'' Williams said, ``and pitching obviously is one of
them. It was great to see Orlando dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu has allowed 30 runs in his last 201/3 innings, Andy
Pettitte has a 6.75 earned run average in seven starts dating from
July 30, and even David Cone has accumulated a 4.70 era in his last
302/3 innings. Hernandez had a 5.52 era in the four outings before
Monday night's game, and he had all but given away a 5-0 lead to
Boston in the fourth inning last week in Fenway Park, frustrating
Torre, who thought Hernandez's pitch selection had been terrible in
that game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the English-speaking Torre approached the
Spanish-speaking Hernandez and, with his hands held head high,
pretended to remove Hernandez's head and then throw it against the
wall. The message was clear: clear out your brain and think about
what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez nodded and smiled, and adjusted. ``I understood his
point when he did that,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter.
``He gave me the confidence to go ahead and clear my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Given another chance against the Red Sox last night, Hernandez
threw more strikes and changed speeds more often, utilizing his
curveball and changeup to greater effect than he has in weeks. He
would throw a fastball inside and then maybe a curveball or a
slider, or maybe a changeup, all at different speeds. Making a
pitch to the slugger Mo Vaughn with the count three balls and two
strikes, Hernandez cut loose with a fading, dying change of pace
that fell into the dirt, and Vaughn was completely fooled, swinging
over the ball. All night, Boston hitters were caught between the
poles of velocity, and the Red Sox were 0 for 6 with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro pitched a strong game for us,'' said Jimy Williams, the
Boston manager. ``But the other kid really stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could not muster a run in support until the fifth
inning, when Darryl Strawberry _ who had looked overmatched against
Martinez, a Cy Young award candidate _ smacked a single to right.
With Vaughn holding Strawberry at first, Jorge Posada managed to
pull a ground ball through the hole in the right side of the
infield. Trot Nixon, Boston's right fielder, charged the ball and
the safe play appeared to be for Strawberry to stop at second.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody had scouted Nixon's arm, however.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's stride became choppy as he made the turn at second,
and past the bag, he gained speed and slid into third, from where
he would score on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Torre planned on using Jeff Nelson in the seventh or eighth, and
Mike Stanton or Graeme Lloyd. Mariano Rivera warmed up before the
ninth inning. But the Yankees have lost 15 of their last 30 games,
and Torre decided to stay with Hernandez, to keep a good thing
going, to stay one step ahead of the fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of plans on the back shelf,'' Torre said. ``I
wasn't going to mess around with that game.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams caught the final out in the final inning,
Hernandez grinned broadly and draped his arms around teammate Luis
Sojo. A big hug. A bigger relief for the Yankees. &QL;

PLUMMER QUESTIONS RE SULTS, NOT ABIL ITY TO MAKE PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer was
drop-kicked by seven sacks in Seattle, threw two interceptions for
touchdowns and fumbled once, but he said Monday that nothing was
broken _ especially his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated by how I played,'' said Plummer, who completed
22 of 36 for 205 yards and a touchdown. ``I looked at the film and
I made some very bad plays. But I made good ones, too. If I keep
taking coach's advice and let the guys around me perform, I can
eliminate some of those bad plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my confidence is fine. If I had thrown six picks and we
got beat, I still have to come back and try to lead this team. Guys
are looking at me to be solid each week. I'm young, but I matured
enough last year to come out and say, `Hey, it's a new week, and I
can lead this team to victory.' '' &QL; 
Tobin takes over &QL; 
For the first time as Cardinals coach,  &UR; Vince Tobin became involved
in the offense when he sent in his ``tens package'' (two tight
ends, two backs and one receiver) for a series in the second period
with Arizona down, 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   A radio talk show took it to mean that his confidence in
offensive coordinator  &UR; Marc Trestman is cracking, but Tobin said he
was just trying to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't call any plays. We were having a hard time, and I was
trying to get something established,'' Tobin said. ``I think we
made seven yards but didn't get the three yards on third down.'' &QL; 
Sackless Simeon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice is sackless in nine games _ the
final seven of last season and the first two this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sack total is down from his rookie season (12.5), but when
a team has someone causing problems, they do something to stop
him,'' Tobin said. ``But he's doing much better against the run
than a year ago. He's an improved player all around. He'll get
sacks this year. I'm not concerned with that.'' &QL; 
Wadsworth report &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tobin gave rookie defensive end  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, who made his
first start after only three practices, a so-so review.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some good things, but also showed he hasn't been in
camp,'' Tobin said. ``He wasn't always in the right spot, which
hurt us on occasion, but he's going to be a very fine player.'' &QL; 
Injury report &QL; 
Tobin listed receiver  &UR; Rob Moore (hamstring) and center  &UR; Aaron
Graham (calf muscle) as questionable for Sunday, but Moore said he
expects to play, and Graham said he is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie offensive tackle  &UR; Anthony Clement, slowed by knee and
back injuries in the preseason, apparently re-injured his back and
his status is unknown. &QL;

GILKEY TO HAVE EYE SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey is in Canada, where he'll
undergo laser surgery Wednesday to correct his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he'll end up being the Comeback Player of the Year (next
season),'' Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said of Gilkey, who
is far-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder  &UR; Jay Bell, who wears glasses for astigmatism, said
he's thought of having surgery on his eyes. He says his vision is
20-20 without glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that can take care of that with surgery or not, I
don't know,'' Bell said. ''It would be nice not to wear glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Gilkey's surgery will not be a determining
factor, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to an ophthomologist before anything,'' said
Bell, who is bothered by contacts. ``There has been enough data on
the surgery. It could be the thing of the future.'' &QL; 
Something to play for &QL; 
Closer  &UR; Gregg Olson and reliever  &UR; Alan Embree both played on teams
that lost 100 games. Olson was part of the 1988 Baltimore Orioles
and Embree with the '92 Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the park every day was a nightmare,'' Embree
recalled. ``They couldn't give away tickets. That was not fun.
There wasn't anything to shoot for.''
</P>
<P>
   Embree said the Diamondbacks' pennant race is against 100 _
avoiding that ominous number of losses.

TEN PEOPLE ARE CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Eight men and two women were charged Monday with spying
for the Cuban government by trying, sometimes successfully, to
infiltrate U.S. military sites and Cuban exile organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S.
attorney's office here said national security was never
compromised. But the officials described a sophisticated operation
led by three men they believe to be members of the Cuban security
forces. Those charged sought to report on the operation of U.S.
military installations, political and humanitarian activity by
groups opposed to President Fidel Castro of Cuba and on U.S.
government and law enforcement, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint charging the 10 said the group, operating
since 1994, targeted Boca Chica Naval Air Station in Key West,
MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa and the U.S. Southern Command,
which oversees operations for the Caribbean and Latin America and
recently moved its headquarters to Miami from Panama.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant, Antonio Guerrero, was a civilian employee in the
public works department of the Key West naval station whose real
job, the complaint said, was to report to Cuba on any ``unusual
exercises, maneuvers and other activity related to combat
readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant, Rene Gonzalez, posed as an FBI drug informer
``to give misinformation,'' said Thomas Scott, the U.S. attorney in
Miami. And two other defendants tried to get information and
employment at the Southern Command, which Scott called ``a priority
objective'' of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests marked the first offensive by federal
law-enforcement authorities against espionage by suspected Cuban
agents, federal officials said. They also come as Cuban exiles,
smarting from the federal prosecution of a group of exiles accused
of plotting to kill Castro, are demanding that the United States
target Cuban agents working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said their investigation of Cuban intelligence
gathering in South Florida began after Brothers to the Rescue,
known for making mercy flights between Florida and Cuba searching
for people in boats fleeing Cuba, lost two planes in an attack by
Cuban fighter jets in 1996. But the officials declined to say
whether the beginning of their effort was related to that incident.
In a bizarre twist after the shootdown, a member of the group, Juan
Pablo Roque, reappeared in Cuba to denounce Brothers to the Rescue
and other Miami anti-Castro groups, and it became known then that
he had been on the FBI payroll since 1993 as an informer.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, would not comment on the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans arrested Monday are also accused of penetrating exile
groups to create animosity and discredit their leaders and of
manipulating political figures and news organizations through
anonymous or misidentified telephone calls and letters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Miami, where many exiles have long assumed that the city is
crawling with Cuban spies and double agents , none of it came as a
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're finally deciding to clean house, I salute them for
it,'' said Rafael Penalver, a prominent exile lawyer who is on the
board of a medical clinic that employed one of the defendants as a
receptionist last year. ``I hope it's a concerted effort to get to
the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said the Cubans had code names, false identities
and accents, and escape plans and alibis in case they were
arrested. They reported to Cuba through high frequency radio,
officials said, and some traveled to and from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the U.S. attorney, and Hector Pesquera, the FBI special
agent in charge, refused to say how far the defendants got in their
intelligence gathering or how threatening the information given to
the Cuban government was. The complaint said that they provided
Cuba with detailed descriptions of the construction and geography
of the Southern Command headquarters. It also said Guerrero gave
information on security areas and aircraft at Boca Chica, and the
addresses of naval officers.
</P>
<P>
   Pesquera said the arrests had left Cuban intelligence gathering
``in a complete state of disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant blow to the Cuban government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the arrests, the espionage network seemed to
have run into hard times. The criminal complaint said that its
officers had to routinely submit financial reports to Cuba
detailing expenses for the operation and that at one point Cuba
sent back word that it had to cut back. ``Because of the economic
state of our country,'' one communication read, ``headquarters has
been obligated to reduce the budget of all the comrades there.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the network were identified as Manuel Viramontes,
whom the criminal complaint describes as ``a Cuban national and
captain in the Cuban military'' who has lived in the United States
since 1992; Luis Medina; and Ruben Campa. They and the other seven
were charged with illegally acting as foreign agents, conspiring to
deliver defense-related information to a foreign government and
conspiring to defraud the United States. They could face sentences
up to life imprisonment and fines of $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good news for anybody who wants to see a relaxation
in U.S.-Cuba relations,'' said Max Castro, a Cuban affairs expert
at the University of Miami's North-South Center. ``Even though
these are things that are typically done by all governments,
whenever a country finds out it's been done in its territory, it's
considered a hostile act.''

CITY TO REVIEW PLANS TO CRACKDOWN ON SMOKING-BAN SCOFFLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The city is failing to enforce a state ban on
smoking in bars and restaurants, with only three citations issued
so far by the Los Angeles Fire Department, a city panel has
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick, chairwoman of the council's Public
Safety Committee, said Monday she had received a number of
complaints from the public about bars that were violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is doing a terrible job of enforcing this,'' said
Chick after the meeting. ``We're basically crossing our fingers and
hoping people will comply voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing testimony, the committee called for a review of
ways to step up enforcement of the law, including possibly
transferring responsibility to the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to reconsider the issue Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints of smoking in bars are handled by the same
eight-person Fire Department office that inspects buildings for
fire-code violations. The inspectors work regular daytime shifts,
meaning they rarely see bars in full swing when responding to
complaints, said Capt. Michael Little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue isn't one of (handling) dozens and dozens of
complaints _ it's a matter of getting staff positions for the times
when these violations happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Alarcon suggested that the LAPD, with its
Operation ABC unit that inspects bars for other problems, take over
enforcement of the smoking ban. The units are available for use on
a citywide basis, rather than the one inspector the LAFD wants to
hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to question if the Fire Department should enforce
this,'' said Alarcon. ``It is very tough for them to enforce a law
like this in bars at 11 in the evening. And I don't know if we have
enough people available to enforce it from the Fire Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the City Attorney's Office sends a
notice to the bar owner after a first complaint. On second
complaints, the city notifies the Fire Department to conduct an
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the city received 408 complaint calls between the time
the law took effect Jan. 1 and the end of June. The city mailed out
105 warning letters in response. Thirteen cases were referred to
the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that suggests to me is that people grow frustrated when
they see a lack of response by the city,'' said Councilman Mike
Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said if the city wants to keep responsibility for
enforcing the ban with the Fire Department, it must also make sure
the department has the tools to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair to the Fire Department, they clearly have not been
given the resources they need,'' she said. &QL;

CARDINALS TOP PIRATES, 7-4; MCGUIRE IS HOMERLESS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Cardinal fans are concerned that the spectacular
home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa that was supposed
to be finished is heating up again, and perhaps not entirely to
their liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying Sosa will pass McGwire,'' said Daren Gatton,
a bartender at the Adam's Mark Hotel here. ``Sosa's on a roll, and
Mark's back is hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been a question whether McGwire, who had suffered a
back spasm in Sunday's game against Houston and was taken out in
the fifth inning, was going to play at all on Monday night as the
Cards played host to the Pirates in the first of a four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends,'' McGwire had said, ``on how I wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the game, McGwire reported that his back was fine. He
hit several balls out of the park in batting practice, and he was
at his customary station, first base, as the game began.
</P>
<P>
   He did not do his customary damage, hitting no home runs in four
times at bat against the last-place team in the National League
East.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 2 for 4, with two singles, two runs batted in, one
strikeout and no walks, as the Cardinals won, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his back is O.K.,'' Cardinal Manager Tony LaRussa said
after the game. ``There were no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether McGwire would play both games of a doubleheader on
Tuesday, LaRussa said: ``I doubt he'll be out there for 18 innings
with an ouchy back. He'll play one of the games. Which one will
depend on who the pitchers are.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was removed from Sunday's game ``for cautionary
reasons,'' LaRussa said. McGwire, who had had back problems
throughout his career, was taken out of one game on June 1 in San
Diego and missed three games against the Dodgers, June 2-4, because
of back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had recalled a time a few years ago when he was washing
his face in a sink and sneezed. ``I threw my back out and missed
seven games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer last Tuesday,
he is 3 for 18 in six games, with three walks and seven strikeouts.
In that time, Sosa has hit four home runs to tie him. McGwire had
been on an astonishing home-run streak until then, hitting 15
homers in 22 games. And in the last two months, McGwire had showed
a particular proclivity for hitting homers whenever Sosa hit one or
two to get too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has now gone six games without hitting a home run. The
longest he has gone this season without a homer is 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think McGwire's getting over the relief of doing it,''
said Gratton, referring to the pressure of chasing the Maris mark.
``I think he'll come back and hit 66 homers.'' And Sosa?
``Sixty-five,'' he said. ``I think it'll be that close.''

SOSA DOESN'T FEEL SLIGHTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The day after reaching Mark McGwire's place in
baseball history, Sammy Sosa received a congratulatory telephone
call from the leader of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   To which some people a tad-too-skeptically replied, what, aside
from his world of troubles, took President Clinton so long?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Clinton was dialed into McGwire's achievement,
calling the St. Louis slugger the same night he surpassed Roger
Maris as the single-season home run leader. It's ridiculous to
raise the race card to explain why McGwire's 62nd blast this past
Tuesday unleashed more gaiety than Sosa's on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No way should baseball's richest rivalry since Maris and Mickey
Mantle teed off on Babe Ruth in 1961 be consumed by creed or color.
To say Sosa was denied a coronation fit for a home run king because
he's not American-born is a reach, the rational equivalent of
swinging at a pitch that's well outside the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs outfielder's accomplishment was not downplayed because
he grew up dirt poor in the Dominican Republic instead of
comfortably middle class in the Los Angeles suburbs like McGwire.
Sosa was relegated to a scaled-down celebration for the same reason
John Landy received less fanfare than Roger Bannister for breaking
the four-minute barrier in the mile.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never heard of Landy from the Land Down Under, it's
not because of any built-in bias against Australia. Rather, it's
simply because he had the bad timing to cover the distance in 3
minutes, 58.0 some seven weeks after Bannister, a Brit, had shown
the world the unthinkable was indeed possible with a clocking of
3:59.4.
</P>
<P>
   Being the first to scale heretofore unreachable heights has its
privileges. How many people remember who followed Sir Edmund
Hillary up Mt. Everest, besides his Sherpa? Sosa accepts this
natural order of celebrity without reservations or rancor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention I've been having all year is good enough for
me,'' Sosa said before Monday's Cubs-Padres game at Qualcomm
Stadium. ``Mark did it first. He was the man. I'm just so happy to
be playing in the United States. I'm not looking ... to make some
more friends. I'm pleased with what I have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be so, but Sosa's sphere is mushrooming and there's
no reason to believe he won't be lovingly and lavishly embraced if
he passes McGwire by the season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's bandwagon reached groaning levels Monday, with 150 media
credentials distributed, all but 15 of which were requested in the
hours between sundown Sunday and high noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The multitude that squeezed into the San Diego Chargers locker
room two hours before the opening pitch seemed to push most of the
air molecules out into the hallway. About the only person who
didn't appear to be breaking a sweat in the claustrophobic
conditions was Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   He started his 30-minute pregame press conference by thanking
everybody for coming, proving once and for all he is not a disciple
of the Albert Belle school of manners.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it must be difficult at times to navigate a sea of
scrutiny in your second language. There's always the danger your
words or nuances will get lost in your translation. The late
Roberto Clemente, one of the greatest Latin American players ever
to grace the major leagues, had a chilly relationship with the U.S.
press because of what he saw as an impenetrable cultural divide.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem for Sosa, whose smile can thaw any snub. He
tips his cap to the people in his adopted country, saying, ``People
in the United States give me the opportunity to be who I am.'' Yet
he remains ever-mindful of his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday that everything he does is for his mother,
Mireya, who was widowed when Sosa was 7 yet somehow managed to rear
seven children _ with Sammy doing his part by shining shoes and
selling fruit _ in a two-room dwelling that contained enough love
to fill a mansion.
</P>
<P>
   He hits homers for his mother and wears the jersey number 21 in
honor of Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa recognizes that, to a lot of people back in his homeland,
he was an idol on par with Clemente, who was a Puerto Rican, even
before he reeled in Babe Ruth and Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to wait for so long (for the next Clemente),''
Sosa explained with a twinkle in his eye. Later, he added that as
much as he admires Clemente, his idol is God.
</P>
<P>
   There are athletes who worship at the altar of the almighty
dollar, and for a long time Sosa's teammates had reason to wonder
if he wasn't one of them. When he first broke into the big leagues,
with the Chicago White Sox, he swung at bad pitches, wore gaudy
gold jewelry and seemed inordinately interested in his own
statistics. As recently as last year, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman
chastised him for foolishly trying to steal a base in an effort to
reach the 30-homer, 30-stolen base plateau.
</P>
<P>
   If Sosa in the past seemed inordinately interested in his own
performance, it was because he saw his individual numbers as his
family's ticket to financial freedom. Having inked a four-year,
$42.5 million contract midway through last season, Sosa came into
this season focused fully on team goals.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two home runs later, nothing's changed. ``I have to go out
there every day and work hard. I can't think about (the home run)
chase,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a responsibility to finish strong and take Chicago to
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he gets the Cubs there or not, he already has taken an
entire continent along for one wondrous ride.

49ERS CRUSH REDSKINS, 45-10 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ It was not just Trent Green versus Steve Young.
No, that alone was not the problem for the Washington Redskins on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it just Garrison Hearst versus Terry Allen or Jerry Rice
versus Michael Westbrook. And it was not just the Redskins' shaky
offense versus the 49ers' muscular defense or the Redskins'
overmatched defense trying to keep pace with the 49ers' primed
offense.
</P>
<P>
   No, the problem was simply the Washington Redskins versus the
San Francisco 49ers. The game. The teams. The talent. The schemes.
The focus. The execution.
</P>
<P>
   It was a blowout, a 45-10 victory for the 49ers _ Norv Turner's
worst loss in his five-year tenure in Washington and the Redskins'
worst home loss since 1948. The 76,798 fans at Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium must be wondering what is next for Washington after it
crashed to 0-2. Here is what: two 2-0 opponents, the Seahawks in
Seattle and then the Denver Broncos back here.
</P>
<P>
   Green, the Redskins' quarterback, made his first start ever,
under the glare of ``Monday Night Football.'' He connected on 14 of
24 passes for 201 yards and 1 touchdown, but it was not nearly
enough. After leaping ahead by 7-0, Washington fell behind by 21-10
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Marc Edwards caught a 2-yard pass from Young in the
third quarter that made it 28-10. Then in the final quarter, San
Francisco scored 17 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   Young was masterly (21 for 32 for 303 yards with 3 touchdown
passes), Garrison Hearst was colorful (22 carries, 138 yards) and
the 49ers' offense over all was sensational. They managed this
against a revamped Washington defense. The Redskins paid $57
million in the off season for two defensive tackles, the former
49er Dana Stubblefield and the former Bengal Dan Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was one of opportunities gone sour for the
Redskins. And it was one in which San Francisco kept applying
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 57 seconds left, Washington appeared to have
scored on a 3-yard pass from Green to Leslie Shepperd that would
have cut the deficit to 21-17, but Westbrook had grabbed the face
mask of cornerback Antonio Langham. So, Washington tried again for
the end zone, failed and then attempted a 34-yard field goal. Scott
Blanton's kick hit the left upright, though.
</P>
<P>
   Washington then forced a punt and took possession again at its
own 33 with 34 seconds left. Green hit passes of 6, 11 and 16 yards
and then scrambled for 5 more. Five seconds were left in the half,
and the ball was on the San Francisco 29. This time, Blanton's
47-yard attempt hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had seen Green open the scoring with a 9-yard strike
to Shepperd. But San Francisco took the kickoff and zoomed down the
field, covering 83 yards in 8 plays. The drive featured hard
running by Hearst and a third-and-5 catch of 17 yards by Terrell
Owens that put the ball at midfield. From the 20, Owens managed the
rest, running a picturesque post pattern on the veteran cornerback
Cris Dishman. That helped tie the game at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   To open the second quarter, Allen fumbled at the Redskins' 30
and Hanks recovered. Six plays later, San Francisco led by 14-7
after Young's 3-yard keeper with 10:10 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton made a 37-yard field goal with 5:37 left that made the
score 14-10, but the 49ers then scored the final points of the
half. Rice beat Darrell Green for 57 yards to the Washington 16.
Tight end Irv Smith scored on a 16-yard catch on the very next
play. San Francisco 21, Washington 10.
</P>
<P>
   Young was 13 of 18 for 191 yards in the half. Green was close,
going 11 of 16 for 170 yards. Young threw for two touchdowns, Green
for one, and neither was intercepted. Each team ran 32 plays.
</P>
<P>
   But in the half as for the entire night, San Francisco produced

   NEW YORK _ Stock prices posted strong, broadly based gains for
the second consecutive session Monday. Analysts and traders
attributed the advance to some renewed optimism over corporate
earnings and guarded hope that the industrialized economic powers
would cooperate to overcome global economic problems that seemed so
destabilizing a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 149.85 points, or 1.92
percent, to 7,945.35. Earlier in the session the blue-chip index
was up as much as 244 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures also posted strong gains. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.66 points, or 2.05 percent, to
1,029.72. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted in
technology issues, increased by 24.05 points, or 1.46 percent, to
1,665.69. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks rose 4.10 points,
or 1.16 percent, to 357.72. On the Big Board, advancing issues
outpaced stocks that fell in price by a ratio of two to one. Volume
was 714.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The gains followed a good day on foreign equity markets and a
rally by the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and traders said investors in this country and
elsewhere were encouraged in part by public opinion polls conducted
over the weekend that showed little or no erosion in support for
President Clinton despite the allegations in Special Prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress. Some people on Wall Street
expressed relief that much of the substance in the report had been
leaked to the media before it was formally released.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, indications that the International Monetary Fund is
prepared to provide a financial package for Brazil, if necessary,
was seen as a positive.
</P>
<P>
   So too was a speech the president gave in New York Monday in
which he highlighted the need to pursue policies that promote
growth around the world. That view was reiterated later in the day
by officials representing the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Clinton's remarks and those by the G-7 follow a Sept. 4 speech by
Alan Greenspan, in which the Federal Reserve Board chairman said
inflation was not a near-term concern for the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is now acknowledging what the risks are, which is
reassuring,'' said David Hale, chief economist for the Zurich
Group. ``And the good news for Clinton is that the Starr report had
nothing new in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, said that in addition to hopes that key international
economic problems may be addressed on a coordinated basis,
investors were encouraged by announcements last week from Intel
Corp. and General Electric Co. that third quarter results will be
better than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were a couple of really important announcements,'' he
said, ``GE for leadership reasons and Intel because of its
bellwether status in the high-tech group.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Okesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said the tone of Monday's session was much like last
Friday, when stock prices also staged a broad advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are definitely more relaxed'' than they were a few
weeks ago, he said. ``Not many are particularly bullish, but the
market has not fallen off a cliff, and that provides some relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of what might be a coordinated cut in interest
rates around the world, coupled with possible IMF help for Brazil,
helped to bolster bank and financial company stock prices, whose
shares have been battered in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp rose 5 a share Monday, to 101. American Express was up
3 5/16, to 81 11/16. Merrill Lynch gained 1 5/8, to 57 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were also big gainers. Merck &AMP; Co. rose 4, to $132,
and Eli Lilly gained 1 5/16, to 76 3/16, after doctors at the
European Congress of Osteoporosis conference said their new drugs
offer new hope for treating the disease, which afflicts an
estimated 200 million women.
</P>
<P>
   And airline stocks were big gainers after the newspaper Barron's
reported over the weekend that these stocks represented very good
value at current price levels.
</P>
<P>
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, gained 4 15/16, to 60
1/2; UAL Corp., holding company for United Airlines, rose 5 7/16,
to 69 3/16, and Delta Air Lines rose by 8 3/4, to 104 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Deere &AMP; Co. and Walt Disney &AMP; Co. were among the losers for the
session, as investors sold shares after the companies said
quarterly earnings will be lower than previously forecast. Deere
dropped 1 3/4, to 31 7/16, and Disney lost 1 3/8, to 24 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The market's recent performance has encouraged some technicians
to predict that the steep slide in prices may be over for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is at least a short-term bottoming or stabilizing
reaction, and could be the start of a rally that lasts for a month
or so,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few are prepared to pronounce that the political and
financial problems facing policy-makers here and around the globe
have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets around the world seem to have concluded the president
will stay in office, and that we will have some leadership in the
United States at an extraordinarily tricky time,'' said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But actions speak louder than words. Congress has to approve
the $17.9 billion requested for the IMF, not the $3.5 billion that
was voted out of the House Appropriations Committee last week. The
Fed has to cut interest rates. Japan has to reflate its economy and
reform its banking system. In short, we need to see things get
done. There is still a healthy level of skepticism.''

ON BASEBALL: ARE THE RED SOX RELIVING THEIR PAST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago Tuesday, the New York Yankees and
the Boston Red Sox began a three-game series at Yankee Stadium that
was well noted at the time but little remembered since.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chambliss, for example, hit a two-run home run against
Luis Tiant that supported Ron Guidry's two-hitter in a 4-0 Yankees
victory. But asked about the hit, Chambliss said, ``I don't
remember that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Remy didn't remember that one or anything else about the
series. ``I don't remember much,'' said the Red Sox second baseman
turned Red Sox broadcaster. ``Maybe I don't want to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, who played in the infield with Chambliss on
that team and coaches with him on this one, tried to pull that
series out of the recesses of his memory, but nothing surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the massacre and I remember the playoff, but I
don't remember that one,'' Randolph said. ``I thought the massacre
was the last time we played them until the playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about that series, as well as the massacre and the playoff,
was popular Tuesday because the Red Sox are in town, and _ guess
what? _ they were doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   The best second-place team in the American League all season,
better than the other first-place teams, in fact, the Red Sox find
themselves with a shrunken wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   It stands at three games on Monday night following their 3-0
loss to the Yankees and Orlando Hernandez, who stifled them on
three hits. It could have been a mere two games, but Toronto
couldn't hold a lead against Cleveland and lost, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays were 12{ games behind the Red Sox on Aug. 26, only
three weeks ago. By this time 20 years ago, the Red Sox, who had
led the Yankees by 14 games in July, had already tumbled out of
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had tied them for first place a week earlier by
destroying them in what became known as the Boston Massacre: 15-3,
13-2, 7-0, 7-4. Game, set and match. The Red Sox then came to New
York a game and a half behind the Yankees and, losing two of three,
left two and a half back.
</P>
<P>
   With their dying gasp, the Red Sox caught up with the Yankees
and forced a playoff whose outcome made their collapse only more
excruciating. They didn't blow it just once, but twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got nothing to do with the history,'' Mo Vaughn quietly
protested Tuesday. ``Collapses are collapses. I have nothing to do
with it. Each situation and each year and each team are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Red Sox, though, this year and this
situation look all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at Yankee Stadium last night with 12 losses in
their last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   The lowlights of that stretch: a four-game sweep by the Blue
Jays in Toronto the first week of this month, and losses of two of
three games in Boston this past weekend with the Detroit Tigers,
who have the worst record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Collapse was written all over those series.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Detroit games were ones the Red Sox should have won,
Mike Stanley, who played the first four months with the Blue Jays,
said: ``It's one of those funks we seem to be in and can't seem to
right ourselves out of. Nobody ever knows why these things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone does know why these particular things have
happened. These are the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The most agonizing aspect of the collapse-in-progress is
watching their prospects of playing the Yankees next month wither
away. Because they are in the same division, the teams cannot play
in the first round of the playoffs. But the Red Sox, who had
dominated the wild-card race, looked eminently capable of beating
either of the other division winners, as did the Yankees, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   That would have set up a showdown in the league championship
series, the one before the World Series, and a Red Sox victory
would exorcise all of the ghosts of the past, including 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But as the season dwindles down to a precious few games, the Red
Sox don't even know if they'll be playing next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still ahead,'' Stanley pointed out. ``We just have to
remind ourselves of that, that we're the ones people are chasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the burly first baseman and team leader who may not lead
or play for the team after its last game this year, said the worst
thing the players could do was add pressure on themselves as they
try to pull out of their funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played with a lot of character and a lot of heart and a
lot of guts all season,'' Vaughn said. ``That's what's going to
carry us through this thing. We can't get caught up too much in
this situation. There's really no time as a player to think about
getting down because there's such a short time left. Just go out
and play the game the way it's supposed to be played and have fun
with it. You're still in the lead. That's how you have to look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, Vaughn added, are not an inexperienced team. ``If
people feel uptight, I'm surprised,'' he said. ``This team has
enough veterans who've been places and know what they gotta do.
We'll know soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the Red Sox be able to handle the answer when they get
it?

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GREAT CHACE IS NOW A RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, re-editing throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day before the All-Star Game in Denver, Sammy Sosa was
sitting with Ken Griffey Jr. in the interview area at Coors Field
when he was asked whether he, Mark McGwire or Griffey had the best
chance to break Roger Maris' record of 61 homers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my money on Mark McGwire,'' said Sosa, the Cubs'
smiling slugger. ``Griffey, I know you my boy, but. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, McGwire, who had hit 58 homers a year ago, had 37.
Griffey had 35 and Sosa 33. ``We have another half to go,'' Sosa
said. ``Who knows? I might be the one, Griffey might be the one, or
Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody else, Sosa was talking about the one slugger who
might break Maris' record. It never occurred to him, or to anyone
else, that two sluggers might hit 62 homers this season, much less
that they would have done it with two weeks left in the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pirates in St. Louis, McGwire, the Cardinal first
baseman, had two singles but no homers. Sosa, the Cub right
fielder, was hitless in San Diego, striking out four times.
</P>
<P>
   In past seasons, when the days have dwindled to a precious few,
baseball has had some memorable pennant races and batting-title
races. But it has never had a home run race anything like what Sosa
has suddenly created in his day-to-day duel with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chasing Maris' record, McGwire and Sosa are now
racing each other to whatever the eventual record might be _ 65,
67, 70 or beyond _ when the season ends on Sept. 27. And Sosa may
get the last shot because his season might not end then.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cubs end up in a playoff with the Mets or Giants for the
National League wild-card berth, Sosa would get an extra game. If
he were to hit any homers in a wild-card playoff game (but not a
division playoff), they would count in his season total.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final two weeks, McGwire will have to hope there is no
recurrence of the back spasms that forced him to leave Sunday
night's game. He was back in the lineup on Monday night in St.
Louis, saying he felt fine. In addition, there will be different
psychological factors that would seem to help and hurt both Sosa
and McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of the Cubs' drive for the wild-card berth should
help Sosa maintain his concentration. But of his remaining 12
games, only three are at Wrigley Field. He has hit 35 homers there,
one every 8.37 at-bats, including four in three games against the
Brewers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Sosa has hit 27 homers, one every 11.11 at-bats.
After the four-game series in San Diego that opened on Monday
night, the Cubs were to return to Wrigley Field for three weekend
games with the Reds, then finish the season next week with two
games in Milwaukee and three in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cardinals have no wild-card aspirations, they play
10 of their final 13 games at Busch Stadium, where they opened a
four-game series with the Pirates on Monday night and where McGwire
has thrived. With 32 homers there, he has one every 7.31 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals go to Milwaukee this weekend for three games, then
return to St. Louis for two games against the Astros and four
against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Over the season, McGwire has hit five homers against Houston,
two each against Milwaukee and Pittsburgh and one against Montreal.
Sosa has hit 10 against Milwaukee, 4 against Cincinnati, 3 against
Houston and 2 against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sosa's surge last weekend, McGwire had always maintained
his lead by responding to Sosa's homers with homers of his own. Now
he must respond just to get ahead of Sosa again.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens down the stretch, this home run race promises
to be more compelling theater than the last weeks of the 1927
season, when Babe Ruth hit 60, and the 1961 season, when Maris hit
61.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September 1927, Ruth had 43 homers, Lou Gehrig 41. In
a Sept. 6 doubleheader in Fenway Park, Gehrig hit his 45th for the
lead but the Babe quickly hit three _ his 45th, 46th and 47th. The
next day the Babe hit two more, then added 11 in his final 20 games
for 60. Gehrig hit only two more for 47.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Maris had 56 and Mantle 53 in September when Mantle
developed a severe hip abscess from a flu shot. He missed 18 games,
finishing with 54 homers.
</P>
<P>
   For both Maris and Ruth, there was no September pennant-race
urgency. In 1961, the Maris-Mantle Yankees won the American League
pennant by 8 games; in 1927, the Ruth-Gehrig Yankees won by 19
games.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after all their homers and all their moments, the chase
is over for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, but their race for the
record has just begun. &QL;

METS DEFEAT ASTROS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Try as he might, Mike Piazza cannot win the wild-card
race by himself. And while it took more than eight innings on
Monday night, the rest of Piazza's teammates finally chipped in,
just when the New York Mets' post-season hopes seemed almost lost.
</P>
<P>
   First, Brian McRae tied the score with a two-run homer in the
ninth, one batter after Piazza had delivered his fourth hit of the
night. And then McRae did himself one better with a tie-breaking,
one-out double that scored Edgardo Alfonzo and Piazza with the
go-ahead runs in the 13th, keying a three-run rally that gave the
Mets a come-from-behind 7-4 victory over the Astros, who
nevertheless clinched the National League Central division when the
Cubs lost.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with 11 games remaining in the regular season, the Mets
(84-67) once again moved into a tie with the Cubs in the National
League wild-card race. For McRae, who threw out the potential tying
run to end Sunday's game in Montreal, it was his second
game-winning hit in two days. And John Franco closed out the game
with his franchise-record 37th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really appreciate our team and they definitely
don't appreciate Brian McRae,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   McRae's extra-inning heroics came a dozen innings after Piazza
had given the Mets a two-run lead with a prodigious first-inning
home run to dead center, his 31st of the season. It was a moment
Valentine did not forget after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost in the whole thing was the hardest home run I've ever
seen,'' Valentine said. ``480 feet? I guarantee you the only way
that ball is coming down is if it hits something.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight innings later, with Piazza on first after a leadoff single
and nobody out in the ninth, the switch-hitting McRae, batting
right-handed, drilled a two-strike pitch from the Houston closer
Billy Wagner over the fence in left center field for a game-tying
home run.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after both teams squandered chances as the innings
wore along, Alfonzo opened the 13th with a double to right off Mike
Magnante, one that Derek Bell kicked around long enough for Alfonzo
to take third base. Magnante retired John Olerud on a grounder to
third with the infield in.
</P>
<P>
   But after an intentional walk to Piazza, who finished 4 for 5 on
the evening, McRae greeted Doug Henry with a double to right
center, took third on a fly out to right and later scored on a wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams squandered opportunities after McRae's 21st home run
had tied the score at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets threatening to add to their rally, pinch-runner
Jermaine Allensworth was doubled off second base with runners on
first and second on pinch-hitter Luis Lopez's line-out to short to
end the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the bottom of the 10th, Turk Wendell retired Bell and
Jeff Bagwell with runners on first and second to end that threat.

GREENE'S HIT LIFTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ A check of Todd Greene's cubicle in the
visiting clubhouse at Tropicana Field reveals no crystal ball, no
tarot cards, nothing of the sort. But Greene, getting his first
start since Aug. 28, saw the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win a game for us,'' he said before Monday
night's game between the Angels and Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
``Hopefully it's in the next 14 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene didn't have to wait that long. He snapped a 0-for-10
slide with a two-out, RBI double in the eighth inning that broke a
2-2 tie and propelled the Angels to a come-from-behind 4-2 win
before 24,279 at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Angels increased their AL West lead to two
games because Texas lost 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-3) relieved starter Omar Olivares and got
the win with two scoreless innings. Troy Percival, coming off his
debacle in Baltimore last Saturday, pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his
40th save.
</P>
<P>
   Greene got off to a fast start _ getting nine hits in his first
15 at-bats _ after being activated Aug. 7. But he had been
frustrated of late, struggling in his role as a pinch hitter, his
average dipping to .319.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here I had been playing on a rehab
assignment, so I was sharp,'' Greene said. ``My timing was there.
But we haven't seen a left-hander in two weeks. I've had four
at-bats since then. I'm not sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said getting four at-bats in a game, instead of one every
few days, would make a difference. ``I might find something that
will help me in my second or third at-bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the fourth at-bat that it paid off. He had come
up with runners on first and second in each of his first three
at-bats and made out each time. He never even advanced a runner.
But in the top of the eighth, the Angels got an RBI single from Tim
Salmon and a sacrifice fly by Jim Edmonds to tie the game at 2-2.
Greene came up with Salmon on first and two out, and one final
chance to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   He fell behind in the count, 1-2, then hit a hanging curveball
down the left-field line. Salmon hobbled on his bad left foot and
scored from first to give the Angels a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, playing with a ligament in the foot that is 70-80
percent torn, said he knew he would be trying to score as soon as
the ball left Greene's bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (third-base coach Larry) Bowa would send me,'' Salmon
said. ``And I probably would have ran through a stop sign anyway.
As hard as I was running it would have been impossible to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson added an RBI double in the inning to make it
4-2. After the game, Greene was modest about his prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' he said. ``I wasn't calling a shot. I've
been setting it up for the last two months. I just wanted to help
us win a game and the more opportunities you get, the more
opportunities to be successful you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to end up coming up in big situations,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``Whether it's as a pinch hitter or
playing a spot, if he gets enough at-bats where he can get his
stroke down, he's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for any of the Angels hitters to do anything
Monday. Devil Rays starter Wilson Alvarez shut out the Angels for
seven innings. But in the eighth, Gregg Jefferies beat out an
infield hit and Randy Velarde walked with one out. That was the end
for Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels then took advantage of losing pitcher Albie Lopez
(6-3), ending their losing streak at three games. Salmon singled
home pinch runner Chris Pritchett, sending Velarde to third.
Velarde scored the tying run on Edmonds' fly out to center, setting
the stage for Greene.

SOSA'S WEST COAST SHOW STAYS IN THE BALL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The great home run chase came to Qualcomm Stadium
Monday night in the form of Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa,
the newest member of the 62 home run club.
</P>
<P>
   But initiation of a 63-home-run fraternity would have to wait
another day, as Sosa went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts in a 4-3
loss to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 60,515 came to watch Sosa, although only 23,948 were
paying customers. It was part of a promotion in which fans could
use unused tickets from previous Padres games. The promotion was
scheduled long before Sosa made baseball history, and fans took
advantage of it for a feel of the home run fever. Paying or not,
the crowd was lively and rambunctious, filling the air with chants
of ``Sammy! Sammy!'' Every time he struck out, Padre fans would
both cheer and boo, cheering Sosa for his efforts and booing the
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The evening came to a dramatic climax in the eighth inning.
After the Cubs tied the score at 3-3 on a one-out home run by Jose
Hernandez, Mark Grace reached on an error to bring Sosa up to the
plate. Padres manager Bruce Bochy countered with the right-hander
Dan Miceli, who had given up Sosa's fourth home run of the season
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Miceli wasted no time, challenging Sosa with fastballs and
striking him out on four pitches, the last one swinging, to keep
the score tied. Ken Caminiti then led off the bottom of the inning
with a homer that would give the Padres the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had already faced a crowd earlier on Monday, with more than
150 members of the news media crowded into a locker room Monday
afternoon for a pre-game news conference. Sosa entered the room
with a smile and, after staring out at the waiting crowd,
sheepishly said into the microphone: ``Hi. Sorry I'm late.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as a reporter began to ask a question, Sosa promptly
cut him off to talk about an important phone call he fielded Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I want to say that I had a beautiful phone call
from Bill Clinton, congratulating me,'' Sosa said. ``It was
something that made me proud of myself. I was jumping up and down
afterwards thinking, `I just talked to Bill Clinton.' It was a very
nice thing for him to do, and I want to say, thank you, Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was a Chicago Cub fan and to take Chicago to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also mentioned that he just gave the bat with which he hit
his historic home runs to the Baseball Hall of Fame, despite
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit 59, 60, 61 and 62 with it,'' Sosa said. ``But when they
told me that it would be close to the bats of Mark McGwire and
Roger Maris, I said, `OK' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's situation is quite different from the one that the St.
Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire is in. The Cubs are in the the
National League wild-card chase, tied with the Mets. Whereas
McGwire has been the main focus in St. Louis, Sosa is helping
Chicago's post-season chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sammy has helped us a lot,'' said Cubs center fielder
Lance Johnson, who threw out a runner at home to end the second
inning Monday night to preserve a 1-0 Cubs lead. ``He's taken
attention away from other players so we don't have to deal with any
of this, or the media, and we could play great ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the second inning, Sosa walked to the plate to a
standing ovation and, amid blinking flashbulbs, the public-address
announcer introduced Sosa as ``one of only two players to hit 62
home runs.''

MONDAY NIGHT GAMES LOSE HOUR, TAVERN ATTENDANCE, L.A. BAR OWNERS
SAY
</HEADLINE>

Football'') (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hour-earlier start of ``Monday Night Football'' may have
East Coast tavern owners cheering wildly, but their counterparts in
the West think someone fumbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Area bar operators who traditionally have counted on Mondays
during football season for a large chunk of their income say
business has dropped as much as 25 percent because of the new 5:10
p.m. game start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're probably down 15 to 20 percent,'' said Dave
Flemming, general manager of the Corbin Bowl Sports Bar in Tarzana,
a Los Angeles suburb. ``It seems like (previous customers are) just
(going) straight home and are not coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League agreed this year to start its
showcase Monday night games an hour earlier to appease East Coast
viewers who have complained that previous years' games ended too
late.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with kickoffs at just after 8 p.m. in the East, a typical
game will end in time for viewers to watch their local 11 p.m. news
or get home from the neighborhood bar before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The change may be good for business for bars out East, West
Coast bar owners say, but the new kickoff is just too close to
quitting time for many people.
</P>
<P>
   George Salameh, owner of The Bull's Eye Grill &AMP; Tavern in
Northridge, an L.A. suburb, said he saw a nearly 25 percent drop in
business during this season's first ``Monday Night Football'' game
Sept. 7. Before the change, the Monday night crowd accounted for up
to 20 percent of Salameh's weekly revenues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, people are ``just getting out of work, they don't
have time to go to a local tavern and watch the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the quality of competition doesn't have anything to do
with the smaller crowds. The Labor Day game was between the Denver
Broncos _ who won the Super Bowl in January and is considered one
of the best teams this year _ and the New England Patriots, a
playoff team last season. Monday's game was between the San
Francisco 49ers and the Washington Redskins, two of the NFL's most
popular teams.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tracy, owner of the MVP Sports Bar and Grill in Simi
Valley, Calif., said it's still too early to tell how much business
will fall because of the time change.
</P>
<P>
   But he fears it could drop as much as 20 percent, in part
because the tavern offers electronic interactive football games in
which patrons compete with other bars across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys that have been playing for years, it's very
difficult for them to play and have a fair chance, because the game
now starts an hour earlier,'' said Tracy. ``So it causes a pretty
big problem for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said that those responsible for the time change could have
kept in mind the needs of West Coast football fans who are just
getting out of work at kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have done a happy medium and maybe started the game
at 5:30,'' said Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Business also has dropped a little bit at The Broiler in
Northridge, but not enough to worry manager Chris Watson too much.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans, he said, seem to be waiting until about the game's
third or fourth quarter to show up at the bar. ``The crowd still
comes, but it's just a later crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But since they're coming later, they're buying less. ``There's
less money spent,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the change, The Broiler and other area taverns are
offering dinner specials or other promotions to entice customers to
stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game used to do it pretty much, but you have to
improvise,'' said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Salameh said he thinks fans will adjust to the change and start
coming back to the Bull's Eye to catch the games on his big-screen
television or the seven other TVs scattered throughout the tavern.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not going to bring it up to the same volume that
we've had in past years,'' said Salameh said.
</P>
<P>
   Flemming said Corbin Bowl doesn't depend to a great extent on
Monday night crowds so his business will do OK, even though
attendance at this year's first Monday game dropped about 25
percent from the previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern has a number of bowling leagues and other activities
that bring in paying customers. ``It's just a small part of
business,'' Flemming said about the ``Monday Night Football''
crowd. ``It's not going to crush the bar.'' &QL;

HUSKIES HOPE TO GIVE BYU GOOD WAC-ING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On display Saturday at Husky Stadium is the equivalent
of Pavarotti singing at the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about out of character. Brigham Young University, home to
the greatest passing offense in NCAA football history, will offer
for the Washington football home opener
three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-beehives.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a running back named Ronney Jenkins, whom UW coach Jim
Lambright likens to Napoleon Kaufman, BYU has gone Ground Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   In its two games, a close road loss at Alabama and a home win
over Arizona State, BYU has thrown a total of 51 passes. In the
past, BYU could throw 51 passes between ``Oh, say can you see ...
'' and ``... rocket's red glare ...''
</P>
<P>
   BYU quarterbacks occupy the first five spots in the NCAA's
career pass efficiency ratings: Ty Detmer, Steve Sarkisian, Jim
McMahon, Steve Young and Robbie Bosco. John Walsh is No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against ASU, current Cougar QB Kevin Feterik completed
six passes. The only way he can get into a meeting of the BYU QB
alumni club is through the federal witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? BYU coach LaVell Edwards in drag?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Huskies, as gracious hosts, will attempt to
keep the expected sellout from staring rudely all afternoon at
their guests' disfigurement.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is coming out in a role reversal of its own _ a full
WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Western Athletic Conference, of which BYU is a
member, has been home to the throw-first-and-ask-questions-later
offense. WAC teams pass from second-and-one, they pass from
7-Eleven, they pass from 21 points ahead, they pass from punt
formation and once in a while on a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's football as the Roman god Mercury would have played it.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the way the 1998 Huskies will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Big Sky Conference, the little brother of the
WAC,'' said UW offensive coordinator Scott Linehan, a former
University of Idaho quarterback under then-coach Dennis Erickson.
``To me that was football, 50-40 games. That's the way football is
supposed to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different than what folks are used to here.''
</P>
<P>
   A little different? Scott, you are sandbagging, if the 42-38 win
over Arizona State Sept. 5 was an example. This is not Don James
football, where the Huskies put their best athletes on defense and
special teams and double-dared the offense to screw it up.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even Jim Lambright football, which took the James
style and added hairier arms and thicker necks.
</P>
<P>
   This is BYU, with faster guys.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sun Devils, Husky quarterback Brock Huard threw a
personal-high 47 passes and completed 27, three shy of Sonny
Sixkiller's school record. He threw to a group of receivers whose
most experienced pass catcher was a running back with eight
previous receptions. But at times there seemed to be dozens of
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   They ran past the local guys with a preposterous final-seconds
touchdown pass, at nearly 11 on a Saturday night, lifting every
college football fan off his or her bar stool, beer spilling up and
down the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The full WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Linehan, ``was the best one-game experience I
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he was the only guy in purple who was certain it
would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The God's-honest truth is that there were nine coaches, 10
counting Lambright, that were sitting there wondering what we were
putting out there,'' he said. ``They'd seen it in practice. But
when the lights kicked on, who was going to come to play? We had
confidence in them, and kinda turned over the game plan to the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's going to be this season, more or less.
Linehan knows that surprise was a one-time weapon now lost, so the
Huskies are going to have to show a little something else Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm smart enough to know that if a team says it will double-
and triple-team our receivers, and use lots of nickel or dime
coverage, we'll abandon our pass-first game,'' he said. ``It'll be
fun to see, as the year goes on, how the opponents view us. Our
opener was a little new for Arizona State, as far as throwing the
ball around. But we have to come up with a guy who can put a
hundreds yards on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good coach-think. Still, it's obvious you
can take the boy out of the Big Sky, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kinda fun to throw the ball 70 percent of the time on
first down and not even think about it; to have the ability to
throw six times in a row,'' he said. ``It's so unlike anything
that's been done here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's quick to credit his boss for walking with him to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lambright goes from a defense/special teams guy who tries not
to lose on offense, to a no-holds-barred offense that keeps
possession with the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about coming out of a comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright and the Huskies couldn't look more different if they
wore Easter bonnets. Presuming they could get the headgear away
from BYU.

SHEFFIELD: MONDESI DEMAND NO WORRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers
dugout Monday night but just for a visit. His season ended two
weeks ago with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   But his 1998 plans already have an interesting wrinkle now that
Raul Mondesi wants his spot back in right field.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only thing going on at Dodger Stadium, where the
Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 4-1, but it certainly was the
most interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Eric Young sprained his right foot in the first inning and
could be lost for the final 12 games of the season. But the Dodgers
already have been through that with Sheffield and Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   And Carlos Perez, who suffered a sprained ankle of his own
before Sunday's game in San Diego, returned to pitch his third
consecutive complete game and came within two outs of pitching a
shutout before Kurt Abbott hit a pinch home run.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield and Mondesi are the two best players on the team.
They also are the highest paid. To avoid a repeat of this season,
new Dodgers GM Kevin Malone needs to get the situation solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know something can be worked out,'' said Sheffield, who will
have a soft cast removed from his ankle today. ``Whether I go to
left or Mondy goes to left, it will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. Mondesi has said he only wants to play
right field, where he won Gold Gloves the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield began his career as a shortstop in Milwaukee and
played third base in San Diego. He is the team's highest-paid
player, just finishing the first season on a six-year deal totaling
$68.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, the club leader with 30 homers and 88 RBI, moved to
center when Sheffield came over from Florida in the May 15 Mike
Piazza deal. But he also developed lower-back pain from the extra
running and has told the team there is no way he is going back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great thing he did,'' Sheffield said. ``A lot of
people, myself included, think he can be a Gold Glover out there,
too. But it does take its toll physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's victory also took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the only member of the Dodgers' starting lineup to play
on Opening Day, walked to open the first inning but was picked off
by Rockies starter Bobby Jones (7-8). He raced to second but caught
his right foot on the bag as he slid. Young, who missed 34 games
earlier this season with a strained left thigh, was helped off the
field and taken to the hospital for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Young's replacement, Juan Castro, started the winning rally in
the eighth inning after Perez and Jones each pitched seven
scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Castro opened with a single and thought he was moving to second
on a sacrifice by Trenidad Hubbard. Jones fielded the ball, but his
left knee collapsed attempting to throw to first and the ball
sailed down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Castro never broke stride and scored easily. Hubbard took
second. Karros walked and Bobby Bonilla doubled to right for the
Dodgers' second run. Two outs and an intentional walk later, left
fielder Roger Cedeno singled home Karros to make it 3-0. With the
bases loaded, Perez walked for the fourth run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had allowed just two runs in his previous 18 innings,
showed no ankle problems. Until the ninth, only one batter, former
teammate Mike Lansing, reached third.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, like Sunday's starter Ismael Valdes, is eligible for
salary arbitration at the end of the season and could be in for a
hefty pay raise if he finishes strongly. After coming over from
Montreal with Mark Grudzielanek on July 31, Perez has been streaky.
He was winless in his first six decisions, including three losses.
But ever since he became angry when manager Glenn Hoffman removed
him from his Aug. 28 start with a 4-1 lead, he has been dominant.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched a two-hit shutout against Philadelphia on Sept. 2 and
allowed just two runs to Arizona in his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable now,'' Perez said. ``When you come
from a different organization, it takes two or three starts to get
a feel for the team. But now my confidence is great. The coaching
staff is letting me pitch my game.''

HASEGAWA DELIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Shigetoshi Hasegawa did it again. The
Anaheim Angels' set-up man pitched two scoreless innings Monday
night, relieving starter Omar Olivares and setting up Troy Percival
in the Angels' 4-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   After an infield single and an error by second baseman Randy
Velarde on a potential double play ball, the Devil Rays had runners
on first and second with nobody out in the seventh inning, leading
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasegawa struck out Quinton McCracken, Wade Boggs and Bobby
Smith to get out of it. After the Angels took the lead in the top
of the eighth, Hasegawa set down the Rays 1-2-3 in the bottom of
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome, Percival said. ``Tonight was as good as I've
seen him in a while. He's fresh again. He gets worn down and never
says anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Terry Collins: ``One thing about him, he's not a
strikeout pitcher. When he strikes out the side, you know he's
bearing down.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad getting better: Darin Erstad is smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who strained his left hamstring Sept. 2, had moped
around the clubhouse with a frown for days, refusing to talk about
his injury. But because the hamstring has made rapid improvement,
his mood is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to spend 16 hours in the training room every day
any more,'' he explained. ``It's better.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not good enough to play. Though he's taking ground
balls and batting practice, he's running at only 20 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I can't run,'' he said. ``Acceleration is the big
thing. I need to build confidence in it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible Erstad could get a pinch-hitting appearance in
Texas later this week, but he probably won't be back in the
starting lineup until sometime during the final homestand, Sept.
18-23.
</P>
<P>
   __ Koufax in the house: As he did the last time the Angels were
in town, Hall of Fame pitcher and ex-Dodger Sandy Koufax made the
drive from his home in Vero Beach to St. Petersburg to visit
Collins, a longtime friend, at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   With Koufax around, the Angels are 4-0, all four wins coming in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can take him to Texas with us,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Gregg Jefferies reinjured his right hamstring Monday
night beating out an infield hit in the eighth inning, getting the
Angels started on their game-winning rally. ``I've played through
it before, I'll do it again,'' Jefferies said.... Third baseman
Troy Glaus was named the Minor League Player of the Year by Howe
Sportsdata International. In 109 minor-league games this season
split between Double-A Midland and Triple-A Vancouver, Glaus hit
.307 with 35 homers and 93 RBI.... The Angels won coin flips with
Boston, Toronto and Texas in case of a tie for the wild card spot
(with Boston or Toronto) or the AL West title (with Texas). Winning
the coin flips mean the Angels would host a one-game playoff
against any of those teams on Monday, Sept. 28.

DINOSAUR STUDY SHOWS THICK-SKULL SPECIES DIDN'T BASH HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dinosaur fantasies die hard.
</P>
<P>
   And now a study of the notorious head-butting creatures called
Pachycephalosaurs, who are so often likened to modern bighorn
sheep, establishes clearly that they did nothing of the sort,
according to a team of fossil hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to kill the myth,'' said paleontologist Mark Goodwin
of the University of California at Berkeley, who has collected
fossils of the ancient beasts and recently led a team that analyzed
skulls of Pachycephalosaurs in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled members of the plant-eating Pachycephalosaur family
may well have used their heads to attack each other on their
flanks, or even flailed away against each other with their
unusually stiffened tails. But their skulls were surely not built
for ramming each other, no matter how fierce their competition,
Goodwin says.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no truth to the theory that one recent authoritative
book described like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a great crash helmet, the thick skull could have absorbed
tremendous impact as rival males butted each other, head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   The skulls of those dinosaurs were nothing at all like crash
helmets, according to Goodwin's analysis. Thin shavings from the
fossil skull of one species, called Stegoceras, show that although
their dome-shaped heads _ often round like bowling balls _ appear
to be solid bone, the bony structures are laced like honeycombs
with the remnants of blood vessels that actually made the skulls
porous rather than rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wouldn't be in their own best interests to ram
heads in a fight,'' Goodwin said. ``They would have killed each
other, and a couple of bowling balls would hardly make good
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also no evidence from the fossil skulls that the
animals Goodwin's team analyzed bore any scars indicating healed
injuries from a head-on fight, Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the fossils _ gathered primarily from Montana and North
Dakota _ anything like the skulls of head-butting animals like
bighorn sheep, he said. Bighorns have broad, flat heads with
spreading horns and air-filled chambers in their skulls that can
absorb head-on blows.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin is a principal scientist at UC Berkeley's Museum of
Paleontology, and has reported his team's new findings in the
Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. His colleagues include Emily
Buchholtz, now at Wellesley College, and Rolf Johnson of the
Milwaukee Public Museum.

 Quark Drops Unsolicited Bid for Adobe   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Quark Inc., facing opposition even among its own customers,
yesterday announced it has dropped an unsolicited bid to buy rival
desktop publishing maker Adobe Systems Inc. of San Jose.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chairman Tim Gill said Denver's Quark decided to stop pursuing
the purchase of its larger rival because Adobe founders John
Warnock and Charles Geschke have rejected a sale and refused to
even discuss a friendly takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostile takeovers don't work in high tech,'' Gill said.
``There would be no point in pursuing it at this time. If Adobe's
opinion would ever change, we would like to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quark's withdrawal ended a brief takeover drama that had upset
desktop publishers, many of whom feared Quark taking over its only
major rival and dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers saw the bid as a publicity stunt by
Quark, but one analyst said the takeover attempt spotlighted the
strengths and weaknesses of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we were left with much ado about
nothing,'' said Craig Cline, an analyst and vice president with
Seybold Seminars in Foster City. ``On the other hand, it caused us
to start sitting up and looking at these companies again and we
found both of them wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe issued only a brief statement that Warnock and Geschke
were pleased with Quark's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful for the tremendous support we have
received from our business partners, customers and our employees.
We continue to focus on the exciting opportunities available to
us,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Quark made the announcement after the stock
market closed. Adobe stock closed at $28.50, up 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Quark revealed last month it had tried to approach Adobe with an
offer, which was flatly rejected. Quark never announced how much
money it was prepared to offer, but Gill had said the company had
the needed financing.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the offer, Adobe's stock value was slumping
toward its 52-week low of $23.63 per share on September 4. Adobe's
low stock price was one reason Quark tried for the friendly
takeover, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Adobe's stock has started to rebound, making a
potential deal more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   And, Gill said, Adobe's ``poison pill'' stock repurchase plan
designed to thwart a hostile takeover would have made the deal too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear they wanted to stay on their own,'' Gill said.
``It just wasn't worth pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quark also found it had only lukewarm support in the publishing
industry. At a major publishing convention sponsored by Seybold
Seminars this month in San Francisco, attendees at a special panel
discussion on the potential Quark-Adobe marriage griped about
Quark's past history of customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the room voted in favor of the merger,'' said Cline,
one of the panel moderators. ``They railed against Quark and its
support policies, which to be fair to Quark, they have recently
taken steps to address. But they have a long history of ticking
people off.''

RODRIGUEZ'S NUMBERS BETTER THAN GRIFFEY'S AFTER FIRST 500 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They entered the major leagues five years apart
under entirely different circumstances. One was a franchise messiah
coming to a last-place team, while the other had the luxury of
breaking into a division championship lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. was the Mariner trailblazer, the team's first
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez has walked in those same tracks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mariners' disappointing season enters its final two
weeks, the team's brightest stars are winding up productive
seasons. They aren't the reasons the M's will finish third or
fourth in the American League West but are largely responsible for
turning a bedraggled franchise into one of the most popular in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And based on a 500-game comparison, the standards Griffey
established since he became The Franchise in 1989 have been
exceeded by Rodriguez, in numbers if not stature.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey still is The Man. Rodriguez is The Man II.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the most prolific twosomes in the majors the past
three seasons, batting second and third in the Mariner lineup,
feeding off each other's love for the game and burning desire to
succeed and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know them personally or get a chance to see them play
every day,'' longtime American League scout Gordon Lakey said,
``but I think they push each other. They are good for one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He pushes me,'' Rodriguez said of Griffey. ``When I look up
and see what he has done, I want to do the same things. It's
natural, like what Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire have done for each
other this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think playing together has been great for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is because they reached the majors under such different
conditions that comparisons are difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Griffey reached the 500-game plateau, 64 games into
his fourth big-league season in 1992, the Mariners were still three
years away from becoming a postseason contender. Rodriguez, who
played in his 500th major league game Monday, became involved in a
pennant race almost immediately. The Mariners were a combined
297-351 in Griffey's first four seasons, 303-277 in Rodriguez's
first four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Alex would do well in any environment,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``He is very headstrong, confident and works very
hard for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, playing with guys like Junior, Jay Buhner
and Edgar Martinez to name a few didn't put him in a position where
he had to be the main guy. He could blend in, utilize his skills
and be a contributor. When Junior came in, he became the franchise
guy by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Any team would be delighted to have either player in its lineup,
and the Mariners realize their good fortune of having both. They
are arguably the best 1-2 punch in the majors, combining for 90
home runs and 243 RBIs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rodriguez, 23, has batted in every lineup position
during his brief major league career, he has excelled as the No. 2
batter, hitting in front of the 28-year-old Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very flattering numbers,'' said Rodriguez, as he
looked at the numerical comparison after 500 major league games.
``To match up with a guy like Griff is very flattering. I have
benefited greatly by hitting in front of him. Any time you have a
Ken Griffey Jr. hitting behind you, you are going to get good
pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Despite hitting a career-high 39 homers this
season Rodriguez hasn't received an intentional walk this season.
Griffey has 11, even with two-time AL batting champion Martinez
hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has taken advantage of this ideal situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't surprise me,'' Lakey said. ``Griffey didn't
have the same caliber of players on the team when he broke in that
Alex did. (Rodriguez) had the best player in the game already in
place, and that took a lot of pressure off him. Griffey was so
highly touted he made the transition for Alex much easier. But both
are tremendous players, and you don't see that kind of talent on
the same team very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing isn't everything. But it helps. Both broke in as
teenagers. Griffey won a roster spot in 1989 spring training when
he was 19 years old and the Mariners were perennial losers.
Rodriguez was called up for 17 games in 1994 as an 18-year-old and
then for 48 games in the division championship season of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate to play with some great players. Not only
Griff, but Edgar and Jay,'' Rodriguez said. ``I've been a
beneficiary of this lineup and so has Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare us,'' Griffey said. ``A better comparison is
Alex and Gar (Martinez). Nothing against Alex because he plays the
game the way it's supposed to be played, like every game is your
last, but you have a guy, number one, who didn't have a guy like me
hitting behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey broke in batting second ahead of Alvin Davis, the
Mariners' best hitter at the time. But Davis was no Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffey arrived, the M's had one winning season in
franchise history. ``There were some established players, but no
superstars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alex got here, it was totally different. Alex didn't have
to create baseball in Seattle. All he had to do was go play and
have fun. That's all we wanted him to do. He already had myself,
Jay and Edgar on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both have performed superbly in their lineup spots,
Piniella is considering a different look for next season, moving
Rodriguez from second to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do depends on what we can get done over the winter,''
Piniella said. ``One of our top priorities is to get a (prototype)
leadoff hitter. I can see (Carlos) Guillen fitting into the second
hole. Or, we could put (David) Segui there. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex basically is not a second hitter. He's a 3-4 guy, and we
have a pretty fair guy in the three hole already. The fourth spot
is a nice spot for him to settle into. I think after a couple of
years in the major leagues and with the success he's had, I think
he's ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodriguez, ``I like hitting second because you come to the
plate a lot. Hitting fourth will allow me to drive in more runs,
but also will take some at-bats away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they are in the lineup doesn't figure to alter their
hitting styles or production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, my next 500 games will be better than the first
500,'' Rodriguez said. ``But I have set some pretty high standards
for myself.''

 Sharper Image Gets Serious  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One sure sign it's not the 1980s anymore: Richard Thalheimer, the
once high-flying chairman of Sharper Image Inc., has sold his
corporate jet.
<P>
   After years of taking guff about living lavishly while his
company stagnated, Thalheimer bowed to pressure and sold off the
company's leather-upholstered nine-seater this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to believe it is an incredibly cost-effective
business tool, but it is also true that, for many people, the
corporate jet is a lightning rod of emotion,'' Thalheimer said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some investors have said that if I'm serious about the
business I would get rid of it. If this sets the tone that we're
serious about saving money, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The move signifies just how much Sharper Image, known as a
purveyor of expensive toys for middle-aged boys, and its founder _
who is often described as an autocrat _ have changed the way they
do business.
</P>
<P>
   Worn down by years of erratic financial performance and a stock
price that is languishing in the basement, Thalheimer, the creative
mind behind the company, has ceded control of Sharper Image's
day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces daunting challenges such as updating its
image, avoiding inventory shortfalls, developing one-of-a-kind
proprietary products and keeping unique merchandise flowing into
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I wake up smug and happy, but in fact I wake up
... with tremendous shame that we haven't achieved the kinds of
sales and earnings we should have,'' said Thalheimer, who launched
Sharper Image in 1978 after earning degrees at Yale University and
Hastings College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Thalheimer accepted only $150,000 of the $257,500 bonus he was
eligible for last year because, with earnings weak, ``I just didn't
feel I earned it,'' he said. (Thalheimer, the company's chairman
and chief executive still isn't hurting _ his 1997 salary totaled
$479,134.)
</P>
<P>
   While Sharper Image profitably operates 85 U.S. stores, a
catalog division and an up-and-coming Web site
( &LR; www.sharperimage.com &LR; ), last year's sales of $210 million weren't
appreciably higher than its 1989 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a rumor-driven bump in April, Sharper Image's shares
have been stalled at around $3 to $4 _ compared to the 1987 initial
public offering price of $10. This state of affairs hurts no one
more than Thalheimer, who owns two-thirds of the outstanding
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image has suffered from a range of chronic problems over
the years, from inventory shortfalls and product development delays
to a repeated lack of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company has tried new concepts including
children's catalogs and a bath and body business called the SPA
Collection. In the Sharper Image stores, it experimented with such
noncore lines as clothing and mainstream brands of consumer
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   None of these ideas had staying power. In the early 1990s, a
combination of economic weakness and merchandising mistakes
contributed to two annual net losses. In 1996, the retailer a took
an $8 million charge to close the SPA catalog and six SPA stores.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these problems stands Thalheimer's propensity to govern
by whim rather than strategy, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a classic entrepreneur,'' said one former Sharper Image
executive. ``He comes in the room and says `Let's stop going south,
let's go north. A few minutes later he comes in again and says,
`Why aren't you all going north? The decision has been made.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that it is highly unusual for a creative
person to have any significant management skills,'' added Kenneth
Gassman, an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. who is one of the few
stock analysts who bother to follow Sharper Image these days. ``If
you print that, Richard'll probably be pissed, &UR;  &LR; but he'd probably
say privately, `You're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, people who know Thalheimer well credit him with having
extraordinary merchandising vision.
</P>
<P>
   He can see unimpressive, even bizarre products, such as a tiny
air conditioner people wear around their necks (10,000 of these
Personal Cooling Systems were sold last month alone for $49 each)
or gel shoe inserts &UR;  &LR; (at $15, one of the company's most profitable
products ever), and sell millions of dollars of them.
</P>
<P>
   Thalheimer conceded his strengths and his weaknesses a year and
a half ago when he brought in Barry Gilbert, a former Warner Bros.
Studio Stores executive who manages Sharper Image's day-to-day
operations.
</P>
<P>
   While Thalheimer had hired managers before, he had never
relinquished authority to them as he has with Gilbert, people close
to the company say. Thalheimer now spends four days a week in
Sharper Image's Novato engineering laboratory developing new
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to walk away from (hands-on management) is a hell of a
step,'' said the former executive.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's major changes at the company include replacing top
managers and focusing on more practical gadgets rather than pure
toys &UR; . &LR;  (Think air purifiers instead of life-size Darth Vader
dolls).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He also is establishing a system for measuring the performance
of each of the company's divisions so that profitable units can be
cultivated and unprofitable ones eliminated, a seemingly obvious
step that led to the closure of the SPA division.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, the company's chief operating officer and vice
chairman, said he continues to monitor an upscale furniture catalog
business, the Sharper Image Home Collection, which was launched two
years ago and is expected to generate revenues of at least $10
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gilbert, Sharper Image's performance has improved
dramatically. In the first half of the year total revenues grew 12
percent and the year-to-date loss is running 8 percent lower than
in the first half of 1997. Like many retailers, Sharper Image
generally loses money until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales this year are projected at $240 million to $250 million
with growth driven mostly by sales from the newly redesigned
Sharper Image catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But just as results appeared to be improving, the company ran
into trouble last month. August same-store sales declined 2 percent
as the company struggled to ship merchandise from Asia. It also
faced an old nemesis: an inventory shortage of some products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Asia problem weren't there I'd be pounding the table on
the stock and the stock ... would probably be $5 to $7,'' said
Gassman.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the challenge, Sharper Image, widely seen as a symbol
of the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s, continues to fight a
dated image. Most of the company's stores, which account for about
70 percent of total sales, have not been renovated for years and
are stuck with a gray 1980s look.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image this fall is opening redesigned test stores, which
employ a new floor plan and are painted in 1990s white instead of
1980s gray, in Orlando, Fla., and in Manhattan. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Sharper Image plans to open future stores in this style,
including six this year and 10 in 1999, &UR;  &LR; but it is still faced with
more than 80 stale-looking stores. Finding the $40 million that
Thalheimer estimates is needed for renovations will not be easy and
may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing a new look piecemeal also has its dangers, warned
William Dean, a San Francisco direct mail consultant. To avoid
consumer confusion, ``Sharper Image needs to be very careful to
maintain the same image across all media,'' including catalogs, the
Web site and stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the company's biggest challenge is to increase its
offering of company-developed products, which are sold under the
name Sharper Image Design.
</P>
<P>
   Some currently hot proprietary items include the Personal
Cooling System; the Ionic Breeze, an air purifier with no moving
parts ($199); and the Ionic Hair Wand, which cleans and conditions
hair without shampoo or water ($39).
</P>
<P>
   Proprietary products carry wider profit margins than merchandise
bought from outside companies. They also ensure that the company
has the kind of unique gizmos it needs to keep shoppers browsing
the stores and skimming the catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time our (comparable store) sales aren't good, it's
because products are late,'' said Thalheimer. Late gadgets mean
lower sales, lower profits and angry investors _ which translates
into lower share prices.
</P>
<P>
   But conceiving of unique high-tech items that will catch on in
the marketplace _ and developing them on time and on budget _ is
much trickier than, say, selling mainstream brands of consumer
electronics or designing and selling apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need the next big thing nobody's ever heard of to
make this business successful,'' said a former Sharper Image
executive. ``It's not like changing a skirt length from season to
season.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggling to increase its selection of
house-designed goods, Sharper Image finally made some progress this
year, with the percentage of sales from proprietary products
doubling to a still-modest 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thalheimer said he would like to see the share grow as high as
50 to 70 percent; Gilbert said he's not certain it will ever be
higher than one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Among the uncertainties hovering over Sharper Image is a major
question mark about Thalheimer's future with the company.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he has talked about selling his shares to a
deep-pocketed investor, according to his colleagues. But he is
faced with the fact that he owns most of the company's stock and
its market value is extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image's market capitalization today is just one-sixth of
annual sales, while the going rate for recently acquired retailers
has been about equal to their annual sales or a little higher,
Thalheimer noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I got a 100 percent premium ... it won't impress me
that's very fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Thalheimer said he has spoken as recently as
this year about devising an exit strategy. But given the state of
the market, Thalheimer said, ``While at some point in my life I
would want to do that (sell shares), it probably is five to 10
years out.''

 Wells CEO's Parachute Is Not as Golden   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Although Wells Fargo Chief Executive Paul Hazen won't head the new
bank resulting from the merger with Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis,
he will receive whatever the new CEO makes in salary and bonus for
five years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition, Hazen will receive 500,000 shares of new restricted
stock currently worth about $16.5 million and options to buy
another 1 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's 56-year-old boss will receive a minimum of 25
percent of his $2,850,000 salary and bonus last year in annual
retirement benefits. He also will receive lifetime medical and
dental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen's employment package benefits are spelled out in proxy
materials being mailed out this week to those who own stock in
either bank.
</P>
<P>
   On October 20, shareholders will vote on the plan to create the
nation's seventh-largest bank with $191 billion in assets, branches
in 21 states, about 20 million customers and more than 90,000
employees. Norwest CEO Dick Kovacevich will head the new bank from
San Francisco and Hazen will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a change of corporate control, top executives are
commonly guaranteed salary and bonus for three years whether they
stay or leave. But chief executives of acquired companies
increasingly are getting five-year deals. In the Wells-Norwest
deal, Hazen also is the only Wells or Norwest executive to receive
new stock grants and options.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his so-called golden parachute package is not
particularly opulent. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer David
Coulter not only was granted the same five-year pay and bonus as
NationsBank CEO Hugh McColl, he was granted far more generous
retirement benefits. The 51-year-old CEO of BofA will receive 95
percent of his $5.24 million salary and bonus last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen's retirement package will provide just 25 percent of his
annual compensation with no spousal benefits. (Hazen is in the
process of getting a divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   Some observers question whether top executives should continue
to receive years of CEO pay for less responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns the principles of fair pay on its head,'' said
compensation critic Graef Crystal. ``Why should you get the same
pay for doing a lot less work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming chairman is like going from the helm of a sailing
ship to the carved figurehead on the bow; it's pretty but not very
functional.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Norwest have yet to disclose the specific
responsibilities of Hazen. Kovacevich says that it is best to work
out his and Hazen's duties after completing an analysis of the two
organizations and their best business practices, not before.
</P>
<P>
   In increasingly more mergers, companies are subsidizing the
extra tax liabilities of their top brass following a takeover. But
this probably will not be necessary in the Wells/Norwest deal
because it is not legally considered a takeover since Wells
shareholders will maintain control.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, if an executive's total compensation is more than
three times his average over the previous five years, the federal
government imposes a 20 percent excise tax on everything the
individual makes over his annual average. Companies also are not
allowed to deduct such compensation, or additional payments to
cover the taxes, as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells Fargo and Hazen should avoid these tax problems
because even though Wells is being acquired by Norwest, Wells
shareholders will retain 52 percent control of the combined
company.

 Hack Attack Shows Web's Vulnerability   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Computer hackers who invaded the New York Times' Web site and
turned it into their own political bulletin board on Sunday could
just as easily have cracked an e-commerce site and stolen personal
information, security experts said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group calling itself Hacking for Girlies posted nude photos
and obscenity-laced language in support of Kevin Mitnick, a hacker
convicted of computer-related fraud charges and imprisoned in Los
Angeles since 1995. It singled out Times reporter John Markoff, who
wrote ``Take-Down,'' a book detailing the search for Mitnick.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual takeover forced the Times to shut down its home page
for nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Web site _ no matter how secure _ can be hacked,'' said
Ira Winkler, a former National Security Agency expert and author on
Internet security. &UR;  &LR; ``Do I care the New York Times was hacked? No.
If this were Amazon.com and I was a customer, though, I would be
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-intruders apparently found a chink in the Times' computer
server to gain illegal entry to the Web site, sources said. The
Washington Post incorrectly reported that hackers bypassed the
paper's ``firewall,'' security software designed to block
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen declined to comment on how
hackers broke into the newspaper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times incident proves again that high-tech security is no
better than the alertness of the administrators overseeing it,''
said Donn Parker, author of ``Fighting Computer Crime'' and an
expert in computer security at SRI International, a Menlo Park
market research firm. ``You can have the best security tools
imaginable, but that does not excuse poor security of individual
computers and Web servers.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler added that the failure of network administrators to
frequently update their systems with security software patches
usually leads to break-ins. He said Sun Microsystems and Microsoft
typically post free monthly software fixes for their server
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attack could come as sobering news to
computer-security personnel at banks, corporations and the
government who are instituting technology to keep hackers off their
Web sites and their internal networks. Most employ firewalls and
encrypted code, which scrambles information. Some even turn to
hackers to safeguard their systems.
</P>
<P>
   But their best efforts aren't stopping an online assault by
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts estimate annual losses from computer crime
range from $55 million to more than $1 billion. Many U.S.
businesses don't report losses because they weren't aware of an
intrusion or out of fear of bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The alarming rise in electronic burglary comes just as
cyberspace is becoming a major artery for commerce. Time Warner,
for example, is among the latest corporations aggressively pursuing
a Web retail strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Financial transactions over the Internet could balloon to $37.5
billion this year, according to market researcher Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Times, it was propaganda _ not money _ that
motivated this weekend's hacker takeover of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's virtual diatribe is the second major hacker break-in in
support of Mitnick. In December, Mitnick sympathizers cracked
Yahoo's site and claimed to have planted a computer virus that
would cause widespread damage on Christmas Day if Mitnick was not
freed from jail. The threat turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's trial date has been set for January.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick is discouraging disruptive online protests in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Mitnick appreciates the support and good wishes of those
who speak out against his continued incarceration for years without
bail,'' Donald Randolph, Mitnick's attorney, said in a statement
yesterday. ``However, he does not encourage any individuals to
engage in hacking pranks on his behalf.''

 Now May Be Time for Small-Fry Investment Bankers to Shine   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It's a toss-up as to which will be the hottest topic at the
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities Conference in San Francisco this
week _ the companies that strut their financials to institutional
investors or the mergers that are redrawing the city's
investment-banking landscape.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of Monty's messy marriage to NationsBanc, and
Robertson Stephens' shotgun wedding to BancBoston, some of the
city's small-fry investment bankers think that it's the perfect
time to be niche bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shops that grew up on the (high-tech and biotech) niches
have now gotten absorbed into national banks that want them to do
everything from steel to cement,'' said Tom Volpe, founder of
Volpe, Brown, Whelan. ``They're not going to be able to focus on
high tech and biotech like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   As Volpe sees it, Monty and Robbie, with the blessings of their
new corporate parents, are trying to equal the top-rung
investment-banking firms like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs or
Lehman Brothers, who do deals in every industry, including
technology.
</P>
<P>
   As Monty and Robbie quit being tech specialists, Volpe said,
they open an opportunity for existing tech bankers, like VBW or the
Soundview Financial Group, to make a killing in tech IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking, replied Rex Sherry, a senior banker at
Montgomery. Although Nations wants Monty to add banking experts in
a host of new fields, it isn't gonna do something dumb, like ignore
the small tech startups that made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the reverse is true,'' Sherry said. ``The
Goldmans and the Morgans are chasing the same $20 million IPO as us
because everybody wants to find the next Oracle or Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hanson specializes in recruiting investment bankers for
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles in San Francisco. She agreed with Sherry that
it would be unlikely that the new and enlarged Monty or Robbie
would ignore tech startups.
</P>
<P>
   But she did lend credibility to the other half of Volpe's thesis
_ that the local investment-banking scene is about to see a
resurgence in new firms, the likes of which hasn't been seen since
the late '60s and early '70s, when Montgomery, Robertson Stephens
and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist made tech-banking a speciality.
</P>
<P>
   With some 30 local investment-banking firms and offices
employing 600 bankers, Hanson's instincts tell her that more than a
few bankers will get ambitious enough to hang out their own
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Economic alert: &LR;  An economic forecast from a Santa Monica
think tank warns that real income and job creation could stall in
the Bay Area next year, as the Asian crisis damages the region's
export-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report by economist Ross DeVol of the Milken Institute, a
research outfit founded by the former junk bond king, is the most
serious warning to date that Asia's woes could throw a monkey
wrench the region's high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   DeVol looked at a series of scenarios from the best-case _ a
quick recovery _ to worst-case _ a prolonged crisis that drags down
China, which so far has been Asia's bright spot. In the worst case,
job growth in San Francisco, which was above 3.7 percent in 1996
and 1997, slows to 1.3 percent this year and 0.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Demi-Web? &LR;  As Netscape and Microsoft vie for market share,
open standards have become &UR;  &LR; casualties of the browser wars, said
Glenn Davis, chief technologist at Project Cool, a Web-development
firm in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The people who build and run Web sites are fed up with creating
two versions of their content to deal with the idiosyncrasies of
browsers that do their own thing instead of following the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things continue like this,'' Davis said ominously, ``one
day people using one or the other browser to access the Web will
only be able to get to half of the content that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Madder than hell and not gonna take it anymore, some 150 Web
designers will meet tomorrow night at Cisco headquarters in San
Jose. The gathering, organized by the Association of Internet
Professionals, will hear Davis and two other speakers, Dan Shafer,
a Cnet editorial director, and Jeff Veen, a Web guru at Wired
Digital, explain how ordinary Websters can stand up to the browser
bullies. See  &LR; webguild.org &LR;  for details.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by phone
(650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail ( &LR; abate(at &LR;

 HP Device Captures Printed Text, But Can It Capture Market?   By Carolyn Said  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a handheld device this week that lets
users easily capture printed text _ from a newspaper, book,
magazine, letter or any paper source _ and print, fax or e-mail it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The HP CapShare 910, about the size and weight of a portable CD
player, holds up to 50 pages and is powered by two rechargeable AA
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   HP said the device is the most portable way yet to get hard copy
into digitized form so that you can send it. Unlike existing
handheld scanners, the CapShare doesn't have to be tethered to a
desktop or laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   HP hopes ``mobile professionals'' will find the device a
time-saver. For example, a business traveler could use the CapShare
to capture proposals or reports and send them back to the home
office, eliminating the hunt for a copier and fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   To use the $699 device, you swipe it across a page and it
automatically captures a picture of the text in bitmap format _
meaning that, like a fax, it can't be edited.
</P>
<P>
   You can use it on any size page; the CapShare has built-in logic
that detects your freehand swipes and stitches them together into
one cohesive page.
</P>
<P>
   A test unit supplied by HP was a bit clunkier to use than
advertised and had some problems stitching together text.
</P>
<P>
   Once you capture text, you can zoom in to read it. But you can't
fax or e-mail directly from the CapShare.
</P>
<P>
   To transfer scanned data, you press a button that sends an
infrared beam from the CapShare into an infrared port on a PC,
laptop, printer or ``smart'' phone. The CapShare eventually will
work with Windows CE devices, too, HP said.
</P>
<P>
   HP DeskJet printers and many others on the market now come
equipped with infrared ports, as do most new computers. If your PC
or printer doesn't have one, you can use a serial cable included
with the scanner to transfer the data.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can e-mail or fax it, or use an optical
character-reader program to turn it into text that can be edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this doesn't have its own integrated (faxing or
e-mail capability) is a big Achilles' heel,'' said Matthew Nordan,
an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He also dings the CapShare for its cost: It's likely to find an
audience only ``among people wealthy enough to pay that $699 price
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those stumbling blocks, Nordan said he thinks that the
CapShare is a harbinger of future, single-function devices. Most
portable devices, like the Palm Pilot or smart phones, provide an
array of text-entry, computing and communications functions
</P>
<P>
   CapShare ``is a corkscrew, not a Swiss army knife. It's designed
to do one thing really well, not a lot of things at once,'' Nordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HP started a special division in Greeley, Colo., to design a
new line of ``information appliances,'' which the CapShare kicks
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologically, there's nothing out there like this,'' said
Charles LeCompte, president of Lyra Research in Cambridge. Despite
the price, he added, `` I'm sure there are people out there who'll
think this is the cat's whiskers. There's certainly a market. The
big question is, `Is it big enough?' ''
</P>
<P>
   HP will begin taking orders for the CapShare on its Web site
beginning October 1 and will ship the device starting December 1.

 Straight-Arrow Cursors Turn Into Web Ads   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
No longer content with boring old arrows, some Web sites are paying
hefty fees for a new technology that turns their cursors into tiny
advertisements.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedy Central is the first to license the technology. After
downloading a plug-in, visitors to  &LR; www.comedycentral.com &LR;  find
their cursor turned into Ben Stein, Kenny from ``South Park'' or
other comedic personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications of the cursor-changing technology are more
blatantly commercial. On a financial site, for example, the cursor
could flash up-to-date ticker prices as it passes over company
names. Or it could show sales prices of compact disks at a music
site, or tidbits such as ``Grammy winner!''
</P>
<P>
   Comet Systems, the New York startup that invented the ``Comet
Cursor'' is charging $1,500 a month to license its software to a
single URL, or $3,000 for one company's use on multiple sites.
</P>
<P>
   That price tag is raising eyebrows in the advertising world,
where executives say they could rent seven or eight South of Market
billboards for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   ``$3,000 a month? To make the cursor into a Barbie's head? That
seems kind of high,'' said Andrew Hayman, executive vice president
of Publicis Technology in San Francisco. ``That seems ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   David Burk, president and chief executive of Walnut Creek Web
developer Clear Ink, can see the morphing cursor as a cool addition
to entertainment sites. But the fee is a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For entertainment value, it's a great thing, but I probably
wouldn't recommend it to my clients,'' Burk said. ``For $1,500 a
month, I could hire a crack programmer to do some pretty neat stuff
on a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Comet Systems, which spent $2.5 million
developing the technology, begs to differ. ``The cursor is the most
important piece of real estate on the screen because you can't move
without it,'' said Dean Margolis, chief executive of the Silicon
Alley venture.
</P>
<P>
   Banner ads, the standard form of Web advertising, easily can be
scrolled past or simply ignored, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central Vice President Larry Lieberman said he considers
$1,500 a good price for the software, though he admits that he got
a special deal.

   ``We've gotten hundreds of wildly favorable e-mails, and I think
800,000 downloads of the plug-in since we launched'' about three
weeks ago, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The morphing cursor allowed Comedy Central to add lots of images
to its home page while scaling down its size, which had made it
cumbersome for surfers to download, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many more applications for the changeable cursor now are under
development at Comedy Central, including messages such as ``On TV
tonight at 10!'' or ``This week's guest star, Gary Shandling!''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Comet Cursor says it already has signed up Mattel, AT&AMP;T
WorldNet, 1-800-FLOWERS and other Web marketers. But to convince
the doubters, the company has hired a market research firm to study
how the recall rates of Comet Cursors compare with banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect there will be much better recall rates,'' Margolis
said. ``If that's the case, then we've created value for the cursor
and advertisers are likely to be willing to pay for it.''

SUZUKI SHINES IN MARINER ROMP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Mariners might not have to put out an
all-points-bulletin this offseason to find another capable starter
in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki continues to make a strong pitch for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander showed plenty of poise while pitching out of a
first-inning jam Monday night at the Metrodome. He later allowed
two tainted runs but was rewarded with his first major league
victory. The 23-year-old pitched into the seventh inning for the
second time in his three big-league starts as the Mariners pounded
the Minnesota Twins, 10-3, before 9,711 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, recovered from a stomach ailment that kept him
out of two games in Kansas City, provided Seattle with the go-ahead
run in a five-run sixth inning. Martinez slugged his 27th homer of
the season, but the bottom third of the Mariners' lineup provided
most of Suzuki's support.
</P>
<P>
   --Seventh-place hitter Russ Davis went 3-for-5, including a
three-run homer in the fifth inning that broke open the series
opener.
</P>
<P>
   --Ryan Radmanovich, batting eighth, had two hits and drove in
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   --Shane Monahan, batting ninth, went 2-for-4 and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the big story is our young pitcher,'' said manager Lou
Piniella of Suzuki. ``A few of them (young pitchers) are pitching
for next spring and he has given us three quality starts.''
</P>
<P>
   This one had a different look.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous two starts, Suzuki took shutouts into the sixth
inning but wobbled when he reached the 90-pitch count. He threw 104
pitches Monday night and appeared to get stronger as the game
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   But not strong enough in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six innings is good, but I want to go seven or eight
every time and finish strong,'' he said. ``I've never pitched more
than 100 innings in my career and it seems as though when I get to
about 100 pitches, my arm feels good but my body feels tight and
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, 1-1 since being promoted from Class AAA Tacoma,
surrendered five hits, walked four and struck out eight. He almost
walked Chris Latham leading off the seventh, falling behind
3-and-0, but worked the count full before Latham flied to Ken
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   When Suzuki walked Alex Ochoa, pitching coach Stan Williams
pulled the starter and brought in Jose Paniagua. The right-hander
zipped through that inning and the eighth before Steve Gajkowski
finished up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about Suzuki and Paniagua is they have no
fear,'' Williams said. ``Mac had good command of all of his pitches
and showed me something in that first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had a run in and the bases loaded with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki met the challenge, retiring Todd Walker on a fly ball and
struck out Terry Steinbach.
</P>
<P>
   Radmanovich delivered a two-run double and Monahan followed with
a run-scoring single in the second inning to erase the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan also figured in Minnesota's get-even, two-run third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie left fielder sat in the visitors' dugout before the
game listening to teammates stressing the importance of watching
the flight of the ball from the moment it is hit.
</P>
<P>
   Many outfielders have lost sight of balls in the gray, teflon
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan did fine when he looked up. It's when he didn't look
down that caused an embarrassing pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   With a runner on first base and two outs, Walker laced a double
past a diving Davis at third base. As Monahan prepared to stoop for
the ball, his feet hit a puddle of water near the Twins' bullpen
and he landed on the seat of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he regained his feet, and composure, both David
Ortiz and Walker had scored. The official scorer credited Walker
with a double and Monahan with his first error.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella complained that Walker should have been credited with a
ground-rule double but didn't get his way and departed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even touch the ball,'' Monahan said. ``The ball hit
the heel of one of the pitchers out there. There was water and all
kinds of nasty stuff out there, like tobacco juice. I take a lot of
pride in my defense and to get an error ... ''

AMERICAN CULTURE LOWERS IMMIGRANTS' MENTAL STABILITY, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adapting to the American way of life can make
immigrants sick in the head, researchers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite low incomes and the strains of moving to a foreign
country, immigrants typically arrive in the United States
remarkably free of alcohol or drug problems, mood disorders and
other psychiatric ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study of 3,012 adults of Mexican origin living in
Fresno, Calif., found that the immigrants soon become just as
messed up as the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers speculate that immigrants gradually lose the support
of strong extended families and other cultural tonics against
mental distress. Although it's unclear just what the protective
aspects of life in Mexico may be, the study suggests that they
don't travel well across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``American culture has other priorities,'' said the study's lead
author, William Vega of the University of California at Berkeley's
School of Public Health. ``In this country, economic and social
mobility compete with family connections and cohesiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Findings were based mainly on lengthy face-to-face interviews,
conducted in either Spanish or English, with equal numbers of
U.S.-born Mexican Americans and Mexican-born immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents also were divided in equal numbers of urban,
suburban and rural residents. Fresno County was picked as the focus
of the study partly because of its high Mexican American and
immigrant populations and its range of urban-to-rural environments.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Monday in the American Medical
Association's Archives of General Psychiatry, debunks the
conventional wisdom that rapid ``Americanization'' brings surefire
psychological rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it now appears that retaining Mexican cultural
traditions _ including large close-knit families, low rates of
divorce and healthy nutritional habits compared with U.S.-born
Americans _ pay off in fewer mood and anxiety disorders and far
less misuse of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   A journal editorial that accompanied the study praised its
sophisticated research methods, which included elaborate diagnostic
tools and detailed cross-checking against psychiatric health
studies done in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies that appeared to show positive effects of
acculturation in American society ``may reflect biases inherent to
studies that were done long before diagnostic criteria and
structured instruments became available,'' according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The new study looked for 14 specific disorders, including
depression, phobias, substance-abuse disorders and anti-social
personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every case, the recently arrived Mexican immigrants
were diagnosed with about half as much of those troubles as people
of Mexican origins born in this country. The longer the immigrants
lived in the United States, the more their mental-health profile
came to match those of the native-born Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, just 24.9 percent of the immigrants had any of the
disorders the researchers were looking for, compared with a 48.1
percent prevalence rate among the U.S.-born study subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings strongly imply that genetic differences, if any,
are not a significant factor in explaining the higher rates of
mental illness in the United States compared with Mexico and other
immigrant ``donor'' countries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is about life in Mexico that protects one's mental
health, those protections ``wear away in less than a generation,''
said UC Berkeley's Ralph Catalano, one of the study authors.

MALONE TESTING WATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Malone's first day as Los Angeles Dodgers
general manager included a brief address to his new players and
meetings with manager Glenn Hoffman and former interim GM Tom
Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   The realization that the club is already committed to $53
million for 12 players next year, Malone said Monday, ``always
brings me back to Earth.'' He added that he also recognizes the
delicate nature of keeping Lasorda involved while charting his own
course.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's game with Colorado, Malone addressed the future
of the farm system and scouting departments, topics he touched on
repeatedly during Friday's introductory news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It probably was not a good sign for farm director Charlie Blaney
that he did not meet Malone until the news conference. Blaney is
known as an excellent administrator, but Malone said that in a
perfect world the farm director should also be a keen evaluator of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone should be worried, but it is a time for
self-evaluation,'' Malone said. ``They have to ask themselves, are
they the best scout, the best personnel person they can be? It's a
good time to evaluate who you are, where you're at, where you want
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who was promoted to senior vice president when Malone
was hired, has said he is available to help Malone during the
transition. Lasorda is probably the best talent-evaluator in the
organization, but most concede he needs to give Malone some room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tommy knows the situation. But he also has a lot of
value. His knowledge of the situation is invaluable,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Medicine man: Team orthopedist Frank Jobe was busy Monday. He
examined the tender right shoulder of pitcher Darren Dreifort, who
is not expected to pitch again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched more innings (180) than he ever has by a wide
margin,'' Jobe said. ``It looks like rest is the best thing for him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe also examined the sprained left ankle of right fielder Gary
Sheffield, who was lost for the season at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has been wearing a soft cast since the injury,
will be examined today by orthopedist Lewis Yocum. Sheffield will
have the cast removed and begin a rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to check to see if there were any fractures,'' Jobe
said. ``At the time, there was so much swelling, so an evaluation
could not be done. We're confident there isn't (a fracture), but we
want to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reliever Mark Guthrie, who has been sidelined the past
two weeks with a sprained ligament in his left elbow, will pitch
off a mound today for the first time since the injury, but the club
is uncertain when he'll be back. Guthrie is a free agent and might
want to return to action to prove he is sound to other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Bobby Bonilla went 3 for 3 to raise his average
against the Rockies to .371 (63 for 170). He also has a .483
on-base percentage in the last seven games, reaching base 14 times
in 29 plate appearances. He is 8 for 23 with a homer and six RBI
during that span, including 3 for 4 with runners in scoring
position.... Carlos Perez's third consecutive complete game was his
sixth of the year, ranking fifth in the NL. ``I'm not the type of
pitcher to pitch every fifth day for only 4-5 innings,'' he said.
``I want to pitch my game, and that is a complete game.''

HERITAGE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS HISPANIC PIONEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcie Gorman points to a slice of Arizona history. A modest
four-room adobe home built 106 years ago, where a pioneer laid down
roots, raised a family and tilled the land.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other frontiersmen, this one didn't make his way to
Arizona from eastern lands. He came through Mexico and represents a
fact many people don't realize: Hispanics were among Arizona's
first settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Latinos around the country begin celebrating their past,
the richness of their culture and their place in American history
as part of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs through
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   National Hispanic Heritage Month began as a week in 1968. But in
1989, a presidential proclamation expanded the observance into a
monthlong event to mark more than one-third of the major Hispanic
holidays that fall during this time.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Independence Day begins on the night of Sept. 15. The
Central American countries of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica celebrate Sept. 15 as the day they declared
their independence from Spain in 1821. Oct. 12, known in the United
States as Columbus Day, is El Dia de la Raza _ ``The Day of the
Race'' _ in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to be a descendant of a pioneer family,'' said
Gorman, 63, who is the granddaughter of Vicente Elias, a farm
laborer who built the dirt-floor adobe home one room at a time to
accommodate his growing family. ``But our history and contribution
to American society is just starting to be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tempe, Ariz., is restoring the home in its midst. City
officials are hoping it will eventually become a Hispanic heritage
museum and a memorial to the Mexican-American families who helped
settle the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``History in the Southwest began long before the non-indigenous
explorers came to this area,'' explains Lydia de la Vara, vice
president of the Tempe Hispanic Heritage International Corp. ``Too
often, people think that all Hispanics are new immigrants. That's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic influence can be traced to 1774, when Juan Bautista
de Anza led an expedition from the interior of Mexico to what is
now Arizona, said Santos Vega of Arizona State University's
Hispanic Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition ended in San Francisco, but many people decided
to make their fortune mining, farming and ranching in the Arizona
region, particularly in the area where Clifton and Morenci now
stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Vega says many people forget that southern Arizona
was part of Mexico until 1854, when the Gadsden Purchase granted
30,000 square miles of Mexican territory to the United States. When
the dust settled, Mexicans living in the region became Americans by
order of treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gloria Medina's family came to be Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny when people ask me when my family immigrated to
the United States,'' said Medina, a 59-year-old Phoenix homemaker.
``They don't understand that many of us have been here all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina says she came from a family of ranchers outside of
Tucson. Later, as the family grew, they moved to different parts of
the state. Some took jobs in the mines in Clifton. Others became
farm laborers. Her father took a job in construction in Phoenix and
moved the family to that area when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't all that unusual,'' explains Medina. ``But people
are always shocked and tell me, `You mean your family has been here
as long as we have?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at them and say: `Longer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's because of these early influences and continued immigration
that the Hispanic population continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, the Census Bureau reported an estimated 30.4
million Hispanics living in the United States, with 1 million
residing in Arizona. Hispanics are expected to overtake Blacks as
the nation's largest minority by 2010 and may account for almost 25
percent of the population by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Hormell, another descendant of an Arizona pioneer family,
marvels at the growth and success of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a small sleepy town. We were such a small part of
the community. Now we see Hispanics and their advancement and
growing,'' said Hormell, who is a 61-year-old bilingual speech
pathology assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Her paternal ancestors were cowboys and ranchers. Her maternal
relatives came to work the mines but later became farmers and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hormell said her maternal grandmother, Marina Ceballos
Soto, was among Arizona's first cotton farmers. When the government
passed out free cotton seeds, she stood in line to get some, even
though she didn't own any property.
</P>
<P>
   Renting some land, Hormell said, her grandmother planted the
seeds, grew the cotton and made enough money to buy her own land.
However, there wasn't enough money to build a house. The family
lived in a tent, then built a tin house and finally an adobe home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ahead of her time with a vision,'' said Hormell,
reflecting upon her heritage. ``Few Hispanic women had such
vision.'' &QL;

HERITAGE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS HISPANIC PIONEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Marcie Gorman points to a slice of Arizona history. A
modest four-room adobe home built 106 years ago, where a pioneer
laid down roots, raised a family and tilled the land.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other frontiersmen, this one didn't make his way to
Arizona from eastern lands. He came through Mexico and represents a
fact many people don't realize: Hispanics were among Arizona's
first settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Latinos around the country begin celebrating their past,
the richness of their culture and their place in American history
as part of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs through
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   National Hispanic Heritage Month began as a week in 1968. But in
1989, a presidential proclamation expanded the observance into a
monthlong event to mark more than one-third of the major Hispanic
holidays that fall during this time.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Independence Day begins on the night of Sept. 15. The
Central American countries of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica celebrate Sept. 15 as the day they declared
their independence from Spain in 1821. Oct. 12, known in the United
States as Columbus Day, is El Dia de la Raza _ ``The Day of the
Race'' _ in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to be a descendant of a pioneer family,'' said
Gorman, 63, who is the granddaughter of Vicente Elias, a farm
laborer who built the dirt-floor adobe home one room at a time to
accommodate his growing family. ``But our history and contribution
to American society is just starting to be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tempe, Ariz., is restoring the home in its midst. City
officials are hoping it will eventually become a Hispanic heritage
museum and a memorial to the Mexican-American families who helped
settle the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``History in the Southwest began long before the non-indigenous
explorers came to this area,'' explains Lydia de la Vara, vice
president of the Tempe Hispanic Heritage International Corp. ``Too
often, people think that all Hispanics are new immigrants. That's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic influence can be traced to 1774, when Juan Bautista
de Anza led an expedition from the interior of Mexico to what is
now Arizona, said Santos Vega of Arizona State University's
Hispanic Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition ended in San Francisco, but many people decided
to make their fortune mining, farming and ranching in the Arizona
region, particularly in the area where Clifton and Morenci now
stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Vega says many people forget that southern Arizona
was part of Mexico until 1854, when the Gadsden Purchase granted
30,000 square miles of Mexican territory to the United States. When
the dust settled, Mexicans living in the region became Americans by
order of treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gloria Medina's family came to be Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny when people ask me when my family immigrated to
the United States,'' said Medina, a 59-year-old Phoenix homemaker.
``They don't understand that many of us have been here all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina says she came from a family of ranchers outside of
Tucson. Later, as the family grew, they moved to different parts of
the state. Some took jobs in the mines in Clifton. Others became
farm laborers. Her father took a job in construction in Phoenix and
moved the family to that area when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't all that unusual,'' explains Medina. ``But people
are always shocked and tell me, `You mean your family has been here
as long as we have?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at them and say: `Longer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's because of these early influences and continued immigration
that the Hispanic population continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, the Census Bureau reported an estimated 30.4
million Hispanics living in the United States, with 1 million
residing in Arizona. Hispanics are expected to overtake Blacks as
the nation's largest minority by 2010 and may account for almost 25
percent of the population by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Hormell, another descendant of an Arizona pioneer family,
marvels at the growth and success of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a small sleepy town. We were such a small part of
the community. Now we see Hispanics and their advancement and
growing,'' said Hormell, who is a 61-year-old bilingual speech
pathology assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Her paternal ancestors were cowboys and ranchers. Her maternal
relatives came to work the mines but later became farmers and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hormell said her maternal grandmother, Marina Ceballos
Soto, was among Arizona's first cotton farmers. When the government
passed out free cotton seeds, she stood in line to get some, even
though she didn't own any property.
</P>
<P>
   Renting some land, Hormell said, her grandmother planted the
seeds, grew the cotton and made enough money to buy her own land.
However, there wasn't enough money to build a house. The family
lived in a tent, then built a tin house and finally an adobe home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ahead of her time with a vision,'' said Hormell,
reflecting upon her heritage. ``Few Hispanic women had such
vision.'' &QL;

RANGERS KEEP STUMBLING WITH FINISH LINE IN SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Fresh from an underwhelming weekend along Tampa Bay,
the Texas Rangers remained at large Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They are fugitives, running from a division title.
</P>
<P>
   At noisy, throat-tightening Oriole Park at Camden Yards Monday
night, the big out-of-town scoreboard in right field seemed to
taunt the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it,'' designated hitter Luis Alicea said. ``We saw that
they scored, what, four runs in the eighth? We knew it came down to
us winning.''
</P>
<P>
   What the scoreboard showed was that ``they,'' the first-place
Anaheim Angels, had come back from a gamelong deficit to defeat the
Devils Rays with four runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   You can check the box scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' Tim Salmon, run-scoring single. Jim Edmonds, RBI on
a sacrifice fly. Todd Greene, run-scoring double. Garret Anderson,
run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at Camden Yards:
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens, 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile, 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in red shoes, with runners in scoring position,
0-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a mad dash to the pennant, is it?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the 1-0 loss to the Orioles in the opener of a
two-game series was a brutally wrenching defeat. But no more
wrenching, you could argue, than the 3-2 loss in Tampa Bay last
Friday that launched this treadmill of a road trip.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, they all run together. The two defeats in
Chicago. The 12-8 stumble in Detroit. The two losses to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 31-31 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a mad dash to the pennant, is it?
</P>
<P>
   The manager says we are too pessimistic. He doesn't say it in a
mean or contentious way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt back in '96 that people back home just assumed we
weren't going to do it,'' manager Johnny Oates said before Monday
night's defeat. ``I thought we were over that, after we won that
year, but I feel like it's there again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just an observation, he says. Oates doesn't understand why
Rangers fans must eternally think the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation would take 26 years, the franchise's lifespan on
the turnpike. But in the meantime, let's simply take Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   You had your starting pitcher Aaron Sele come into run-friendly
Camden Yards and shut out the home team for nearly seven full
innings. Yet the effort was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Alicea said. ``(Juan) Guzman is the type
of guy you have to get before the fifth inning. You've got to get
him early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him on the ropes early, and we couldn't take advantage.
To lose a game 1-0 with the kind of offense we have is tough to
swallow _ especially in the position that we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   The position is second position. Second place. Second gear. The
Rangers are in dire need of some roadside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But on the pennant-race road, things happen. Your veteran first
baseman breaks a big toe. So the fill-in first baseman hacks at the
first pitch he sees in the sixth and leaves a runner stranded on
third base. Then, in the field, every critical ground ball seems to
come his rusty way.
</P>
<P>
   Should Stevens have stepped on the first base bag and tried to
double off the Orioles' pinch runner in the telltale eighth? Not
even shortstop Royce Clayton, who took the shaky throw, was sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty tough double play to turn,'' Clayton said.
``But if the throw is on the bag, yeah, we've got a decent shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, for the past two weeks at least, the Rangers
have been playing dependable defense. Plus, for 12 of their
previous 15 games, their starting pitchers have taken them into the
sixth inning with a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, alas, are 8-7 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   They are also 3-for-31 with men in scoring position over the
past four games _ even though they lead the American League in that
category for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like somebody to step up,'' Oates said after the 1-0
defeat. ``But then, you'd have liked to have pitched better in
Florida on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just pick your story.''
</P>
<P>
   On the out-of-town scoreboard, bad news from Tampa Bay stared
the Rangers in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when any clutch hit would do, the Rangers themselves
remained missing. They fell to 1-3 on this treadmill of a road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a mad dash to a pennant, is it?

BRONCOS' DAVIS CONTINUES PROVING TALENT SCOUTS WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was an afterthought in the 1995 NFL draft, a guy none of the
talent evaluators thought belonged in the same class with Napoleon
Kaufman and Sherman Williams and Curtis Martin and Travis Jervey.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it had to do with how rarely he was used at Georgia. Or
maybe it had to do with how he came to big-time college football,
as a San Diego native who landed at Long Beach State, a college
that had given up on football and was destined to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the NFL was scared of a running back who came from a
background of poverty, crime, drugs and prison.
</P>
<P>
   One brother, Bobby, did prison time after his attempted robbery
resulted in him shooting a pregnant woman, killing the fetus. His
late father, Joe, did four prison stints on robbery and weapons
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to living with Pops, my brothers and I saw guns
so often it became as routine as seeing the ice cream truck,''
asserts the running back, who recalls a story of his father's idea
of discipline. ``He pulled each of his four boys out of bed, lined
us up against the wall, pulled out his .38 special with black
electrical tape around the grip and just started shooting right in
our direction. He wasn't shooting at our heads but right above
them. Putting holes in the damn bedroom wall. Not one of us jumped
or moved or ran under the bed to hide and start crying. We knew
Pops wasn't going to kill us, not his four youngest boys. He wasn't
trying to. He was shooting at us, which was crazy, but we knew Pops
was a good shot _ an excellent shot. All he was doing was
toughening up his boys, making it so that nothing would ever scare
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The running back's well-chronicled problems with migraine
headaches are probably a result of his childhood, experts say. And
maybe predictably, his childhood contributed to the running back
spending time in jail, too, for grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   All that is reason enough for NFL teams to have been scared off,
to lean toward guys like Kaufman (first round, Oakland), Williams
(second round, Cowboys), Martin (third round, Patriots) and Jervey
(fifth round, Packers). NFL teams were and are frightened of the
notorious, worried about behavioral problems, petrified not only at
the thought of getting 4 a.m. phone calls from the police, but of
having to explain the details of the phone calls to the public the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the Denver Broncos weren't more brave than the rest.
Maybe they were just lucky, lucky that Kaufman and Williams and
Martin and Jervey were gone, lucky that circumstances allowed them
to take a sixth-round flyer on a guy who would rush for more than
1,000 in each of his first three NFL seasons, who would win Super
Bowl MVP, who would be recognized as one of the top two runners in
the sport, a guy who would deserve to be rewarded with a nine-year,
$56.1 million contract, a guy who now works tirelessly with young
people to prevent them from following his early-life example.
</P>
<P>
   Brave? Lucky? Smart? You decide. The Broncos don't care. They've
got Terrell Davis. ALMOST PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs must now aspire to go 15-1 after Derrick Thomas and
others foolishly talked of going undefeated in the days leading up
to Sunday's loss to Jacksonville. TRIVIAL PURSUIT
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, when Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs, the New York Giants
finished first in the NFL. The Green Bay Packers finished second.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, when Roger Maris hit 61 home runs, the Packers beat the
Giants for the NFL title.
</P>
<P>
   There. Two historical reasons to believe the NFC Championship
Game will feature the Giants against the Packers. QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   At 2-0, maybe the Saints have something to be cocksure about.
Let's go to linebacker Brian Jones, an aspiring actor and model,
inspired by the short-lived Magic Johnson TV show. ``After watching
Magic's show,'' Jones says, ``any doubts I might have had about my
abilities are gone.'' CHECK OUT ...
</P>
<P>
   The rumor from San Francisco that says Bill Walsh's decision not
to re-join the 49ers organization was not Walsh's decision at all,
but instead was the result of owner Eddie DeBartolo failing to
return Walsh phone calls. Look for Walsh to now turn his attention
to involvement with an eventual Southern California expansion
franchise. THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   You take your good Bears news where you can get it: They're 0-2,
but they've lost two close games to Super Bowl aspirants
Jacksonville and Pittsburgh, and all of Chicago's draft picks made
the team, and four start. ... San Diego has replaced special-teams
coach Frank Novak (an assistant to head coach Kevin Gilbride) with
Wayne Sevier (a longtime crony of GM Bobby Beathard), and you
thought Jerry Jones was the only GM who picked assistants. ... NFC
East followers can't make fun of the NFC West for now. The division
includes the 49ers and, in the Saints and Falcons, two 2-0 teams.
... The difference between the monthlong injury losses of QBs Troy
Aikman in Dallas and Brad Johnson in Minnesota? Dallas' No. 2,
Jason Garrett, is an extremely valuable member of the club from
Mondays to Saturdays. But on Sundays, Randall Cunningham is the
best backup in the NFL.

RANGERS BOTCH CHANCE, LOSE TO ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Perhaps Texas Rangers first baseman Lee Stevens made
the correct decision.
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed Monday night's events from Oriole Park at
Camden Yards never will know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, though, acknowledged that his poor throw on an
eighth-inning, double-play ground ball led to the game's only run
and the Rangers' third loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Eric Davis, whom Orioles manager Ray Miller utilized
as an eighth-inning pinch hitter, parlayed that extra out into what
proved to be the game-winning, sacrifice fly ball that scored left
fielder B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers frittered a gutsy performance from
right-hander Aaron Sele _ who pitched 62/3 scoreless innings _ and
fell two games behind the American League West-leading Angels.
Anaheim defeated the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 4-2, Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a lousy throw,'' a disgusted Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Xavier Hernandez (6-6) induced a ground ball from
Surhoff with Eugene Kingsale at first base. Kingsale, who possesses
good speed, replaced third baseman Cal Ripken Jr. as a pinch runner
after Ripken's leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens fielded the well-hit ball perhaps as close as a step
from first base, but he chose to try for a 3-6-3 double play
instead of retiring Surhoff at first before attempting his throw to
shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get the fastest runner off the bases,''
Stevens said. ``It's a double play if I make a good throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The throw, though, pulled Clayton toward right field. Clayton
managed to keep his right foot on the bag to retire Kingsale, but
the throw forced him face-first into the infield dirt without the
possibility of a return throw.
</P>
<P>
   Did Stevens, who is playing in place of the injured Will Clark,
make the correct decision to throw to second base before retiring
Surhoff at first?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He may
not have a chance at the runner at second if he touches the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Lenny Webster then delivered a one-out single to center
field, and Surhoff _ running with the pitch _ advanced to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rusty,'' said Stevens, despite accumulating 27 innings at
the position in the past eight days. ``I'm just rusty. I haven't
been over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who surrendered six hits, kept the Orioles scoreless
despite six walks. The Orioles do not present a favorable matchup
for Sele, and the right-hander issued one intentional walk, then
two unintentional-intentional walks to left-handed hitters Brady
Anderson and Harold Bailes in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Oates summoned left-hander Greg Cadaret to retire first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro for the final out of the seventh inning with the
bases loaded, and the game remained scoreless. Orioles right-hander
Juan Guzman matched Sele, as the Rangers went 0-for-7 with runners
in scoring position. No at-bat, though, stung as much as the one
during the sixth inning by Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez led off the inning with a double and
advanced 90 feet on a ground ball by catcher Ivan Rodriguez. The
Orioles played their infield in, and Gonzalez could not score on
Stevens' one-out ground ball to second baseman Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went 0-for-12 during their final 12 plate
appearances with the final six coming against right-handers Alan
Mills and Armando Benitez, who retired the side on strikes during
the ninth inning for his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's appearance represented the rotation's 12th quality start
in the past 15 games, yet the Rangers won only eight of those
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said we'll win if we pitch well,'' Oates said. ``Is that
the kiss of death?''

CLINTON SCANDAL A HOT TOPIC IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RACE  
 BY CARLA MARINUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
   and LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton's personal sex scandal quickly
became the hottest topic in the California governor's race Monday
as both sides wrestled to take control of the issue and turn it to
their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gubernatorial nominee Gray Davis told an enthusiastic
San Francisco gathering of 500 women that the president deserves
punishment for personal conduct he called ``embarrassing and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that his GOP challenger, state Attorney General
Dan Lungren, was heading down ``a tricky path'' by trying to give
it center stage, because Californians are still grateful for
Clinton's public agenda on health care, the environment and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren _ who started running ``character counts'' ads earlier
this month _ took time out from a Washington fund-raising tour to
slam Davis for not speaking out sooner about Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few people who have stood as strongly beside the
president as he has,'' Lungren said of Davis. ``It's not leadership
to wait until the parade has passed by and then run to try and
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   With seven weeks to go before the Nov. election, the frenzied
back-and-forth on the character issue underscored how quickly
Clinton's current troubles have taken center stage in California _
3,000 miles from the Lewinsky hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But a new poll released yesterday by the Public Policy Institute
of California showed that state voters are more interested in
policy than in either of the candidate's character or experience.
That poll, a survey of 1,616 registered voters conducted statewide
during the first week of September, also found Davis leading
Lungren by 9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters seem to be saying, `Don't brag about your sterling
character, just tell me what you plan to do,' '' pollster Mark
Baldassare said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who only last month raised a record $3.6 million with
Clinton at his side, said he would welcome the president again. He
argued Monday that Republicans like Lungren will be on slippery
ground if they attempt to run against Clinton's character issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's private and there's public character,'' he said.
``(Lungren) voted against school lunches, . . . against the clean
water act, the safe drinking water act. People want to know how you
behave in your public conduct. That's what they hire us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis chose Monday to release a sobering ad reminding California
voters _ who remain strongly in favor of abortion rights _ that ``I
am pro-choice. My opponent is not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Lungren) wants to make this about character, we'll make it
about character,'' said Davis' campaign manager Garry South. ``What
kind of character does it imply that a male politician _ who can't
get pregnant last time I checked _ voted time after time after time
to deny even innocent victims of rape and incest the right to an
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's campaign manager Dave Puglia fired back with a
blistering statement charging that Davis is misrepresenting the GOP
candidate's position ``as the Clinton scandal threatens to
overwhelm (his) candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Davis wants to discuss this issue, he is going to have to
explain to the people of California why he thinks that a teenage
girl who must get her parent's permission to use a tanning salon
should be able to get an abortion without them ever knowing about
it,'' Puglia said.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how aggressive the GOP may continue to be on the
character issue, Davis competed for press attention at his San
Francisco appearance with GOP strategist Dan Schnur, who took
reporters aside to argue that ``character has emerged as the single
greatest issue'' in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur, in a strategy sure to be repeated throughout the
campaign, said Davis' recent fund-raising appearances with the
president raise clear questions about ``Gray Davis and the company
he keeps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Character is not just about summer interns,'' said Schnur,
asked how Davis' character relates to the California campaign.
``Character is about being able to stand up to the trial lawyers
and labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Democratic loyalists in the crowd said that the
use of Bill Clinton as a campaign issue was ``a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's private character is not a Democratic Party
issue,'' said an angry San Francisco Supervisor Leslie Katz. ``We
don't hold the whole GOP responsible for (House Speaker) Newt
Gingrich serving his cancer-stricken wife with divorce papers on
her death bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jane Harman, the Democratic representative who opposed
Davis in the June primary, said that raising the character issue is
``legitimate for anyone'' in a political race. But Lungren's
attempts will not have traction, she said, because ``both people
running in this race have character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's personal problems have nothing to do with Gray
Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who raised $100,000 in his hourlong stop in San
Francisco, praised Clinton's performance on such issues as
education, the economy and the environment. But, ``his private
conduct is embarrassing, indefensible and should be punished,''
Davis said. ``That punishment will be determined by the House of
Representatives after all the facts are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that he wrapped up a major fund-raising tour with
Clinton last month, and did not expect to be given more time with
the president before the election. But asked if he would shy away
from appearing with Clinton in the future, he said, ``Listen, if
he's out to help other people, or for the party, and my schedule
permits, I'll be there.''

punishment for personal conduct he called ``embarrassing and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that his GOP challenger, state Attorney General
Dan Lungren, was heading down ``a tricky path'' by trying to give
it center stage, because Californians are still grateful for
Clinton's public agenda on health care, the environment and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren _ who started running ``character counts'' ads earlier
this month _ took time out from a Washington fund-raising tour to
slam Davis for not speaking out sooner about Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few people who have stood as strongly beside the
president as he has,'' Lungren said of Davis. ``It's not leadership
to wait until the parade has passed by and then run to try and
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   With seven weeks to go before the Nov. election, the frenzied
back-and-forth on the character issue underscored how quickly
Clinton's current troubles have taken center stage in California _
3,000 miles from the Lewinsky hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But a new poll released Monday by the Public Policy Institute of
California showed that state voters are more interested in policy
than in either of the candidate's character or experience. That
poll, a survey of 1,616 registered voters conducted statewide
during the first week of September, also found Davis leading
Lungren by 9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters seem to be saying, `Don't brag about your sterling
character, just tell me what you plan to do,' '' pollster Mark
Baldassare said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who only last month raised a record $3.6 million with
Clinton at his side, said he would welcome the president again. He
argued Monday that Republicans like Lungren will be on slippery
ground if they attempt to run against Clinton's character issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's private and there's public character,'' he said.
``(Lungren) voted against school lunches, . . . against the clean
water act, the safe drinking water act. People want to know how you
behave in your public conduct. That's what they hire us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis chose Monday to release a sobering ad reminding California
voters _ who remain strongly in favor of abortion rights _ that ``I
am pro-choice. My opponent is not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Lungren) wants to make this about character, we'll make it
about character,'' said Davis' campaign manager Garry South. ``What
kind of character does it imply that a male politician _ who can't
get pregnant last time I checked _ voted time after time after time
to deny even innocent victims of rape and incest the right to an
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's campaign manager Dave Puglia fired back with a
blistering statement charging that Davis is misrepresenting the GOP
candidate's position ``as the Clinton scandal threatens to
overwhelm (his) candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Davis wants to discuss this issue, he is going to have to
explain to the people of California why he thinks that a teenage
girl who must get her parent's permission to use a tanning salon
should be able to get an abortion without them ever knowing about
it,'' Puglia said.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how aggressive the GOP may continue to be on the
character issue, Davis competed for press attention at his San
Francisco appearance with GOP strategist Dan Schnur, who took
reporters aside to argue that ``character has emerged as the single
greatest issue'' in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur, in a strategy sure to be repeated throughout the
campaign, said Davis' recent fund-raising appearances with the
president raise clear questions about ``Gray Davis and the company
he keeps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Character is not just about summer interns,'' said Schnur,
asked how Davis' character relates to the California campaign.
``Character is about being able to stand up to the trial lawyers
and labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Democratic loyalists in the crowd said that the
use of Bill Clinton as a campaign issue was ``a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's private character is not a Democratic Party
issue,'' said an angry San Francisco Supervisor Leslie Katz. ``We
don't hold the whole GOP responsible for (House Speaker) Newt
Gingrich serving his cancer-stricken wife with divorce papers on
her death bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jane Harman, the Democratic representative who opposed
Davis in the June primary, said that raising the character issue is
``legitimate for anyone'' in a political race. But Lungren's
attempts will not have traction, she said, because ``both people
running in this race have character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's personal problems have nothing to do with Gray
Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who raised $100,000 in his hourlong stop in San
Francisco, praised Clinton's performance on such issues as
education, the economy and the environment. But, ``his private
conduct is embarrassing, indefensible and should be punished,''
Davis said. ``That punishment will be determined by the House of
Representatives after all the facts are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that he wrapped up a major fund-raising tour with
Clinton last month, and did not expect to be given more time with
the president before the election. But asked if he would shy away
from appearing with Clinton in the future, he said, ``Listen, if
he's out to help other people, or for the party, and my schedule
permits, I'll be there.''

 &HT;    'Fifth Avenue' gives fascinating view of the city
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Patterson's ``Fifth Avenue: The Best Address'' (Rizzoli,
$29.95) is for all those who loved ``Time After Time'' or ``The
Alienist.'' Although it's well-written, the glory of the book is
its photographs _ of long-gone mansions and their overstuffed
Edwardian interiors, complete with potted palms; of the art
collections cramming every inch of the galleries, of the Astor
house, of the newly constructed Flatiron building.
</P>
<P>
   And the people; black-clad nannies pushing trams across the
street, two schoolgirls riding bicycles down a Fifth Avenue without
cars; the Washington Square arch outlined and illuminated by white
lights in 1909; the heavy Italianate lobby of the old
Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for anyone who is romantic about New York.

   BOOK TV A WELCOME ADDITION ON WEEKENDS
</P>
<P>
   This weekend marks the beginning of Book TV, which is what
C-Span 2 is calling itself every weekend. Basically, Brian Lamb is
turning over all of the channel's broadcasting time to serious
discussions of serious books, predominantly nonfiction. There will
be call-in shows, interviews with authors and editors, etc.
</P>
<P>
   There have been discussions about establishing cable channels
devoted to books, some enlisting the names of prestigious writers
like E.L. Doctorow as bona fides, but they've always foundered over
the problem of advertising support.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lamb deserves our gratitude, as well as our time.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sundays offer peace; but the rest is up to us
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Sunday mornings are peaceful in our village.
The bells at the Catholic church down the street toll their gentle
reminder; it's six o'clock. The rest is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   Just before daylight, the paper boy thumps a Sunday edition onto
my front porch. The weather's still warm enough for me to take my
first cup of decaf outside to read it. Automatically, I flip to the
comics and my favorite Viking, ``Hagar the Horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a little while, the bells over at the Lutheran church begin
chiming hymns - this morning it's ``Onward Christian Soldiers'' and
``Flow Gently Sweet Afton'' - I think. A gaggle of cute kids,
scrubbed and dressed to the nines, walks in the direction of the
music. Time for Sunday School.
</P>
<P>
   The minister across the street heads for his pulpit carrying a
briefcase so commodious I suspect him of packing a lunch.
</P>
<P>
   A few white-haired couples holding hands walk by and wave. Some
are walking off bypass surgery; for others their daily strolls are
preventive maintenance. A few cling to the old habits and head to
the bakery for a bag of donuts or cream sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels are racing up and down the trees in front of my house
and scampering noisily across the porch roof. Upstairs in an open
window, my cats are giving them what for. That brings to mind the
raccoon who's been trying to lease my house for the winter and I
wonder if Roger from the hardware store has been there yet to
screen the chimney. As cute as the little varmints are, I don't
relish coming home from school one day to meet up with one in my
living room.
</P>
<P>
   There's no wreath on the funeral home door across the street;
that means nobody has died in the night. It's reassuring because a
couple of my friends have parents in precarious health. That's kind
of always on my mind when I glance over there.
</P>
<P>
   A migrant family passes by, probably on their way to mass at St.
Michael's. Maybe one of their kids is in my English class. Good
kids. Tough life.
</P>
<P>
   In somebody's kitchen nearby, pans are rattling and I'm thinking
what a happy sound that is. Does it get much better than lying in
bed, smelling the coffee and bacon, and listening as the silverware
settles onto the table top?
</P>
<P>
   Somebody has left a bag of tomatoes and zucchini from a backyard
garden in the basket beside my front door. It's the last of the
crop. I don't know who to thank - I may never know, but that
doesn't matter. A friend just wanted to share.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks in our village would describe themselves as
Christians - some practicing and some, as they called it in the
church of my youth, backsliding. We don't steal from one another
and for the most part we get along. Like my neighbor and I who
share a flower bed and water each other's plants when one or the
other is out of town. On Tuesdays he always brings my empty garbage
can in from the curb and I appreciate it every time.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a couple of rich folks in town, but we don't know
about it. Most of us are getting by and feel pretty lucky to have a
bank account and own a little property. I don't know anybody who
was sweating the Dow dip.
</P>
<P>
   More than big city folks can imagine, life is still pretty good
in small villages like ours. It's simple and straightforward and we
like it that way. We've chosen our laid-back lifestyle. We don't
like being messed with unless it's crucial.
</P>
<P>
   And the Starr Report that has just flopped out of my morning
paper is, in my opinion, not crucial. It is however, salacious and
long, but not enough of either to warrant the millions of
taxpayers' dollars this political evangelist has blown on getting
down to the nitty gritty of our president's sex-life.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? The country was still running, and from what I can
tell, running rather well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public has the right to know,'' is the
sanctimonious cry of the political talking heads who are enjoying
the hell out of this garbage that is now passing for not only news,
but grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is not my game and I am not a card-carrying member of
any party. I am, however, a voter, a taxpayer, and an American. I
am not a fool. The Starr Report is not for the good of our country.
There's little need to speculate on who wins in this one.
</P>
<P>
   No one.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Buckeyes expected victories
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ohio State's opening game at then-No. 11 West
Virginia was considered by players and coaches alike as the
Buckeyes first true test of their No. 1 worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a victory there and another last week vs. Toledo,
OSU cornerback Ahmed Plummer isn't all that impressed with the
Buckeyes so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't done anything spectacular as far as beating
a big, big team,'' he said with a shrug. ``(West Virginia) is a
good team but we know we're going to face better teams _ and
Missouri is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, No. 21 in the Associated Press poll, comes to Columbus
to face an Ohio State team that, at least outwardly, doesn't seem
all that smitten with its opening victories against West Virginia
(34-17) and Toledo (49-0). Don't get them wrong: They're pleased
they won, but hey, that's what they expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more of an attitude this year,'' running back Joe
Montgomery said. ``Last year, we didn't have that go-get-'em
attitude. I think sometimes when we'd get down, everybody was
hanging their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Dee Miller of Springfield agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were confident but there were some times when
things weren't going our way and people just let up,'' Miller said.
``This year, we have a lot more to lose. So we're not cocky, we're
just confident. We're ready to just keep defending this No. 1
ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes say they're determined not to let what happened to
last week's No. 2, Florida State _ 24-7 losers to 25-point underdog
North Carolina State on Saturday _ happen to them. ``We don't worry
about being upset,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Buckeyes don't appear to have too many worries
right now. They're healthy, hungry and for the most part, humble.
</P>
<P>
   Some players attribute their confident but cautious attitude to
letdowns they've experienced in the past. Too many times, they say,
this senior class has had a legitimate shot at No. 1 only to see it
washed away in the wake of a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my fifth year here and maybe two or three years, we
were a game or two away from being national champions,'' Miller
said. ``(The seniors) don't want to feel like that our last year
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some already may have felt a twinge of pain when they've looked
at the polls and they have seen how other top teams have fallen.
But many say they try not to get too caught up in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't pay attention to the polls,''
strong safety Damon Moore said. ``But it really doesn't mean
nothing. You don't hear guys talking about it in the weight room or
walking around saying, 'It feels great to be No. 1.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a challenge in front of us and we have to go out every
day and try to improve and get better and try to meet that
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the challenge is the Tigers, a top 25 team that
employs a dangerous option offense run by quarterback Corby Jones.
The Buckeyes simply say: Bring him on.

 &HT;    O'Donnell ``fought'' for victory
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ Every time they step on the field, the
Bengals learn something new about quarterback Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he commands attention in the huddle. Sure, he can
throw the deep ball. Yes, he's one tough customer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell played a nearly flawless game in the Bengals' 34-28
overtime victory over the Detroit Lions on Sept.13, completing 25
of 36 passes for 303 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   His scoring strikes of 70 and 36 yards to Darnay Scott were
impressive. So was his toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Taking more shots than a prize fighter in a Caesars Palace
boxing ring, O'Donnell hung tough in the pocket and, despite three
sacks, spread the ball to eight receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a competitor,'' center Darrick Brilz said. ``A
lot of guys would have probably gone down. But he didn't. He kept
coming back. He fought. I know we can count on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Willie Anderson said there were times he drove
Detroit's stunting end, Robert Porcher, to the inside. O'Donnell
read the moves, stayed poised and managed to escape without panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most quarterbacks would get rattled and throw the ball away,''
Anderson said. ``But he had the patience and the durability to stay
in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear coaches and commentators talk about how the great
quarterbacks are the ones who can stand in the fire like that and
take the licks. He showed a lot of courage under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating only his fourth 300-yard passing game in the
last three seasons, O'Donnell expressed confidence in head coach
Bruce Coslet's sophisticated offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I play in this system, the more comfortable I am,''
O'Donnell said. ``I'm starting to get a feel for the receivers. Big
plays are what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet is impressed with that kind of talk from a guy who has
undergone a crash-course in learning the offense since he was
signed July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy that's only been in this offense for two months,
he's still got a long ways to go, but his experience shows,''
Coslet said. ``He is poised. He stood in there tough. He got hit.
He did some good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to continue that, which I know he will because that's
his style _ the style we signed him for as a free agent. We knew he
was a tough guy and accurate. We just have to keep bringing him up
to speed on how we run our offense ... all the things he'll learn
as he gets more comfortable with what we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very aware during the game. He knows exactly what's going
on around him. He gives us a lot of good information on the
sidelines between series.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet ripped the offensive line for a poor performance against
the Lions, but O'Donnell wouldn't go that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the guys in front of me,'' he said. ``They're fighters.
I'll be all right. I'll stand behind them. I have no complaints.
I'm a tough guy.''

 &HT;    Wooden out for season
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Miami Dolphins safety Shawn Wooden joined
teammates Yatil Green and Larry Shannon: He underwent knee surgery
that will keep him sidelined for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden, the Dolphins' starter at strong safety, had arthroscopic
surgery on his left knee to repair damage to the anterior cruciate
and medial collateral ligaments sustained Sunday on the opening
kickoff of the 13-7 victory against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson
said. ``Shawn had done a great job against Indianapolis (in the
season opener). He was really doing a good job as far as putting us
in the right coverages. We're disappointed that we're not going to
have him this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss means that if Calvin Jackson isn't hampered too much by
a groin strain, he will get the starting job that he battled Wooden
for during the pre-season. The Dolphins also will rely more heavily
on Brian Walker. They also could re-sign Bracey Walker, a four-year
veteran cut Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins plan to work out about six defensive backs today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a look at making a few changes, but (the players
already on the team) are going to be the key players,'' Johnson
said. ``The biggest thing is that Calvin Jackson has got to get
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino and McGwire: The Dan Marino household includes a piece of
Mark McGwire memorabilia. In July, Marino gave his son, Joey, a bat
signed by McGwire for his ninth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to get him, then I realized that he was a
big Mark McGwire fan,'' Marino said. ``So I tracked Mark down in
San Francisco and got him to sign a bat for Joey. Mark (shipped)
the bat to me and Joey was so excited. . . . Watching Joey get so
excited when he got that bat was a special thrill for me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino and his family watched McGwire break Roger Maris' home
run record last Tuesday night. He had a good excuse for missing
Sammy Sosa catching McGwire at 62 on Sunday: He was playing against
the Bills at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Dolphins released some comments from Marino, who
holds the NFL single-season record for touchdowns with 48 in 1984,
about McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I appreciate most is how he's handled the whole
thing, and the way he's conducted himself with all the attention
he's gotten,'' Marino said. ``The way he's so gracious dealing with
the press and the public just shows that he's a class act, and
people should appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled employee update: Receiver Charles Jordan says he is
over the frustration of losing his starting job to Oronde Gadsden,
but now tight end Troy Drayton is the one frustrated by a lack of
balls being thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to play within the offense,'' said Drayton, who
has caught one pass for 9 yards in two games. ``What can you do?
Nothing. I can't do anything about it. I can do what they ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan fumed most of last week. But Monday, although he still
was behind Gadsden on the depth chart, he said: ``That matter is
put behind us and we're looking toward going forward. Honestly,
it's all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson greeted talk of unhappy players with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if everybody caught a lot of balls,
everybody had a lot of runs, and everybody had a lot of playing
time, but, hey, we're going to do whatever need to do to win
games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while Ed Perry has caught six passes for 35
yards, Drayton remains the Dolphins' No. 1 tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're only completing 14 passes a game and you've got
five or six guys, some guys are not going to get a lot of them,''
he said. ``The other thing is that Ed Perry has come on to be a
pretty good receiver for us. I don't know that I can guarantee
anything, but I think there are going to be games where Troy is
going to catch a lot of passes. But that's not our priority. Our
priority is to win games.''

 &HT;    Niedermayer keeps his head while all around inquire
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Everywhere Rob Niedermayer goes nowadays, people
have the same question: How's the head?
</P>
<P>
   When Toronto Maple Leafs Assistant General Manager Mike Smith
finally opted not to make the trade that would have sent Felix
Potvin to Florida for Niedermayer and Rhett Warrener, he cited
concerns over the head injuries Niedermayer incurred last season.
</P>
<P>
   First-year Florida coach Terry Murray had no such worries after
watching Niedermayer score a goal in the Panthers' first
training-camp scrimmage at National Car Rental Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paying any attention to the problems he had last
year,'' Murray said. ``It's just an injury. It's over with. It's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray phoned Niedermayer at his off-season home near Cranbrook,
British Columbia, in mid-August and got caught up on his recent
history. Niedermayer told him he had been headache-free for almost
two months and team doctors had told him that if he took certain
precautions, chances of a recurrence would be small.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and trainer Dave Smith have Niedermayer wearing the
safest helmet on the market with a broader, more secure chinstrap
as well as a face shield and mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   But Niedermayer knows he'll be a target when opponents choose to
learn for themselves if he's really 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like being a rookie in this league; I'll be tested a
bit,'' he said. ``That's fine. I got that the first time I got back
from a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the confidence in the gear I'm wearing, the head's
feeling fine, so I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's confidence got a boost last week when he underwent
rigorous stress testing with no complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really pushed it in some of the tests, like on the
(stationary) bike, going to extremes, and everything is fine,'' he
said. ``So it's very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was encouraged by what he saw Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good day,'' he said. ``He had some contact, handled
the puck well, came through the mid-zone with good speed and
attacked into the offensive zone to make a play at the net. That's
the kind of play you want from him. It states very clearly that
he's back.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Murray had Niedermayer centering a line with
Scott Mellanby and Johan Garpenlov on his wings, the Panthers' No.
1 line from two years ago that, because of injuries, was rarely
seen last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for him to get his confidence going again,''
Murray said, ``and that's why I put him where I did _ to have some
automatic read off guys he's played with in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer missed 49 games last season because of injuries that
included three concussions, a dislocated thumb, arthroscopic knee
surgery and post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our team,'' Mellanby said. ``He's a kind of
player who, even if he's not scoring, if he can be healthy and play
70-75 games, that's 75 nights (opponents) have to contend with a
guy who's 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds, with speed, who can create some
offense and is strong in his own end.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Murray said Garpenlov, who also assisted on a
Mellanby goal, was the best forward in the scrimmage, while GM
Bryan Murray said rookie Jaroslav Spacek was the best defenseman. .
. . Sean Burke allowed a soft shot by rookie Dave Duerden through
his legs. . . . Bill Lindsay got into what he said was his first
training camp fight as a Panther, decisioning rookie Curtis Doell.
In a heavyweight bout, John Jakopin took care of youngster Mike
Brown.

   COMMENTARY: Diarist's death leaves less life on paper
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward Robb Ellis, diarist,'' the headline read.
</P>
<P>
   By custom, obituary headlines are a name, sometimes an age and
in better ones, a label. No verb, since ``dies'' is always
understood. Its repetition would depress readers and vex headline
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The labels in obituaries tend to be job titles. Seeing
``Diarist'' in such a headline last week was a novelty. It's not a
job, a club or a government appointment. It's a self-imposed
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, it turns out, kept a diary since 1927. He filed away 22
million words. Like the reporter he was for 35 years, he took each
day as an assignment, made notes, typed his account, then did it
all again the next day. Fifty cartons of days. Seventy-one years of
cartons. He donated them to New York University, according to the
obit.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ordinary man who has done one extraordinary thing,'' was
how he summarized his life in an interview with Salon on-line
magazine last year.
</P>
<P>
   Diarist. Like armorer, cooper or loblolly boy, it's not a label
you expect in a present day obit.
</P>
<P>
   Which is sad. It is easy to pity any future graduate student
stuck with the study of the time we now inhabit. Assuming these
researchers can run our videotape, work our disks and wade through
our data, sound bites and photography, they'll simultaneously know
too much and not enough. Welcome to the club.
</P>
<P>
   But that will be mere data-mining and image surfing. It won't
make up for the lack of diaries and letters. Future grinds will
know everything we saw and heard but little of what we thought and
felt. They won't have any idea of what we thought in private. If
they go by the televised and published evidence, they may not think
we even had a concept of ``private.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll know the oddest of our perversions and the goofiest of
confessions courtesy of shock-autobiographers who write with the
uninhibited self-serving gusto of a Jerry Springer guest. But they
won't know the price of a cup of coffee at a breakfast place where
the waitress calls everyone ``hon.'' They won't suspect there's a
guy who spends his time patrolling middle school corridors yelling
at kids for not tucking-in their shirts. They won't imagine that
despite everything posted on the Web, advertised on television and
featured in newspapers, there are people of this time who, without
being Amish, are perfectly content with dial telephones,
televisions with antennas and computers that run on Intel-386
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Turn-of-the-century specialists of Capt. Kirk's generation won't
hear of the joys of cheering for a losing baseball team on the last
perfect summer night on the last day of the season. Won't know when
birds migrated. Won't know what senators said over drinks. Won't
know what the sermon topic was. And won't glimpse the habitual
daily rhythms that make the rest of politics, economics, faith and
art intelligible.
</P>
<P>
   They won't know these things because nobody keeps diaries any
more and few people mail letters.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is well and good and can make even the heart of a midlife
newsman go pitty-pat. But they seldom go to a printer and are never
stacked and sealed and tied together with a red ribbon that is sure
to fade.
</P>
<P>
   And diaries describing public events not only are unlikely from
leaders elected because they can bite sound rather than write
words, they would be downright dangerous when special prosecutors
and interest-group lawsuit specialists roam the land. In the
present political atmosphere, leaders don't write their frank
assessments on anything more durable than a Post-It Note.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, I must report that we -- regular folks and leaders
alike -- are going to look goofy and unfathomable to our
descendants, people who already have good reason to hold us in low
esteem.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands between us and them are a few low-tech holdouts
like Edward Robb Ellis, diarist. In 200 years, if people are still
writing the kind of narrative history that makes any sense, he
could be better known than Springer, O.J. Simpson or Madonna. Or
one may hope.

 &HT;    `Peyton Jr.' to lead Horns against the No. 5 Wildcats
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's freckle-faced, red-headed, nicknamed
``Opie'' and not especially thick of limb or quick of foot, an
unlikely college quarterback who on his recruiting visit to Texas
was accused by a future teammate of being a frat-boy hanger-on
looking to see what prospects were in town.
</P>
<P>
   He's a former offensive lineman who loved the Alabama Crimson
Tide with a passion; who as kid made time every afternoon to not so
much watch football tapes as devour them; who went to 25 football
camps in nine summers; whose personal trainer called him Peyton Jr.
because his mental skills reminded him of another of the man's
clients.
</P>
<P>
   He's a self-made Division I starter who had his father run
routes for him when no receivers were available; who turned himself
into a major-college quarterback to the music of a jump rope
hitting his garage floor in sets of 500 _ after coming home at
midnight from a date.
</P>
<P>
   This week Major Applewhite is also something else _ designated
sacrificial lamb. The fill-in starting quarterback will lead the
Texas Longhorns on the road against the team that's the best in the
country in scoring offense and scoring defense, fifth-ranked Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him his old coach says to spread out so they don't get
you in one volley,'' laughed Boots Garland, the speed specialist
who worked with Applewhite and Peyton Manning at the Manning
Passing Academy over the past few summers.
</P>
<P>
   With starter and Big 12 passing-efficiency leader Richard Walton
out four to six weeks with a broken hand, Applewhite will be called
upon to hand the ball to Ricky Williams, the Horns' Heisman Trophy
candidate halfback. He'll also face an imposing pass defense that
allowed only a 41.1 completion percentage and four touchdown passes
all last season.
</P>
<P>
   If there are tougher spots in which to make a debut, the list is
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for the national championship game,'' flanker Kwame
Cavil said, ``This is really one of the best opportunities. If he
succeeds, he's a hero. If he fails, well, everybody expected
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to go in and play well. I expect to move the
offense,'' Applewhite said. ``I'm not going in with a carefree
attitude, like nobody is expecting me to do well so I have nothing
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   High hopes for a guy who played center, guard, tackle and tight
end in grade school before getting his chance at quarterback when _
how's this for irony _ the eighth-grade starter broke his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he's built himself into a quarterback, more with
brains than brawn. ``When people talk of talent, they usually mean
physical talent,'' Garland said. ``Major has as much mental talent
as anyone I've worked with, and that includes (former Tennessee and
current Indianapolis Colts quarterback) Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will say their goal is to play at LSU, or wherever, but I
tell them your goal is to find out what it takes to do that.
Major's as good a practitioner of that as anybody I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge, that confidence, has created a leadership aura
his teammates respect, once they get past his Howdy-Doody
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him I asked, `What position does this kid play?' ''
recalled linebacker Dusty Renfro. ``Then I saw him play and I was
really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Michael Bishop type,'' Applewhite said, referring to
his mercurial counterpart this week. ``I won't run around and make
the big play and I'm also not the type who can kill with the pass.
My attribute is keeping a level head, avoiding big mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't win any decathlons, but he can play quarterback,''
said his high school coach, Dale Weiner, who watched him throw 47
touchdown passes with only four interceptions in his two seasons as
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite was a life-long Crimson Tide fan _ he's got photos of
himself with former Alabama quarterback Jay Barker, Sugar Bowl MVP
Derrick Lassic and ends Eric Curry and John Copeland, all from
Alabama's 1992 national title team. But Alabama, which had just
parted ways with Coach Gene Stallings, told Applewhite they weren't
recruiting any quarterbacks, and Applewhite turned to Texas A&AMP;M
because he felt offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger had a plan
for him. A&AMP;M had a different plan for Ensminger. The school fired
him a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite visited Texas the weekend the Horns hosted Notre Dame
in '96, and the school won his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was meant to be a Longhorn,'' his father, Larry,
said, ``because God gave him burnt-orange hair.''
</P>
<P>
   After redshirting last season, Applewhite became the backup
(over Greg Cicero, who injured his knee) and then the starter when
his competition was injured. During the UCLA game, he was fairly
oblivious to his turn in fortune until reserve quarterback and
clipboard operator Ryan O'Neill came over and told him Walton had
hurt his hand. Applewhite picked up a ball, got in a quick warmup
with Adam Dunn, then lipped a prayer as he ran out on the field:
``Whatever is your will, Lord, let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they said, `Oh yeah!, more meat!' '' flanker Kwame
Cavil said of the Bruins. ``I wasn't sure how he'd react . . . but
I was proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident with my game experience, but there was still
some doubt,'' Applewhite said. ``I hadn't been in a big situation
with heat. When I went into the game, I looked over and, `Yeah,
they still had the first-team guys in.' After the first play, it
was, `Yeah, they're still coming after us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite stood firm, completing 3 of 5 passes for 35 yards and
leading the Horns on two scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been impressed with his composure,'' Coach Mack
Brown said. ``He played well against New Mexico State, but there
were a lot of friendly people around and we had a big lead, so it
was, `OK. . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, against UCLA, it's in the Rose Bowl, we're trying to
come from behind and he didn't even have a chance to get loose. We
just had time to say, `Major. . .' It probably helped that the
first play he handed off to Ricky (Williams) for 17 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he'll do the same Saturday in Manhattan, after reciting
Ephesians 6:11, which talks of putting on the ``armor of God,'' and
Philippians 4:13, and after listening to a Champions for Christ CD.
Then he'll walk on the field, warm up and prepare for the Wildcats
blitz _ ``That's what I'd do if I knew a redshirt freshman was
playing quarterback'' _ and whatever else awaits the unlikely
quarterback in the ungodly situation.

 &HT;    Seagrass next on threatened species list
 &HT;    By Jim Reeder
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A rare seagrass found in the Port of Fort
Pierce has been added to the threatened species list, a move that's
likely to require extra care in dredging operations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's seagrass has been found in the Indian River near the
mouths of Taylor Creek and Moore's Creek, two tributaries that the
county may dredge to remove polluted sediments.
</P>
<P>
   It's been found only between the Sebastian Inlet, north of Vero
Beach, and Biscayne Bay near Miami, according to the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare and exhibits one of the most limited geographic
distributions of any seagrass,'' NMFS spokesman Chris Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It provides food for manatees and green sea turtles and seagrass
beds provide habitat for juvenile fish.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal agency said it expects the listing to have
little effect on dredging and other marine-activities, Reps. Mark
Foley and E. Clay Shaw urged the NMFS to delay adding the seagrass
to the threatened species list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a severe impact on routine maintenance dredging
projects in the Intracoastal Waterway, the three major ports in
South Florida as well as the rights of private property owners,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the grass is not threatened with extinction and ``some
research actually appears to thrive in areas where dredging
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County's most recent study of the Taylor Creek area
found Johnson's seagrass on the outer fringe of a seagrass bed at
the northeast corner of Harbour Pointe.
</P>
<P>
   The county is considering dredging Taylor Creek to deepen it by
removing sediment scientist said is contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants have told the county they'll have to be sure not to
dredge the seagrass and to insure it isn't affected by silt stirred
up during the dredging, Acting Port Director Jack Karibo said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Adger, the county's former port director, came under fire
from commissioners in 1996 because he lobbied to keep Johnson's
seagrass off the threatened species list.
</P>
<P>
   Adger said he was supporting the position of the Florida Ports
Council.

tote their own beach chairs and snacks through the tunnel beneath
State Road A1A from the former Majorie Merriweather Post mansion to
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Trump wants to change that. He has plans to build a 100-foot
long seaside pool, 14 cabanas with showers, a snack bar, bathrooms
and two decorative fountains on the club's 360 feet of beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   These cabanas are no canvas lean-tos. They will be
air-conditioned, have seating, French doors and patios.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Mar-a-Lago Club,'' said project manager Wes
Blackman. ``We really think this is a beautiful amenity for the
members. It's something they've asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump needs approval from the state, because the pool and
cabanas are east of the state's coastal construction line, and from
the town council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expecting it,'' said Town Councilman Leslie Shaw.
The club has submitted plans to the state. With state permits, the
club will apply to the town, probably next year.
</P>
<P>
   To gain approval for the club from the town in 1993, Trump
deeded ``preservation easements'' to the National Trust for
Historic Preservation, guaranteeing the view from the main house to
the lake and to the ocean would not be obstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Trump got that approval this spring. ``Our interest was ensuring
the structures be kept north and south of the central vista,'' said
Paul Edmondson, an attorney for the Washington, D.C.-based National
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the cabanas would be clustered in two stories at the
north end of the property and the remaining one above the snack bar
and bathrooms at the south end of the split-level beach.
</P>
<P>
   That will leave a 192-foot wide view in the center for the pool
and a ramp leading from the existing four-foot seawall down to the
lower level of the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A swimming pool and cabanas seem to go with a beach,'' said
Councilman Sam McLendon, ``I'm more concerned about how it fits
with the neighbors. I don't think it's a problem unless it's a
major obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's cabanas would be shoulder-to-shoulder with the
cabanas of its next-door neighbors, the Bath and Tennis Club,
another private club.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's club has yet to reach its 500-member limit and Blackman
does not anticipate an increase in traffic, a concern of the
council in the past.

 &HT;    Hispanic, black freshmen gain ground at UT
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas, trying to build a
diverse student body without affirmative action, enrolled slightly
more black and Hispanic freshmen this fall, indicating that a law
requiring state colleges to admit freshmen in the top 10 percent of
their high school class could be helping.
</P>
<P>
   However, official head counts done on the 12th day of classes
were not available from other state universities, and the UT data
are open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear at UT is that a higher percentage of black and
Hispanic freshmen came from the ranks of the top 10 percent than
those enrolled in the past two years. The 1997 Legislature passed
the law to combat declines in black and Hispanic enrollments at the
state's premier universities, the result of a 1996 federal court
ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in admissions,
scholarships and other student programs.
</P>
<P>
   UT's medical and dental schools, meanwhile, have made
significant gains in Hispanic and African American enrollments
since the so-called Hopwood ruling and admitted a first-year class
similar to what they had in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``By broadening the scope of who we invited in for interviews
and by looking at a number of different factors . . . we were able
to reach a level of diversity close to the pre-Hopwood years,''
said Budge Mabry, director of the medical and dental applications
center for the UT System.
</P>
<P>
   Among undergraduate freshmen, UT-Austin enrolled 198 blacks, or
2.9 percent, of the entering class of 6,744 students, and 891
Hispanics, or 13.2 percent of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Hopwood ruling fully took effect, UT
enrolled 190 blacks, or 2.7 percent of 7,085 freshmen, and 892
Hispanics, or 12.6 percent. That compared with 266 blacks, or 4.1
percent, of 6,430 freshmen in 1996, and 932 Hispanics, or 14.5
percent, of the total.
</P>
<P>
   UT Admissions Director Bruce Walker attributed this year's
modest increases to the new top-10-percent law, along with stepped
up recruitment efforts and minority-targeted scholarships offered
for the first time by the private UT Ex-Students' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now walk into any high school in Texas and know,
without a doubt, there is a group of students who are qualified to
be in UT-Austin,'' Walker said. ``We're headed in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-10-percent law was seen as a way to boost African
American and Hispanic enrollments _ groups historically
underrepresented in Texas higher education _ because there are many
public high schools in Texas dominated by students in those two
groups. Only grades go into figuring a student's class rank;
college entrance exam scores are not considered.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 percent of the freshmen enrolled at UT-Austin were in
the top 10 percent of their high school class. Of the 198 black
freshmen, 73, or 36. 9 percent, were top-10-percent students. Among
891 Hispanic freshmen, 436, or 48.9 percent, were in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 28.4 percent of the blacks were in the top 10 and
41.9 percent of the Hispanics were. That compares with 35 percent
of black freshmen in 1996 and 43.8 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   At UT's four medical schools, 40 blacks were in this fall's
entering class of 801, compared with 24 out of 800 last year and 41
out of 782 in 1996. Among Hispanics, 133 enrolled this fall,
compared with 100 last year and 134 in 1996. At the two dental
schools, there were two African Americans among 148 entering
students, compared with two among 144 last year and one out of 143
in 1996. Among Hispanics, there were 19 this fall, seven in 1997
and 12 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no difference in grades and medical school
test scores over the three years, according to UT data.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment figures also have been finalized at the law school.
In a class of 465, 29 are Mexican American, 13 are other Hispanics,
eight are black, 29 are Asian Americans, five are American Indian,
313 are Anglo and 68 did not identify their race. In 1997, UT
enrolled four blacks and 26 Mexican Americans, compared with 26
blacks and 42 Mexican Americans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   UT System Regent Tony Sanchez of Laredo, the only minority on
the nine-member UT System Board of Regents, said that while he was
aware of efforts taken to boost minority enrollments, he was far
from satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely disappointed in the law school,'' he said.
``It's an elitist school, and a lot of the kids who apply are not
being given the same kind of overall scrutiny as the kids that
apply to medical schools. I don't know what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials interviewed several hundred applicants for
the first time this year and broadened criteria for judging
students to go beyond grades and test scores. The Ex-Students'
Association also provided minority-targeted scholarships.

 &HT;    Wonder gel is barricade against fires
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Firefighter John Bartlett had better lengthen
the dock behind his Jupiter house. A ship's coming in. His.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago Bartlett had an idea about how to protect homes,
utility poles, timber, you name it, from advancing fires. He turned
the idea into a product _ Barricade fire gel.
</P>
<P>
   The world took notice _ ABC News, firefighting journals, fire
chiefs, Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
   And customers. Lots of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales went from zero to $250,000 in two years. All packaging,
shipping and order-taking is done from the garage next to his
father's house in south Martin County. They're running out of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's idea _ which was of the Eureka sort _ flashed into
being in 1993 as he sifted through the charred remains of a trash
fire in Jupiter. Distinct among the melted bottles and crisp embers
were unburned baby diapers _ smoldering but still white.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, 44, wondered why the diapers didn't burn. He chatted
it up with a family friend, a chemist.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was polymers, the Velcro-like molecules of the
chemical world. Things stick to polymers. Polymers absorb moisture,
which is why they're used in diapers. They're used in acrylic
paints, medicines, anyplace where you want thickening or a bond
that holds up under assault by other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the diaper principle to its logical conclusion,'' says
Bartlett. ``Enough polymers absorbing enough water applied to a
house will make the house very, very fire resistant _ for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Long enough to keep 20 homes treated with Barricade in Flagler
County from burning down during July's wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and '95 Bartlett, his father, who had worked 44 years in
fire departments, and the chemist got down to work to perfect the
idea. They tried granular polymers but soon found that a liquid
base was the way to go. They adjusted the ratios of the six
molecules that make up a polymer. The result is a non-toxic white
gunk that Bartlett is happy to apply to his hand to demonstrate its
effectiveness. With a 3500-degree blowtorch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bartlett and his wife, Bailey, his dad, Bill, and partner
Bruce Hill work seven-day weeks to keep up with orders, requests
for demonstrations and bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not anywhere near rolling wheelbarrows of money to the
bank,'' says Bailey. ``We're hanging on. But we're gonna make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who has served with Palm Beach County Fire and Rescue
for 16 years, is plowing through accrued vacation time in order to
get the new company off the ground. He and Bailey once enjoyed wind
surfing on weekends. Now, says Bailey, they've been on the water
maybe twice in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time is consumed by the business,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Barricade, meanwhile, assures that houses are not consumed. It
will protect a structure for up to 30 hours, depending on weather
and humidity, says Bartlett. That gives homeowners or firefighters
time to spray on the protection and retreat to safety. About 4
gallons of the stuff mixed with water from either a pumper truck or
garden hose will cover a two-story home. Cost: around $150.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Ellis, 80, is one of the country's leading researchers in
fire barriers. The Palm Beach Gardens resident has spent a lifetime
developing chemical products that protect wood and textiles, and
slow or suffocate advancing fire. Barricade is a giant evolutionary
step for firefighters, he says. Applications will include movie
sets, military uses, protection of utility poles ... anyplace
something can burn.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is not an investor in Bartlett's company but, at his own
expense, has traveled the South offering his expert opinion of the
gel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A polymer can hold 400 times its weight in water,'' says
Ellis. ``That makes the mixture a strong defensive weapon. It
shields the house or tree line from advancing fire .... It denies a
fire access. It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not as simple as adding water to just any polymer,''
says Ellis. ``I know John Bartlett has tweaked and adjusted his
formula almost 60 times in order to get the right mix. To work, the
gel can't slide off a house, but it can't stick on it forever,
either. It has to be viscous enough to adhere, but not sticky
enough to clog the fireman's equipment. It works, and it will save
more homes and more money than you can count.''
</P>
<P>
   A wildfire can move at 30 miles per hour. It can burn at over
1200 degrees Fahrenheit. It can consume a wood-frame house in
minutes. It can outrun and kill firefighters. The only way to stop
it is to deny it fuel, by cutting dry fire breaks with bulldozers
or applying wet breaks with water. Or a polymer gel like
Bartlett's.
</P>
<P>
   The exact chemical configuration of Bartlett's product is a
secret. He has patents pending that will protect the process of
applying Barricade, and he has an exclusive purchasing arrangement
with the German chemical company that supplies his polymers. He
doesn't have a patent on the polymers themselves. His situation is
somewhat akin to a person who discovers that mixing three common
household products produces a cure for the flu. That person might
not be able to patent the three household products but could patent
the unique use that results from mixing them.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Barricade has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County Emergency Services Director, Steve Wolfberg, has
stocked the gel on all 10 of the county's first-line firetrucks.
Los Angeles County is putting Barricade on board its trucks,
especially those that fight the wildfires that arrive each year
with the hot Santa Ana winds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 3,000 homes burned in Malibu when fires leaped highways
and canyons. Firefighters there perform triage on houses _ they
pick those they think they can save and let flames take the others.
Barricade will allow them to quickly protect all the homes in an
area and then get down to the business of containing the fire. It's
already being used in Northwest forest fires and California
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Airport Fire Chief Bill Cramer bought a new
2,500-gallon pump truck that will do nothing but spread Barricade
gel. Last year his men were asked to help at a junkyard fire where
thousands of old tires, gas tanks and `` a mess of other
materials'' were burning. The Barricade stopped the fire's spread
like nothing he's ever seen, he says.
</P>
<P>
   All this means Bartlett needs a few more days in his work week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When lives are at stake you don't want to put your money on an
untested product,'' says Bartlett. ``I expect the scrutiny. I'll
work the long hours. But I hope the day comes when every truck in
the country carries Barricade, when every homeowner has some in the
garage. We're going to save lives with this. And I'm not blowing
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he apologizes for the bad pun.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like a guy who wants his ship to hurry up and
dock. But everyone who knows John Bartlett attests to his love of
the fire service and his belief in public service. Jeff Alter,
Martin County training chief, has known Bartlett for 15 years. He
says Bartlett's goal isn't personal riches but public safety. Hal
Ellis says the same thing. So does the chief up in Indianapolis. So
does Bailey Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John could get the stuff for free and give it away, he
would,'' says Alter. ``But he saw something nobody else did, and
went after it. He deserves everything he's going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's already gotten is a pile of thanks-a-million from
homeowners who have houses to go home to thanks to Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   What he's going to get is a lot more.

 &HT;    Biking through the mountains of Costa Rica
 &HT;    Photos available
 &HT;    By Dale Fuchs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAJUELA, Costa Rica _ How did I get myself into this?
</P>
<P>
   I was the kid who still had training wheels on her bike at the
age of 9. When I was a teenager, my parents didn't let me ride my
purple 3-speed with the flowered basket off the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here I am, pedaling a 21-speed ``hybrid'' bike up and down
the mountains of Costa Rica. I'm bouncing along jagged roads and
squeezing the hand brakes at every downhill turn.
</P>
<P>
   My butt is numb despite my $50 padded bike shorts. My thighs
feel like I am punishing them for all those times they refused the
StairMaster.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, as I push past the emerald-green coffee
fincas (plantations), the waterfalls and the pulperias, candy
stands with their displays of pretty penny candy, I do not feel the
urge to take a single picture. All I want to do is make it to my
hotel alive.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that I'm on vacation? I had wanted to do something
different this year: to practice my Spanish, explore exotic places,
get some exercise. A saner person might have chosen Club Med. I
signed up for a weeklong bicycle tour of Costa Rica. ``Butterflies,
bicycles and beaches'' is the name listed on the ExperiencePlus!
brochure.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a good idea at the time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I don't own a bike _ if fact, I've ridden a bike only a few
times since I was a teenager _ but how hard could this be?
According to the computer on my exercycle, I can do 30 miles in a
little more than an hour. In Costa Rica, I'll have all day to do 20
to 40 miles. That should give me plenty of time to wander around
the small villages, maybe have a picnic or search for all the
tropical birds that Costa Rica is famous for. I've never seen a
toucan besides Froot Loop Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The tour packing list calls for a helmet, gloves, three ``padded
Lycra cycling shorts,'' three ``cycling jerseys specific for
bikers'' and an optional rearview mirror, so I've already spent
most of my souvenir money _ almost $200 _ on gear.
</P>
<P>
   I may be a bit clumsy riding a bicycle, but at least I'll look
good. This is going to be a ``singles'' tour, after all. You never
know who you might meet over rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I expect to meet the man of my dreams while sweating my
armpits off and wearing shorts that make my derriere look twice its
natural size. But I don't have any friends who are crazy enough to
pay $1,600 for the chance to spend a week switching gears and
guzzling Gatorade. And at least I know I won't be cycling solo in a
kissy-face crowd of bicycles-built-for two.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one thing I'm afraid of: riding with traffic. Four
years ago, I was in a bad car accident that left me with a
more-than-healthy fear of being anywhere near cars.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll have the supervision of four tour guides, plus the
company of more experienced riders. Besides, how much traffic could
there be in the mountains of ecology-friendly Costa Rica? A Central
American country smart enough to abolish its army surely must have
a law against rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine quiet country roads traversed by slow-moving ox carts
_ the hand-painted kind you see in postcards _ and maybe a few
passing sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1: Meet the jocks
</P>
<P>
   A party of gung-ho bikers has already left on a practice ride to
a zoo and nearby volcano when I arrive at our hotel in Alajuela,
known as ``the city of mangoes'' and ``home of the three-toed
sloth.'' I fit into the second category.
</P>
<P>
   I am assigned a roommate, another sloth named Karyn, a nurse
from Chicago. She's 33 (a couple of years older than I am) and
athletic but surely no superjock. She, too, would rather skip the
ride to the local volcano today _ we'd ride to a much better one
later that week, now wouldn't we? We hit it off right away and
discuss the chances of meeting a cute guy.
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner that included the three main Costa Rican food
groups (rice, beans and fried sweet plantains), I meet the other
bikers and am heartened to learn that, in case of an accident, two
doctors and a lawyer are on this tour.
</P>
<P>
   There are 17 of us, ages 12 to 63. The youngest is chaperoning
his dad, a nurse from Seattle who's in the process of getting a
divorce. The oldest, a Titusville retiree, had triple bypass
surgery 15 months before.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 12-year-old has had more biking experience than I have.
When I admit with a laugh that I don't actually own a bike, eyes
pop. I hear several vulgar variations on ``Holy cow!'' followed by
an awe-filled chorus of ``You're very brave.''
</P>
<P>
   I did not intend to be brave. I'm starting to get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: A smashing start
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing like the exercise bike at home. For the first 3
miles, we're pedaling single file, close together _ stop and go,
stop and go _ through Alajuela, where I have yet to spot a mango
tree or a sloth because there are so many people, cars, buses _
stop, go, stop, ouch! _ and traffic lights. The congestion wouldn't
be such a problem if I knew how to get on and off my bike. Which I
don't.
</P>
<P>
   The seat is too high for me to mount with my feet flat on the
ground so I have to jump up a few times to get started, and when I
stop _ whack! _ those padded bike shorts crash right into the seat.
</P>
<P>
   I am certain that I am going to be hit by a car in this clogged
downtown. At home, I drive a Volvo because it is the closest thing
to a tank; yet here I am, with cars darting around me, spewing
exhaust in 95-degree heat, and I have no protection but a gray
metallic helmet (with visor, as per ExperiencePlus!
recommendation).
</P>
<P>
   One of the other riders, a 50-year-old psychologist, takes pity
on me, stops and lowers my seat. Together, we pedal through the
exhaust fumes of Alajuela into the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the scenery is beautiful: humble yet tidy cottages rimmed
by tropical flowers. Lush mountains. Endless rows of coffee plants
more appealing than a Starbucks double latte.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen closely, you can hear monkeys howling from the
treetops. If you can afford binoculars after buying all those
biking ensembles, you might even see the monkeys, too.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't have much time to admire the view. I'm more
interested in looking for potholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find them in the shadows always,'' warns Jose, one of our
young Costa Rican tour guides, in the
slightly-awkward-but-remarkably-clear English that can be heard
often in Costa Rica, which has the highest standard of living in
Central America and where many people, like Jose, have attended
European- or American-run schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jose told me a woman on the last tour flipped off her bike when
she hit a pothole at the bottom of a hill. So I'm using my brakes
constantly and studying the ground on every downward slope. And
there are many _ we're talking curves so sharp you can't see
whether a car is coming until you're halfway through the turn.
</P>
<P>
   I've lost sight of my roommate, Karyn, for about a half hour
when, in a series of downhill turns, the likes of which I've seen
only on skis, she starts picking up speed and passes me.
</P>
<P>
   But I know that some poor soul must be even slower than I am
because I do not enjoy the privilege (or disgrace) of pedaling with
a professional escort.
</P>
<P>
   On this tour, you see, one guide leads the 17-member group and
marks the route with white chalk arrows while another accompanies
the person bringing up the rear. A third guide rides in the middle,
and a fourth drives a van carrying water, Gatorade, snacks and _ in
the event of utter exhaustion _ you and your bicycle _ to the next
hotel along the route.
</P>
<P>
   With neither van nor guide in sight, I suddenly come upon a
traffic jam. In the mountains? This was not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   I walk my bike along the shoulder until I see the cause of the
commotion. Someone in a turquoise shirt is lying on the road.
There's a bicycle lying beside her.
</P>
<P>
   It's Karyn. Her head and shoulder are bleeding. She has a black
eye. She doesn't know who I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I am? What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in Costa Rica, on a bicycle trip. I'm your roommate,
Dale. You just fell off your bike and hit your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later: ``Where am I?'' Five minutes later: ``Who are
you? What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she saw a car, swerved too fast and veered off the side of
the road. Maybe she hit a pothole. No one knows. A driver, I learn,
found her on her back, struggling for breath, her helmet dented but
still strapped around her chin. He says an ambulance is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The very last biker is on her way, too. Her name is Cindy, and
she's a doctor. She takes charge, and when the ambulance shows up,
she rides with my roommate to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   I, meanwhile, feel like throwing up. The scene brings back
memories of my car accident. I accept a ride in the Gatorade van to
the city of Grecia, where I meet the other riders outside a red
church, a simple 19th-century wonder that cuts cleanly into a blue
sky.
</P>
<P>
   We eat mariscos (shellfish), for lunch, adjust bikes, let the
local kids play with our shiny helmets.
</P>
<P>
   And before we pump on to the town of Sarchi, handicraft capital
of the country and our final destination for the day, I sneak back
into the Church of La Mercedes and, although I'm not religious, or
even Christian, I gaze at the life-size Virgin Mary and pray.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3: Birth of a biker
</P>
<P>
   Today is the longest day. We have 40 miles to cover as we cross
the Continental Divide and head into the rain forest. After fueling
up with a traditional ``gallo pinto'' breakfast (scrambled eggs,
rice and beans), I am tempted to ride in the Gatorade van with my
roommate, who has returned from the hospital with a nasty headache,
most of her memory, several oozing sores that bikers call ``road
rash'' and her arm in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   But a woman named Ruth, a neurosurgeon from California, promises
to ride slowly and wait for me if I give it the old college try.
And it is indeed a college try: Ruth and I, it turns out, not only
went to the same college but lived in the same freshman dorm. (So,
it's true: Though the cute guys on the tour are too far ahead of us
to suggest a game of spin-the-water-bottle, you just never know
whom you might meet.)
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of the journey is almost all uphill, along cliffs
that I'm sure would offer breathtaking views if I had the guts to
look over them. While the jocks push ahead of us, we inch along,
sweating and breathing in through the nose 2-3-4 and out through
the mouth 2-3-4 and in 2-3-4 . . .
</P>
<P>
   Did I forget to mention (gasp) that on this week in the usually
pleasant month of February (grunt), there is a heat wave in Costa
Rica? Yes, temperatures top 100 degrees. ``Ah, but it's a dry
heat,'' offers Mario, the tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   Last day
</P>
<P>
   ``What? That's it? I can still go for at least another 20
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm riding with the big boys now _ two veteran bikers, John from
Vancouver and Peter from Colorado, and they are both shocked that I
can keep up with them as we ascend the Cuesta Grande, ``big hill''
in euphemistic Spanish, breeze past melon fields and sleepy
villages and head for Samara Beach on the Pacific Ocean. That's our
last stop, and we are so nonchalant about the whole affair that we
actually carry on a conversation while pedaling. We take stock of
the tour:
</P>
<P>
   Accident count: Nine, including my roommate's. Karyn left the
tour on Day 4 after a valiant attempt to resume riding despite a
separated shoulder. (ExperiencePlus! refunded her money, I
learned.)
</P>
<P>
   Cindy the Doctor, who woke up every hour to check Karyn's pupils
on that first night after her concussion, took four tumbles
herself. During one spill, Cindy broke her finger when her bike
fell into a 4-foot rut in the road. Luckily, my riding buddy, Ruth
the Surgeon, was on hand to set her finger.
</P>
<P>
   I escaped without injury, except for a few blisters, which had
nothing to do with the bicycle and everything to do with wearing a
pair of new tennis shoes without socks.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, touristy activities: Six, including an hourlong hike
through a rain forest; an afternoon raft down the Corobici River
(which included a quick dip in alligator-infested water); a
nighttime swim in volcanic hot springs; a nighttime bus to the
smoldering side of the volcano Arenal (which last erupted in 1968,
killing about 80 people).
</P>
<P>
   Hottest day: 108 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Coolest day: There weren't any.
</P>
<P>
   Most treacherous stretch: Ten unpaved kilometers around Lake
Arenal.
</P>
<P>
   Most beautiful stretch: Ten unpaved kilometers around Lake
Arenal.
</P>
<P>
   Most useless piece of equipment: Rearview mirror. I saved it for
my Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Howler monkey sightings: Twelve that I could see without
binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Toucan sightings: None in the wild; two injured critters in a
cage at Hotel Hacienda in La Pacifica, which is a ``model of
sustainable development'' according to the ExperiencePlus brochure.
It has its own ``tropical dry forest,'' with trails along a river.
The hotel also had a great pool but the worst mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tour romances: None. Hard to believe, but true. Cindy, the
accident-prone doctor, however, came the closest. She was one of
the few people on the tour who could speak Spanish and dance salsa.
Naturally, she met a Costa Rican dancing machine at the disco in
Nicoya. Her Spanish was good enough to get her through the evening
with him, but when he escorted her back to our hotel and wanted to
spend the night, her vocabulary failed her. I know this because she
knocked on my door at 2 a.m., looking for help with the
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Worst language blunder: The honor goes to Cindy. She met a
handsome Costa Rican man at a roadside restaurant. Then she met the
woman he intended to marry. Trying to make light of the situation,
Cindy winked at the lucky bride-to-be and tried to say, in Spanish,
``good catch.'' She used the words buen cogido, which means, to put
it politely, ``good sex.''
</P>
<P>
   An appropriate end to an adventure
</P>
<P>
   If you thought I was panicking on the bicycle, you have never
seen me board a plane. This fear of flying probably started after
my second car accident. I have an anxiety attack nearly every time
my plane hits turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine my delight when I find out that there are
only two ways to travel from the Pacific coast to the international
airport in San Jose: 1) a 30-minute flight on a puddle jumper; or
2) a seven-hour bus ride on those curvy mountain roads I had just
cycled on. I choose the puddle jumper.
</P>
<P>
   I'm puzzled when the taxi driver pulls up to an empty field and
stops. ``Esta aqui, el aerpuerto?'' I inquire. Yes, this is the
airport, the driver assures me. Gulp. And the cute specimen
touching down like a ride in an amusement park is the plane. It has
room for about 10 people, including the pilot and someone who looks
like his teenage son but who is apparently the copilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tip your wings at our friends?'' a couple asks, the
plane's only other passengers. Oh no, not that! ``Sure, no
problem!'' says the pilot. ``Please don't tip your wings,'' I beg.
``No te preocupes, don't worry,'' the pilot says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And above the turquoise Pacific waters and the white sand and
the little house with a little swimming pool, where a bunch of
expatriate Americans salute us with their afternoon drinks, we tip
our wings once, twice, then fly low, beneath the clouds and over
the mountains. And I'm not afraid.
</P>
<P>
   I had just biked through Costa Rica. After that, nothing else
seems scary.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Homer king will be perfect guy for it
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chasing history, catching history and now wrestling over it.
Mark McGwire couldn't possibly have known what he was getting into
when he took serious aim at baseball's brawniest record. Even at
the end of the rainbow, 62 home runs in one sparkling pot, he is
joined by Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Even after getting a congratulatory call from the president, he
understands that the final word has yet to be spoken on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is bigger than Mark and Sammy. It's bigger than you
and me. And, needless to say, it's got Bud Selig totally baffled.
The ball that Sosa hit for his 62nd homer Sunday at Wrigley Field
bore no special authenticating mark. As a matter of fact, I'll be
offering it at my next garage sale, right next to an old tube sock
that might have been worn by Wilt Chamberlain the night he scored
100 points or by me the last time I mowed the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   How simple it was a week ago, when Big Mac was running around
hugging Cardinals and Cubs alike on the occasion of his 62nd and an
entire nation sat basking in the glow of a baseball blessing
broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, all that's clear is the conflict within.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire to have the eventual record, whatever it may be,
because he performed so valiantly in running down both Ruth and
Maris for the home fans at the end of a Cardinals homestand.
</P>
<P>
   I want Sosa to have it because he didn't begrudge McGwire the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire because St. Louis, the best baseball city in
America, knows how to appreciate the record and all that went into
earning it.
</P>
<P>
   I want Sosa because Chicago deserves a sure-fire celebration
before the Cubs, always a heartache waiting to happen, take another
wild stab at the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire because the tremendous emotional release of
reaching 62 first has cost him the fine mental edge that made it
possible. He'll have to restoke the fire now, even as Sosa benefits
from the daily rush of the Cubs' stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   I want Sosa because he never surrendered his shot at the record,
even after McGwire's premature coronation.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire because he finally appears to be enjoying the
record run more than any of us. That wasn't always the case this
summer, back when Mac had 30 or 35 homers and was getting asked
every night to comment on the eventuality of doubling that.
</P>
<P>
   I want Sosa because he somehow has been able to keep the whole
carnival in context. He's won more big games for the Cubs with
clutch base hits than he has with home runs and cut way down on his
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire because he has gone out of his way to show
respect for Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   I want Sosa because Babe Ruth, ruler of a sports world
restricted to white Americans, could never have believed a
Dominican major leaguer possible.
</P>
<P>
   I want McGwire because the Cardinals train in Jupiter. To have
baseball's new single-season home-run champion signing autographs
along the rail at Roger Dean Stadium next spring would be the most
exciting thing since Hank Aaron, the all-time king, trained with
the Braves in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and the Cubs, they train in Arizona. No crime in that, but
something's got to break the tie. I'll take McGwire, in the end,
knowing that a 6-foot-5 giant with a fiery red goatee will sound
even grander one day to the grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   What I really want, though, is for this baseball season to go on
forever. That's the power of this rivalry and the pleasure of
admiring the players involved.

 &HT;    Fall TV '98
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you're Holding the Bay and watching That '70s Show, wondering
about the 7 Days of fall TV. With 36 new shows, it's a virtual
Fantasy Island of choices. All these new people to meet _ The
Hughleys and DiResta and Maggie Winters and Buddy Faro and Conrad
Bloom, not to mention Costello and Jesse. So many questions: Are
Trinity and Legacy just Two of a Kind? Will you be Charmed by
Felicity or struck by Cupid? And Will &AMP; Grace, are they L.A.
Doctors or on that Army Show? Before you declare Martial Law and
seek Vengeance Unlimited (or even cry out Encore! Encore!). Our
television critic Kevin D. Thompson is here to help.
</P>
<P>
   KINGS OF THE HILL
</P>
<P>
   THREE NEW SHOWS TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   _ Cupid (ABC, Saturdays, 10 p.m.): A wonderfully enchanting
romantic comedy about a psychiatric patient (Jeremy Piven) who
believes he's Cupid. His story: He was sent back to Earth to
relearn his craft. The twist? He actually might be the Roman god of
love. Smartly written and beautifully acted, with serious chemistry
between Piven and Paula Marshall, who plays a smitten relationship
expert. Could be the next Moonlighting . . . or Relativity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hyperion Bay (WB, Mondays, 9 p.m.): A thoughtful and
intelligent relationship drama about two odd-couple brothers, one
white-collar, one blue-collar, who battle each other while defining
their roles in life. Forget the much-hyped Felicity. This is the
WB's best drama.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy Island (ABC, Saturdays, 9 p.m.): A stylish and
deliciously sinister remake of the campy '70s series. Not only does
Malcolm McDowell's Mr. Roarke not wear white suits (he likes Armani
gray), you get the sense this guy's in cahoots with the devil, or
something. Helping Mr. Roarke are a trio of loyal assistants,
including the yummy Madchen Amick (Twin Peaks), who can morph into
anything.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SHOOT ME!
</P>
<P>
   THREE NEW SHOWS TO SKIP
</P>
<P>
   _ Brimstone (Fox, Tuesdays, 9 p.m.): Oh, just your average drama
about a New York ex-cop (Peter Horton) who died in the line of duty
and was sent to Hell by the devil for killing his wife's rapist.
But after a mass jailbreak in Hades _ no, we're not kidding! _ our
hero is dispatched back to Earth to round up those ornery demons.
His reward if he succeeds? A first-class ticket to heaven. A
shameless X-Files rip-off that's dark, brooding and boring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wind on Water (NBC, Saturdays, 8 p.m.): If TV shows were
judged on looks alone, this sappy, Dallas-like soap would get four
stars. There's lush Hawaiian scenery, hard-bodied studs surfing and
Bo Derek in a bathing suit! Jeez . . . even the horses look great.
But this ho-hum, woodenly acted drama about Hawaiian cattle
ranchers is nothing more than glorified eye candy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports Night (ABC, Tuesdays, 9:30 p.m.): A show within a show
that gives us a behind-the-scenes look at a crazed ESPN-like sports
show. But is it a comedy? Is it a drama? The producers don't seem
to know. And you probably won't care. The Larry Sanders Show did it
better.
</P>
<P>
   DEJA VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many new shows look familiar? Well, because they are.
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: The Jeffersons (CBS): Middle-class black family movin'
on up to a de-luxe apartment on Manhattan's mostly white East Side.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: The Hughleys (ABC): Middle-class black family movin'
to a de-luxe house in an all-white suburb. George and Weasie are
better in repeats.
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: Fantasy Island (ABC): Suave-looking Mr. Roarke
(Ricardo Montalban) and midget helper Tattoo (Herve Villechaize)
make people's fantasies come true.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: Fantasy Island (ABC): Same premise, but Mr. Roarke
(Malcolm McDowell) is creepy and sinister-looking. No ``de plane,
de plane,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: ER (NBC): Fast-paced medical drama that explores the
lives of passionate and talented doctors treating patients with
nasty-looking wounds.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: Mercy Point (UPN): Fast-paced medical drama that
explores the lives of passionate and talented doctors treating
nasty-looking . . . aliens in outer space. Dr. Ross, meet Dr.
McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: Ally McBeal (Fox): Good-looking, highly introspective
woman (Calista Flockhart) struggles with work, life and guys.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: Felicity (WB): Good-looking, highly introspective teen
(Kerri Russell) struggles with college, life and guys. But without
David E. Kelley writing dialogue for her. And no Dancing Baby!
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: The Equalizer (CBS): Former government agent (Edward
Woodward) operates one-man security force to help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: Vengeance Unlimited (ABC): Whacked-out psycho (Michael
Madsen) operates one-man security force to help people in need. The
difference? Woodward could act.
</P>
<P>
   OLD SHOW: Full House (ABC): A single dad (Bob Saget) raises twin
daughters (the Olsen twins) with the help of his brother-in-law and
pal.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOW: Two of a Kind (ABC): A single dad (Christopher Sieber)
raises scheming twin daughters (the Olsen twins again!) with the
help of . . . you get the idea. Someone find these kids a mom _
quick!
</P>
<P>
   TOUCHED BY AN ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   THIS YEAR'S TRENDS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Odd Couples return: More buddy shows. NBC's Will &AMP; Grace
about mismatched roommates (he's gay, she's straight!); ABC's
Brother's Keeper; UPN's Guys Like Us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacks in the 'burbs: ABC's The Hughleys and Fox's Living In
Captivity both have black folks ``movin' on up.'' If we're lucky,
both shows will soon move on out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mr. Moms: Who says single men don't raise kids? They do on
Fox's Holding The Baby; UPN's Guys Like Us; ABC's Brother's Keeper
and ABC's Two of a Kind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Irish guys are smilin': NBC's Wind on Water; Fox's Costello;
CBS' To Have And To Hold and NBC's Trinity all revolve around Irish
families and characters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Living large: If you're fat and can act, get to Hollywood . .
. now! TV's big guys include comic John DiResta in UPN's DiResta;
Nathan Lane in NBC's Encore! Encore!; David Anthony Higgins on the
WB's The Army Show; Kevin James on CBS' The King of Queens and
Sammo Hung on CBS' Martial Law.
</P>
<P>
   SAMMO WHAMMO!
</P>
<P>
   THE YEAR'S MOST UNLIKELY STAR
</P>
<P>
   Sammo Hung, the star of CBS' cop drama Martial Law, looks more
like a kindly sumo wrestler than a lethal, martial-arts killing
machine. The 5-foot-7-inch, 220-pound Hung plays Sammo Law, a
karate-chopping, back-flipping, high-kicking Shanghai cop who joins
forces with the L.A.P.D. What's he like? Ever see a human bowling
ball kick butt?
</P>
<P>
   Here are capsule descriptions of the new fall shows by
television critic Kevin D. Thompson. means Kevin recommends it.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY:
</P>
<P>
   Holding The Baby (Fox): A workaholic single dad (Jon Patrick
Walker) raises his baby with his skirt-chasing brother (Eddie
McClintock) and a cute nanny (Jennifer Westfeldt) after his wife
skips town. Yet another formulaic and cliche-ridden sitcom where
poor ol' dad is a bumbling dope.
</P>
<P>
   That '70s Show (Fox): A sweet and often hilarious look at a
group of teens growing up in the '70s. Think a more adult version
of The Brady Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Show (WB): A silly military comedy about a band of
misfits at a forgotten Army compound. The only thing you'll want to
forget is this lame sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY:
</P>
<P>
   The King of Queens (CBS): A UPS-like delivery man (Kevin James)
watches his basement paradise invaded when his loud-mouthed
father-in-law (Jerry Stiller) moves in and wreaks havoc. Stiller is
a scream _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   The Brian Benben Show (CBS): Brian Benben stars as a demoted
L.A. anchor who schemes to get back his cushy job from the living
and breathing Ken doll who took it. Benben better get stronger
writers or he'll get bumped in real life, too.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Doctors (CBS): Four doctors get fed up with red tape HMOs
and open up their own practice where the patients matter more than
the bottom line. CAT scans are more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Bloom (NBC): A rising New York ad exec (Mark Feuerstein)
has a lot of women in his life, but none of them is the one special
lady he seeks. Oh, goodie, yet another NBC sitcom set in an office.
</P>
<P>
   Will &AMP; Grace (NBC): Two roommates (gay Will, straight Grace)
enjoy poker, French films and The $10,000 Pyramid. Boasts likable
leads and could be NBC's only new hit.
</P>
<P>
   Guys Like Us (UPN): Two hip roommates (Bumper Robinson, Chris
Hardwick) share their swinging bachelor pad with a 6-year-old kid
(Maestro Harris) who talks like he's 42. Yeah, the kid is cute and
perky. Too cute and perky, though. You wonder if he runs on
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   DiResta (UPN): A New York City transit cop (John DiResta)
juggles career and family. DiResta's a likable lug, but we can't
help but think we've seen all this stuff before.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Life of Desmond Pfeiffer (UPN): TV's most original _
and silly _ idea. A White House butler (Chi McBride) unwittingly
becomes a confidant for a womanizing President Lincoln (Dann
Florek). Yeah, it's dumb, but it's also pretty funny _ and, uh,
timely.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion Bay (WB): A gripping and sensitive family drama about a
guy (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) who moves back to this small town to make
sense of his life. One of TV's most promising new dramas.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   The Hughleys (ABC): What happens when a middle class black
family moves to an all-white suburb? Not much in this unfunny and
mostly unrealistic sitcom starring stand-up comic D.L. Hughley.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Night (ABC): A behind-the-scenes look at a
Sportscenter-like show. ABC's promos are funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Encore! Encore! (NBC): Nathan Lane is a former opera singer
forced to give up his career and move back with his family in Napa
Valley. The show's riddled with problems, but we're counting on the
Frasier folks, who created this series, to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Costello (Fox): A loud, spirited bartender (Sue Costello) hangs
around a bunch of loud, foul-mouthed friends in south Boston.
Tacky, crass and downright vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   Brimstone (Fox): A dead ex-cop (Peter Horton) is sent back to
earth by the devil to round up 113 evil souls who escaped from
Hell. If he gets the job done, the scowling cop gets heavenly
redemption. We think he'll get canned before capturing, say, three
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Point (UPN): ER meets Star Trek: Voyager. A team of
doctors, led by the reliable Joe Morton, treat humans and numerous
aliens in an out-of-this-world medical facility. Sometimes icky,
sometimes interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity: A naive teen (Keri Russell) takes charge of her life
by moving to New York from California. The most hyped new drama of
the season _ and we still don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Lives of Men (ABC): Three guys get together each week
to play golf (oooh, how exciting!) and wax poetic about life. We
call it The Boring Men's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Winters (CBS): Think Ally McBeal goes back home. Faith
Ford moves in with her mom (Shirley Knight) after her big city job
doesn't work out. Ford is appealing and could grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   To Have And To Hold (CBS): A romantic comedy drama about a
public defender (Annie Cornell) and a Boston detective (Jason
Beghe) who love each other _ and their jobs. We don't love them,
though.
</P>
<P>
   7 Days (UPN): Remember Timecop? It's back, only now it's called
7 Days. Jonathan LaPaglia stars as a cocky ex-CIA agent who goes
back in time for seven days to undo present-day catastrophes. Slick
and action-packed.
</P>
<P>
   Charmed (WB): Three good-looking sisters who just happen to be
witches. With cool special effects, snappy writing, Shannen Doherty
and the sexy Alyssa Milano, Charmed should hook the Buffy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   Vengeance Unlimited (ABC): The Equalizer gone over the edge. A
mumbling, so-called do-gooder (Michael Madsen) helps people get
revenge on bad guys. As a quietly deranged vigilante, Madsen has
too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse (NBC): A single mother (Christina Applegate) juggles her
job, dreams and all the guys hitting on her. While Married . . .
With Children's Applegate is likable, Jesse is just another
run-of-the-mill comedy.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   Two of a Kind (ABC): Once again the Olsen twins are being raised
by a harried single dad (Christopher Sieber). Cute and funny, this
show could help revive ABC's once-mighty TGIF lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Brother's Keeper (ABC): Two odd couple brothers (one's a stuffy
English professor, the other's a wild professional football star)
live together while raising an 8-year-old. Another charming ABC
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Faro (CBS): Dennis Farina has a grand time as a one-time
brilliant Los Angeles investigator who's having a tough time
working in the '90s. Smart, visually arresting and funny. This
one's a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity (NBC): A drama about a working-class Irish family from
New York's famed Hell's Kitchen. Although the pilot wasn't
gripping, we'll give it a shot since ER Executive Producer John
Wells is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Living In Captivity (Fox): Three diverse couples try to do the
Rodney King thing, you know, just get along, while living in the
suburbs. Murphy Brown producer Diane English should be ashamed
she's an executive producer on this witless comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Legacy (UPN): Imagine if Dynasty took place on the rolling blue
grass hills of post-Civil War Kentucky. Then it'd look a lot like
this soap, which follows the triumphs and struggles of a close-knit
family. While not riveting entertainment, it's mildly pleasing, and
with a great-looking cast, very easy on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy Island (ABC): You know the premise . . . people come to
an exotic island to have their fantasies come true. Malcolm
McDowell is deliciously dark and sinister as the mysterious Mr.
Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid (ABC): A man (Jeremy Piven) claims he's Cupid and that he
must bring together 100 couples to get back to Mount Olympus. Is he
or isn't he the Roman god of love? You'll have fun finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Martial Law (CBS): A butt-kicking, karate-kicking Shanghai cop
(Sammo Hung) joins forces with the L.A.P.D. to do more butt-kicking
and karate-kicking. A delightful, rock 'em-sock 'em treat.
</P>
<P>
   Wind on Water (NBC): A Dynasty-like drama about a bunch of
cattle ranchers, surfers and sky divers who live to the extreme in
Hawaii. Bo Derek heads the mostly no-name cast, most of whom look
like walking Tiger Beat covers.

SENATORS TO STRIP OFF ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL RIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   The
current Senate Interior Appropriations bill is piled high with more
than a dozen anti-environmental riders. These riders are intended
to carve out exceptions to environmental law or lower the level of
environmental protections for public lands. ``Mugging the
environment,'' The New York Times called the process _ carried out
in the darker recesses of Capitol Hill, hidden from public view.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few senators will step into the light this week and introduce
amendments to strip off the worst of these riders.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the ranking Democrat on the Senate's
Environment and Public Works Committee, will lead the charge
against the environment muggers. He plans to introduce an amendment
to strip eight riders from the Interior spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the provisions in the Baucus amendment clashes with his
fellow senator from Montana, Republican Conrad Burns. Burns added a
rider that would terminate the ongoing public process of grizzly
bear reintroduction into the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness area of
Idaho and Montana. The Burns rider eliminates the state-level
public discussion and process to create a successful grizzly bear
plan. The Baucus amendment will strip off that rider _ in effect,
leaving grizzly recovery plan in the hands of those citizens living
closest to the recovery area.
</P>
<P>
   The Baucus amendment, if passed by the full Senate, will peel
off a rider that would prevent the National Park Service from
enforcing regulations to protect wildlife and to phase out
commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska.
Commercial fishing is prohibited in all national park units.
</P>
<P>
   The Baucus amendment would pluck off a rider that would
authorize the construction of a $30-million road through the middle
of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The road is
opposed by 56 Native Alaskan villages in the region, taxpayer
groups and sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus also targets a rider that would override the Endangered
Species Act in managing the Columbia River dams and ecosystem _
thereby severely restricting efforts to restore endangered and
threatened Pacific salmon.
</P>
<P>
   And four riders that would profoundly impact our national
forests could be scraped off by the Baucus amendment:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tongass National Forest rider that requires the U.S. Forest
Service to offer 240 million board feet of timber a year for sale,
or allows the timber companies to sue the USFS. It also requires
the agency to pay local communities 25 percent of the value of the
timber not harvested.
</P>
<P>
   2. A rider that would prevent the USFS from using prescribed
fire to remove brush until all commercial timber has been cut from
the area. The economic value of the stronger, fire-resistant trees
would cause them to be the first to be logged. The loss of these
trees undermines the point of a prescribed burn to restore balance
in the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   3. A rider that would prevent the USFS from removing dangerous
and environmentally damaging roads until all roads that were
created by illegal off-road vehicles have been closed or upgraded.
Many of these unauthorized roads are unrecorded and an inventory
would cause lengthy delays in the process.
</P>
<P>
   4. A rider that would prevent the USFS from updating plans to
manage national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., will introduce an amendment to
reduce taxpayer subsidies for timber sales and logging roads. A
rider on the Interior spending bill would increase these subsidies
by well over $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., targets a rider that
prevents the Secretary of the Interior from updating environmental
regulations governing hardrock mining on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 requires the
secretary of interior to ``take any action necessary, by regulation
or otherwise to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation on the
federal lands.'' The rider interferes with this law and puts a
moratorium on any revisions to the regulations. Taxpayers are
paying for cleaning up abandoned hardrock mines to the tune of $70
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment offered by Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., will restore
the $6.4 million from funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1998
for the acquisition of lands within the Cumberland Island National
Seashore. The money comes from royalty payments from offshore
drilling and is put into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The
$6.4 million is an overdue payment on a purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sens Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, will seek
to increase the level of funding for the operations and maintenance
of National Wildlife Refuges to the level requested in the
president's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., will act to restore funding to
the Land and Water Conservation Fund. States use money from this
fund to purchase new recreational areas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendments do not solve all the environmental
problems with the Senate Interior spending bill. For instance,
drastic cuts in funds for the Florida Everglades jeopardizes the
restoration plan. So far no senator has stepped forward to rectify
the situtation.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the key pro-environment amendments do not pass, the
president may veto the Interior Appropriations bill. In the last
Congress, Republicans attempted to eviscerate environmental law
using riders to appropriations bills _ but the public knew who was
to blame when Clinton vetoed them and brought federal agencies to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the president's current problems, the public will
not be fooled into blaming him for a veto that blocks any serious
move to gut environmental protections. More than 70 percent of the
American public support strong environmental laws.

   LYING-SEX (San Francisco) _ Almost everyone lies about sex; it
is the one area of our lives that it is appropriate to lie about.
And if a person lies about sex, it doesn't mean at all that he or
she lies about anything else. The truth is that, like the males of
most species, the human male is not naturally a physically
monogamous animal. By FRED FLAXMAN.
</P>

plan to beef up child-care programs has withered on the vine in a

Congress. By CARY CLACK.

<P>
   The typical supermarket produce section has grown by a factor of
about four in the past 15 years. Where there was once spinach,
there are now kale, bok choy and half a dozen other greens for
cooking. Where there were all-purpose potatoes, there are now Yukon
gold, little red and several more.
</P>
<P>
   Many people find this overwhelming, but the truth is that
cooking vegetables is simple. Of course, you need to identify the
vegetable and know the general rules for preparing it. But once
you've done that, there's not much more you need to do to put a
nicely finished vegetable dish on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Few vegetables cannot be simmered or steamed to tenderness and
then lightly dressed, with something as simple as lemon juice or
vinaigrette. And few vegetables cannot be cooked in a little olive
oil, either over high heat so that they become crisp, or with some
liquid, covered, over lower heat, so that they become meltingly
tender.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy super-fresh, super-high-quality vegetables, you can
give them the minimalist treatment and they'll be singing with
enough flavor to please even a vegetable hater.
</P>
<P>
   Most vegetable haters are simply vegetable lovers who haven't
realized it yet. These dishes can move the process along.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STIR-FRIED BROCCOLI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   You need not precook the broccoli for this stir-fry, but if you
have leftover or extra simmered or steamed broccoli, by all means
use it. Just keep the cooking time to a minimum, no longer than it
takes to heat the broccoli through.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; About 1 1/2 pounds broccoli, trimmed &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons peanut (preferred) or other oil &QL; 
 &UR; Salt to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon sugar &QL; 
 &UR; 1 cup chicken, beef or vegetable stock, or water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut the stalks of the broccoli into thin slices. Separate the
florets into small sections.
</P>
<P>
   Place the oil in a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high
heat. Two or three minutes later, add the broccoli, raise the heat
to high and cook, stirring, until it becomes bright green and
glossy and begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the salt, sugar and stock or water. Stir and continue to
cook until almost all of the liquid evaporates and the broccoli is
tender, about 5 minutes more. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUICK-BRAISED CARROTS WITH ORANGE AND GINGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Best with butter, but still delicious when made with oil. Simply
cooked carrots are good spiked with spices. In addition to ginger,
try ground cardamom, cinnamon, cumin or coriander.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons butter or 1 tablespoon canola or other neutral oil &QL; 
 &UR; 1/4 cup orange juice &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon minced orange zest &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon sugar or 1 tablespoon maple syrup &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger &QL; 
 &UR; Minced fresh parsley, mint, chervil or cilantro leaves for garnish &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place the carrots, butter or oil, orange juice, orange zest,
sugar, salt and pepper in a medium saucepan over high heat; bring
to a boil and cover. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover and raise the heat a bit. Add the ginger. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the carrots are
cooking in butter or oil. Lower the heat and continue to cook,
stirring occasionally, until tender, a couple of minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, then garnish and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OVEN-BAKED RATATOUILLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 1 1/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Combining vegetables can turn a simple dish into a dramatic one
_ or even into a main course. This mixture of soft vegetables,
gently baked in layers until very tender, is sensational.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 cloves garlic &QL; 
 &UR; 2 large onions, thinly sliced &QL; 
 &UR; 2 large eggplant, about 2 pounds total, sliced 1/2-inch thick (If
time allows, salt both sides of the slices, let drain in a colander
for at least 30 minutes, rinse and squeeze dry between paper
towels.) &QL; 
 &UR; 4 red or yellow bell peppers, stemmed, peeled if desired, seeded
and sliced into 3 or 4 pieces each &QL; 
 &UR; 4 ripe red tomatoes, cored, skins and seeds removed, and cut into
thick slices &QL; 
 &UR; 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, rosemary or savory leaves &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, basil or chervil leaves for
garnish &QL; 
 &UR; 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Either of these techniques will make the garlic easier to peel:
Drop it into boiling water, leave it there for 30 seconds, then
remove. Or toast it in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking
frequently, for 3 or 4 minutes. Peel and cut each clove in half.
</P>
<P>
   In a casserole, make a layer of onion, followed by one of
eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, herbs, salt, pepper and garlic cloves.
Repeat. Drizzle the ratatouille with the olive oil and place in the
oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about an hour, pressing down on the vegetables
occasionally, until they are all completely tender. Garnish and
serve, hot or at room temperature.

 FROM ``HOW TO COOK EVERYTHING'' by MARK BITTMAN  
 Copyright 1998 Mark Bittman

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans are reluctant to buy and cook fish for
themselves. We currently eat twice as much fish in restaurants as
at home, a statistic which becomes even more impressive when you
consider that it includes the fish most commonly prepared by home
cooks: canned tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is different from other animals we eat for one main reason:
60 or more kinds, on a rotating basis, make common appearances in
the supermarket. This makes fish confusing for many.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a feature of fish that makes the cooking much
easier than it would be otherwise: Many fish are so similar that
they can be readily substituted for one another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the following fish fillets have much in common.
They are all stark-white, or nearly so, mild-flavored and under an
inch thick. All are tender, some more than others. The sturdier
ones (marked with a + ) can be substituted in the recipes that work
for the more tender ones.
</P>
<P>
   + Catfish
</P>
<P>
   + Dogfish, also known as cape shark
</P>
<P>
   Flatfish of any type: flounder, fluke, sole, dab, plaice
</P>
<P>
   Haddock (likely to have skin on, but skin is edible)
</P>
<P>
   Large- or small-mouthed bass (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Pickerel (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Pike (freshwater)
</P>
<P>
   Ocean perch
</P>
<P>
   + Red snapper, or other snappers
</P>
<P>
   + Rockfish of any type
</P>
<P>
   + Sea bass
</P>
<P>
   Weakfish, also known as sea trout
</P>
<P>
   + Wolffish, also known as ocean catfish
</P>
<P>
   Whiting, also known as hake
</P>
<P>
   These fish cook very, very quickly and overcook almost as fast.
How do you know when they're done? Several ways:
</P>
<P>
   1. By the time the outside of the thinner fillets is opaque, the
inside is very nearly done. This is absolutely true if you turn the
fish over, as you do in a pan. But even in a broiler or oven,
external opacity is a sign of internal doneness.
</P>
<P>
   2. With thinner fillets, when the thinnest part flakes, the
thicker part is done. When the thicker part flakes, it's
overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   3. With thicker fillets, those up to one inch or so, you can
roughly estimate doneness by timing: about 8 minutes is the longest
you want to cook any fillet under one inch thick. In addition, take
a peek between the flakes of the fish; if most of the translucence
is gone and the fish is tender, it's done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXTRA-CRISP RED SNAPPER (OR OTHER FILLETS) WITH APPLES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a lovely combination, typical of the simple fish dishes
of northern France. It's best with red snapper or other sturdy
fillets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 crisp not-too-sweet apples, such as Granny Smiths &QL; 
 &UR; 6 tablespoons butter &QL; 
 &UR; Flour for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 1 egg &QL; 
 &UR; 4 red snapper or other sturdy fillets, about 6 ounces each, scaled
or skinned
 &UR; Plain bread crumbs for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice &QL; 
 &UR; 1 tablespoon brandy (optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peel and core the apples, then cut them into rings or thin
wedges. Melt half the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.
Add the apples, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, tossing
and stirring occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides, about
7 minutes. Keep warm in a 200 degrees Fahrenheit oven while you
proceed with the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've started cooking the apples, preheat a large
non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the flour with salt
and pepper and beat the egg in a bowl. Add the remaining butter to
the skillet and, when the foam subsides, dredge each fillet in the
flour, then dip it in the egg, dredge it in the bread crumbs, and
place it in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook until the fillets are nicely browned on both sides, about 6
to 8 minutes total. The fillets will be white, opaque and tender
when done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fish to a platter. Drizzle the apples with lemon
juice and brandy and spoon a portion onto each fillet. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``OVEN-FRIED'' CATFISH (OR OTHER FILLETS)
</P>
<P>
   (makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a 1950s-style recipe that takes almost no effort.
</P>
<P>
   Use this with any of the fillets listed above. Reduce the
cooking time to 4 to 5 minutes for those under 1/2 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; About 1 1/2 pounds catfish or other fillets, scaled or skinned &QL; 
 &UR; 1 1/2 cups milk &QL; 
 &UR; Plain bread crumbs for dredging &QL; 
 &UR; Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
 &UR; 3 tablespoons melted butter or olive oil &QL; 
 &UR; Lemon wedges &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soak the fillets in the milk while you preheat the oven to 500
degrees Fahrenheit. Season the bread crumbs with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   When the oven is hot, dredge the still-wet fish in the bread
crumbs, patting them to make sure they adhere. Drizzle a little of
the butter over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, preferably
non-stick, then lay the fillets in the pan. Drizzle with the
remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake near the top of the oven for about 8 minutes; the fish will
be tender and opaque when done. Serve immediately, with lemon
wedges.

CONGRESS SHOULD REVIVE CLINTON'S CHILD-CARE PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ President Clinton's highly touted plan to beef up
child-care programs has withered on the vine in a development that
could have damaging repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton introduced the plan with much fanfare and praise. Now,
fingerpointing is under way as observers expect the proposals to
die quietly during the final weeks of the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that lawmakers are not planning to
fund Clinton's proposed $21 billion child-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The president's programs would have provided subsidies for poor
working families, tax credits for the middle class and other
attempts to make child care more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton lacked the focus or the muscle to push through this
big-ticket spending item.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional aide told The Associated Press that the
Clinton administration provided a lot of steam but not much engine.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Clinton planned to fund child-care programs with
money from a mammoth tobacco settlement, but Congress failed to
approve the settlement, thanks to obstructionism by the Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pick up the issue again next year because it is
too important to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Without child-care assistance for the nation's working poor,
welfare reforms will ultimately be unsuccessful and millions of
single parents will never have a chance to pull themselves out of
poverty.

LYING WAS THE HONORABLE THING TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED FLAXMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since no one else has done this, I'm going to
tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth on
the subject of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that they had an affair, that it was sexual and that
it was inappropriate and wrong, and that Clinton lied to everyone
about it. But it is also true that lying was the honorable thing to
do. Almost everyone lies about sex; it is the one area of our lives
that it is appropriate to lie about. And if a person lies about
sex, it doesn't mean at all that he or she lies about anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, like the males of most species, the human
male is not naturally a physically monogamous animal. But there are
huge social pressures favoring monogamy. This situation presents
conflicts for many men and they have sex outside of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They may love their wives and children and want to maintain a
strong family life, but they also crave a bit of sexual variety.
Such activity is widely perceived as wrong, as Clinton admitted in
his address to the nation, and it certainly is dangerous to
marriages and family life. Therefore, men (and women) who cheat on
their spouses but care about them and their children usually cover
it up. Truth is, that is the right and honorable thing to do if
they don't want to hurt the people they love.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried on his affair in a study off the Oval Office of
the White House. It sure wasn't very wise to have sex on sacrosanct
public property. It would have been much wiser not to have carried
on with a White House intern at all. But sexual appetite is not a
matter of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And given that these two were so sexually attracted to each
other and that neither of them wanted the rest of the world to know
about it, where could they go? The White House family quarters? A
motel? You've got to admit that Clinton's options were rather
limited, and that if you had done what he did, you would want to
cover it up as well.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything Clinton said in his speech to the nation was
correct, as far as it went, and he should not have gone any
further. He was right that one's sex life should be a private
affair as long as it is between consenting adults. Monica Lewinsky
has not charged Clinton with sexual harassment or with using the
power of his office to obtain sex. Paula Corbin Jones, the one
woman who did make such charges, had her case dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has said about independent counsel Kenneth Starr
was also correct. Starr's investigation of Clinton's sex life was
as wrong and inappropriate as Clinton's affair in the Oval Office,
but what Starr has done is far more damaging to the country.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Clinton's affair in the White House that embarrassed
the country, it was Starr's revelation of that affair. It wasn't
Clinton's lying and coverup of the affair which got him in trouble,
it was Starr's forcing him to come clean. It was Starr, not
Clinton, who used the power of his office to compel Monica Lewinsky
to do something she didn't want to do _ tell the truth about her
affair with the president or face prosecution for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr who forced the president's lawyers and advisers and
Secret Service agents, who were supposed to protect the president,
to testify against their will under oath. It was Starr who wasted
millions of dollars of taxpayers' money investigating the private
sex life of a sitting head of state, damaging the president's
credibility and capacity to govern, harming the nation, and
attempting to overrule the will of the American people who elected
Clinton, not Starr.
</P>
<P>
   I don't question Clinton's motives for trying to cover up his
affair, but I sure do question Starr's for going after Clinton's
private life. It appears as though he was out to get Clinton for
purely political reasons, and when he couldn't find anything in the
Whitewater affair he was originally hired to investigate, nor in
any other aspect of Clinton's nonsexual behavior, he decided to
check below the belt, where, as we now know all too well, he found
something he had no business looking for to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   A special prosecutor should be hired to investigate Kenneth
Starr's leaks of grand jury testimony to the press. If it can be
proven that he was responsible for some of those leaks, he should
be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If there is
insufficient evidence to prosecute him on this account, the new
special prosecutor should thoroughly investigate Starr's sex life _
and see how he likes that.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he has something there that he has lied about,
covered up, or at least not revealed to anyone else. Most men do.

CLINTON WOES REDUCE CHANCES FOR SEVERAL BILLS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The release of salacious details of President
Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky has lowered the odds that
Congress will pass several major pieces of legislation, some of
which are top priorities of consumer groups or control the way US
companies conduct billions of dollars in business.
</P>
<P>
   Some business lobbyists say the president now seems unwilling to
push for one of their favored bills _ a measure that would lead to
more free-trade treaties. They speculate that Clinton may be leery
of angering Democratic groups that oppose the legislation and may
be needed as allies during an impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a ``patients' bill of rights,'' which would impose
new regulations on health-maintenance organizations, say only fear
of a voter rebellion this November forced Republican leaders to
move the bill through Congress. ``What's changed is some
Republicans may be feeling that the Lewinsky issue is consuming
enough of the public's attention that they can get away without
passing any managed care legislation,'' said Ronald Pollack,
executive director of Families USA, a consumer group backing the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Congress faces tough and time-consuming negotiations
over a Republican-proposed tax cut, a major overhaul of banking and
insurance rules, and a proposal to send more money to an
international agency charged with calming the Asian financial
turmoil _ all while time is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers plan to adjourn Oct. 9 to prepare for the November
elections. Much of their remaining time must be spent passing a
federal budget for the next fiscal year, which starts in only 16
days.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan for next year is contained in 13 separate
bills, and only one has made its way through Congress. ``If time is
a currency in limited supply, clearly all this talk (of the
Lewinsky affair) takes away from it,'' said Frank Coleman of the US
Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for business interests. ``This
has clearly derailed action, to a degree, on the things we're
working to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   One top priority for the chamber is a bill that would grant
Clinton so-called ``fast track'' powers, which would make it easier
for him to sign the type of free-trade treaties the United States
already has with Mexico and Canada. Clinton has long fought to
renew his fast-track powers, which lapsed in 1994, but he lost a
major battle for them in the House last November.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on fast track again on Sept. 24,
but business lobbyists say the president is not leaning on
lawmakers this time to support the measure. Some blame the
administration's focus on the Lewinsky matter and the possibility
of impeachment procedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, it has left the administration distracted. At worst,
it has left the administration working against us in order to curry
favor with labor union leadership and extreme environmentalists''
who oppose fast track, said William Morley, lead lobbyist on the
issue for the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also running out of time to solve disputes between
the banking, brokerage and insurance industries _ and among
different constituencies within each industry _ over a major
overhaul of rules that control how those businesses operate.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul would rewrite Depression-era laws that prevent or
make it difficult for banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to merge with each other or compete in each other's
businesses. Congress has tried unsuccessfully nearly a dozen times
in past two decades to rewrite the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawmakers were faced with a new challenge when the
Independent Insurance Agents of America withdrew their support of
the bill over complaints that it would give banks an advantage over
individual agents in selling insurance. The bill has overcome
similar hurdles in the past, but its passage is in doubt because
the agents' group has members in every congressional district and
wields significant clout.
</P>
<P>
   While some bills, including the new regulations for managed-care
health insurers, appear to be stalling, several other bills have
gathered new momentum in recent days and may find their way through
the legislative maze.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, during speeches on the Senate floor
last week that totalled nearly five hours, had complained that the
Republian leadership was blocking votes on the managed-care bill,
which he strongly supports, and on a plan to raise the minimum wage
by one dollar over two years, to $6.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Kennedy said he had won the right to a Senate vote
on the minimum wage bill. If he is successful Tuesday, the minimum
wage hike would be attached to a bill that would make it harder for
people to escape their debts by declaring personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also said Republicans will be sure to move other bills
through Congress, such as a measure to reauthorize $40 billion in
college loan and other higher education programs, because the GOP
cannot be seen as impeding those programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote as early as this week on a
contentious bill that would allow high-tech companies, and certain
other businesses, to hire more skilled foreign workers for US jobs.
The measure is bitterly opposed by labor unions and high-tech
worker groups.

LET'S TALK ABOUT LYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Lying _ yes. Perjury _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Down the first road lies a nonpartisan accommodation to the
principled leadership of people like Senator Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut Democrat, who insist that President Clinton's conduct
that is wrong and immoral be subject to a public rebuke while also
taking the view that off the evidence that is known, talk of
impeachment or resignation is unwise and unjust.
</P>
<P>
   Down the second road lies a partisan insistence on the political
death penalty, which will produce a partisan defense against a
charge that cannot be proved in an adversary proceeding. It will
also produce months of ugly and disgusting proceedings that are
more likely to infuriate Americans of all persuasions than produce
a consensus for action that can withstand the stern test of
history.
</P>
<P>
   If it's about lying, we can talk. More than that, the case can
almost certainly be settled in a way that condemns the president's
behavior while respecting the country's solidly anti-impeachment
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is insisted that we talk about the crime called
perjury, there will be a fight, with virtually no chance of a
widely accepted result.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear by now that the president is prepared to
acknowledge more than his horrid behavior, that to keep his sexual
encounters with Monica Lewinsky secret he did something all of us
can understand in English as lying.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear yet to the country that perjury is a crime
that encompasses far more than lying, and far more than the facts
as known in the case will support.
</P>
<P>
   That will change.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most politicians and press commentators are lazily
sliding past the issue by confusing lying with perjury, and
ridiculing Clinton's lawyers for pointing out distinctions that are
central to hundreds of years of legal history and tradition. They
easily score political points.
</P>
<P>
   However, that momentary advantage is trumped by the card the
Clinton side can eventually play with a vengeance. At some point,
the sound bites about hair-splitting will be irrelevant and the job
will fall to somebody to prove perjury with evidence and witnesses.
And that simply cannot be done in this case without flouting some
precious principles that protect individuals from the long arm of
an irresponsible state.
</P>
<P>
   From Ken Starr's report and the two rebuttals by the president's
lawyers, it is clear that the core of the assertions of perjury in
Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and his
Aug. 17 testimony to Starr's grand jury is the allegation that the
president aroused Lewinsky sexually. Both sides agree that if he
did, that conduct falls within the tortured definition of sex
proposed by the Paula Jones lawyers and modified by the trial
judge.
</P>
<P>
   That allegation, for obvious reasons, comes only from Lewinsky,
and it is denied by the president in his Aug. 17 testimony.
</P>
<P>
   To proceed, the House Judiciary (and perhaps some months from
now the Senate in a trial) would have to produce Lewinsky to
testify about sex acts in even more detail than was gratuitously
summarized ad nauseam in Starr's report. And this testimony, unlike
her grand jury appearances, would include cross-examination and
other testimony putting her credibility in question _ which eight
months of madness around here has indicated is the size of Mt.
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one of the basic elements of the US law of perjury is
that one witness doesn't make a case _ that at least one
independent form of corroboration, meaning it could stand
regardless of whether the other witness existed, is required.
</P>
<P>
   This is not hair-splitting. It is part of British and American
tradition to keep that state from using perjury as a back-door
means of getting ``something'' on a target or as a form of illegal
entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, it is settled US law that perjury is not a
strictly accurate statement that nonetheless implies something that
is false or masks the full truth; nor is perjury any answer to a
question found to be vague or convoluted such as the Jones lawyers'
sex query; nor is an incomplete answer perjury because the burden
is properly on the questioner to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   The classic illustration in the Clinton case is his lawyer, Bob
Bennett's entreaty to his Jones counterparts in the deposition:
``Why don't they ask the president what he did, what he didn't do,
and then we can argue in court later about what it means?'' They
never did. And yet, it is obvious that the president did not just
behave immorally, he lied.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for grownups should not be to play perjury games
for another year, but to settle this case with the admission and
public rebuke that would make the sanction fit the offense and
produce not only justice but the ending the public ardently
desires.

CONNECTICUT SUB WORKS HAS THAT SINKING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; GROTON, Conn. _ It's out there somewhere, running quiet and
deep in the Atlantic, working out final bugs that separate it from
joining the Navy's fleet and placing a melancholy punctuation mark
on a shipbuilding tradition humbled by peace.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Connecticut _ the first submarine named for a state
synonmous with submersible ships _ will be commissioned late this
year. It will notch the end of an era when almost limitless
Pentagon budgets meant bountiful paychecks and full-speed work
schedules on a waterfront whose heritage dates to 1900 and the
nation's first submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, everybody's father worked there. Your brother
worked there. You're uncle worked there,'' said John Yates, a
retired submarine-builder, sipping a cold beer at the Sea Romer
Cafe, up the street from the Electric Boat shipyard here. ``And it
was all guaranteed work.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War, we made all kinds of money. But when the
Berlin Wall fell, everybody started to save money. You look at that
shipyard today and it's kind of sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along Eastern Point Road, where generations of workers
have assembled submarines with names like Scorpion and Skipjack,
Catfish and Carp, Baltimore and Boston, a leisurely rhythm outside
Electric Boat's main gate has supplanted the pell-mell shift change
tableau that symbolized the shipyard's heyday of the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Its payroll has been cut from a Reagan-era high of 18,500 to a
post-Cold War 7,800, a seismic downsizing whose epicenter here
still struggles to adjust to life in a world without superpower
villains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When World War II was over, you had a big party and everybody
wanted to go home,'' said John K. Welch, a 48-year-old Waltham
native who is EB's president. ``At the end of the Cold War, there
wasn't that euphoria. People were asking, `What's next?' It's been
a rough transition. The hardest part for everybody is dealing with
changes that have been required.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists, union leaders, and ex-shipyard workers said those
changes mean more stress and more uncertainty as the demand for a
highly skilled manufacturing work force is eclipsed by a premium on
technology and a more service-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom times of the '80s were euphoric. They were unnatural.
They were giddy,'' said Will McEachern, an economics professor at
the University of Connecticut. ``The region is doing pretty well
now, but that doesn't mean that certain people didn't take a great
hit because they did.''
</P>
<P>
   McEachern said some casual observors assume that laid off
shipyard workers simply shifted their morning commute slightly
north and west and exchanged their pipefitters' wrenches for the
roulette wheels and gaming chips at the nearby Foxwoods and Mohegan
Sun casinos. In fact, said McEachern, only a fraction of EB's
workers ended up in the casinos, with most settling for other less
well-paying jobs in southeastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks are working two or three jobs now, and their
standard of living has changed,'' said Kenneth DelaCruz, president
of the 2,000-member Metal Trades Council, a blue-collar union whose
membership once topped 10,000. ``It's deceiving when you pick up
the paper and see that unemployment in this region is low. That's
probably true, but the quality of life for these folks and for
their families has changed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   As a testimonial to those displaced workers and to the
generations of welders, boilermakers, painters, carpenters,
machinists, electricians, engineers, and designers who preceded
them, the Navy has designated the second of its three Seawolf
submarines for the state that turned out 85 submarines for World
War II, built the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS
Nautilus, in 1955, and has designed 15 of the 18 classes of nuclear
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Only Electric Boat and a shipyard in Newport News, Va., build US
submarines. And the Navy, which in the 1980s would sometimes order
three or four subs a year, has drastically cut back. In fiscal year
1999, one sub is being requested. The following year, none is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest moment will come Dec. 11, when we commission her
and that crew runs aboard that ship and the Navy takes command,''
said Dee Hauber, a former Groton mayor and a member of the USS
Connecticut's commissioning committee. ``That's genuine tradition.
I mean I get goose bumps just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 billion, 353-foot submarine will be the fifth ship
named for the fifth state of the union, but the first submarine to
carry the name Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the second of its sea trials off the New England coast,
where its propulsion plant and engines are tested, the Connecticut
will carry a crew of 130. And when it joins the fleet, it will be
armed with Mark 48 antisubmarine torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Navy takes over the Connecticut &UR;  &LR; in December, Electric
Boat shipyard will not deliver another submarine to the Navy for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents the end of a very robust nuclear construction
program that went throughout the Cold War and then overlapped into
the years after the Cold War,'' said Welch. ``It's a tribute to the
heritage that the whole state has had in support of the military
for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a state that made cannons for the Revolutionary War,
gunpowder for the Civil War, and helicopters for the Persian Gulf
War, workers along the Thames River waterfront worry that
submarines are becoming more a part of history than an economic
fixture of the future.
</P>
<P>
   So, they say, the upcoming commissioning ceremony, with its
spit-and-polish pomp, marching bands, balloons, and confetti, will
be a bittersweet moment for the workers who for generations worked
in numbing cold and searing heat to turn out sophisticated
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric Boat is never going to be the way it was before,''
said James Gula, who worked in the warehouses for 25 years before
retiring recently. ``But we build the best submarines in the world
and we should be recognized for that. But I think it's a shame to
lose all those skilled workers over there.''
</P>
<P>
   DelaCruz said many workers are haunted by the view of the
shipyard's waterfront, once jammed with ships under construction,
but now nearly vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very sad,'' he said. ``That's the only thing we do ...
build submarines. You walk through the yard and it's a skeleton of
what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Navy announced last week that it was naming an entire
new class of fast-attack submarines for the state of Virginia, home
to EB's submarine-building competitor, some workers here said they
were further demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future looks dim,'' said Melvin E. Olsson, president of
the Marine Draftsmen's Association, a white-collar EB union.
``It'll be exciting to see the Connecticut commissioned, but it's
disappointing to see what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very quiet in the yard now. You can walk through and you
don't see many people. The work force is much older. The younger
people have been laid off. Your neighbors used to work there. Your
grandfather used to work there. It's not going to be like that
anymore. Now, your relative is just as likely to be a blackjack
dealer up at Foxwoods.''

MARIS DOESN'T NEED A PLACE IN THE HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mark McGwire was holding history in his hands. As
McGwire squeezed the 37-year-old Roger Maris bat, which had been
resting comfortably in a glass case at the baseball Hall of Fame,
tears came to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire took the barrel of the bat that delivered home run No.
61 in 1961, rubbed it over his heart and looked skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger,'' McGwire said, ``I hope you're with me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, McGwire hit his record-setting 62nd home run of the
season. One of the lingering moments of that magical, mystical
night in St. Louis came when McGwire climbed into the stands to
embrace Maris' children. During a post-game ceremony honoring
McGwire, the crowd showered the Maris children with the sort of
cheers and affection and understanding that so often eluded their
father when he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Life dealt Roger Maris the sort of hand you might wish on an
Internal Revenue Service auditor. Maris broke Babe Ruth's season
home run record, and people didn't take kindly to a mere mortal
having the audacity to put a chink in a legend's armor. Injuries
subsequently prevented Maris from having the sort of career that he
might have had. Then cancer came along and robbed Maris of the
golden years ahead of him. Maris died when he was only 51, leaving
behind a wife and six children.
</P>
<P>
   Any heart has to melt when confronted by a family that will
never be whole again in this lifetime. The natural impulse is to
try to heal all the scars the Maris family has accumulated. The
resulting clamor to bring closure by inducting Maris into the Hall
of Fame is as understandable as it is ill-conceived. Emotion, not
reality, is the only thing that can fuel a campaign to put Maris in
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: What Maris did in 1961 was monumental. Denny
McLain had a similar breakthrough in 1968, when he became the first
pitcher in 34 years to win 30 games. Nobody has come close to
winning 30 in a season since, but that didn't get McLain in the
Hall of Fame. McLain doesn't belong there, because his entire
career (131-91, on Most Valuable Player award, two Cy Youngs, three
All-Star selections) doesn't have enough substance.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame status is based on the body of work of an entire
career. Maris played 12 seasons in the major leagues. He hit 275
home runs, drove in 851 runs, batted .260. He won the American
League MVP award twice, made four All-Star teams, played in seven
World Series, drove in 100 runs three times, won one Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Maris had an enviable career, but he couldn't sustain his
greatness long enough to earn enshrinement in at the Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One of Maris' contemporaries was fellow right fielder Rocky
Colavito. In just two more seasons than Maris, Colavito accumulated
374 homers and drove in 1,159 runs. Colavito made the All-Star team
five times, drove in 100 runs six times. When it comes to the Hall
of Fame, Maris needs to get in a long line that by no means starts
with Colavito.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ennis had more homers and runs batted in than Maris. Does
anybody really think Del Ennis is a Hall of Famer? Maris had a
lower career home run total than the likes of Bob Johnson, Rudy
York, Jimmy Wynn, Kent Hrbek, Roy Sievers, Willie Horton and Joe
Adcock. Fine players, all of them, but hardly Cooperstown-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Boog Powell, Bill Buckner, Vic Wertz, Mickey Vernon, Al Oliver
and Darrell Evans aren't beating down the doors to Cooperstown, and
they all drove in at least 300 more runs than Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Whether injuries or anguish kept Maris from accomplishing more
isn't relevant. He did what he did, with no apologies or excuses
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris used to say, ``I just wanted to be one of the guys,
an average player having a good season.'' He had a sublime season
once upon 1961, and he deserves credit and recognition for what he
did. He is on display in an exhibit alongside McGwire and Sammy
Sosa. He deserves nothing less and nothing more.

<P>
   Rick Mahoney believes that most people have it wrong about
folks, himself included, who drive convertibles. They think we
lower our tops to let the sun shine in, he says. Which is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the sun,'' Mahoney pointed out one recent
afternoon as he relaxed behind the wheel of his 1990 BMW at
Wollaston Beach in Quincy, across the harbor from Boston. ``It's
about the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's about a lot of things. But Mahoney, a freelance
visual consultant who owns two other convertibles, knows that many
people look at a retractable top and see only a bad hair day.
They'd rather ride in a fully enclosed, climate-controlled box,
where the sounds and smells of the roadway _ and yes, the sky _ are
kept outside.
</P>
<P>
   But the convertible won't go away. Thirty-four models are on the
market this year, and so far they represent about 3.3 percent of
new passenger car sales. That may not sound like much, especially
when compared with the 7 percent figure of the early 1960s, but
don't forget that topless sales increased 11.4 percent last year
and 20.4 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Especially don't forget that the convertible nearly expired a
quarter of a century ago. During that dark hour, amid concerns
about auto safety and street crime, the Big Three US automakers
actually stopped making the toys of summer. There was even a novel
titled ``The Last Convertible.''
</P>
<P>
   But toplessness was reborn during the 1980s, first on the wheels
of Chrysler's K-car and later on Mazda's Miata. Now you see
convertibles at the beach, the mall, the PTO meeting, everywhere.
(But remember this: No self-respecting convertible owner refers to
his or her car as a ``ragtop,'' and hasn't since about 1958.)
</P>
<P>
   For Fred Taylor, convertibles never went away. It was as a
teenager back in the 1940s that Taylor, now a Boston music
producer, convinced his mother that what she really needed was a
Chevrolet convertible. A decade later he was able to purchase his
own Chevy, a classic '57 Bel Air, which began a string of five
topless cars. (Taylor concedes that he does not part with
automobiles easily, having owned them as long as 15 years.)
``Nothing has ever made me feel like the next car I buy would be an
enclosed car,'' he says, spitting out the last two words as if they
were the name of an ancient enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Like most owners of convertibles, Taylor does not easily put
into sentences the pleasures derived from driving a car without a
top. He talks about the ``openness'' of the experience, as do we
all. But he begins to cut to the core when he says: ``It's just ...
it's almost like you're walking. You're looking up at things, down
at things, sideways at things. You're more aware of what's going on
around you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one other thing, adds Taylor: ``You can get a tan going
somewhere in a convertible. You don't have to actually be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one word that the serious owners of convertibles
inevitably fall back on, it is this: freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to explain,'' sighs Goldie Muise, a postal clerk
who owns both a 1976 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1980 Ford Mustang
convertible. ``You don't feel like you're closed up inside a metal
crate. And there's a feeling of living to the fullest, of really
being able to enjoy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, people notice when we drive our convertibles. They
notice Oscar Guardado, a 24-year-old landscaper, and not just
because he recently had his 1989 Mustang painted a color that can
only be described as orange-on-orange. Or because the convertible's
trunk is chock full of heart-stopping sub-woofers.
</P>
<P>
   They even notice Guardado when he parks his car at Revere Beach
and sits proudly atop the seawall behind it. ``So many girls ask
me, `Take me for a ride, take me for a ride,''' he says, beaming.
``And some people stop and say, `Hey, you want to sell it?' But I
say, `No, it's my toy.' I call it `my honey.' And my girlfriend
says, `Oh, your car's your honey?' But she doesn't want me to sell
it either.''
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be statistically proven, but it appears likely that,
like Taylor, we convertible owners keep our cars longer than
non-convertible owners. There's some kind of mystical connection
between driver and car that can't be found with a sedan, a station
wagon, or _ God forbid _ an SUV. Dr. Richard Sullivan, who has
owned his 1959 Triumph TR3 for 14 years, talks about driving being
a more ``active'' process with the top down. ``You're more part of
the experience of driving,'' he contends. ``It's like riding a
horse. I truly, truly love doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s and 1960s, Sullivan had several friends who
owned convertibles but who eventually abandoned the genre. ``I
guess they grew up,'' he notes sadly. Actually, the auto industry
feels that the principal customers for convertibles are not young
people, but older folks with the cash to buy them. They're seen as
``reward'' cars for hard-working baby boomers, or as midlife-crisis
cars for folks grappling with middle age. ``Image enhancers'' is
how George Pipas, Ford Motor Co.'s sales analysis manager,
describes them.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just maybe, convertibles are coming back simply
because they're fun to drive. That's what Jennifer Jacobs, a
20-year-old medical assistant _ no midlife crisis there _
discovered in April when she bought a 1996 Chrysler Sebring
convertible. At the time, Jacobs's idea of letting in the sky
consisted of purchasing a car with a sunroof. But she talked
herself into the real deal instead, and now the first thing she
does when she leaves work in the evening is put the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest us who drive convertibles, Jacobs is hooked. This
may be her first topless car, she declares, but it won't be her
last. ``I don't think,'' she says from behind the wheel, ``that I
could get used to a regular car after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could?

DISCORD FADES, HARMONY REIGNS FOR PEARL JAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wait a minute. A happy Pearl Jam?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a contradiction?
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's what we're hearing as Pearl Jam continues its first
large-scale tour in years. Once known for its moody bickering with
record industry Philistines and corporate giant Ticketmaster, Pearl
Jam has settled back into music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a different place now,'' says bassist Jeff Ament.
``We're just trying to grow as artists and as friends. ... For us,
it's all about the creative process and making records and getting
into a room together and pushing ourselves. We're just trying to
write great songs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Seattle-based Pearl Jam always has tried to do since
exploding on the scene with the 1992 album ``Ten,'' which sold 10
million copies. But such surreal sales (``It was just a completely
different reality than any of us had ever seen,'' says Ament)
eventually caused tensions within the band and with the outside
world. The group pulled back and even stopped making videos (only
recently did it resume with a video for ``Do the Evolution'') and
generally stopped touring because it wouldn't play Ticketmaster
venues, saying the service fees were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam has since compromised and is playing some Ticketmaster
venues, but the band doesn't have any regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were doing what we felt was the right thing,''
Ament says from a New York tour stop. ``The fact that people are
still talking about it is just something for the media to pile on
top of. Every preview I've read about this tour says something
about having backed down from battling the Ticketmaster giant or
whatever. But, man, all we want to do is play music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt there were people out there who had nothing to do with
music and felt they were bigger than music. And that's what
bothered us,'' says Ament. ``I think it still bothers us when we
run into people like that, whether it be an occasional promoter or
someone who just doesn't know a damn thing about what's going on in
the music world. But right now, we just want to play music and make
records.''
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't been fully understood is how much internal strife
the band had to face to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the whole Ticketmaster thing, there were other
things going on within the band,'' says Ament. ``We were going
through personnel changes and it was probably an all-time low in
terms of how we were communicating with each other. That had as
much or more to do with us not touring than the Ticketmaster thing.
From the outside world, people can't see what's going on within the
band, so everybody just blames Ticketmaster. But I really don't
think it was a time that we could have toured and survived. We were
still figuring out a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   One was a change in drummers _ Dave Abbruzzee was replaced by
Jack Irons, who was replaced for the new tour by former Soundgarden
drummer Matt Cameron. According to some reports, Irons didn't want
to tour because he's dealing with manic depression. ``Matt's a
total pro,'' Ament says, though he admits the band will face a
tough decision later on whether to invite Irons back or continue
with Cameron. ``Both are great guys; both are great drummers,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Pearl Jam's charter members (singer Eddie Vedder,
guitarist Mike McCready, and rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard, and
Ament) have learned to talk more openly with each other, which has
fostered the harmony and optimism of the current tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some bands, such as Aerosmith, Pearl Jam didn't hire
therapists to facilitate communication. They handled it in-house,
via band meetings that have now become a staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days when we said, `hey, let's have a meeting,'
everybody kind of felt like, uh oh, it's like a teacher or a
principal calling you into the office,'' says Ament. ``Now, it's
just part of how we do things. Probably once a week when we're on
the road, we'll sit down and talk about how things are going, what
we need to do, what we want to do, what people's individual needs
are, or what's upcoming. It just feels more natural now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some group members also ventured into side projects to build
confidence (Ament with the band Three Fish, McCready with Mad
Season, and Gossard with Brad). And though Pearl Jam's album sales
have fallen with the last two records (``No Code'' and ``Yield''
each sold one million-plus), Ament says, ``I know for a fact we're
writing better songs now.''
</P>
<P>
   The songwriting is also more democratic: Ament and Gossard have
increased their roles, relieving the pressure on Vedder. The music
has grown more complex, if less adrenalized, than on the earlier,
Led Zeppelin-influenced albums ``Ten'' and ``vs.'' There remains a
core of fans that wants the group to revive that early style (as
heard in hits ``Jeremy'' and ``Alive''), but Ament says that was
another time and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes for me, it's hard to go back and listen to that
stuff because it feels like something we wrote when we were kids,''
he says. ``There was a real simple purity in those songs, and
that's definitely something that we try to retain to some degree,
but we've had more life experiences since then. We're just trying
to approach writing as honestly as we can. And we still play some
of those songs on tour.''

SO MANY GREAT PLACES TO VIEW FALL'S FINERY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Everyone's favorite question at this time of year: ``Where's the
best foliage?''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont and New Hampshire may be the states that first come to
mind, but Maine claims it not only has spectacular color but is
promoting the state as a ``welcoming, must-see destination, with
lots of interesting and unique things to see and do,'' according to
Dann Lewis of the Maine Office of Tourism. ``We want to show people
there is more to do in Maine than simply look at leaf color.''
</P>
<P>
   The many activities, Lewis says, set Maine apart from its
``competitors'' (and you know who they are). Maine is out to be the
``Outdoor Adventure Capital of the East'' and as such offers a
bountiful list of autumn activities, from white-water rafting and
windjammer sailing to hiking and biking.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hits of Maine's foliage season is the ``leaf lady.''
If you're on the Internet, check out the state's Web site at
www.visitmaine.com, where you can get in touch with Susan Benson,
the ``leaf lady,'' who will answer just about any foliage-related
question you can think of. In 1996, her site on the Web generated
just 4,700 hits all year; this August alone, there were 73,000
hits.
</P>
<P>
   For those not on the Web, head for Maine and stop at the
Interstate 95 information center just across the border in Kittery
where you'll find lots of ideas for foliage viewing and things to
do. Last year while attending a wedding, I was throughly impressed
with the early October colors along the coastal route between York
and Ogunquit. For Maine information and foliage reports, call
888-624-6345.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in ``competitor'' Vermont, reports of pockets of
colors emerging in higher elevations and in scattered wetlands are
growing. Among a couple of routes with good color now are Route 9
from Brattleboro to Wilmington and Route 100 to the Mount Snow ski
area. For foliage reports, events, and vacation planning kits, call
800-VERMONT or visit www.travel.vermont.com. Vermont also offers an
automated fax service that provides foliage information by calling
800-833-9756.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, by the way, claims its foliage is better than others
because the state has good soils that favor tree species such as
maples and a climate said to be conductive to foliage coloration.
Vermont has a fairly long season of cold nights and warm days,
which are needed for good color production.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has, perhaps, the most famous foliage road in the
county, the Kancamagus Highway, or Route 112. This 34-mile stretch
of White Mountain National Forest road that runs between Lincoln
and Conway has views that are second to none _ towering mountain
peaks, wonderfully clear streams, and scenic vistas that offer
spectacular views. While in the area, take the Loon Mountain
gondola ride in Lincoln for more great views or head to North
Conway for a ride aboard the Conway Scenic Railway and then take in
some outlet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Call the state's foliage line at 800-258-3608 for the latest
color report. Or, for a 215-page guide to the state, call
800-FUN-IN-NH, ext 200.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the most enjoyable areas of New Hampshire is
the Monadnock Region, an area of picturesque villages (Fitzwilliam,
pictured on the front of the Travel section, is one of the classic
towns), antiquing, the arts, scenic drives, and rolling hills.
Mount Monadnock, easily reached from Boston, is known as the most
climbed mountain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The area abounds in wonderful inns and bed-and-breakfasts. The
Fitzwilliam Inn (603-585-9000), which has been welcoming guests for
200 years, reports it still has some space during foliage season.
Also in Fitzwilliam are the Ashburn House (603-585-7198), Hanna
Davis House (603-585-3344), and the Amos A. Parker House
(603-585-6540). Fitzwilliam is convenient for those without cars
because the Vermont Transit Bus Line offers service from Boston to
the Fitzwilliam Inn (call 800-451-3292). For other information,
call the Chamber of Commerce in Keene (603-352-1303), Jaffrey
(603-532-4549), or Rindge (603-899-5051).
</P>
<P>
   ``The foliage in Connecticut could be the best ever this year,''
said Don Smith, chief of the state bureau of forestry. And, adding
to the confusion as to where the best color is, Smith says
Connecticut's geography makes it the perfect destination for lovers
of fall foliage. ``Just as northern New England's fall foliage is
winding down, Connecticut's colors are getting ready for their big
burst of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's tourism hot line, 800-CT-BOUND, ext. 88, allows
travelers to book accommodations of every type, as well as provide
information on events during foliage season, and there are plenty,
ranging from the Bristol Mum Festival, Sept. 25-Oct. 11; the Durham
Fair, now in its 79th year, Sept. 25-27; the Southington Apple
Harvest Festival, Oct. 3-4 and 8-11; to the Chowderfest at Mystic
Seaport, Oct. 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many driving tours to catch the state's foliage,
one of the best ways to enjoy it is on foot. Every Columbus Day
weekend, the state's northeast corner, or ``Quiet Corner,'' holds a
Walking Weekend with more than 50 guided itineraries for every
fitness level throughout 25 towns. For information, call the
Northeast Visitors District at 888-628-1228.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, too, has great colors in the fall. And the
easiest way to catch some great views is to get on Route 2 in
Cambridge and head west. The only problem with Route 2 is that,
especially on Columbus Day weekend, the road can become jam-packed
in the Mohawk Trail region, which has its beginnings in Orange.
Last year, I tried to get to Greenfield's Fall Festival on the
Common (Oct. 10, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. this year) and gave up just
after the French King Bridge in Erving because of traffic. But
then, I see this area weekly on shopping trips to Greenfield, so
don't give up _ its worth the slow going. More on that festival and
others in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As in Connecticut, the Bay State's colors seem to peak on
Columbus Day weekend and continue for almost the rest of the month.
The best part of being in the Boston area is that you don't have to
drive far to catch the colors. Leaf peepers need only head to the
Blue Hills Reservation, a 5,000- acre wilderness less than 10 miles
from the city proper. Drive through the reservation, easily reached
from either the Southeast Expressway or Route 128 in the
Canton-Randolph area, then drive back into the city via Canton
Avenue and you'll think you're in New Hampshire, especially when
you pass the classic white churches near Randolph Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In central Massachusetts, one thing to do is to get lost in a
maze _ a four-acre field of tall sorghum grass. There are some 2.2
miles of pathways at the Davis' Farmland in Sterling. The design of
the maze is inspired by a Celtic dragon motif, the work of Adrian
Fisher, an English maze designer. The field will be open until
frost or tramping feet push it under. The maze is on Route 62 on
Redstone Hill Road in Sterling; admission is $7.50 for those 13 to
59; $5.50 for the 4-to-12 set and those over 60. There is also a
petting zoo with a separate admission. For information, call
978-422-6666.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away in Princeton is Mount Wachusett, perhaps best known
for its handy ski slopes in winter. But in foliage season you can
drive to its top for stunning views. Or you could hike it as Henry
David Thoreau did in 1842; he then dreamed of Homer on Mount
Olympus and read Virgil in the original Latin. Mount Wachusett
rises 2,006 feet, so you might want to drive up.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, though, has something special when it comes to
colorful fall shows _ the cranberry harvest, where you'll see
flooded bogs where berries float to the surface, forming a
brilliant red carpet of color. The Cranberry Harvest Festival, Oct.
10-12 takes place at two sites: at the Edaville Cranberry Bogs off
Route 58 in South Carver (call 508-295-5799) and at Cranberry World
on the waterfront in Plymouth (call 508-747-2350). While in the
area, take in King Richard's Faire, where Renaissance swordplay,
music, entertainment, crafts, and food are featured (call
508-866-5391). The faire is held weekends through Oct. 18.

BLEDSOE'S TEAMMATES PLAYING FOLLOW THE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It's an intangible, so it cannot be
measured. It's a subtlety, so it can be felt more than diagrammed.
Drew Bledsoe does seem to be a different quarterback this season.
</P>
<P>
   Two games does not a season make, but Bledsoe seems to be
playing much more within himself. A different level of poise seems
to be there, as well as a higher degree of maturity. Most of all,
Bledsoe seems to be in full control of New England's offense,
making plays but not mistakes. In short, Bledsoe seems more what a
quarterback must be if a team is to go to the Super Bowl: a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The change seems so evident that Vincent Brisby went home after
Sunday night's 29-6 win over the Colts and ``I was telling my mom
that Drew is in more control this year,'' said the Patriot wide
receiver. ``He's the leader out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans might be able to sense from afar a change in Bledsoe's
quarterbacking, but that change is more clear to those most close
to Bledsoe, such as his pal and backup quarterback, Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it in his eyes this year,'' said Zolak, ``as
opposed to last year or the year before. You could really see it in
his eyes before the Denver game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that Denver game, the season opener, the media and
chatterers ``talked about his big-game jinx and all that, which is
a bunch of malarkey,'' said Zolak. At Mile High Stadium, though,
``you could just see _ he had a fiery disposition about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   And when things didn't go well early for the Patriots in Denver,
said Zolak, ``Drew was actually pretty ticked off when somebody
made a bad play or we had a bad call go against us. That's
something you hadn't seen before. He seems a lot more fiery this
year, more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative, of course, that Bledsoe be a leader for this
offense that is, as coach Pete Carroll put it Monday, ``still a
work in progress.'' New England's running game is sporadic, at
best, and impotent at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you've got a fiery leader _ a Brett Favre type _
that the other guys play harder,'' said Zolak. ``And I think that's
what we've been doing, playing harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bledsoe also seems to be playing well within himself. In
Denver, he threw one pass to Ben Coates into nearly triple coverage
(which Coates caught), but overall Bledsoe's decisions through the
first two games have been sound. He has thrown no interceptions,
while he has thrown many passes demonstrating Bledsoe at his best,
such as the TD pass to Brisby late in the Denver game and a
perfectly timed stop-and-go pass to Shawn Jefferson along the right
sideline for 38 yards in the Colts game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing within himself,'' said Zolak. ``And he's doing a
good job of not looking at Ben on those third-and-5s or
third-and-7s, or just looking to Terry (Glenn). He's spreading the
ball around real well, using the underneath guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak also noticed a change in that ultimate intangible, poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something bad happens,'' said Zolak, ``like last week in
Denver when we were down, 17-0, Drew kept his poise real well. When
things are going bad, he's not getting rattled. He's a leader and
that's the onus he has to put on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Patriots say much the same. Jefferson said Bledsoe now
enters the huddle and tells receivers, ``This ball is coming to
you.'' Brisby said Bledsoe ``is more of a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see he's more fiery,'' said receiver Troy Brown.
``He's just being Drew Bledsoe to me. He's making great throws and
he's doing a great job of making the defense move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, said Brisby, ``now is challenging the guys in the
huddle _ like Favre does _ and the guys love it. Drew is telling
guys to step up and in the huddle he's saying, `I'm bringing this
play to you, so you'd better be ready.' I'm just thinking that he's
feeling more comfortable about everything and himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, said Brisby, ``Drew knows that he's the key to making
us get to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first two games at least, Bledsoe is playing
exactly that part.

SOSA A BIG HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ You couldn't blame Sammy Sosa for feeling at home in
Qualcomm Stadium Monday night. The voices he heard were in both
English and Spanish. The affection he felt was genuine. Move over,
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa may be running No. 2 in the baseball popularity contest,
but he went into Monday night tied in the home run race with
McGwire at 62. The tortoise had caught the hare, and don't be
surprised if it's Sosa out in front at the finish line, with the
home run title and the hearts of baseball fans to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a beautiful phone call from President Bill Clinton,''
said Sosa in a press conference before the Cubs-Padres game that
drew nearly as many Spanish media as English-speaking reporters.
``It's something that makes me real proud of myself. In fact, after
I hung up, I was jumping up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He congratulated me,'' continued Sosa, who belted homers No.
61 and 62 Sunday in Chicago. ``He saw an interview that my mother
had and liked it. He said he was a Chicago Cubs fans. He told me he
wanted me to take the Cubs to the playoffs. I told him I'd do my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing the race to Roger Maris's mark of 61 a week ago to
McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinals slugger, Sosa has risen from a
premature burial by many of the nation's media and fans. This is
the same Sammy Sosa who once trailed McGwire, 24-9, yet pulled into
ties at 47 and 55. All told, Sosa hit four homers over the weekend
to draw even again after McGwire had belted his 62d to establish a
new record and set the nation afire last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that this will be a fight to the finish. Sosa is
having too much fun to have it go down any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people want to know if I think I haven't gotten as much
out of this as McGwire,'' said Sosa. ``The attention I have been
having all year has been good enough for me. Mark did it first. He
was the man. I'm just so happy to be playing in the United States
and be the person that I am. I'm pleased with what I have right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico only 20 miles away, Sosa devoted more than half of
his pregame remarks to a Spanish-speaking audience. The questions
took a different tone, more about Sosa's inner feelings than his
battle with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to the whole Latin American community, and the people in
the United States who gave me the chance to be who I am, that this
is unbelievable,'' said Sosa, a native of the Dominican Republic.
``I've only got one way to go. Maybe after it's over, I can look
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes this a nice situation is to be in a
wild-card race. I don't have to go out there and think about home
runs. Somebody asked me who is my idol. My idol is God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy loves it,'' said Cubs teammate Mark Grace. ``I don't
blame him _ I'd love it, too. He's an outgoing, fun-loving type of
person. He likes to share his accomplishment with his family and
friends. He doesn't close himself off. I think he's enjoying the
heck out of this and this is what makes him tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did this year compares to two Hall of Famers, Ryne
Sandberg and Andre Dawson. What he's doing this year makes those
guys look like kindergarteners.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said he didn't know what it will take for Sosa to get the
kind of recognition that McGwire does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine it will be when he hits more home runs than
McGwire,'' said Grace. ``Whoever does that has the record and for
Sammy to get the all-time record, that is what has got to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange situation. Whoever thought two guys would
do it? It's been an amazing year. The postseason is where you
shine. Sammy needs to get to the playofffs and he deserves to get
there. It's up to the rest of us to pull our load.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of San Diego tried to do the right thing Monday
night. Sosa was given a glowing introduction and a standing
ovation. But such things, he says, are just icing on the cake of
life. His goal is simple: help the Cubs reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates are 100 percent behind me,'' said Sosa. ``They
know that I try to do my best and help this team reach the
playoffs. That's why the home runs aren't a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa says his day is coming. He heard from McGwire Monday.
Comissioner Bud Selig, who skipped Sunday's exploits in Chicago
against his Brewers, also checked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is still the man,'' said Sosa. ``We are two people who
are working so hard and out chasing history. But we're not enemies.
We have a good relationship. I think that Mark McGwire is one of
the good friends that I have. He called me to congratulate me and
told me to keep going. Let's see how it goes.''

SOME FIND LESSONS IN WATERGATE FOR CLINTON'S TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leonard Garment, who was President Nixon's counsel
during the darkest days of the Watergate scandal and is now keenly
watching President Clinton's impeachment troubles, finds himself
humming the old song, ``Who's Sorry Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Garment, 74, is one of many former Nixon aides watching the
unfolding Clinton saga with a combination of bemusement and
bitterness. Without any prompting, he notes that two of the
``archetypal lawyers'' on the staff of the House Judiciary
Committee in 1974 were Hillary Rodham _ she didn't use the name
Clinton then _ and Bernard Nussbaum, Clinton's former White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the current members of the House Judiciary Committee say
they are reluctantly considering the possibility of impeachment,
Garment said the committee staff and members in 1974 expressed
``all the piety and the sanctimony, that `it breaks our heart to do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Garment said, ``We lived in a high-altitude climate of
anger, a world of enemies. They had a sense of mission, not a sense
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, it is inevitable that comparisons are being made to
Nixon's experience with impeachment proceedings. While there are
major differences between Watergate and Clinton's current
predicament, there are lessons for both the president's defenders
and detractors in what happened during a summer that forever
changed American political life 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican
who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said last week
that he is using the committee's work in 1974 _ which led to a
bipartisan vote for articles of impeachment against Nixon _ as a
model for dealing with the allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge that the same courtesy extended to President Nixon
will be extended to this president,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, this is not necessarily good news. Republicans hold
a majority in the House and thus are more inclined to vote against
Clinton, just as the Democrats controlled the House in 1974 and
were more likely to vote against Nixon. The move toward approving
the articles of impeachment grew as Nixon lost Republican support,
and the same could happen to Clinton if Democrats start abandoning
him.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the old Nixon hands have bitter memories of the
House Judiciary Committee, one Democrat who served on the panel in
1974 said that Nixon was treated better than Clinton has been so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Former Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York Democrat
who sat on the Judiciary Committee in 1974, said that Hyde already
has dealt unfairly with Clinton by voting for the release of the
independent counsel's report about the president's relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Watergate, the impeachment effort came about because
the American people demanded it when Richard Nixon had (special
prosecutor) Archibald Cox fired and the attorney general resigned
and the country said, `Enough is enough,''' Holtzman said. ``Here
you have impeachment proceedings being triggered by one person, the
independent counsel, about whom serious questions of conflict of
interest have been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Holtzman said, ``The report is being made public
before the commmittee has a chance to review it. During Watergate,
the House Judiciary bent over backwards to be fair to the
president. We always gave him the benefit of giving us his views.
Here you have a report by a special independent counsel who is
defining impeachable offenses for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not what Holtzman imagined would happen when she helped
write the law that allows an independent counsel to present
evidence of possible impeachable offenses to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of the authors of the special prosecutor law, I am
ashamed to say,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr highlights
the major difference between the way Congress handled the Clinton
and Nixon cases

   During Watergate, a committee led by Senator Sam Ervin of North
Carolina spent much of 1973 investigating and holding hearings into
the allegations against Nixon before the House considered
impeachment. A parade of witnesses testified and were questioned by
Nixon's supporters and opponents on the committee. In the Clinton
case, the witnesses have been questioned _ and in some cases,
compelled to testify _ only in secret before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr is trying to force the committee's hand and act as if he
is the chairman,'' said former federal prosecutor Bruce Yannett.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the nation has learned about the Lewinsky saga slowly,
through leaks to the news media, until the Friday release of the
Starr report, which was stunning in its lurid detail but lacking in
new blockbuster revelations. If the report doesn't lead to a public
call for Clinton's ouster, the question is whether Congress will
try to mold public opinion through Watergate-style hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If the Watergate experience is a guide, a months-long series of
dramatic hearings could rivet the nation's attention, especially if
new information is revealed about Clinton. Lewinsky, for example,
has uttered barely a word in public. Eventually, she could be
called before a congressional committee and be cross-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the president's secretary, Betty Currie, who
facilitated many of Lewinsky's meetings with Clinton and took
possession of gifts he gave to the former intern, could come under
intense pressure to tell the committee what she knows. Some
Republicans view her potential testimony as the equivalent of that
by John Dean, the former Nixon counsel who delivered up many of
Watergate's more devastating revelations.

CHILD ABUSE CASES OPENED TO PUBLIC IN MINNESOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Her jaw is clenched and her Champion sweatshirt
looks too big, or maybe she just seems to grow smaller when the
state lawyer says her toddler twins recoil at the sight of her.
</P>
<P>
   Under raw fluorescent lights in a cramped courtroom, the state
is hellbent on taking away the twins, permanently. But today the
question for the judge is simply whether the drug-addicted mom with
a violent past should lose her weekly, two-hour, supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   The case is as sad as it is routine. What is anything but
routine is that this week in a Minnesota courthouse, this family's
worst moments were open to public view.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the time-honored notion that noncriminal cases of child
abuse and neglect should be decided behind closed doors _ away from
the prying eyes of neighbors, the media, and the idly curious _
Minnesota has launched an experiment under which such cases are
being heard in open court, with records open as well.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year pilot program, under way since June, is the
brainchild of the state's highest judge, inspired by her belief
that despite the best efforts of judges and caseworkers and often
the families themselves, too many children are suffering for too
long, and the system isn't accountable.
</P>
<P>
   A catalyst toward turning that belief into action was the
February 1997 death of 3-year-old Desi Irving. Outrage grew when
Minnesotans learned that Desi's abuse by her mother was well known
by several people who did nothing. Unable to gain access to a
closed system, they mistakenly believed that protective service
agencies were already involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing assessment by the public that children are
not protected to the extent they should be,'' said Kathleen Blatz,
chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court and the program's
driving force. ``With a closed court, nobody with objective eyes
can be present. Your critics are the most helpful to you. They ask
questions like, `Why is nobody representing the child?' They can't
ask those kinds of questions if they aren't allowed to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those very critics are outraged by Blatz's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a misguided way of trying to approach the very
real issue of accountability,'' said Professor Esther Wattenberg,
director of the Center for Advanced Studies in Child Welfare at the
University of Minnesota. She called the court openings ``a deluded
search for a simple solution'' that invades family privacy and
makes it harder to protect children and keep families together.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of children in Minnesota became a matter of
national interest last week after the strangulation deaths of six
children, ages 5 to 11, allegedly by their mother, Khoua Her. The
24-year-old St. Paul woman, a Hmong immigrant who married and had
her first child at 13, was charged with six counts of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Child protection agencies said they had no previous contact with
the family, so no one is suggesting that open abuse and neglect
hearings might have somehow prevented the killings. Nevertheless,
the case has focused attention on the open court program, if only
because it is such a horrifying example of cruelty to children.
</P>
<P>
   This week at the Hennepin County Juvenile Justice Center, in the
shadow of the Metrodome, Becky Hoffman faced a state attempt to end
her overnight visits with her 7-year-old and 2-year-old daughters,
who are in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who you are. You don't know me. And you come in
here if you want and intrude (on) my family's privacy. That's not
right,'' she said &UR;  &LR; to a reporter. ``Anybody can come in here off
the street, think they know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Pamela G. Alexander, who minutes earlier had granted
Hoffman's request for continued overnight visits, agreed in
principle, noting that such cases often are complex and play out
over extended periods. She said a glance at records, or a visit to
one or two hearings, can leave a skewed impression.
</P>
<P>
   Others have expressed even stronger doubts, focusing on
everything from schoolyard taunts to humiliated families to damaged
future job prospects for children whose worst nightmares are made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``To open the hearings, I felt, was to allow children to be
re-victimized,'' said Judge Gary J. Meyer, chief judge of the
state's second-largest judicial district, covering eight counties.
``Their names would be in the paper, and people &UR;  &LR; _ neighbors _
would have access to their files. These are children who would not
have any ability to help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said a better argument could be made for opening
delinquency hearings, which are still closed to the public, because
at least in those cases the youth offenders did something to
trigger court involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders, who represent parents in most abuse and
neglect cases, have been almost unanimously opposed to the open
courts. ``Letting the public indulge its morbid curiosity is not
keeping our eye on what is best for the children,'' said Robert
Docherty, public defender in rural Watonwan County.
</P>
<P>
   Blatz responded to the criticism by noting that criminal cases
of neglect and sexual abuse are already prosecuted in open court.
``If a parent rapes a child, those cases are open to the press and
public. Where are the pictures on the news in those cases? The
media and the public have been responsible in those cases,'' she
said, and can be expected to act the same in these.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the three months since the pilot program began in 12
of the state's 87 counties, there has been relatively little
attention paid, agreed judges, lawyers, and child advocates. ``My
biggest disappointment is that nobody is coming. There seems to be
very little interest,'' said David Sanders, director of Hennepin
County Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear that the media will descend en masse at the
first sign of a sensational case. Media leaders say that isn't the
plan. ``We have no intention of holding children and adults up to
ridicule. We're very sensitive about maintaining the privacy of
children whose situations are being scrutinized and adjudicated by
the court,'' said Pam Fine, managing editor of the Minneapolis Star
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   So far, public notice has been limited to two occasions. Just
after the program started, a judge caused a stir by closing a court
hearing _ as allowed, under special circumstances _ but the next
hearing in the case was open, and no other closures have been
reported. Then US officials briefly threatened to withhold $60
million in funding, citing federal privacy rules that prohibit the
disclosure of information about foster care and child protection
cases. The threat was soon withdrawn and the crisis passed.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is not the first state to open civil abuse and neglect
hearings; the program is based on a decade-old system in Michigan,
and Minnesota child welfare officials say more than a dozen other
states have taken similar steps, though the trend has yet to reach
New England.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the system has been in place so long it is no
longer an issue, said Judge Freddie Burton Jr., presiding juvenile
judge in Wayne County, which includes Detroit. Unlike Minnesota,
Michigan even allows cameras in juvenile courtrooms, though photos
of children are barred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is secrecy, it breeds suspicion. I think
(opening the courts) has given people confidence in the system,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence, and hope, were on hand last week in Judge Robert
Blaeser's courtroom, though the only member of the public present
was a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty, 10-year-old girl in a flowered sundress sat nervously
with her mother and the father of her two half-brothers. Her mom,
with sunken eyes and a collapsed mien, has drug problems that won't
quit. The girl has been a ward of the county. Now, the judge was
being asked to give legal and physical custody to the father of her
two half-brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assured the judge it was what they wanted, though the
mother's face was drawn and pale. Blaeser quickly approved the
request, and the girl's shoulders sagged with relief. She smiled.
So did the man she calls Daddy. And so did her mother.
</P>
<P>
   It's what passes for a happy ending in these halls.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mom in the Champion sweatshirt, she retained her
weekly visitation. For now, the judge said, setting another court
date.

NEW PROPOSALS AREN'T SUCH A SUPER IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The champions of 17 European countries will play this week in
the Champions League, a round-robin event concluding with an
eight-team elimination tournament and finals May 26, 1999. Another
103 teams will be involved in European cups, which provide the
model for soccer competitions world-wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Champions Cup, Cup Winners Cup, and UEFA Cup are open to all
comers, from the most obscure club in the Faroe Islands to the
giants of sport, such as AC Milan. The only qualification is that
places be won on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposing a European Super League would put an end to
this. Rosenborg of Trondheim, Norway, which visits Athletic Bilbao
of Spain Wednesday, certainly would not be included in any Super
League. That is unfortunate, because Rosenborg provided one of the
most shocking upsets in sports history by eliminating Milan two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Super League would not have upsets. Everything would be
predictable. Standards would be high, but what would be the point?
As English Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman said, ``I
don't think the fans in this country would have the slightest
interest in what would be exhibition games. It would be Harlem
Globetrotters stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports without upsets, without promotion/relegation, become
increasingly dull. They also become exclusionary activities,
legislating to eliminate potential challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Platini believes a Super League would be ``a disaster''
because it would not provide places for young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried,'' said Platini, president of the France '98
Organizing Committee and FIFA's director of sports, ``because our
sport should not serve the interests of business and television.
With a Super League, they would have clubs without young players in
the team and without programs for young players' development. This
could destroy everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by L'Equipe in France, Platini expressed doubt that
such a league actually will be launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the mentalities are ready to accept a
system that puts in danger national championships or national
teams. I believe the big clubs are interested above all in money.
If they can obtain the share of the profits they want, they will be
satisfied and everything will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is that a Super League would be redundant in Europe.
The Champions League already satisfies this demand, and does so
with precisely the elements that make such a championships
interesting: merit requirements and the possibility for upsets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Rupert Murdoch understands this. For Murdoch,
whose News Corporation is offering $1.06 billion for Manchester
United, sports is a ``battering ram'' to promote his satellite
television ambitions around the world. Manchester United, the most
popular team in Asia, would be the entry into that continent for
Murdoch's Star TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Murdoch have to remove Manchester United from the
Premier League to fulfill this goal. The club's popularity has
little to do with its success. Manchester United retained its
worldwide appeal even when all England clubs were banned from
European competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Super Leagues promoters are basing their campaign on a canard,
that domination and winning are crucial to popularity and success.
Manchester United, which won the European Championship only once _
in 1968 _ proves it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rock 'n' roll soccer?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United fans have announced that they have recruited a
rock star to outbid Murdoch, and will announce his identity
Tuesday. This seems unlikely, but the club's board of directors is
obliged to seek a higher bid and Salomon Smith Barney has been
named to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of media and sports has caused massive changes to
the way games are conducted in the US. But television has only
minimally invaded soccer throughout the world. A game played in
most countries today lasts 90 minutes, plus a 15-minute halftime,
just as it did 50 years ago. This is the best measure for
guaranteeing optimum athletic performances and fan involvement _
delays and instrusions from off-field factors are minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, television's involvement with sport seems inevitable.
Carlton Communications is on the verge of a $450 million takeover
of Arsenal in England. And the Granada network has been rumored to
be interested in Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic media and sport are used for all sorts of purposes,
from selling products to sponsoring ideol-ogies. The hope is that
the integrity of the game and its supporters are respected.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough games on tap
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The highlight Champions League games Wednesday are Manchester
United-Barcelona and Real Madrid-Inter in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United should have a good chance against Barcelona,
which lost to Maillorca in the Spanish Super Cup and struggled
against Extremadura in a 1-0 victory Saturday. But they are in the
most difficult group, and must visit Bayern Munich Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The top team from the six groups, plus the top two second-place
finishers, qualify for the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difficult week for Real Madrid, which forfeited
home-field advantage after a goal was pulled down by fans in last
year's competition, leading to the suspension of the 100,000-seat
Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. The defending Champions Cup champions
must play Inter, then Barcelona in a league match Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four days, you can regain your strength and the whole group
will return fresh,'' said Real Madrid's Dutch coach, Guus Hiddink.
``The problem is that, but the tension, the concentration, the
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid also will be missing its Brazilian defender, Roberto
Carlos, who is suspended. But they have an adequate replacement _
Robert Jarni, a starter at left back for Croatia in the World Cup.
This illustrates how the rich stay rich and are able to stockpile
talent. It also shows how powerful clubs tend to find foreign help
instead of developing young domestic talent.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to worries in Italy about a decline in standards.
And worries were further fueled when the country's top two young
players, Andrea Pirlo and Nicola Ventola, were purchased by Inter.
But both played strong roles in Inter's rally for a 2-2 tie with
Cagliari in the Serie A opener Sunday. They replaced Youri
Djorkaeff and Roberto Baggio, and combined on both goals after
Inter fell behind, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how it would be possible for Ventola to go back to
the bench,'' noted La Gazzetta dello Sport.

LET'S TALK ABOUT LYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Lying _ yes. Perjury _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Down the first road lies a nonpartisan accommodation to the
principled leadership of people like Senator Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut Democrat, who insist that President Clinton's conduct
that is wrong and immoral be subject to a public rebuke while also
taking the view that off the evidence that is known, talk of
impeachment or resignation is unwise and unjust.
</P>
<P>
   Down the second road lies a partisan insistence on the political
death penalty, which will produce a partisan defense against a
charge that cannot be proved in an adversary proceeding. It will
also produce months of ugly and disgusting proceedings that are
more likely to infuriate Americans of all persuasions than produce
a consensus for action that can withstand the stern test of
history.
</P>
<P>
   If it's about lying, we can talk. More than that, the case can
almost certainly be settled in a way that condemns the president's
behavior while respecting the country's solidly anti-impeachment
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is insisted that we talk about the crime called
perjury, there will be a fight, with virtually no chance of a
widely accepted result.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear by now that the president is prepared to
acknowledge more than his horrid behavior, that to keep his sexual
encounters with Monica Lewinsky secret he did something all of us
can understand in English as lying.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear yet to the country that perjury is a crime
that encompasses far more than lying, and far more than the facts
as known in the case will support.
</P>
<P>
   That will change.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most politicians and press commentators are lazily
sliding past the issue by confusing lying with perjury, and
ridiculing Clinton's lawyers for pointing out distinctions that are
central to hundreds of years of legal history and tradition. They
easily score political points.
</P>
<P>
   However, that momentary advantage is trumped by the card the
Clinton side can eventually play with a vengeance. At some point,
the sound bites about hair-splitting will be irrelevant and the job
will fall to somebody to prove perjury with evidence and witnesses.
And that simply cannot be done in this case without flouting some
precious principles that protect individuals from the long arm of
an irresponsible state.
</P>
<P>
   From Ken Starr's report and the two rebuttals by the president's
lawyers, it is clear that the core of the assertions of perjury in
Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and his
Aug. 17 testimony to Starr's grand jury is the allegation that the
president aroused Lewinsky sexually. Both sides agree that if he
did, that conduct falls within the tortured definition of sex
proposed by the Paula Jones lawyers and modified by the trial
judge.
</P>
<P>
   That allegation, for obvious reasons, comes only from Lewinsky,
and it is denied by the president in his Aug. 17 testimony.
</P>
<P>
   To proceed, the House Judiciary (and perhaps some months from
now the Senate in a trial) would have to produce Lewinsky to
testify about sex acts in even more detail than was gratuitously
summarized ad nauseam in Starr's report. And this testimony, unlike
her grand jury appearances, would include cross-examination and
other testimony putting her credibility in question _ which eight
months of madness around here has indicated is the size of Mt.
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one of the basic elements of the US law of perjury is
that one witness doesn't make a case _ that at least one
independent form of corroboration, meaning it could stand
regardless of whether the other witness existed, is required.
</P>
<P>
   This is not hair-splitting. It is part of British and American
tradition to keep that state from using perjury as a back-door
means of getting ``something'' on a target or as a form of illegal
entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, it is settled US law that perjury is not a
strictly accurate statement that nonetheless implies something that
is false or masks the full truth; nor is perjury any answer to a
question found to be vague or convoluted such as the Jones lawyers'
sex query; nor is an incomplete answer perjury because the burden
is properly on the questioner to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   The classic illustration in the Clinton case is his lawyer, Bob
Bennett's entreaty to his Jones counterparts in the deposition:
``Why don't they ask the president what he did, what he didn't do,
and then we can argue in court later about what it means?'' They
never did. And yet, it is obvious that the president did not just
behave immorally, he lied.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for grownups should not be to play perjury games
for another year, but to settle this case with the admission and
public rebuke that would make the sanction fit the offense and
produce not only justice but the ending the public ardently
desires.

CONSERVATIVE COUPLE PENS STRATEGIES OR PROTECTING KIDS' CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCER ISLAND, Wash. _ Meet the Medveds _ not the usual family
next door these days.
</P>
<P>
   They watch no television whatsoever, no news, no sports, not
even any public broadcasting specials, and the three Medved
children are permitted to only watch six hours of parent-approved
videos each week.
</P>
<P>
   The two parents also have personally screened all their
children's playmates ``from the earliest ages'' to make sure they
are not the sort to exhibit inappropriate behavior that might
provide unwanted peer influences. And an occasional spanking is
sometimes employed to provide discipline in the Medved household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resist the argument that spanking is, by definition,
abusive,'' says Michael Medved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking,'' adds Diane Medved, ``is just one more tool in an
arsenal of disciplinary tactics, although we certainly do not do it
in any fit of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, who live in a spacious view home with a swimming
pool on Mercer Island, also are rigorous in the observance of their
Jewish faith, eating only Kosher foods and refraining from all
regular activities on the sabbath (including driving, cooking,
talking on the phone or turning on electrical devices).
</P>
<P>
   But however unlike other families the Medveds may be, they
firmly believe that far more parents would follow their example, or
at least part of it, if they just understood that it was an option.
</P>
<P>
   So the two Medveds have stepped smartly into the societal fray
to provide ``empowering'' support for parents from a couple with
established credentials. The Medveds are nationally known
conservatives, he as a film critic and a host of a syndicated radio
talk show that originates at KVI-AM in Seattle, she as host of a
multimedia show on the Internet, as a clinical psychologist with a
half-time private practice in her home and as a writer of several
books (including one on the American family co-written with former
Vice President Dan Quayle).
</P>
<P>
   Their prescription for parents is outlined in the Medveds' new
book, ``Saving Childhood: Protecting Our Children From the National
Assault on Innocence'' (HarperCollins, 324 pages, $24). This is an
unlikely and sometimes jarring mix of a parenting volume. It starts
with 200 pages of angry political diatribe and horror stories about
permissive and intrusive societal forces today. Then it follows
with 100 pages of heartfelt parenting advisories and strategies for
keeping kids as kids, at least a little while longer, with many
examples drawn from the Medveds' own experience raising 11-year-old
Sarah, 9-year-old Shayna and 6-year-old Danny.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their political affiliation, everyone in
America wants to have a conservative family,'' stresses Diane
Medved, 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives make the mistake of thinking that only
conservatives have conservative family values,'' adds Michael
Medved, 49. ``But no parent, no matter how partisan, wants to raise
kids that grow up to be like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds' book has more boogeymen than a Goosebumps book by
R.L. Stine (another prohibited entity in the Medved household).
They zap everything from Power Rangers dolls to children who do not
know etiquette to ``the disastrous experiment in forced busing'' to
a society ``obsessed with the importance of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Medveds reserve their strongest salvos for what they
consider the most odious transgressors against childhood today:
</P>
<P>
   _ The mass media, with their purveying of frightening images,
graphic violence and casual sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us elitist, self-righteous, self-appointed preservers of
our culture,'' write the Medveds, ``but hey, TV is goo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The schools, with their graphic programs aimed at warning
children against adult dangers (sex, disease, drugs, strangers),
programs introduced at ages far younger than, the Medveds believe,
average children are ever likely to encounter such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools,'' write the Medveds, ``teach children to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Other children, who exert peer pressure with their rudeness
toward adults, their absence of moral behavior and their pursuit of
such dangerous fads as materialism, gothic cults and body piercing
and tattooing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tattoo or brand,'' write the Medveds, ``is a permanent
statement that innocence is over.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents themselves, with their lazy abdication of the
responsibility for discipline and morality, are pushing kids into
too many choices about too many activities and showering them with
too many material goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents would serve their children better,'' write the
Medveds, ``if they emphasized happiness over achievement, and
goodness over goodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds themselves are not immune from the dilemmas,
compromises and contradictions that bedevil their fellow baby
boomers as parents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their book, the Medveds include themselves among
``concerned parents of public school students,'' but this month is
the first time that all three Medved children have spent even
partial time in public schools after being educated exclusively at
home with hired teachers (in Seattle) or in private Jewish day
schools (in California).
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, an openly affectionate couple, are particularly
critical about the effects of divorce today _ one of Diane Medved's
earlier books is ``The Case Against Divorce.'' But both Medveds are
on their second marriage, although neither had children previously.
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds have zealously guarded their children from the
excesses of MTV and current rock music, only to have their younger
daughter mention, to their horror, that she knew the names of the
Spice Girls. That unwelcome knowledge turned out to have come from
what she heard during her time in a group that Diane Medved has
long supported, the Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to erase her mind,'' Diane Medved relates. ``But
by showing shock about such a thing (as the Spice Girls) that shows
her that it is not something I approve of. She gets the message, as
opposed to my just saying, `Oh, that's cool.' I talk a lot with her
about how I want her to remain my little girl. ... I know I cannot
keep her in the dark forever, but it should be a slow, gradual
process.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Medveds, who argue so strenuously about the need to
shield children from the damaging effects of the mass media (of
which they happen to be a part), do allow their children to listen
to talk radio, including their father's show, even at a time when
much political discussion there might once have been considered
X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be one reason why Sarah approached her father recently
and inquired, ``What's oral sex?''
</P>
<P>
   To which he replied, ``Do you really want to know? I don't think
you're going to like what you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. It has to do with mouth-genital contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do normal people do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not prohibited in the Torah. But it's not normal to do
that with somebody you're not married to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it may not be too surprising that the Medveds _ amid their
recommendations for reading to children, imbuing patriotism,
teaching manners, honoring parents, preserving optimism, telling
Bible stories, sharing family dinners _ also evidence a fondness
for times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ozzie and Harriet Nelson's life was celebrated rather
than scorned, TV messages championed rather than detracted from
wholesome ideals,'' the Medveds write. ``In days when women enjoyed
being home for the kids, peers came over for basketball in the
driveway and homemade lemonade rather than scattering for
unsupervised explorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe `the old days' before the social changes of the '60s
weren't perfect, but they allowed a bevy of family-friendly forces
to surround parents with encouragement for their mission: to honor
God, country and family, to use that white picket fence to keep out
threats to childhood, and keep loved ones close at hand.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Mahoney believes that most people have it wrong about
folks, himself included, who drive convertibles. They think we
lower our tops to let the sun shine in, he says. Which is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the sun,'' Mahoney pointed out one recent
afternoon as he relaxed behind the wheel of his 1990 BMW at
Wollaston Beach in Quincy, across the harbor from Boston. ``It's
about the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's about a lot of things. But Mahoney, a freelance
visual consultant who owns two other convertibles, knows that many
people look at a retractable top and see only a bad hair day.
They'd rather ride in a fully enclosed, climate-controlled box,
where the sounds and smells of the roadway _ and yes, the sky _ are
kept outside.
</P>
<P>
   But the convertible won't go away. Thirty-four models are on the
market this year, and so far they represent about 3.3 percent of
new passenger car sales. That may not sound like much, especially
when compared with the 7 percent figure of the early 1960s, but
don't forget that topless sales increased 11.4 percent last year
and 20.4 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Especially don't forget that the convertible nearly expired a
quarter of a century ago. During that dark hour, amid concerns
about auto safety and street crime, the Big Three US automakers
actually stopped making the toys of summer. There was even a novel
titled ``The Last Convertible.''
</P>
<P>
   But toplessness was reborn during the 1980s, first on the wheels
of Chrysler's K-car and later on Mazda's Miata. Now you see
convertibles at the beach, the mall, the PTO meeting, everywhere.
(But remember this: No self-respecting convertible owner refers to
his or her car as a ``ragtop,'' and hasn't since about 1958.)
</P>
<P>
   For Fred Taylor, convertibles never went away. It was as a
teenager back in the 1940s that Taylor, now a Boston music
producer, convinced his mother that what she really needed was a
Chevrolet convertible. A decade later he was able to purchase his
own Chevy, a classic '57 Bel Air, which began a string of five
topless cars. (Taylor concedes that he does not part with
automobiles easily, having owned them as long as 15 years.)
``Nothing has ever made me feel like the next car I buy would be an
enclosed car,'' he says, spitting out the last two words as if they
were the name of an ancient enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Like most owners of convertibles, Taylor does not easily put
into sentences the pleasures derived from driving a car without a
top. He talks about the ``openness'' of the experience, as do we
all. But he begins to cut to the core when he says: ``It's just ...
it's almost like you're walking. You're looking up at things, down
at things, sideways at things. You're more aware of what's going on
around you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one other thing, adds Taylor: ``You can get a tan going
somewhere in a convertible. You don't have to actually be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one word that the serious owners of convertibles
inevitably fall back on, it is this: freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to explain,'' sighs Goldie Muise, a postal clerk
who owns both a 1976 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1980 Ford Mustang
convertible. ``You don't feel like you're closed up inside a metal
crate. And there's a feeling of living to the fullest, of really
being able to enjoy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, people notice when we drive our convertibles. They
notice Oscar Guardado, a 24-year-old landscaper, and not just
because he recently had his 1989 Mustang painted a color that can
only be described as orange-on-orange. Or because the convertible's
trunk is chock full of heart-stopping sub-woofers.
</P>
<P>
   They even notice Guardado when he parks his car at Revere Beach
and sits proudly atop the seawall behind it. ``So many girls ask
me, `Take me for a ride, take me for a ride,''' he says, beaming.
``And some people stop and say, `Hey, you want to sell it?' But I
say, `No, it's my toy.' I call it `my honey.' And my girlfriend
says, `Oh, your car's your honey?' But she doesn't want me to sell
it either.''
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be statistically proven, but it appears likely that,
like Taylor, we convertible owners keep our cars longer than
non-convertible owners. There's some kind of mystical connection
between driver and car that can't be found with a sedan, a station
wagon, or _ God forbid _ an SUV. Dr. Richard Sullivan, who has
owned his 1959 Triumph TR3 for 14 years, talks about driving being
a more ``active'' process with the top down. ``You're more part of
the experience of driving,'' he contends. ``It's like riding a
horse. I truly, truly love doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s and 1960s, Sullivan had several friends who
owned convertibles but who eventually abandoned the genre. ``I
guess they grew up,'' he notes sadly. Actually, the auto industry
feels that the principal customers for convertibles are not young
people, but older folks with the cash to buy them. They're seen as
``reward'' cars for hard-working baby boomers, or as midlife-crisis
cars for folks grappling with middle age. ``Image enhancers'' is
how George Pipas, Ford Motor Co.'s sales analysis manager,
describes them.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just maybe, convertibles are coming back simply
because they're fun to drive. That's what Jennifer Jacobs, a
20-year-old medical assistant _ no midlife crisis there _
discovered in April when she bought a 1996 Chrysler Sebring
convertible. At the time, Jacobs's idea of letting in the sky
consisted of purchasing a car with a sunroof. But she talked
herself into the real deal instead, and now the first thing she
does when she leaves work in the evening is put the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest us who drive convertibles, Jacobs is hooked. This
may be her first topless car, she declares, but it won't be her
last. ``I don't think,'' she says from behind the wheel, ``that I
could get used to a regular car after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could?

THE GRAY-BEARDS OF SURFING.

<P>
   LITTLE COMPTON, R.I. _ Some folks pray for hurricanes, not
little storms with just a puff of breath in them. But mighty
tempests that can climb up the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The annual hurricane season prompts great glee among local
hard-core surfers. Not so much among the teenagers who surf after
school or on weekends, but among the middle-aged men who have been
obsessed with riding the waves for years and have lifestyles that
allow them to drop everything when the surf's up.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who, despite the march of time, the loss of hair,
and the growth of families, just won't let go of the surfer life,
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad day of surf is better than a bad day at work,'' says
Bill Gramm, 47, who's been riding the waves for decades. Despite
having two small children at home, he admits he has no plans to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, every wave is still thrilling,'' says
Chris Kyricos, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike surfers in Hawaii who can walk out their back doors on
any given day and find the swells they need, surfers along the East
Coast must be a patient lot. They can wait weeks, even months, for
strong surf to be up.
</P>
<P>
   There hadn't been good waves since March, so recent hurricanes
brought the network to life along the coast as surfers tuned in to
weather channels, shared information on the Internet, blocked out
free time for riding their boards, and talked to the dawn patrol
daily before heading out. The patrol is made up of surfers who
check out conditions at various beaches along the coast and then
use their cell phones to call other surfers about prevailing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, the best waves are usually in Little Compton.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Gramm, Kyricos, and two other longtime surfer
buddies have been heading when the storms blow in. All four have
built lives that allow them to surf. Gramm co-owns a lumberyard in
Wareham, Mass. with his sister. Kyricos, of Cohasset, Mass., is a
consultant. Sean Egan, 40, of Hull, Mass., is a carpenter and
contractor, and Glen Riley, 35, also of Hull, is a musician and
house painter.
</P>
<P>
   They all sat down recently for lunch at the Common's Lodge
restaurant here before heading out for an afternoon of surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first good waves of the summer,'' says Riley,
who's divorced and has a son. He heads south during the winter
months to surf. ``I've traveled to Barbados, Mexico, and Puerto
Rico to surf. What keeps me coming back here is my son.''
</P>
<P>
   A passion for surfing can wreak havoc on a marriage,
particularly over time. Fortunately, Gramm and Kyricos have very
understanding wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife knows that surfing makes me happy and if she wants a
happy man around the house, she's got to understand that this is
what I want to do,'' says Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   What causes the most havoc is that the winds are so
unpredictable that a surfer cannot plan ahead. So there are times
of tension when the surf's up and there's a family wedding or other
gathering that has been planned for months and the pull of the
waves wins out over family.
</P>
<P>
   For Gramm, the fever started early. When he was growing up there
were four surf shops in Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rebellious, counterculture lifestyle, and there were
drugs involved,'' says Gramm. ``But it was all about freedom _
freedom to hang out on the beach and ride the waves. Surfing's very
physical. I stay in shape to surf. But you really can't take it all
too seriously. I mean the last stretch of waves was in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm sometimes leaves his house at 5 in the morning, surfs for
three hours and then heads to the lumberyard for a day's work. He
owns five boards of various sizes and weights _ the larger the
wave, the longer the board needed.
</P>
<P>
   Egan says surfing is never boring because each wave is
different. There is so much mass involved in each wave that a
surfer must move as fast as the wave is moving through the water.
That is the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Kyricos agrees that the sensation of riding a wave never
diminishes. ``There's so much involved,'' says Kyricos. ``No other
sport has you interacting with such a variety of forces. It's a
matter of kinetics _ the forward and downward motions, the effects
of gravity and the winds. It's about putting oneself against the
earth's energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the waves in Little Compton, the men enjoy the
comradeship of local surfers there because they aren't aggressive,
publicity-seeking hotshots like some they've encountered in Newport
or California.
</P>
<P>
   The men will surf all year if conditions permit _ they all have
wetsuits and wax for every kind of water temperature. They say that
what helped advance the sport in the '70s was the board leash that
is worn around the ankle and prevents a board from flying loose
when a surfer wipes out or ``kicks out'' (exits) the wave.
</P>
<P>
   And they all agree they are frequently scared. ``A wave is such
an unyielding, relentless mass and has its own agenda,'' says
Kyricos. ``The ocean has to be respected because a wave has the
ability to pulverize you when you wipe out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is finished, and the no-longer-young surfers pile into a
van. They choose a spot away from other surfers and paddle out to
meet the waves. The ``session'' lasts several hours. The winds
aren't good, and the waves are relatively small. But better some
surf than none.
</P>

ROLAND MERULLO LOOKS HOMEWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVERE, Mass. _ It is a crisp morning, and Roland Merullo is
sitting in one of the pavilions along the shore, there to talk
about his new novel, ``Revere Beach Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more sea gulls than people on the beach, and there is
a cool onshore breeze. But Merullo _ like any son of Revere
returning for a day _ wants to go for a swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't bring a suit, did you?'' he asks somewhat
plaintively. Deprived of a dip, he settles for the other thing one
does at Revere Beach: going for a roast beef sandwich at Kelly's.
</P>
<P>
   Merullo, author of two well-received novels set far from Revere
_ one in Micronesia, the other in Russia _ has now returned home,
novelistically, and with a vengeance. ``Revere Beach Boulevard,''
published this month by Henry Holt, is the first book in a
projected Revere Beach trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could write 50,000 pages set in Revere,'' Merullo says. And
you believe him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his book, Merullo speaks through the
protagonist's sister, a Boston television news anchor, and writes:
``Once I actually reached the city, once I left the highway,
circled down the exit ramp, and began making my way through the
tired streets, the fake little gem of my Boston life seemed to drop
out of sight. The rain stopped as I turned onto Proctor Avenue. I
drove up the familiar street, past the familiar house fronts
standing tight together, and felt myself moving deep into a
darkness that swallowed everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Merullo, 45, lives now in Conway, with his wife, Amanda, a
photographer _ she took the photo of Revere Beach at twilight on
the novel's jacket _ and their 8-month-old daughter, Alexandra. But
his family _ mother, two brothers, and a clan of uncles, aunts, and
cousins _ still lives in Revere, where he grew up. He insists that
the characters portrayed in ``Revere Beach Boulevard'' are
fictional, but the city is a character as important as any.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure, something of an offstage narrator, is pastor
at St. Anthony's, an imposing Romanesque building with a campanile
towering over American Legion Highway _ and the Catholic church
where Merullo's grandparents worshiped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think what a priest's life must be like in a town like this,''
Merullo says. ``Walking down the street, seeing people with the
secrets he carries around in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving around the city, Merullo points out the house a block or
two off Shirley Avenue. It's the house that he imagines the book's
protagonist, a real estate agent addicted to gambling and in hock
to Mafia loan sharks, has been ordered to torch.
</P>
<P>
   And on Proctor Street, where Merullo attended elementary school,
he points out the small ranch-type house where he imagines the
story begins _ the house that inspired the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really struggling with a book that I still haven't
finished,'' Merullo says. ``I was having a horrible time, two, 2
1/2 years of real frustration.'' So on the strength of having just
been hired to teach at Bennington College, he put the book aside
(although it may resurface later in the trilogy) and took off with
his wife for a vacation in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   But just before leaving, Merullo recalls, he had ``a very
powerful, very visceral sense of one moment. An old Italian guy
sitting in his back yard, watching the moon come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the yard,'' Merullo says, ``and I knew the guy, a very
humble, simple old Italian guy who drove my father to his tailor
shop in the North End and would also come and prune our
grapevines.''
</P>
<P>
   With that strong image in mind, Merullo took a stack of yellow
legal pads to Italy. By the time he returned, he had written 179
pages in longhand of what became ``Revere Beach Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``old Italian guy'' became Vito, father of Peter, the
gambling-addicted real estate agent. In the novel, his wife is
dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of ``Revere Beach Boulevard,'' Merullo
writes, in Vito's voice, ``Before the phone call came that would
take my life and turn her inside out like the sleeve on a jacket, I
was sitting in the yard with the woman I had been husband and wife
with 49 years, the woman who was the other half of my body. We were
waiting for the moon to come up over Patsy Antonelli's roof. Big,
she would be coming up. You could tell by the light between the
houses that she would be coming up big on that night, the full
circle of her, the full, perfect face.
</P>
<P>
   ```Do you feel any pain, Lucy?' I asked my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she said `No,' quiet, in a voice that meant don't keep
asking, Vito. So I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Merullo's first novel, ``Leaving Losapas,'' published in 1991,
grew out of an illness-shortened tour with the Peace Corps in
Micronesia. His second novel, ``A Russian Requiem,'' published two
years later, drew on his studies in Russian literature at Brown
University and a stint with the US Information Agency in Moscow.
Both books were hailed as the work of a writer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the three novels, there have been a number of freelance
nonfiction projects, the most memorable a series on the 1996
presidential primaries for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   From that assignment, Merullo recalls vividly a drive from Bob
Dole's Kansas to Bill Clinton's Arkansas, stopping to ask people
what words came to mind when he mentioned the names of the
candidates _ and being ``shocked at the vitriol directed at
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Merullo, who teaches English literature one semester a year at
Bennington, speaks analytically of his own writing.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers have found confusing Merullo's device of using a
number of first-person narrators _ Peter, his sister Joanie, their
parents, a Revere policeman, among others _ to tell the story of
``Revere Beach Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really worked hard to get the voices to be consistent and to
be different _ as much as possible with people from the same family
and the same town,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But while he thinks that ``when people talk, they do reveal
something about themselves that they don't know they are
revealing,'' he says that the first-person narrator _ especially a
townful of them _ ``handcuffs the writer. There's so much that
people, especially people who aren't very introspective, just don't
say about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For a writer, he says, ``it's like writing with one hand tied
behind you'' and, he adds firmly, ``I'll never use multiple
first-person narrators again.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is firmly committed to the idea of a trilogy. ``There's a
lot of hubris there,'' he admits, ``but I'm not worried.''

CONSERVATIVE COUPLE PENS STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING KIDS'
CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MERCER ISLAND, Wash. _ Meet the Medveds _ not the usual family
next door these days.
</P>
<P>
   They watch no television whatsoever, no news, no sports, not
even any public broadcasting specials, and the three Medved
children are permitted to only watch six hours of parent-approved
videos each week.
</P>
<P>
   The two parents also have personally screened all their
children's playmates ``from the earliest ages'' to make sure they
are not the sort to exhibit inappropriate behavior that might
provide unwanted peer influences. And an occasional spanking is
sometimes employed to provide discipline in the Medved household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resist the argument that spanking is, by definition,
abusive,'' says Michael Medved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking,'' adds Diane Medved, ``is just one more tool in an
arsenal of disciplinary tactics, although we certainly do not do it
in any fit of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, who live in a spacious view home with a swimming
pool on Mercer Island, also are rigorous in the observance of their
Jewish faith, eating only Kosher foods and refraining from all
regular activities on the sabbath (including driving, cooking,
talking on the phone or turning on electrical devices).
</P>
<P>
   But however unlike other families the Medveds may be, they
firmly believe that far more parents would follow their example, or
at least part of it, if they just understood that it was an option.
</P>
<P>
   So the two Medveds have stepped smartly into the societal fray
to provide ``empowering'' support for parents from a couple with
established credentials. The Medveds are nationally known
conservatives, he as a film critic and a host of a syndicated radio
talk show that originates at KVI-AM in Seattle, she as host of a
multimedia show on the Internet, as a clinical psychologist with a
half-time private practice in her home and as a writer of several
books (including one on the American family co-written with former
Vice President Dan Quayle).
</P>
<P>
   Their prescription for parents is outlined in the Medveds' new
book, ``Saving Childhood: Protecting Our Children From the National
Assault on Innocence'' (HarperCollins, 324 pages, $24). This is an
unlikely and sometimes jarring mix of a parenting volume. It starts
with 200 pages of angry political diatribe and horror stories about
permissive and intrusive societal forces today. Then it follows
with 100 pages of heartfelt parenting advisories and strategies for
keeping kids as kids, at least a little while longer, with many
examples drawn from the Medveds' own experience raising 11-year-old
Sarah, 9-year-old Shayna and 6-year-old Danny.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their political affiliation, everyone in
America wants to have a conservative family,'' stresses Diane
Medved, 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives make the mistake of thinking that only
conservatives have conservative family values,'' adds Michael
Medved, 49. ``But no parent, no matter how partisan, wants to raise
kids that grow up to be like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds' book has more boogeymen than a Goosebumps book by
R.L. Stine (another prohibited entity in the Medved household).
They zap everything from Power Rangers dolls to children who do not
know etiquette to ``the disastrous experiment in forced busing'' to
a society ``obsessed with the importance of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Medveds reserve their strongest salvos for what they
consider the most odious transgressors against childhood today:
</P>
<P>
   _ The mass media, with their purveying of frightening images,
graphic violence and casual sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us elitist, self-righteous, self-appointed preservers of
our culture,'' write the Medveds, ``but hey, TV is goo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The schools, with their graphic programs aimed at warning
children against adult dangers (sex, disease, drugs, strangers),
programs introduced at ages far younger than, the Medveds believe,
average children are ever likely to encounter such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools,'' write the Medveds, ``teach children to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Other children, who exert peer pressure with their rudeness
toward adults, their absence of moral behavior and their pursuit of
such dangerous fads as materialism, gothic cults and body piercing
and tattooing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tattoo or brand,'' write the Medveds, ``is a permanent
statement that innocence is over.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents themselves, with their lazy abdication of the
responsibility for discipline and morality, are pushing kids into
too many choices about too many activities and showering them with
too many material goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents would serve their children better,'' write the
Medveds, ``if they emphasized happiness over achievement, and
goodness over goodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds themselves are not immune from the dilemmas,
compromises and contradictions that bedevil their fellow baby
boomers as parents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their book, the Medveds include themselves among
``concerned parents of public school students,'' but this month is
the first time that all three Medved children have spent even
partial time in public schools after being educated exclusively at
home with hired teachers (in Seattle) or in private Jewish day
schools (in California).
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, an openly affectionate couple, are particularly
critical about the effects of divorce today _ one of Diane Medved's
earlier books is ``The Case Against Divorce.'' But both Medveds are
on their second marriage, although neither had children previously.
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds have zealously guarded their children from the
excesses of MTV and current rock music, only to have their younger
daughter mention, to their horror, that she knew the names of the
Spice Girls. That unwelcome knowledge turned out to have come from
what she heard during her time in a group that Diane Medved has
long supported, the Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to erase her mind,'' Diane Medved relates. ``But
by showing shock about such a thing (as the Spice Girls) that shows
her that it is not something I approve of. She gets the message, as
opposed to my just saying, `Oh, that's cool.' I talk a lot with her
about how I want her to remain my little girl. ... I know I cannot
keep her in the dark forever, but it should be a slow, gradual
process.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Medveds, who argue so strenuously about the need to
shield children from the damaging effects of the mass media (of
which they happen to be a part), do allow their children to listen
to talk radio, including their father's show, even at a time when
much political discussion there might once have been considered
X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be one reason why Sarah approached her father recently
and inquired, ``What's oral sex?''
</P>
<P>
   To which he replied, ``Do you really want to know? I don't think
you're going to like what you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. It has to do with mouth-genital contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do normal people do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not prohibited in the Torah. But it's not normal to do
that with somebody you're not married to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it may not be too surprising that the Medveds _ amid their
recommendations for reading to children, imbuing patriotism,
teaching manners, honoring parents, preserving optimism, telling
Bible stories, sharing family dinners _ also evidence a fondness
for times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ozzie and Harriet Nelson's life was celebrated rather
than scorned, TV messages championed rather than detracted from
wholesome ideals,'' the Medveds write. ``In days when women enjoyed
being home for the kids, peers came over for basketball in the
driveway and homemade lemonade rather than scattering for
unsupervised explorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe `the old days' before the social changes of the '60s
weren't perfect, but they allowed a bevy of family-friendly forces
to surround parents with encouragement for their mission: to honor
God, country and family, to use that white picket fence to keep out
threats to childhood, and keep loved ones close at hand.''

   LITTLE COMPTON, R.I. _ Some folks pray for hurricanes, not
little storms with just a puff of breath in them. But mighty
tempests that can climb up the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The annual hurricane season prompts great glee among local
hard-core surfers. Not so much among the teenagers who surf after
school or on weekends, but among the middle-aged men who have been
obsessed with riding the waves for years and have lifestyles that
allow them to drop everything when the surf's up.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who, despite the march of time, the loss of hair,
and the growth of families, just won't let go of the surfer life,
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad day of surf is better than a bad day at work,'' says
Bill Gramm, 47, who's been riding the waves for decades. Despite
having two small children at home, he admits he has no plans to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, every wave is still thrilling,'' says
Chris Kyricos, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike surfers in Hawaii who can walk out their back doors on
any given day and find the swells they need, surfers along the East
Coast must be a patient lot. They can wait weeks, even months, for
strong surf to be up.
</P>
<P>
   There hadn't been good waves since March, so recent hurricanes
brought the network to life along the coast as surfers tuned in to
weather channels, shared information on the Internet, blocked out
free time for riding their boards, and talked to the dawn patrol
daily before heading out. The patrol is made up of surfers who
check out conditions at various beaches along the coast and then
use their cell phones to call other surfers about prevailing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, the best waves are usually in Little Compton.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Gramm, Kyricos, and two other longtime surfer
buddies have been heading when the storms blow in. All four have
built lives that allow them to surf. Gramm co-owns a lumberyard in
Wareham, Mass. with his sister. Kyricos, of Cohasset, Mass., is a
consultant. Sean Egan, 40, of Hull, Mass., is a carpenter and
contractor, and Glen Riley, 35, also of Hull, is a musician and
house painter.
</P>
<P>
   They all sat down recently for lunch at the Common's Lodge
restaurant here before heading out for an afternoon of surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first good waves of the summer,'' says Riley,
who's divorced and has a son. He heads south during the winter
months to surf. ``I've traveled to Barbados, Mexico, and Puerto
Rico to surf. What keeps me coming back here is my son.''
</P>
<P>
   A passion for surfing can wreak havoc on a marriage,
particularly over time. Fortunately, Gramm and Kyricos have very
understanding wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife knows that surfing makes me happy and if she wants a
happy man around the house, she's got to understand that this is
what I want to do,'' says Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   What causes the most havoc is that the winds are so
unpredictable that a surfer cannot plan ahead. So there are times
of tension when the surf's up and there's a family wedding or other
gathering that has been planned for months and the pull of the
waves wins out over family.
</P>
<P>
   For Gramm, the fever started early. When he was growing up there
were four surf shops in Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rebellious, counterculture lifestyle, and there were
drugs involved,'' says Gramm. ``But it was all about freedom _
freedom to hang out on the beach and ride the waves. Surfing's very
physical. I stay in shape to surf. But you really can't take it all
too seriously. I mean the last stretch of waves was in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm sometimes leaves his house at 5 in the morning, surfs for
three hours and then heads to the lumberyard for a day's work. He
owns five boards of various sizes and weights _ the larger the
wave, the longer the board needed.
</P>
<P>
   Egan says surfing is never boring because each wave is
different. There is so much mass involved in each wave that a
surfer must move as fast as the wave is moving through the water.
That is the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Kyricos agrees that the sensation of riding a wave never
diminishes. ``There's so much involved,'' says Kyricos. ``No other
sport has you interacting with such a variety of forces. It's a
matter of kinetics _ the forward and downward motions, the effects
of gravity and the winds. It's about putting oneself against the
earth's energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the waves in Little Compton, the men enjoy the
comradeship of local surfers there because they aren't aggressive,
publicity-seeking hotshots like some they've encountered in Newport
or California.
</P>
<P>
   The men will surf all year if conditions permit _ they all have
wetsuits and wax for every kind of water temperature. They say that
what helped advance the sport in the '70s was the board leash that
is worn around the ankle and prevents a board from flying loose
when a surfer wipes out or ``kicks out'' (exits) the wave.
</P>
<P>
   And they all agree they are frequently scared. ``A wave is such
an unyielding, relentless mass and has its own agenda,'' says
Kyricos. ``The ocean has to be respected because a wave has the
ability to pulverize you when you wipe out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is finished, and the no-longer-young surfers pile into a
van. They choose a spot away from other surfers and paddle out to
meet the waves. The ``session'' lasts several hours. The winds
aren't good, and the waves are relatively small. But better some
surf than none.
</P>
<P>
   They pile into the van again and head for another spot. They
surf until dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was in the water a total of six or seven hours,''
says Gramm. ``Not bad for a 47-year-old man.''

BATTERS NEED MORE THAN BRAWN TO HIT HOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After the ball leaves the pitcher's hand at 90
mph, home run kings Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have only a
fraction of a second to put their muscles in gear, bring the bat
over the plate and connect dead-on with enough force to send it
over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have set the sporting world on its ear this
season with their awesome displays of hitting prowess, each topping
Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 homers. But it's not just a
matter of raw power: The tolerances are so minute that many
consider hitting a major league home run the most difficult feat in
all of sports.
</P>
<P>
   It involves everything from strong muscles to razor-sharp
reflexes and the ability to judge the speed and direction of a ball
well before it makes its way to the plate, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And the muscles involved aren't just in the shoulders and upper
arms.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who plays for the St. Louis Cardinals, and Sosa, who's
on the Chicago Cubs, also call on their torso, hips and legs to
help move the bat at speeds approaching 70 mph. A right-handed
hitter's left leg alone will absorb 1.2 times his body weight when
he lunges for a pitch, said Duane Knudson, a biomechanics expert
and assistant professor at California State University at Chico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he knelt down and just swung with his upper body, he
wouldn't do nearly so well,'' Knudson said. By including the other
muscles and the power they generate in the swing, ``you get quite a
bit of bat speed.''
</P>
<P>
   When it collides with a fastball, the bat creates 1,500 pounds
of force and sends the ball flying at 110 mph to 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But just any bodybuilder off the street wouldn't be able to
connect with a big-league pitch. A batter also has to know just
where the ball is heading and the exact moment to unleash his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pay them for their bodies, we pay them for their
minds,'' said A. Terry Bahill, co-author of ``Keep Your Eye on the
Ball: The Science and Folklore of Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that pitch is coming in, they have to predict where the
ball is going to be when it comes across the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The swing itself takes just 150 milliseconds. And with pitches
arriving in less than half a second, it has been calculated that a
swing that is more than 10 milliseconds too soon or too late will
result in a pop-up or a ground out, leaving only the slimmest
window for the sweet spot of the bat to do its magic, Knudson said.
</P>
<P>
   He likens the skill to typing or walking _ complex, fast-moving
muscle coordinations that become second nature after many, many
repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have batting practice every day, and they just get better
and better at it,'' Knudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball legend Ted Williams said he could actually see the ball
connect with his bat. But could he track it all the way from the
mound? No way, said Louis Dell'Osso, an eye movement specialist and
professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The eye can track a fastball for only the first 15 to 20 feet,
Dell'Osso said. Then the batter has to switch his gaze to the plate
and wait the other one- to two-tenths of a second for it to whiz
by. Even with a slow pitch of 60 mph, ``anything inside 15 feet of
home plate, you can't track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is less than halfway to the plate when the batter has
to decide to look where the ball is going. He has to guess where
the ball is going to be, and the pitcher is trying to fool him,''
Dell'Osso said. ``The ball can do a lot of things in those last 30
to 40 feet, and you've already had to make your decision.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the bat also factors into a slugger's ability to
send the ball fast and far. A lighter bat travels faster, but
delivers less mass at impact, said Bahill, a professor of systems
engineering at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most batters do better with lighter-weight bats, but a few
will do better with heavier ones,'' said Bahill, who has
exhaustively studied bat weight and performance data. He also
consulted with the San Francisco Giants in 1989, offering advice to
the club on which players should use heavier or lighter bats. The
team won the National League pennant that year.
</P>
<P>
   In general, taller players do better with heavier bats, but the
results are highly variable, and individual testing is required to
come up with a person's ideal bat weight, Bahill said.

CONSERVATIVE COUPLE PENS STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING KIDS'
CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCER ISLAND, Wash. _ Meet the Medveds _ not the usual family
next door these days.
</P>
<P>
   They watch no television whatsoever, no news, no sports, not
even any public broadcasting specials, and the three Medved
children are permitted to only watch six hours of parent-approved
videos each week.
</P>
<P>
   The two parents also have personally screened all their
children's playmates ``from the earliest ages'' to make sure they
are not the sort to exhibit inappropriate behavior that might
provide unwanted peer influences. And an occasional spanking is
sometimes employed to provide discipline in the Medved household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resist the argument that spanking is, by definition,
abusive,'' says Michael Medved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking,'' adds Diane Medved, ``is just one more tool in an
arsenal of disciplinary tactics, although we certainly do not do it
in any fit of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, who live in a spacious view home with a swimming
pool on Mercer Island, also are rigorous in the observance of their
Jewish faith, eating only Kosher foods and refraining from all
regular activities on the sabbath (including driving, cooking,
talking on the phone or turning on electrical devices).
</P>
<P>
   But however unlike other families the Medveds may be, they
firmly believe that far more parents would follow their example, or
at least part of it, if they just understood that it was an option.
</P>
<P>
   So the two Medveds have stepped smartly into the societal fray
to provide ``empowering'' support for parents from a couple with
established credentials. The Medveds are nationally known
conservatives, he as a film critic and a host of a syndicated radio
talk show that originates at KVI-AM in Seattle, she as host of a
multimedia show on the Internet, as a clinical psychologist with a
half-time private practice in her home and as a writer of several
books (including one on the American family co-written with former
Vice President Dan Quayle).
</P>
<P>
   Their prescription for parents is outlined in the Medveds' new
book, ``Saving Childhood: Protecting Our Children From the National
Assault on Innocence'' (HarperCollins, 324 pages, $24). This is an
unlikely and sometimes jarring mix of a parenting volume. It starts
with 200 pages of angry political diatribe and horror stories about
permissive and intrusive societal forces today. Then it follows
with 100 pages of heartfelt parenting advisories and strategies for
keeping kids as kids, at least a little while longer, with many
examples drawn from the Medveds' own experience raising 11-year-old
Sarah, 9-year-old Shayna and 6-year-old Danny.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their political affiliation, everyone in
America wants to have a conservative family,'' stresses Diane
Medved, 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives make the mistake of thinking that only
conservatives have conservative family values,'' adds Michael
Medved, 49. ``But no parent, no matter how partisan, wants to raise
kids that grow up to be like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds' book has more boogeymen than a Goosebumps book by
R.L. Stine (another prohibited entity in the Medved household).
They zap everything from Power Rangers dolls to children who do not
know etiquette to ``the disastrous experiment in forced busing'' to
a society ``obsessed with the importance of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Medveds reserve their strongest salvos for what they
consider the most odious transgressors against childhood today:
</P>
<P>
   _ The mass media, with their purveying of frightening images,
graphic violence and casual sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us elitist, self-righteous, self-appointed preservers of
our culture,'' write the Medveds, ``but hey, TV is goo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The schools, with their graphic programs aimed at warning
children against adult dangers (sex, disease, drugs, strangers),
programs introduced at ages far younger than, the Medveds believe,
average children are ever likely to encounter such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools,'' write the Medveds, ``teach children to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Other children, who exert peer pressure with their rudeness
toward adults, their absence of moral behavior and their pursuit of
such dangerous fads as materialism, gothic cults and body piercing
and tattooing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tattoo or brand,'' write the Medveds, ``is a permanent
statement that innocence is over.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents themselves, with their lazy abdication of the
responsibility for discipline and morality, are pushing kids into
too many choices about too many activities and showering them with
too many material goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents would serve their children better,'' write the
Medveds, ``if they emphasized happiness over achievement, and
goodness over goodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds themselves are not immune from the dilemmas,
compromises and contradictions that bedevil their fellow baby
boomers as parents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their book, the Medveds include themselves among
``concerned parents of public school students,'' but this month is
the first time that all three Medved children have spent even
partial time in public schools after being educated exclusively at
home with hired teachers (in Seattle) or in private Jewish day
schools (in California).
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds, an openly affectionate couple, are particularly
critical about the effects of divorce today _ one of Diane Medved's
earlier books is ``The Case Against Divorce.'' But both Medveds are
on their second marriage, although neither had children previously.
</P>
<P>
   The Medveds have zealously guarded their children from the
excesses of MTV and current rock music, only to have their younger
daughter mention, to their horror, that she knew the names of the
Spice Girls. That unwelcome knowledge turned out to have come from
what she heard during her time in a group that Diane Medved has
long supported, the Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to erase her mind,'' Diane Medved relates. ``But
by showing shock about such a thing (as the Spice Girls) that shows
her that it is not something I approve of. She gets the message, as
opposed to my just saying, `Oh, that's cool.' I talk a lot with her
about how I want her to remain my little girl. ... I know I cannot
keep her in the dark forever, but it should be a slow, gradual
process.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Medveds, who argue so strenuously about the need to
shield children from the damaging effects of the mass media (of
which they happen to be a part), do allow their children to listen
to talk radio, including their father's show, even at a time when
much political discussion there might once have been considered
X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be one reason why Sarah approached her father recently
and inquired, ``What's oral sex?''
</P>
<P>
   To which he replied, ``Do you really want to know? I don't think
you're going to like what you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. It has to do with mouth-genital contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do normal people do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not prohibited in the Torah. But it's not normal to do
that with somebody you're not married to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it may not be too surprising that the Medveds _ amid their
recommendations for reading to children, imbuing patriotism,
teaching manners, honoring parents, preserving optimism, telling
Bible stories, sharing family dinners _ also evidence a fondness
for times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ozzie and Harriet Nelson's life was celebrated rather
than scorned, TV messages championed rather than detracted from
wholesome ideals,'' the Medveds write. ``In days when women enjoyed
being home for the kids, peers came over for basketball in the
driveway and homemade lemonade rather than scattering for
unsupervised explorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe `the old days' before the social changes of the '60s
weren't perfect, but they allowed a bevy of family-friendly forces
to surround parents with encouragement for their mission: to honor
God, country and family, to use that white picket fence to keep out
threats to childhood, and keep loved ones close at hand.''

MANSON'S `ANIMALS' OFFERS BEASTLY WORLDVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead. Play the word association game with a teenage boy who
is into rock and heavy metal. You say ``Led'' and he'll say
``Zeppelin.'' But if you say ``Manson,'' dollars to dimes, he'll
respond ``Marilyn.''
</P>
<P>
   We have come to this: The nation's most-notorious Manson is
Marilyn, not Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie, the war-monger wannabe in hippie's clothing, made a
career of evil. Marilyn, the nihilistic rock star as androgynous
cadaver, has made a career singing about evil. Marilyn Manson's got
the media at his fingertips. At the MTV Music Awards last week,
Manson appeared draped in leopard skin with his bare butt _ or a
prosthetic _ hanging out. Also, this boy who was initially named
Brian Warner, boasted plastic, nipple-free breasts. He's always
cast himself as a quasi-alien being or a mutant-of-the-monster. Now
_ and on the cover of Manson's new album, ``Mechanical Animals''
(Nothing) _ he adds this fillip of provocative disturbing
(a)sexuality. Poor Charlie is still in the can, working his
website.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc by Manson and his merry men _ guitarist/bassist
Twiggy Ramirez, synthist Madonna Wayne Gacy, drummer Ginger Fish _
is in shops today. (Well, some shops. Wal-Mart has once again
passed.) The followup to Manson's mainstream breakthrough,
``Antichrist Superstar,'' ``Mechanical Animals'' was co-produced by
Manson and Michael Beinhorn (Soundgarden, Hole). Beinhorn knows a
few things about sculpting rough sounds for maximum mainstream
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively speaking, glitter-era David Bowie, the original
cracked actor, was hovering over the whole project. It's as if
Bowie said, ``Take what I did with `Ziggy Stardust' and `Diamond
Dogs' and make it gnarlier, nastier.'' As such, Manson has dyed his
hair flaming chartreuse, and he's been infected by the glam vibe.
``I'm just a boy playing the suicide king,'' Manson sings on title
cut. (``You're just a rock 'n' roll suicide?'' Bowie might answer.)
On ``Rock is Dead,'' Manson sings about the numbing insularity and
isolation of stardom _ another Bowie theme from ``Ziggy Stardust.''
</P>
<P>
   The swaggering first single, ``The Dope Show'' is more of a nod
in T.Rex's direction. It swings like a pendulum and clanks like a
jail-guitar door. Manson has called it a ``We Are the World'' for
dopers, and he's right. It's a slippery, sleazy rock anthem, all
rebellion, damnation and self-exploitation. Manson is obsessed by
the dark side of stardom _ ``Show me the dead stars, all of them
sing,'' he sings in ``Posthuman,'' capping the song with ``All that
gilteres is cold, all the glitters is cold.'' Manson has gone to
Hollywood _ his new home is in Laurel Canyon _ and he cavorts with
a higher level of rock star peer. But he finds still finds rot and
decay wherever he looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical Animals,'' is, without question, a melodic kick
upwards from ``Antichrist Superstar,'' just as that album was a
kick up from the group's first two CDs, ``Smells Like Children''
and ``Portrait of an American Family.'' Manson's previous work had
more of an industrial/techno grind to it. The image was total shock
treatment. This album is more guitar-stoked, more hook-based and,
thankfully, less dependent on the Manson vocal hiss. But the
worldview is still harsh and nihilistic, albeit the focus more
inwardly directed. This is a my-world-and-welcome-to-it album, and
it's about as peachy keen as you'd expect. Manson mixes hedonism
and self-flagellation. Sex is never fun; it's messy or forced, an
ugly embrace. The drug scene is omnipresent, somewhere between a
stimulus, a backdrop and a scourge. Manson presents himself as both
the user and the used, the spitter and the spitoon.
</P>
<P>
   About the happiest Manson allows himself to get is in
``Fundamentally Loathsome,'' where he wants to ``wake up in your
white sun'' _ but, essentially, he's really just trying to attain
the state of being comfortably numb, to borrow from Pink Floyd.
(Manson also borrows from Pink Floyd in terms of texture and dark
grandeur.) In ``I Want to Disappear'' he proclaims himself
``vacant,'' ``a whore.'' In ``New Model No. 15,'' he begins by
singing ``I'm as fake as a wedding cake.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been said before, Marilyn Manson is Alice Cooper for the
end of the century _ but with more venom. There was a smile under
Cooper's makeup. Manson hasn't let us glimpse that yet. His guard
is up and his aim is truly corrosive.

EXAMINING THE BLOODSHED OF BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HEARTS GROWN BRUTAL 
Sagas of Sarajevo 
By Roger Cohen 
Random House, 523 pp., illustrated, $27.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the Starr Report threatened to bring the world to a
grinding halt, another drumbeat of ominous reports persisted in the
back pages of last week's newspapers. Busloads of Albanian women
fled western Kosovo, dragging their tattered suitcases, weeping.
Men of fighting age were scarce in this province of the former
Yugoslavia, feared ``cleansed'' from the ethnic population. Former
US senator Bob Dole, now heading the International Commission for
Missing Persons in the Bosnian and Croatian Wars, called it a
``humanitarian catastrophe in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   Like presidential indiscretion, this news was hardly new. And
after all, this is the Balkans. This is the region where in 1992,
writes author Roger Cohen, ``rather than confront the genocide, an
attempt was made to pretend it was not happening.'' This is a place
long misunderstood, and often ignored, but within the pages of
``Hearts Grown Brutal'' lies a sweeping account of the Bosnian war
that dissects every official excuse and breathes anguish into every
statistic. At the same time, it shines a heartbreaking spotlight on
the conflict at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen weaves his central conviction _ that early US involvement
could have prevented the bloodshed in Bosnia _ through the stories
of four families. Each embodies the ethnic complexities of
Yugoslavia; each is destroyed by the war's end. After looking down
on the city of Sarajevo from the surrounding hills, from the
vantage point of the Serbian gunners, Cohen identifies the Bosnian
targets below with unnerving precision. There is Muris Zecevic, a
secular Muslim, shelled to death before his brother's eyes; there
is his mother, Bisera, shot in the stomach as she tries to flee the
city where her son died. In these intimate biographies, and their
violent conclusions, Cohen scripts a rich narrative of the
corporeal horror of war.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than lapse into sentimental laments, Cohen returns,
relentlessly, to the policies that allowed things to get that far.
He unleashes a scathing attack on the United States _ in his own
words and those of enraged officials who quit their posts in
disgust _ skewering President Clinton's election-year calls to
action in Yugoslavia. He recalls the 1992 satellite photographs of
Serb concentration camps at Srebrenica _ ones kept from the
Security Council at the time _ and he holds up an uncomfortable
mirror, reminding us that ``like America, Bosnia had been a
multi-ethnic state; it was dismembered through ideologies of ethnic
hatred that flouted the American ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bosnia did not satisfy the Pentagon's criteria for the use
of American power,'' he writes. ``The administration was presented
with an intractable mess, but it could find neither the
determination nor the moral conviction to rectify it. Bosnia's
dismemberment was consummated through this failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally misguided were humanitarian efforts. Lodged in the
20th-century ``victim syndrome,'' the United Nations refused to
identify an aggressor _ ``a poor substitute for foreign policy,''
Cohen writes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cohen never abandons another core mission of
the book: contextualizing the historical circumstances of the
Balkans, a region whose name has become synonymous with ``a mess.''
In the first third of the book, in a segment called ``The Lost
Century,'' he gives a painstaking account of the conflicts
preceding this one, reaching back past Tito's reign to Yugoslavia's
birth in 1918, continually wondering why it was, ``in the agonizing
vestiges of Yugoslavia, that memory and understanding were
inextricably linked.''

   Nowhere is this question more curious than in the myth of
Kosovo, Cohen believes. Oddly, its name is invoked victoriously by
modern Serbian leaders _ even though the 1389 ``Battle of Kosovo''
was one in which the Serbs were defeated by the Ottoman Turks. It
is turned on its head as a source of Serbian national pride. And in
this, it is a classic Serbian inversion. When Serbian leaders
complain of ``neo-fascist aggression'' against Serbs in Kosovo, as
they did in a 1986 memorandum, they are really talking about a
region in which, in the years preceding, ``no more than five Serbs
died,'' Cohen writes.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter covering the war for The New York Times, Cohen lay
awake at night in his room in Sarajevo, troubled, and he ``came
away wounded at the war's end in 1995.'' The doublespeak of the
Serbs, particularly leaders Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan
Karadzic, clearly disturbed him, as he watched officials in the
West take them at their word. Cohen's clarity of convictions
courses through ``Hearts Grown Brutal''; it is one of the few
comforts in this devastating book. And as officials now face the
problem of how to deal with Kosovo, it remains to be seen whether
there will be an answer to the question posed at the start of the
book: ``Was the anguish of Yugoslavia that of our dying century?''

A SAINTLY SALOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTWERP, Belgium _ St. Peter, over there in the corner, has
confided to a Belgian pal of mine named Franz that the commandment
Moses overlooked _ the Eleventh _ is to be found right here.
</P>
<P>
   Saints preserve us, this is the gospel truth, says Franz, who
has also been communing with St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, according to an old Belgian legend, the neglected
Eleventh Commandment was this: `Thou shalt not water the booze.'
Probably wine in the original version. There is no mention of
whiskey, beer or jenever _ our gin _ that I know of in the Old
Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this renowned saloon at the center of old Antwerp, is
named the Eleventh Commandment, and houses a crowd of saints of
every name, description and size _ plaster and wooden statues
salvaged (or stolen?) from bygone churches that went out of
business or were razed.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis is feeding his birds, although Franz says they would
prefer beer _ ``at least here because our Belgian beer is the best
in the world. It would make those sparrows act like eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs a sculpted Last Supper is in progress. ``The menu here
at the Eleventh Commandment is more varied and tasty, I suspect,''
says Franz. ``As you can see, the location makes the saints feel
right at home. We Belgians say, `Thirstiness is next to Godliness.'
By the way, we lead the world in beer-drinking per capita: 200
pints a year for every citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, practically next door is the soaring Cathedral of Our
Lady, the highest of the Lowlands' Gothic churches, facing the
broad main square, the Grote Markt. Leading man outside is the
bronze folk hero, Brabo, topping a fountain and clutching the hand
that he ripped off the evil giant, Druoon Antigoon. I suppose the
guides tell tourists, ``Let's give this guy a big hand!''
</P>
<P>
   Within the cathedral, a leading man is the gifted hometown boy
Pieter Paul Rubens, represented by two massive and powerful
paintings: the raising of the cross, and Christ being brought down
from the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Those old-boy Belgians could paint, all right, and their work is
all over town. Pieter Brueghel of the apocalyptic visions is my
guy. At the Mayer Van Den Bergh Museum is his transfixing ``Mad
Margot,'' a woman running across a landscape of desolation and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   After that, my friend Aurelio says we need a cup of coffee.
Conveniently the Sucree Salee is nearby, a 19th-century bakery with
tables outside, presided over by two stunningly pretty and pleasant
blondes, Sonia Rymenans and her daughter, Marianne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in the family for generations,'' says Sonia. ``My
father's retired, but he still does some baking. Since you are a
stranger, I must insist, perhaps immodestly, that you have my new
cookies with your coffee. They have become quite a hit in Belgium,
and have been given a prize for calling attention to our great
port.''
</P>
<P>
   Deservedly so. The cookies, trimmed in the celebrated Belgian
chocolate, are shaped like the container ships that are so
prominent in Antwerp's maritime economy. Deliciously they take the
edge off Breughel.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia takes over during a look through the handsome house of
16th-century printer Christopher Plantin, a museum devoted to
ancient books, manuscripts, presses, and printing equipment. Not
that I can read them, but it's still thrilling to look upon ninth-,
10th- and 11th-century manuscripts, under glass, and the
15th-century poet Jean Froissart's ``Chronicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the metal type, set into headlines and stories by hand,
isn't too different from what I used in a shop where my college
newspaper was printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go back that far, do you?'' says Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not quite. But look at these galley proofs with inked
corrections. This wasn't uncommon until _ suddenly _ computers took
over. Not that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Dock's Cafe, beside the Schelde River that leads to the harbor,
had been recommended for its seafood. It's excellent, a lively
place with waitresses charging up and down stairways to cover the
main floor and mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   My personal rule, undoubtedly provincial, never to eat lobster
outside of New England is countermanded by Aurelio's insistence to
``take a chance. Belgium's blue lobster has a great reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. It's small, succulent, needs no melted butter.
Lobster follows Dutch sardines with onions and beans, taken with a
straight shot of gin. Now her personal rule _ no gin ever _
countermanded. ``It works with the sardines. They're marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking back to the hotel on this Saturday night, we stray into
a downtown pleasure precinct called ``de rosse buurt'' _ the
red-light district where men of all ages are window shopping. The
ladies in lingerie in the show windows are there on a rental basis,
and the neon tube illumination of the storefronts is, yes, scarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Our concierge later tells us, ``It's, of course, illegal, but a
very old custom that alarms no one. This is a very old port, and
you know the saying about sailors and their girls in every port.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalistic zeal leads us to knock on a door. Tina leaves her
window to answer. ``Both of you?'' she inquires pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the window?'' Aurelio grimaces, wondering about working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Tina laughs. ``We have a room behind. For both of
you the fee would be 3,000 francs ($80). Shall we begin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking,'' says Aurelio, and the door closes. ``I think
we better go back and hang out with the saints.''
</P>

WITH SOME FINE-TUNING, `ROSEANNE' COULD BE FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ROSEANNE SHOW 
On: ABC 
Time: Daily at 10 a.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know Roseanne is not out to make friends. With her savage
honesty, her pretzel-logic feminism, her tabloid attention-getting,
and her crooked grammar, she has probably offended every American
at least once in the past decade. But filtered through her late,
great sitcom, ``Roseanne,'' the comedian's abrasive wit was as
culturally valuable as it was dear. For nine years, she provided us
with a TV role-model alternative to those countless blonde
bombshells and helped deliver the family sitcom from yuppie
frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   Can Roseanne make a successful return to TV without the sanded
edges and blue-collar dignity of her Roseanne Connor character?
Monday morning, the mud-wrestling, national-anthem-screeching,
much-face-lifted diva got down with the people to host the premiere
of her own talk-variety hour, ``The Roseanne Show.'' Set to air
daily at 10 a.m., the syndicated series arrived after a summer of
industry rumors that it was a directionless mess headed toward
creative disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a mess? Despite a few unbearable moments, a format that's
clearly still in progress, and the fact that it will never be as
significant as ``Roseanne,'' ``The Roseanne Show'' exhibited a fair
amount of promise and enthusiasm. The show's writers need to do
serious rejiggering, but the most important element _ Roseanne's
persona _ appears to click in the daytime arena. Let me say
straight away that I prefer irreverence to irrelevance, and would
take one painfully candid Roseanne over five disingenuous Rosie
O'Donnells any day. Rather than put on false modesty and adulation
for her guests, Roseanne takes a spikier, more self-ironic route,
affecting mock grandeur as she opened her show Monday descending
from a crane, throwing rose petals and Polaroids of herself onto
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The show appears to be mimicking a spectrum of daytime formats,
from traditional celebrity interviews and socially aware ``Oprah''
segments to raucous argumentation straight out of ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' A short monologue opened the hour, with Roseanne
nudging the critics by saying to her audience, ``All I have ever
really wanted to do was to talk directly to you without any
middleman.'' Then she brought out Whoopi Goldberg, and the two
began some feisty political chatter.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Whoopi is not ``Meet the Press,'' and her
opinions about Ken Starr and Bill Clinton are not especially
eye-opening. On the other hand, Whoopi is not ``Meet the Press,''
and as she got heated up, the conversation had an earthy,
``Politically Incorrect'' feel to it. ``I respect everything you
say,'' Roseanne chimed in, ``but you're full of (bleep) on this
issue.'' Certainly it was more fun than an entire segment on
Whoopi's latest endeavor, ``Hollywood Squares.'' Also, Whoopi and
Roseanne stayed at an unusual level of frankness as they talked
about their difficult daughters and Whoopi's role as grandmother _
a condition most celebrities try to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roseanne Show'' took an unfortunate turn as the two stars
recalled their years as welfare mothers, then greeted three teenage
single mothers for an empowerment talk. As Whoopi and Roseanne sat
on the edge of the stage with concerned expressions, the three
women answered condescending questions like ``What's the hardest
part of your day'' with lines like ``Sometimes I feel like I just
can't breathe.'' It was hard to watch, as Roseanne gave them money
and urged them to ``build a network of mothers,'' and it smacked of
wealthy Hollywood types processing their own feelings of guilt. It
also revealed the show's demographic intentions too obviously.
</P>
<P>
   In another failed bit, Roseanne tried for David Letterman-styled
absurdity, as a police sketch artist drew scenes from ``Ghost.''
And she conducted a far-too-lengthy interview with ``Linder
Tripp,'' as Nora Dunn sat wearing a horrible blond wig. ``You're a
big fat snitch,'' Roseanne yelled. Roseanne is eager to offer
strength to her mostly female audience _ she even had Sandra
Bernhard sing ``I Am Woman'' over the credits _ but first she needs
to offer them a more finely tuned show.

VALENTINES, CRANBERRIES AND GYPSY MOTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know (or should) that the Pilgrims' arrival in Plymouth,
the Salem witch trials, the Boston Tea Party, and Paul Revere's
ride all happened in Massachusetts. But those are only a few of the
Commonwealth's claims to fame, as a new book clearly shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Massachusetts Legacy: 150 Landmark Events That Shaped Our
Nation'' by Christopher Kenneally (Adams Publishing, $16) explores
many events with Massachusetts connections you may not have known
about. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _In 1631, Boston court officials created America's first police
force.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1814, the Industrial Revolution began with steam-powered
mills in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1816, Captain Henry Hall of Cape Cod became the first to
cultivate cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1850, the New England Valentine Co., the first mass producer
of valentines, was founded in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1869, scientist Leoplold Trouvelot, living in Medford,
mistakenly unleashed the first gypsy moths in North America.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1887, the predecessor of the roadside diner was introduced
in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1903, the Boston Pilgrims faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in
the first baseball World Series.
</P>
<P>
   _And in 1944, in a Cambridge laboratory, the 50-foot-long
Harvard-IBM Mark 1 Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator ushered
in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  Where besides Kentucky will you find Fort Knox?
(Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``Nowhere does death occur so spectacularly, so proudly,
as it does in New England in October.'' _ a reflection on foliage
in ``Gone, Baby, Gone'' by Dennis Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; In a name: &LR;  There is a pasta restaurant in Brunswick, Maine, called
the Great Impasta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Travel bookshelf: &LR;  People who come to Northern New England to view
foliage have been known to take wrong turns, then say words that
are as colorful as the leaves. To help avoid that exercise in free
speech, DeLorme, a Maine-based mapping company, has issued three
easy-to-use books: the ``Maine Atlas and Gazeteer,'' the ``Vermont
Atlas and Gazeteer,'' and the ``New Hampshire Atlas and Gazeteer.''
In addition to routes, there is information on historic sites,
scenic drives, and camping, hunting, and fishing sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Yeah, right: &LR;  From a letter sent to the Orlando tourism people:
``Please send me four Disney World tickets _ I'll send you the
money later.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Busmen's holiday choices: &LR;  The American Bus Association has chosen
Branson, Mo., as the best all-around destination and the best value
for the money. Other selections: best small-town destination,
Lancaster, Pa.; hottest up-and-coming destination, Myrtle Beach,
S.C.; city that most needs to be nicer to groups, New York; and
most popular casino or gaming attraction, Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Today's fractured English lesson: &LR;  A sign on the railing of a
river-cruise boat in Guilin, China, advises: ``Please don't
leapoter the fence.'' (With thanks to Mary Mahoney of Beverly, who
notes, ``Seeing the murky water, we were very careful not to
leapoter the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Museum of the Month:  &LR; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in
Cleveland has opened an exhibit dedicated to Elvis Presley _ the
first display in the hall that honors a single artist. The exhibit,
called the largest collection of Presley memorabilia outside
Graceland, contains much more than guitars and jumpsuits. Among the
items: crayons Elvis used when he was 8, his seventh-grade report
card (with an ``A'' in spelling and a ``D'' in science), an
application for a trucking company job (which he didn't get), a
high school band program that spells his name ``Prestly,'' and a
certificate listing heart disease as the cause of his death. For
museum brochures or more information, call 888-764-ROCK or visit
www.rockhall.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of the hall of fame: &LR;  How did the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame and Museum end up in Cleveland anyway? One reason was that
Alan Freed, who popularized the term ``rock 'n' roll,'' got his
career really going in Cleveland and staged perhaps the first rock
'n' roll shows there. Another reason was the enthusiasm of
Cleveland residents in wooing the hall of fame committee and
providing an excellent location for the building near the shore of
Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Did you guess it? &LR;  You'll also find Fort Knox in Prospect, Maine,
across the Penobscot from Bucksport. It's a former military post
from the Civil War era.

   One possible option, bringing back former Senate majority leader
George Mitchell to serve as chief of staff, would be like throwing
gasoline on the fire. Whether you think that's a good idea or not
depends on your reading of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Let us quickly retrace our steps. The roots of the current
crisis go back to 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president
over Jimmy Carter. But the origins of the partisan frenzy that has
led the Republicans to attempt to hound bill Clinton from office go
back mainly to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's 1980 election marked a change of course, America's
entry into a global right turn, toward market styles of
organization, away from increasing the powers of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The movement had begun elsewhere _ in Chile, Spain, and
Portugal, in China and the United Kingdom. In due course it would
spread throughout the rest of the world: to Europe, the Soviet
Union, Latin American, South Asia, and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the zig-zag of American politics, the first year or so of
the Reagan presidency was a moment as profound as had been the
beginning of the New Deal in 1932 _ and before long the outlines of
his program achieved the same kind of broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years the hapless Democratic Party struggled to
understand what had happened _ and resisted the developing mandate,
even when elections drove home the point. In 1984 Reagan buried
Walter Mondale in a landslide. In 1988 George Bush clobbered
Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1992 did the Democrats nominate a candidate sufficiently
like a Republican to be trusted to serve as steward of the Reagan
consensus _ William Jefferson Clinton. He took office on much the
same terms as Republican Dwight Eisenhower had inherited the New
Deal from Democratic presidents 40 years before _ with a license to
tinker, but not to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, however, the bitterness of the rivalry between the
parties began to approach new highs. George Bush, who had come into
office promising a ``kinder, gentler'' version of the Reagan years,
found himself opposed by Democrats at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the intransigent Democrats in those years was
Senate majority leader George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   First Mitchell managed to torpedo Bush's promise to engineer a
capital gains tax cut. Then he turned on Bush after the 1990 budget
agreement to trim the deficit on the eve of the Gulf War, mocking
it as ``a flop of a flip of a flop'' _ despite the fact that Bush
had brought upon himself a storm of right-wing disdain by entering
into the agreement in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell then led the opposition to the Persian Gulf War. After
it was concluded sucessfully, he handed Bush a series of
legislative defeats that contributed to the popular image of a
president who had lost control of domestic policy. And throughout,
Mitchell was among those who sought the use of special prosecutors
to pursue both Reagan and Bush and their aides for their conduct of
foreign policy in Nicaragua and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, George Mitchell voluntarily stepped down from the
Senate. He declined Clinton's offer of a Supreme Court nomination.
He failed to get the job he had hoped for as commissioner of
baseball. Only then did Clinton name him chairman of the North
Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In that job, of course, Mitchell was spectacularly successful.
The agreement he brokered has won him the intense admiration of
both sides _ and a place in history that he may be reluctant to
give up.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitchell were to return to serve Clinton, as The Los Angeles
Times has reported he might, he would be walking into a situation
whose intransigence, culturally adjusted, rivals that of the one
that he just left in the Emerald Isle. Only this time he wouldn't
be seen as a neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of fiercely partisan Mitchell would signal Bill
Clinton's intent to go ``to the matresses'' _ gang talk for all-out
war with Republicans. Still crazy after all these years? They would
deserve each other.

   The gibberish resounding from Wall Street is so loud I can
scarcely hear myself losing money. Ever since this Jello market
began to jiggle, any pundit with a tongue to wag has raced before
the television cameras to declaim in the most sober and sapient
tones the foulest nonsense to hit the airwaves since Howard Stern
first panted into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   These blind seers scatter their wisdom like fairy dust. For our
market woes, they say, blame Russia, blame earnings, blame
presidential prusience, blame Keiko the killer whale. The jabbering
is an institutional con suavely presented as a clarifying gaze deep
into the heart of our current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Listen long enough to the jangle of contradictory alarms and
assurances and you soon realize that the bunco artists are into the
muck well over their heads, clueless as you and me, and are just
blowing mud bubbles at us.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to get my investment adviser on his cell phone as he
was shuttling between appearances on CNBC and the Game Show
Network. He's a big shot, a partner in the esteemed brokerage firm
Kidding Nobody &AMP; Co. Like Cher, my Wall Street wizard goes by only
one name: Merlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merlin, what do I do? What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not panic, my friend. You are an experienced, long-term
investor, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you know these market hiccups are soon digested,'' he
continued. ``But we may be witnessing something worse than a hiccup
_ something closer to intestinal poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you saying?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be headed for an ugly case of market vomiting. You'll
be left wading knee-deep in a bucket of stinking losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy rubber boots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the deal with Russia?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put it to you this way: When was the last time you went
on a shopping spree at Brooks Brothers and paid in rubles?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see your point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has a puny economy; it buys less than 1 percent of our
exports. Their mess can't touch us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew, what a relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's just suppose: The Russian economy is D.O.A., its
institutions are in a straight-jacket, its currency is toilet
paper, there's anarchy in the streets _ and someone over there has
an itchy finger on the nuclear button.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh dear, oh dear. What do I do, Merlin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best case? Bend over and kiss your you-know-what goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, let's be realistic,'' I offered. ``Alan Greenspan
will never allow the world to plunge into catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, the Omnipotent One. Yes, the Federal Reserve chairman will
always be there to protect us.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omnipotent One has his itchy finger on a far bigger weapon
than any nuclear bomb: the money spigot. Turn the valve a touch
this way and flood the world with dollars. Another flick of the
wrist and the Omnipotent One can stop Russia from falling in the
punchbowl, can feed hungry mouths in Indonesia, can make us
stock-market gaga forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'll sleep soundly tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you fluff your pillow, I must tell you one more thing.
The Omnipotent One may have had all his Omnipotence can take. He's
been heard muttering, `Amscray, amscray,' and has been seen in a
leather vest mounting a Harley-Davidson. The Omnipotent One, I
fear, is about to roar down the highway with a biker gang, and
we'll never hear his sacred mutterings again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doomed! What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy Harley stock.''

 &HT;    
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a bright Saturday morning in Boston. Just off the Public
Garden, in the health club of the Four Seasons Hotel, two men climb
onto exercise bikes and fiddle with the little TV sets at the
consoles.
 &HT;    Barry MacLean, who runs a large family business in Illinois and
has had his share of frustrations with Washington bureaucracy,
tunes in to cartoons. At the next bike, William Neukom, Microsoft's
chief lawyer in its landmark legal battle with the Justice
Department, tunes in to a C-Span rebroadcast of a presidential
speech.
 &HT;    A moment later, Neukom looks at MacLean's console, then at his
own and mutters, ``What's the difference? It's all entertainment.''
 &HT;    A month later, in the swish setting of the Primi Piatti
restaurant, a few blocks from the White House on Washington's
Pennsylvania Avenue, Warren Beatty is poking at his pasta and
bantering with a handful of capital columnists and TV
correspondents.
 &HT;    There, amid talk of President Clinton's woes and Beatty's movie
``Bulworth,'' the actor has an epiphany: ``There is no difference
anymore between Hollywood and Washington. They are both totally
into the sound bite. One is no more superficial than the other.
Even this whole process of yakking to people about this movie is
really no different from what you'd be doing if you were running
for office.''
 &HT;    Politics. Entertainment. Politics as entertainment. The
distinction between the two, never sharp, is today less well
defined than ever. Once, the presidency was a documentary shown in
prime time; now it has degenerated into a soap opera for afternoon
television.
 &HT;    Once, campaign advertising complemented stump speeches and
position papers; in some races today, the ads virtually replace
stump speeches and position papers. Once, news shows provided a
sober intermission between situation comedies and full-length
feature films; now they have taken on characteristics of both.
 &HT;    ``We are now reaching a point,'' says Sen. Richard Durbin,
Democrat of Illinois, ``where the line between entertainment and
news is blurring.''
 &HT;    In technology as in entertainment, the word for this phenomenon
is ``convergence.'' And what politics and entertainment
increasingly have in common is not only that they reward style more
than content; not only that they seek to manipulate rather than
simply to persuade; not only that they pander rather than
challenge; not only that they reward celebrity and avoid searching
questions.
 &HT;    All those things are true, but the most important similarity
between modern entertainment and modern politics is what is, in a
sense, most un-American about them both: They are passive
experiences.
 &HT;    Like entertainment, politics is increasingly part of the
easy-listening background music of the time _ always present, not
particularly adventuresome, seldom very important. Like
entertainment, politics is increasingly a show of special effects.
Like entertainment, politics is increasingly modified by the word
``virtual.'' And, like entertainment, politics has become something
that other people do.
 &HT;    This movement of politics from the active mode to the passive
has grave implications for American civic life and for the health
of our democratic system. It is, moreover, an important departure
for a nation that was born in the activism of the 18th-century
revolutionaries, that conducted the signature debates of the modern
age in public, that at every turn decided to expand its visions of
freedom and liberty rather than to constrict them _ and that
throughout its history broadened, rather than diminished, its
definition of ``rights.''
 &HT;    ``We are in danger of becoming a nation of spectators,'' warned
The National Commission on Civic Renewal, based in College Park,
Md., which for a year studied American civic life.
 &HT;    There's always been a bit of entertainment in politics and a bit
of politics in entertainment. Indeed, in Elizabethan times the
theater was a public sphere, the place where, in the absence of
newspapers, television, talk radio or Oprah, the real issues were
debated _ with vivid, meaningful conflict over questions such as
monarchical succession, religious freedom, social and class
structure and economic mobility.
 &HT;    ``Entertainment was the very place where political ideas were
articulated and challenged and changed,'' says David Scott Kastan,
a Columbia University authority on Shakespeare and his time. ``It
was what made the theater exciting and entertaining and important,
and it is why we remember Shakespeare today. Now we have an
entertainment industry that doesn't engage in serious political
thought, but worse, we have a political system that doesn't engage
in serious political thought.''
 &HT;    In America too, politics has always had a big entertainment
element but in truth, it was far more entertaining in the past.
Politics was the great national sport at the turn of the century,
and one of the forgotten truths about 19th-century politics is that
many Americans voted for one party or another not because they
favored its politics but because they preferred its barbecues.
 &HT;    Even in more recent days, there was a greater flair and more
flavor to politics. John Lindsay slept overnight on a steelworker's
couch. Barry Goldwater flew his own campaign plane. Nelson
Rockefeller was a walking vaudeville act, traveling in helicopters
and seaplanes and boats, eating Oreo cookies all day long and
shepherding favored reporters to one of the best wine cellars in
the world.
 &HT;    Gov. John Rhodes of Ohio based an entire campaign on visiting
county fairs. One Pennsylvania congressman slept in his office,
surrounded by hundreds of bags of mail that were never opened. Gov.
William Scranton of Pennsylvania used to have roast swan for
Christmas dinner. Jimmy Tayoun, the last of the Philadelphia street
politicians, made a point of running red lights to attend a wake
for a Polish saloonkeeper in South Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``We've always had great showmen in American politics,'' says
former Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1972. ``But the increased use of media
consultants and all these photo-op tactics lend themselves to false
drama and the creation of entertainment. That's the big
difference.''
 &HT;    American politics used to be a participatory sport, not a
spectator sport, and it was conducted by getting people to hold
signs and sit in phone banks. That is dying or, in some regions, is
dead already. Politicians have a keen sense of trends in American
life, and so they are telling us something when they no longer
devote countless hours to choosing their chief organizers. Now they
spend that time selecting their press secretaries, media
consultants and strategists.
 &HT;    ``Politics today is all media,'' says Michael Whouley, a
Boston-based political consultant who is close to Vice President Al
Gore. ``More than 10 years ago, you would compartmentalize a
campaign: media, fund-raising and field organizing. Now it's
fund-raising, and the fund-raising is all geared to the media.''
 &HT;    This hasn't changed only the way politics is conducted. It also
has changed the sort of people who run for office and, just as
important, the kind of people who are drawn to campaigns. The
organizers are passe. The media manipulators are king.
 &HT;    Listen to the view of Beatty, who grew up in the Washington
suburbs but whose work is done in Hollywood: ``It's impossible to
engage people in a complex issue. You've got to stop them from
channel surfing. You've got to give them a simple, vulgarized
version of things. And you're doing it all with a rearview mirror
that you didn't always have: You now know how people will react to
things.''
 &HT;    Maybe the best place to see the merging of entertainment and
politics is in the movies. Just recently, Michael Douglas, Jack
Nicholson, Gene Hackman, Kevin Kline, Jack Lemmon, James Garner,
Dan Aykroyd, Harrison Ford, Sam Waterston and John Travolta have
all played the president of the United States on film. The American
president isn't only a political figure. It's a movie.
 &HT;    ``Politics has always been show business,'' says former
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who was a principal figure
in the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush. ``Today it's more show business.''
 &HT;    Show business _ complete with celebrities. The entire notion of
celebrity can, of course, be traced to the entertainment world, and
in truth celebrities have always been interested in politics _ and
vice versa.
 &HT;    Frank Mankiewicz, the veteran Washington public-relations
executive and a close adviser to both McGovern and Robert F.
Kennedy, likes to tell about how his uncle, Joe Mankiewicz, a great
director and writer who won four Oscars, called him and said he was
coming to Washington.
 &HT;    Mankiewicz offered to throw a dinner party for his uncle, who
requested that some of the senators in the middle of the Vietnam
debate _ McGovern, Frank Church of Idaho, Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin _ be invited. His uncle wanted to spend the evening
talking about reductions in troop strength and what the Chinese
were going to do about Vietnam; the senators wanted only to ask
about the casting couch and Marilyn Monroe.
 &HT;    This hasn't changed. ``Today, you get Barbra Streisand in
Washington, and she wants to talk about land mines,'' Mankiewicz
says, ``and everybody at dinner wants to talk about why she didn't
get nominated for `The Mirror Has Two Faces.'''
 &HT;    In the old days, there were two Hollywoods, one Republican and
one Democratic. The actors and actresses were almost all
Republicans, the writers and producers almost all Democrats. There
were no centrists. The conservatives were very far to the right,
and the liberals were very much to the left. The Hitler-Stalin pact
of 1939 split the left, but even then there was no middle ground.
And so the debates were furious. Hollywood was divided over FDR and
the New Deal and over Upton Sinclair's 1934 gubernatorial campaign
in California.
 &HT;    There's nothing new about someone such as Beatty being involved
in the presidential campaigns of RFK in 1968, McGovern in 1972 and
Gary Hart in 1984. But what is new is the melding of politics and
celebrity, and that began with John Kennedy.
 &HT;    ``Reagan may be the first movie-star president, but after all,
the Kennedys themselves made glamour an indispensable part of
American politics long before the host of `Death Valley Days' and
the `General Electric Theater' reached the White House,'' Michael
Knox Beran writes in ``The Last Patrician,'' the remarkable book
about Robert Kennedy published this spring. ``Joseph Kennedy was in
Hollywood, learning its lessons, studying its methods, financing
its movies, 10 years before Ronald Reagan showed up at Jack
Warner's studio in Burbank in 1937.''
 &HT;    But though Joe Kennedy had been drawn to Hollywood and its
melange of starlets and celebrity, his son John had a celebrity of
his own, a breezy insouciance, a touch of intellectualism, a quick
sense of humor.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have to make Kennedy a celebrity, and nobody in the
campaign _ Larry O'Brien and Kenny O'Donnell and Ted Sorensen _ was
a celebrity,'' says Joe Napolitan, who worked for Kennedy in 1960,
Johnson in 1964 and Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 and may have been
the first person ever to call himself a political consultant. ``He
naturally had it all: He was a war hero, he was handsome, he had
just married a glamorous woman, he had a big name and he was a
senator.''
 &HT;    Today a lot of presidential candidates not only try to package
themselves (as 19th-century presidents did, invariably finding a
log cabin in their past) but also try to make themselves
celebrities in their own right.
 &HT;    Surely Bill Clinton has a bit of the entertainer in him. He can
play the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall Show, he can delight a group
of senior citizens, he can play to just about any audience. But
there's nothing entertaining about his plight since the Monica
Lewinsky story broke in January _ and yet the entire spectacle has
more in common with mass entertainment than with serious politics.
 &HT;    Some of that, to be sure, is Clinton's fault. There is little
dispute that the president has put himself in harm's way with some
of the women he has encountered over the years. And Clinton, a
fervent disciple of Kennedy's style, has merged the public and the
private in new ways. He opened his home to people he describes as
his ``friends'' but who also are big Democratic fund-raisers. He
willingly disclosed the sort of private details of his life _ not
only his preference in underwear but his mother's many marriages
and the alcohol and abuse that filled his home life as a youngster
_ that in other presidents' lives are often left to a sleuthing
biographer or historian.
 &HT;    But the storm that has engulfed the Clinton presidency since
January has been governed by the press as well, which has lunged at
unsubstantiated rumors, trailed Lewinsky and transformed her into a
woman of mystery, and added a sense of treacly melodrama to a sober
legal proceeding that has its own inherent drama.
 &HT;    This is all occurring at a time when there are few contested
issues in American life. With a strong economy, a deficit that has
disappeared and no great foreign threats, national life is quiet,
devoid of the great struggles that captivated Americans even in the
tranquil years of the 1950s, which had wars in Korea and the Middle
East, civil-rights battles in Little Rock, terrifying superpower
confrontations, a dramatic uprising in Hungary and the launching of
the space age with the Soviet Sputnik satellite.
 &HT;    Modern politics is infused with entertainment values because
modern politics is infused with media influences. The pace, tone
and timbre of the House and Senate changed once their deliberations
were televised; Gore and Newt Gingrich were among the first to
recognize the power that televised sessions provided, and both
became grandstanders _ and powerful figures _ as a result.
 &HT;    The advent of cable television, which was supposed to provide
``local access'' to lower levels of government, also changed the
way politics is conducted.
 &HT;    ``Because of that, politicians play to the camera,'' says State
Assemblyman Bill Campbell of California, a first-term Republican
who represents southeastern Orange County. ``More people speak, and
they speak longer than they would otherwise. People play to the
tube.''
 &HT;    Yet the rush to entertain has killed the entertainment in
politics _ and has made politics less appealing than ever. This
autumn as many as 100 House members may run unopposed. The major
parties simply were not able to find anyone to challenge the
incumbents in nearly a quarter of the House districts in the
nation.
 &HT;    ``It takes a major effort now to convince anyone to run for
public office,'' says Durbin, the Illinois senator. ``The intrusion
into your private life is too great. Politics has reached such a
low level that people just can't stomach the idea of going into
politics.
 &HT;    ``I spend time on the phone, begging people to run for all sorts
of offices,'' he continues. ``It's a very hard sell. They don't
know whether they want to put themselves or their families through
this. You either have to be flawless or prepared to see your flaws
on the front page of the paper.''
 &HT;    And then people don't think they can get anything accomplished
even if they are elected. ``People always ask: Do you get anything
done up there? Can you make a difference?'' says Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who heads the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. He
says he answers yes.
 &HT;    He's probably right. This year the lawmakers have dealt with
issues such as the budget surplus, whether to overhaul the campaign
finance system, what the minimum wage should be and how much money
should be spent on thousands of line items in the 13 appropriations
bills that get almost no attention anywhere.
 &HT;    Those are real decisions involving real people. In the end,
that's politics. That's not entertainment.

own and mutters, ``What's the difference? It's all entertainment.''
 &HT;    A month later, in the swish setting of the Primi Piatti
restaurant, a few blocks from the White House on Washington's
Pennsylvania Avenue, Warren Beatty is poking at his pasta and
bantering with a handful of capital columnists and TV
correspondents.
 &HT;    There, amid talk of President Clinton's woes and Beatty's movie
``Bulworth,'' the actor has an epiphany: ``There is no difference
anymore between Hollywood and Washington. They are both totally
into the sound bite. One is no more superficial than the other.
Even this whole process of yakking to people about this movie is
really no different from what you'd be doing if you were running
for office.''
 &HT;    Politics. Entertainment. Politics as entertainment. The
distinction between the two, never sharp, is today less well
defined than ever. Once, the presidency was a documentary shown in
prime time; now it has degenerated into a soap opera for afternoon
television.
 &HT;    Once, campaign advertising complemented stump speeches and
position papers; in some races today, the ads virtually replace
stump speeches and position papers. Once, news shows provided a
sober intermission between situation comedies and full-length
feature films; now they have taken on characteristics of both.
 &HT;    ``We are now reaching a point,'' says Sen. Richard Durbin,
Democrat of Illinois, ``where the line between entertainment and
news is blurring.''
 &HT;    In technology as in entertainment, the word for this phenomenon
is ``convergence.'' And what politics and entertainment
increasingly have in common is not only that they reward style more
than content; not only that they seek to manipulate rather than
simply to persuade; not only that they pander rather than
challenge; not only that they reward celebrity and avoid searching
questions.
 &HT;    All those things are true, but the most important similarity
between modern entertainment and modern politics is what is, in a
sense, most un-American about them both: They are passive
experiences.
 &HT;    Like entertainment, politics is increasingly part of the
easy-listening background music of the time _ always present, not
particularly adventuresome, seldom very important. Like
entertainment, politics is increasingly a show of special effects.
Like entertainment, politics is increasingly modified by the word
``virtual.'' And, like entertainment, politics has become something
that other people do.
 &HT;    This movement of politics from the active mode to the passive
has grave implications for American civic life and for the health
of our democratic system. It is, moreover, an important departure
for a nation that was born in the activism of the 18th-century
revolutionaries, that conducted the signature debates of the modern
age in public, that at every turn decided to expand its visions of
freedom and liberty rather than to constrict them _ and that
throughout its history broadened, rather than diminished, its
definition of ``rights.''
 &HT;    ``We are in danger of becoming a nation of spectators,'' warned
The National Commission on Civic Renewal, based in College Park,
Md., which for a year studied American civic life.
 &HT;    There's always been a bit of entertainment in politics and a bit
of politics in entertainment. Indeed, in Elizabethan times the
theater was a public sphere, the place where, in the absence of
newspapers, television, talk radio or Oprah, the real issues were
debated _ with vivid, meaningful conflict over questions such as
monarchical succession, religious freedom, social and class
structure and economic mobility.
 &HT;    ``Entertainment was the very place where political ideas were
articulated and challenged and changed,'' says David Scott Kastan,
a Columbia University authority on Shakespeare and his time. ``It
was what made the theater exciting and entertaining and important,
and it is why we remember Shakespeare today. Now we have an
entertainment industry that doesn't engage in serious political
thought, but worse, we have a political system that doesn't engage
in serious political thought.''
 &HT;    In America too, politics has always had a big entertainment
element but in truth, it was far more entertaining in the past.
Politics was the great national sport at the turn of the century,
and one of the forgotten truths about 19th-century politics is that
many Americans voted for one party or another not because they
favored its politics but because they preferred its barbecues.
 &HT;    Even in more recent days, there was a greater flair and more
flavor to politics. John Lindsay slept overnight on a steelworker's
couch. Barry Goldwater flew his own campaign plane. Nelson
Rockefeller was a walking vaudeville act, traveling in helicopters
and seaplanes and boats, eating Oreo cookies all day long and
shepherding favored reporters to one of the best wine cellars in
the world.
 &HT;    Gov. John Rhodes of Ohio based an entire campaign on visiting
county fairs. One Pennsylvania congressman slept in his office,
surrounded by hundreds of bags of mail that were never opened. Gov.
William Scranton of Pennsylvania used to have roast swan for
Christmas dinner. Jimmy Tayoun, the last of the Philadelphia street
politicians, made a point of running red lights to attend a wake
for a Polish saloonkeeper in South Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``We've always had great showmen in American politics,'' says
former Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1972. ``But the increased use of media
consultants and all these photo-op tactics lend themselves to false
drama and the creation of entertainment. That's the big
difference.''
 &HT;    American politics used to be a participatory sport, not a
spectator sport, and it was conducted by getting people to hold
signs and sit in phone banks. That is dying or, in some regions, is
dead already. Politicians have a keen sense of trends in American
life, and so they are telling us something when they no longer
devote countless hours to choosing their chief organizers. Now they
spend that time selecting their press secretaries, media
consultants and strategists.
 &HT;    ``Politics today is all media,'' says Michael Whouley, a
Boston-based political consultant who is close to Vice President Al
Gore. ``More than 10 years ago, you would compartmentalize a
campaign: media, fund-raising and field organizing. Now it's
fund-raising, and the fund-raising is all geared to the media.''
 &HT;    This hasn't changed only the way politics is conducted. It also
has changed the sort of people who run for office and, just as
important, the kind of people who are drawn to campaigns. The
organizers are passe. The media manipulators are king.
 &HT;    Listen to the view of Beatty, who grew up in the Washington
suburbs but whose work is done in Hollywood: ``It's impossible to
engage people in a complex issue. You've got to stop them from
channel surfing. You've got to give them a simple, vulgarized
version of things. And you're doing it all with a rearview mirror
that you didn't always have: You now know how people will react to
things.''
 &HT;    Maybe the best place to see the merging of entertainment and
politics is in the movies. Just recently, Michael Douglas, Jack
Nicholson, Gene Hackman, Kevin Kline, Jack Lemmon, James Garner,
Dan Aykroyd, Harrison Ford, Sam Waterston and John Travolta have
all played the president of the United States on film. The American
president isn't only a political figure. It's a movie.
 &HT;    ``Politics has always been show business,'' says former
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who was a principal figure
in the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush. ``Today it's more show business.''
 &HT;    Show business _ complete with celebrities. The entire notion of
celebrity can, of course, be traced to the entertainment world, and
in truth celebrities have always been interested in politics _ and
vice versa.
 &HT;    Frank Mankiewicz, the veteran Washington public-relations
executive and a close adviser to both McGovern and Robert F.
Kennedy, likes to tell about how his uncle, Joe Mankiewicz, a great
director and writer who won four Oscars, called him and said he was
coming to Washington.
 &HT;    Mankiewicz offered to throw a dinner party for his uncle, who
requested that some of the senators in the middle of the Vietnam
debate _ McGovern, Frank Church of Idaho, Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin _ be invited. His uncle wanted to spend the evening
talking about reductions in troop strength and what the Chinese
were going to do about Vietnam; the senators wanted only to ask
about the casting couch and Marilyn Monroe.
 &HT;    This hasn't changed. ``Today, you get Barbra Streisand in
Washington, and she wants to talk about land mines,'' Mankiewicz
says, ``and everybody at dinner wants to talk about why she didn't
get nominated for `The Mirror Has Two Faces.'''
 &HT;    In the old days, there were two Hollywoods, one Republican and
one Democratic. The actors and actresses were almost all
Republicans, the writers and producers almost all Democrats. There
were no centrists. The conservatives were very far to the right,
and the liberals were very much to the left. The Hitler-Stalin pact
of 1939 split the left, but even then there was no middle ground.
And so the debates were furious. Hollywood was divided over FDR and
the New Deal and over Upton Sinclair's 1934 gubernatorial campaign
in California.
 &HT;    There's nothing new about someone such as Beatty being involved
in the presidential campaigns of RFK in 1968, McGovern in 1972 and
Gary Hart in 1984. But what is new is the melding of politics and
celebrity, and that began with John Kennedy.
 &HT;    ``Reagan may be the first movie-star president, but after all,
the Kennedys themselves made glamour an indispensable part of
American politics long before the host of `Death Valley Days' and
the `General Electric Theater' reached the White House,'' Michael
Knox Beran writes in ``The Last Patrician,'' the remarkable book
about Robert Kennedy published this spring. ``Joseph Kennedy was in
Hollywood, learning its lessons, studying its methods, financing
its movies, 10 years before Ronald Reagan showed up at Jack
Warner's studio in Burbank in 1937.''
 &HT;    But though Joe Kennedy had been drawn to Hollywood and its
melange of starlets and celebrity, his son John had a celebrity of
his own, a breezy insouciance, a touch of intellectualism, a quick
sense of humor.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have to make Kennedy a celebrity, and nobody in the
campaign _ Larry O'Brien and Kenny O'Donnell and Ted Sorensen _ was
a celebrity,'' says Joe Napolitan, who worked for Kennedy in 1960,
Johnson in 1964 and Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968 and may have been
the first person ever to call himself a political consultant. ``He
naturally had it all: He was a war hero, he was handsome, he had
just married a glamorous woman, he had a big name and he was a
senator.''
 &HT;    Today a lot of presidential candidates not only try to package
themselves (as 19th-century presidents did, invariably finding a
log cabin in their past) but also try to make themselves
celebrities in their own right.
 &HT;    Surely Bill Clinton has a bit of the entertainer in him. He can
play the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall Show, he can delight a group
of senior citizens, he can play to just about any audience. But
there's nothing entertaining about his plight since the Monica
Lewinsky story broke in January _ and yet the entire spectacle has
more in common with mass entertainment than with serious politics.
 &HT;    Some of that, to be sure, is Clinton's fault. There is little
dispute that the president has put himself in harm's way with some
of the women he has encountered over the years. And Clinton, a
fervent disciple of Kennedy's style, has merged the public and the
private in new ways. He opened his home to people he describes as
his ``friends'' but who also are big Democratic fund-raisers. He
willingly disclosed the sort of private details of his life _ not
only his preference in underwear but his mother's many marriages
and the alcohol and abuse that filled his home life as a youngster
_ that in other presidents' lives are often left to a sleuthing
biographer or historian.
 &HT;    But the storm that has engulfed the Clinton presidency since
January has been governed by the press as well, which has lunged at
unsubstantiated rumors, trailed Lewinsky and transformed her into a
woman of mystery, and added a sense of treacly melodrama to a sober
legal proceeding that has its own inherent drama.
 &HT;    This is all occurring at a time when there are few contested
issues in American life. With a strong economy, a deficit that has
disappeared and no great foreign threats, national life is quiet,
devoid of the great struggles that captivated Americans even in the
tranquil years of the 1950s, which had wars in Korea and the Middle
East, civil-rights battles in Little Rock, terrifying superpower
confrontations, a dramatic uprising in Hungary and the launching of
the space age with the Soviet Sputnik satellite.
 &HT;    Modern politics is infused with entertainment values because
modern politics is infused with media influences. The pace, tone
and timbre of the House and Senate changed once their deliberations
were televised; Gore and Newt Gingrich were among the first to
recognize the power that televised sessions provided, and both
became grandstanders _ and powerful figures _ as a result.
 &HT;    The advent of cable television, which was supposed to provide
``local access'' to lower levels of government, also changed the
way politics is conducted.
 &HT;    ``Because of that, politicians play to the camera,'' says State
Assemblyman Bill Campbell of California, a first-term Republican
who represents southeastern Orange County. ``More people speak, and
they speak longer than they would otherwise. People play to the
tube.''
 &HT;    Yet the rush to entertain has killed the entertainment in
politics _ and has made politics less appealing than ever. This
autumn as many as 100 House members may run unopposed. The major
parties simply were not able to find anyone to challenge the
incumbents in nearly a quarter of the House districts in the
nation.
 &HT;    ``It takes a major effort now to convince anyone to run for
public office,'' says Durbin, the Illinois senator. ``The intrusion
into your private life is too great. Politics has reached such a
low level that people just can't stomach the idea of going into
politics.
 &HT;    ``I spend time on the phone, begging people to run for all sorts
of offices,'' he continues. ``It's a very hard sell. They don't
know whether they want to put themselves or their families through
this. You either have to be flawless or prepared to see your flaws
on the front page of the paper.''
 &HT;    And then people don't think they can get anything accomplished
even if they are elected. ``People always ask: Do you get anything
done up there? Can you make a difference?'' says Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who heads the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. He
says he answers yes.
 &HT;    He's probably right. This year the lawmakers have dealt with
issues such as the budget surplus, whether to overhaul the campaign
finance system, what the minimum wage should be and how much money
should be spent on thousands of line items in the 13 appropriations
bills that get almost no attention anywhere.
 &HT;    Those are real decisions involving real people. In the end,
that's politics. That's not entertainment.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Life has changed for the big men of small countries. Gone are
the days when a thuggish Third World leader could find a superpower
to support him, if only because the other didn't.
 &HT;    Thirteen years ago, when Hun Sen first became prime minister of
Cambodia, it was as the puppet of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and
they were not particularly bothered by political killings or a lack
of elections. (The United States was equally indifferent to the
corruption and abuses of Lon Nol, the Cambodian dictator it
supported in the early 1970s.)
 &HT;    But with the Cold War over, things changed. The United Nations
moved in; an election was held in 1993 and, until last year, Hun
Sen ruled Cambodia in coalition with his co-prime minister and
political rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
 &HT;    In July 1997, however, Hun Sen staged a military coup, ousting
Ranariddh and killing at least 41 of the prince's military and
political allies. This violated the rules of the post-Cold War
world, which call for democracy _ at least in a small and poor
country.
 &HT;    Largely at the urging of Congress, Washington cut off foreign
aid to his government (it continued to help finance Cambodia's
buzzing civil society) and stopped the United Nations from awarding
him Cambodia's U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, which had
been considering Cambodia for membership, abruptly froze its bid.
 &HT;    These slights were a problem for a man who craved respect, got
half his budget from foreign aid and had been cut off by the
International Monetary Fund because of corruption. The solution was
an election. He held it on July 26 _ and apparently got everything
he wanted.
 &HT;    International observers took note of the killings of activists
from opposition parties, of Hun Sen's monopoly over television and
radio, of his control of the electoral machinery, of his party's
bribes and widespread intimidation of voters. A nd they approved
the election anyway.
 &HT;    The speed and enthusiasm of the world's embrace raises troubling
questions about whether it is democracy or merely its appearance
that the world demands, and whether the international rules are any
less cynical today than during the Cold War.
 &HT;    I came to Cambodia to watch the election and to interview Hun
Sen, an interview suggested and arranged by his American lawyers
and his public-relations adviser. Bretton Sciaroni, an American
working in Phnom Penh as a lawyer for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party, or CPP, said that Hun Sen's PR makeover began following the
July '97 coup.
 &HT;    ''After the fighting last summer, they (the CPP) couldn't get
their side of the story out,'' he said. Sciaroni was once a lawyer
in the Reagan White House. Now he was standing in a schoolyard on
election morning, waiting for Hun Sen to vote. ``My conservative
brethren don't understand my involvement with the CPP,'' he said.
``I would argue the CPP is more pro-free enterprise.'' There was a
pause. ``But ideology has nothing to do with it. It's all power.''
 &HT;    A succinct description of what drives Cambodian politics.
Sciaroni wrote a long paper giving Hun Sen's side of the coup. To
help in Washington, he hired James C. Stearns, a lawyer with
Porter, Wright, Morris &AMP; Arthur. Stearns, in turn, brought along
the law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter and David Morey, a corporate
strategist.
 &HT;    A letter filed with the Justice Department's foreign-agent
registry says these consultants will get a total of $550,000 for
five months' work, ending next month.
 &HT;    They held dinners in Washington for visiting CPP officials and
supporters of Hun Sen. ``We're advising them on free elections,''
Morey told me over lunch in Phnom Penh. One of Morey's associates
said, ``We are working with Hun Sen on human rights.'' Speaking of
the time I would have to meet with Hun Sen, Stearns said that his
advisers were rearranging his campaign schedule so I could see him
``with his best foot forward.''

 &HT;    The client is a PR challenge. since the Khmer Rouge came to
power in 1975, Cambodia has suffered under an assortment of
dreadful governments, and Hun Sen has been in all of them. He was
still a teen-ager, a peasant's son, when he joined the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas nearly 30 years ago.
 &HT;    In 1977, while a midlevel officer, he fled to Vietnam. Two years
later, when Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge and installed a
government in Cambodia, Hun Sen, all of 27, was its foreign
minister. In 1985, at 33, he became prime minister.
 &HT;    Hun Sen's government was infinitely better than the psychopathic
terror of the Khmer Rouge. It was, nevertheless, a brutal Communist
dictatorship that used assassination and torture to still its
critics and controlled the country through a network of
party-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    The Khmer Rouge guerrillas continued their civil war. To
Washington's undying shame, it supported the Khmer Rouge claim to
be the legitimate government of Cambodia and encouraged China to
give the guerrillas aid _ because they were fighting a regime
aligned with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
 &HT;    In 1991, Washington, Moscow and Beijing brokered a peace deal
that put an end to the 13-year civil war. The United Nations moved
in with a huge and ambitious peacekeeping operation. It spent more
than $2 billion to organize elections in 1993 and try to restore
democracy.
 &HT;    The CPP lost to Funcinpec, the royalist party led by Prince
Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen then claimed he
had been cheated and threatened to continue the civil war unless he
got a share of power. The United Nations caved in; neither the
United States nor anyone else had the stomach for battles between
U.N. and CPP troops.
 &HT;    So Hun Sen retained his control. It was an important lesson in
the pliability of the international community.
 &HT;    Over the next few years, Hun Sen learned how easy it was to
manipulate the outside world. The United Nations did not demand
that the CPP loosen its control of the army and political
structures. Hun Sen's influence was boosted by the incompetence of
Prince Ranariddh, whose only talent for leadership seemed to be
enjoying the perquisites of power.
 &HT;    But two events in 1997 shattered the world's complacency with
Hun Sen. One was the coup. The other was a grenade attack on a
peaceful political rally in Phnom Penh, killing 16 people and
narrowly missing Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most ardent critics.
Witnesses saw Hun Sen's bodyguards protect the suspects.
 &HT;    The only investigation _ by the American FBI _ was halted
prematurely and the results have never been released. Even a number
of Hun Sen's supporters told me they believed the bombing was the
work of those close to him.
 -0- 
 &HT;    My interview with Hun Sen took place on Election Day in his new
house, a huge peach-colored stucco mansion about 10 miles from
Phnom Penh. The sitting room was decorated in ornate Louis XIV
style, with white sculpted chairs, crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, flowered rugs and cabinets full of expensive-looking silver
bowls and sculptures. The grounds featured Versailles-style
gardens, fish ponds and coconut groves. He has another house in
town.
 &HT;    The cabinet behind his office desk displays honorary degrees
from American schools _ one, I later learned, from an unaccredited
correspondence school. There were also pictures of his children,
who by fall will all be studying in France and America, one of them
at West Point. Sciaroni, Morey and Stearns sat with us.
 &HT;    Hun Sen was well briefed. His answers were direct and well
organized, mercifully absent the hourlong monologue that normally
kicks off an interview with him. He stuck to his message: Hun Sen,
democrat. I brought up Washington.
 &HT;    ``We agree with each other on democracy, pluralism and respect
for human rights,'' he said, smiling.
 &HT;    The grenade attack on the Sam Rainsy rally, he implied, was
carried out by a member of the royalist party, Funcinpec. Asked
about the coup, he took out two maps from his desk and went through
an intricate account of provocation by Ranariddh and the Khmer
Rouge. When I left he gave me a souvenir watch with his picture on
it.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of Hun Sen's attempt to remake himself as a
democrat was the elections themselves. Although Hun Sen claims
authorship, he had to be pushed into elections by the more moderate
wing of the CPP, which believed the party's nationwide machine
would assure victory. Still, Hun Sen had balked. Even a month
before the election, he was still trying to get Ranariddh's party
disqualified.
 &HT;    The election would not have happened at all without the cajoling
of foreign diplomats, including an unprecedented effort by the
Asean nations, who usually refrain from meddling in the political
affairs of Asian countries. Nevertheless, the campaign climate was
so lopsided that a pre-election statement issued by the National
Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute,
the American monitoring groups, called the process ``fundamentally
flawed.''
 &HT;    Hun Sen's control of broadcasting was one reason. The U.N.
human-rights office in Cambodia, which tracked media appearances,
found that in the month of May, Hun Sen and CPP officials were on
the air 448 times, mostly shown handing out goodies. Funcinpec and
Sam Rainsy party officials had a total of 14 appearances, most of
them treated negatively. Local election committees and polling
stations were run by CPP-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    I met people who had been given clothes and food in exchange for
promises to vote CPP, and others who had been threatened, forced to
join the party and warned of the consequences if the CPP lost. The
U.N. human-rights office, which Hun Sen has repeatedly tried to
close, tracked scores of suspected political murders between the
coup and the election. None have been investigated.
 &HT;    The CPP, which won only 41 percent of the vote, boosted its
total from 59 to 64 parliamentary seats _ 2 more than a majority _
by using a new formula to allocate seats. Funcinpec and Sam
Rainsy's party alleged that the vote count had been ruined by
ballot-stuffing, deliberate miscounting or other fraud.
 &HT;    Losers always cry fraud in Cambodia, but there was enough
evidence of mischief during the vote count to make the allegations
credible. It would have taken a thorough investigation to determine
whether the incidents of fraud were widespread enough to have
altered the outcome. Yet the international community quickly
declared the election valid.
 &HT;    The American monitoring groups, who had long-term monitors in
Cambodia throughout the campaign, issued a written statement saying
that the ``relative success'' of balloting and counting could not
negate the violence and unfairness of the campaign, but that the
Cambodian people had overcome those obstacles and held a
``successful exercise in national self-determination.''
 &HT;    That was overshadowed, however, by the news-conference ad lib of
Stephen Solarz, the former congressman and a leader of the
delegation, who said that if the opposition charges proved
unfounded, history could one day call the election ``the miracle on
the Mekong.''
 &HT;    He also implied that after an investigation of the opposition's
claims, Hun Sen should get his Asean membership, foreign aid and
U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The other foreign monitors were even more enthusiastic. Two days
before the vote, a U.N.-sponsored monitoring group with delegates
from dozens of countries said conditions for the elections were
``reasonable.'' The day after the election, it called the voting
and counting ``free and fair to an extent that enables it to
reflect, in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people.''
 &HT;    Sven Linder, the Swedish diplomat who was the spokesman for the
group, said at the news conference: ``We traced no tensions in the
air. We have not traced any atmosphere of intimidation.''
 &HT;    The positive tone prevailed, perhaps, because most monitors
spent only the week around the election in Cambodia, and for that
period the CPP largely behaved. Cambodians, who are rarely asked
their opinions on anything, had a voter turnout of more than 90
percent and told observers they were thrilled to be able to choose
a good government.
 &HT;    Their dignity and enthusiasm for democracy moved observers. But
the observers' emotional reaction may have caused them to overlook
the unfairness of the campaign. They tended to forget how ill
equipped outsiders were to spot problems.
 &HT;    Villagers were warned not to talk to foreigners. It is
impossible, even at less charged times than Election Day, to have a
private conversation in the claustrophobic and controlled
atmosphere of a Cambodian village, and anyone suspected of talking
about mischief would be in danger.
 &HT;    My visits to villages convinced me that I could gain no idea
what was going on under the surface. Although there was a network
of domestic observers, there were only 500 teams of foreign
observers for 11,000 polling places.
 &HT;    Carol Armstrong, executive director of the U.S.-Thailand
Business Council and an American monitor, said: ``The premature
judgment on the election by the international community was
throwing away 12 months of documented cases of intimidation and
human rights abuses for two days.''

 &HT;    Solarz was crucial to the success of the 1991 Cambodian peace
accords that led to the 1993 elections and was the Clinton
administration's special envoy to Cambodia after the coup. His
involvement may have encouraged him to look on the bright side. He
also had a potential conflict of interest stemming from his
position as a senior counselor at the Washington lobbying firm Apco
Associates.
 &HT;    The Legal Times of Washington reported last year that in 1995
Solarz participated in a pitch meeting with Ranariddh to represent
Cambodia in Washington. Apco then registered with the Justice
Department as a foreign agent representing Cambodia. Apco failed to
get the job, however; perhaps the contract required Hun Sen's
approval.
 &HT;    Solarz denied that these business efforts created a conflict.
``My relationship to Cambodia goes back a long time,'' he said ``If
anything, I'm biased in favor of the opposition.''
 &HT;    The calm of Election Day provided cover for other observers who
had political reasons to endorse the election. U.N. monitors were
never given detailed information about the abuses of the campaign
period before they arrived.
 &HT;    When team leaders from each country met before the election to
write a statement about the campaign period, the Asian delegates
argued against pointing out any problems. When the delegates met
again on counting day, most of the Europeans argued against using
``free and fair.''
 &HT;    But delegates from France and Asian nations _ which included
such dictatorships as China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam _ disagreed.
Asean members, in particular, argued that European standards should
not apply.
 &HT;    ``Asean wants to admit Cambodia as a member as soon as they
possible can,'' one Western diplomat said. ``A minimally credible
election would be enough.''
 &HT;    Some who found the election legitimate argued that it had to be
seen in context. The world, after all, had accepted Suharto in
Indonesia, even though his elections featured no real opposition at
all. Intimidation was nothing new in Cambodian political culture.
Ranariddh, moreover, promised nothing better. He preferred golf to
working and surrounded himself with courtiers.
 &HT;    ``The international community decided that Ranariddh was a
buffoon,'' said one Western diplomat.
 &HT;    The American Ambassador Kenneth Quinn was widely perceived as
pro-Hun Sen, but most of the important ambassadors in Phnom Penh
felt that Hun Sen was the key to stability, one high-ranking
Cambodian official told me.
 &HT;    ``They work with who has the power,'' he said. ``Hun Sen became
the interlocutor.'' The quality of the election was irrelevant, and
he knew it.
 &HT;    The United Nations and European nations have their own reasons
for endorsing the election. The U.N. spent more than $2 billion to
try to make Cambodia a democracy five years ago. This year, the
European Union spent nearly $12 million on the election.
 &HT;    ``There's real Cambodia fatigue,'' one European diplomat said.
``It's been 20 years or so, and a lot of effort and time has gone
into helping to fix Cambodia. People are turning away and want a
solution.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It remains to be seen what kind of solution Hun Sen can offer,
what kind of stability can come from a leader whose strongman rule
is blocking the creation of the institutions needed for long-term
stability. After the election, hundreds of opposition activists
were threatened and fled their villages.
 &HT;    Two weeks ago, Cambodia's own National Election Commission,
which is stuffed with Hun Sen supporters, rejected almost all the
opposition claims summarily. And on Aug. 20, one man died in a
gun-and-grenade attack at a Sam Rainsy-led protest outside the
Interior Ministry.
 &HT;    How the world will treat Cambodia has also not yet been settled,
but it seems as though Hun Sen will be accorded the legitimacy he
wanted. Cambodia has been a laboratory for the international
community, which succeeded in pushing Hun Sen to adopt the
trappings of democracy. And even those may evaporate completely
once the world turns away.
 &HT;    But the real manipulation went in the other direction, as Hun
Sen got the world's endorsement for an election that was neither
free nor fair. The mouse, after all, also trains the scientist.
When he rings the bell, the good doctor brings him cheese.

 By DAVID OSHINSKY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The town of Philadelphia, Miss., can't quite escape its past.
Like Selma, Ala., and Howard Beach, N.Y., it has come to symbolize
the racial violence that tears at America to this day.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1964, Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and
Andrew Goodman were shot and killed in rural Neshoba County, just
outside Philadelphia, by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Although the
FBI compiled enough evidence to convict seven men on federal
charges of violating the civil rights of the victims, the state of
Mississippi never brought anyone to trial on murder charges.
 &HT;    ``A day doesn't go by that I don't think about those boys,''
says Stan Dearman, longtime editor of The Neshoba Democrat, ``and
wonder if justice will be done.''
 &HT;    What, exactly, does justice entail? For some, the federal
convictions were justice enough. In 1989, Mississippi's secretary
of state, Dick Molpus, a Philadelphia native, made an emotional
apology at a memorial service attended by relatives of the victims.
 &HT;    ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' Molpus
declared. For many, this was more than enough.
 &HT;    Dearman disagrees. He believes that justice requires a murder
trial in Neshoba County, and it is possible that he will get his
wish. The push for a criminal prosecution may be aided by material
in the newly opened files of the State Sovereignty Commission.
 &HT;    Created in 1956 to defend Mississippi from ``encroachment by the
federal government,'' the commission spent two decades monitoring
those suspected of supporting racial integration before it was
abolished in 1977. The files, which contain 87,000 names, are
mostly about the harassment of ordinary people.
 &HT;    Yet they also provide a remarkable window onto a series of Klan
killings in the 1960s, including those of Medgar Evers and Vernon
Dahmer, the prominent civil-rights leaders, as well as those of
Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman. There are no smoking guns in the
Neshoba case _ nothing to indicate that someone in state government
had prior knowledge of the murder plot, took part in the crime or
tried to cover it up.
 &HT;    But the files reveal a deep hatred of the civil-rights workers
who reached Mississippi in 1964 and a level of surveillance
probably unprecedented in the nation's history. Equally important,
the files show that state investigators, working independently of
the FBI, came up with similar information regarding the murder
suspects in Neshoba.
 &HT;    The federal government chose to prosecute on the charges
available to it (violation of civil rights); the state chose not
to, on the charges in its purview (murder).
 -0- 
 &HT;    The facts in the case are well known. Schwerner, a Cornell
graduate, had gone to Mississippi with his wife, Rita, to work for
the Congress of Racial Equality.
 &HT;    Opening a community center in Meridian, the young couple taught
black children to read and write while encouraging their parents to
register and vote.
 &HT;    Chaney, 21, was a frequent visitor at the center and quickly
became Schwerner's confidant. In June 1964, Schwerner and Chaney
drove to Oxford, Ohio, to help train volunteers for a huge
voter-registration drive in Mississippi, known as Freedom Summer.
There they befriended Goodman, a 20-year-old white college student
from New York.
 &HT;    Reaching Mississippi on June 20, the three men spent the next
day inspecting the ruins of a black church near Philadelphia that
had been firebombed by the Klan.
 &HT;    That afternoon they were arrested for ``speeding'' by Neshoba
County's deputy sheriff, Cecil Price. According to extensive
testimony at the federal trial, Price sent out word that those
arrested included ``Goatee'' _ the Klan's code name for Schwerner,
who had been marked for death by the Imperial Wizard, Sam Bowers
(who was just convicted for the murder of Dahmer on Aug. 21).
 &HT;    Price held the civil-rights workers long enough for Edgar Ray
Killen, a preacher and, according to the FBI, local Klan leader, to
round up a posse. As Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman headed down
Route 19 that evening, Price tailed them in his cruiser, followed
by two carloads of Klansmen.
 &HT;    After a frantic chase, the three men were caught, taken to an
isolated spot on Rock Cut Road, murdered in quick succession and
buried below an earthen dam on the farm of Olen Burrage, one of
Philadelphia's wealthiest citizens. Their Ford wagon was set
ablaze.
 &HT;    The three bodies were discovered six weeks later, following one
of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Near the end of the year,
federal agents arrested 19 men for conspiring to deny Schwerner,
Chaney and Goodman their civil rights. After numerous delays, a
federal jury convicted Bowers, Price and five other defendants.
Three more went free when the jury deadlocked, including Killen;
the rest were acquitted.
 &HT;    Many people believe that state officials had no desire to see an
explosive murder trial in Neshoba County, where the probable
outcome _ mass acquittals _ would embarrass Mississippi once again.
They realized too that a trial could easily unmask their own roles
in this tragedy _ the roles of leaders who fanned the hysterical,
and ultimately lethal, resistance to civil rights in the South's
most segregated state. The Neshoba killings remain officially
``unsolved.'' The leading suspects are still alive.
 &HT;    Although ``local people'' such as Evers and Dahmer formed the
backbone of the civil-rights movement in Mississippi, it is
Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman who remain the most visible martyrs
to that cause. Fairly or not, their case offers the best chance for
redemption and closure on the national stage.
 -0- 
 &HT;    In the newly released files is a 1964 ``talk'' by Erle Johnston,
the Sovereignty Commission director, to a group of business
leaders, marked ``Absolutely Restricted,'' about preparations to
neutralize the Council of Federated Organizations, or COFO, the
umbrella group behind Mississippi's Freedom Summer.
 &HT;    ``Through our investigative staff and other sources of
information,'' he said, ``the Sovereignty Commission has been fully
informed about COFO's plans.'' Johnston wasn't boasting. The files
show that commission informants had thoroughly infiltrated COFO.
 &HT;    One informant supplied copies of the Freedom Summer application
forms, which included a biographical sketch of each civil-rights
worker and _ more important _ a photograph. Others forwarded the
notes they had scribbled at COFO meetings. The most valuable
source, known as ``Agent X,'' attended the COFO training sessions
in Ohio and also supplied the descriptions and tag numbers of COFO
vehicles in Mississippi, which the Sovereignty Commission then
distributed to local police officers, many of whom, as in Neshoba,
belonged to the Ku Klux Klan.
 &HT;    One such vehicle, ``a '63 Ford Station Wagon bearing Mississippi
license plate number H 25503,'' was the car Schwerner, Chaney and
Goodman were driving when they were stopped for speeding by Deputy
Price.
 &HT;    Some view Agent X, identified in recent press reports as R.L.
Bolden, a local black man with ties to the civil-rights movement,
as an accessory to murder. (Bolden has refused to be interviewed.)
Yet Agent X was hardly alone in putting the lives of these
civil-rights workers at risk.
 &HT;    The Sovereignty Commission files reveal that the Schwerners were
being monitored by law enforcement within weeks of their arrival in
Mississippi. A detailed report by the commission's top
investigator, Andrew Hopkins, on March 23, 1964, gives precise
descriptions of both Schwerners, their local address, choice of
clothing (``dungarees'' and a ``CORE button'') and current
employment (encouraging blacks to vote). It concludes that the
Meridian police are ``keeping these subjects under surveillance and
are getting information from reliable informants.''
 &HT;    The Sovereignty Commission dispatched Hopkins to Philadelphia a
few days after the civil-rights workers disappeared. His
confidential reports, written by someone who changed his thinking
over time, provide a unique look at the murders. A devoted
segregationist, with strong ties to the local police, Hopkins at
first accepted the prevailing white opinion that the three
``agitators'' had faked their disappearance to gain publicity for
Freedom Summer.
 &HT;    ``There is still no physical evidence that (they) have met with
foul play,'' he noted on July 3, ``other than the burned out car
which could very easily be part of a hoax.''
 &HT;    Hopkins resented the FBI's presence in Neshoba County. He
complained that the bureau did not seek the aid of Mississippi
officials, and he accused individual agents of browbeating
suspects. Yet the more Hopkins learned from his informants, the
better the FBI's case appeared.
 &HT;    State investigators, using multiple sources, were told that six
to eight Klansmen were directly involved in the killings, including
``law enforcement people'' and ``a minister.'' Hopkins found that
the bureau had ``every one'' of these suspects under close
surveillance.
 &HT;    On Aug. 6, two days after the bodies were discovered, he
admitted that the FBI did not need his information about the case _
``they already had most of it.'' His report of Aug. 6, one of the
key documents in these files, appears to contain what until now was
the bureau's most closely guarded secret _ the identity of the
person who broke open the case by revealing where the bodies were
buried. All that had been known was that the FBI had paid the
individual $30,000 and had promised to protect his identity.
 &HT;    ``I have information from a confidential source,'' Hopkins
wrote, ``that Mr. Olen Burrage ... directed the FBI to the spot
where the bodies were buried. ... The informant stated that Mr.
Burrage received $30,000 from the FBI for this information.''
Burrage was indicted on federal conspiracy charges, but not
convicted. (Burrage did not respond to repeated requests for
comment.)
 &HT;    When the 19 arrests were made, Hopkins was mildly surprised. He
had expected an additional police official to be booked, but he
hadn't imagined so many arrests beyond the actual participants at
Rock Cut Road. His final report in 1964 describes the FBI's case in
meticulous detail and criticizes the bureau on one major count _
its strong-arm tactics against suspects who refused to confess.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Philadelphia, a town of about 7,000 people, looks today much as
it did on that blistering Sunday afternoon 34 years ago when Price
made his fateful arrest. The old markers are there _ the red-brick
county courthouse, the shops lining the main square, the storefront
offices of the lawyers who represented the Neshoba defendants at
the federal trial.
 &HT;    The big difference around Philadelphia is the Silver Star Resort
and Casino, three miles west of town. Owned by the Choctaw Indians
and opened in 1994, it provides Neshoba County with millions in
revenue and hundreds of jobs.
 &HT;    If the Silver Star represents the glittering future, then the
civil-rights killings mark the bitter past. Most whites say they
believe that a murder trial today would needlessly reopen old
wounds.
 &HT;    A lawyer tells me: ``We're a small town. A few years ago, my
little girl got on the wrong school bus and was lost. Cecil Price
spent hours searching for her until she was found.'' He adds: ``I
believe that murder must be punished, but I just don't know what
good it would do to put Cecil in jail again after all these
years.''
 &HT;    A trial, however, would have real meaning for local blacks such
as the Rev. Clint Collier, a Methodist minister who spent much of
his life battling for civil rights. For his labors, Collier was
arrested, fired from his teaching job and swindled out of much of
his land. Today, at 89, he vividly recalls the meetings with
Schwerner, who spoke about the prospect of being killed, and the
mean swagger of local police officers. He remembers Price telling
him, several years ago, about being ``brainwashed'' by the Klan.
 &HT;    ``Have you repented?'' Collier asked him. ``Are you teaching
your boy to do right?'' Price supposedly said yes. ``That's good,''
Collier declared.
 &HT;    ``That's all you can do.''
 &HT;    In 1989, Collier listened with disappointment as Molpus
apologized for the killings. ``I want punishment,'' Collier says,
pausing to let the anger pass. ``I want justice.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Edgar Ray Killen still lives in Neshoba County. I phoned him at
his farm. He told me that he didn't give interviews, yet he seemed
in no hurry to hang up. After chatting briefly, we agreed to meet
at a local store. Killen and his wife arrived in a rusted pickup
truck. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat, with a plug of tobacco in
his cheek, he looked remarkably fit for a man of 73 _ lean,
well-muscled, deeply tanned. He shook hands warmly and invited me,
my 20-year-old son, Matthew, and the photographer who was with us
to supper.
 &HT;    Killen lives in the hills southeast of Philadelphia, a stone's
throw from Rock Cut Road. ``I've always preached the same way,'' he
said. ``I brag on Jesus.''
 &HT;    Like some white Southerners, Killen viewed the civil-rights
movement as part of a Communist conspiracy to replace biblical
truths with godless principles. In 1964, according to FBI files, he
became a founding member _ and chief recruiter _ of the local Ku
Klux Klan. According to testimony at the 1967 federal trial, Killen
was not among the group that killed Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman
on Rock Cut Road. Yet several witnesses swore that he had recruited
them for the murders.
 &HT;    ``Reverend Killen said they had three of those civil-rights
workers locked up and we had to ... tear their butts up,'' one
said. Another witness recalled a conversation with the preacher
just after the civil-rights workers disappeared. He ``told me that
they had been shot, that they were dead ... and buried in a dam
about 15 feet deep.''
 &HT;    We sat in a living room crammed with religious items. ``I'm a
right-winger who supports the Constitution as written by the
Founding Fathers,'' Killen said. Asked about the murders, he
replied: ``Those boys were Communists who went to a Communist
training school. I'm sorry they got themselves killed. But I can't
show remorse for something I didn't do.''
 &HT;    Having said exactly what he intended, the preacher got up to
check on supper. At that moment, his youngest brother, Don,
arrived, and the evening took a darker turn. Shaking my hand, Don
announced that he didn't like blacks and homosexuals (in terms not
printable in this magazine). He told me that President Clinton was
a homosexual and that Martin Luther King Jr. had been one too. The
preacher joined in, using a racial slur to describe King's
``Communist'' sympathies.
 &HT;    The remark surprised me, for he had been careful to this point.
With the formal interview now over, another side of Preacher Killen
appeared. For the next three hours, over steak and French fries,
iced tea and Kool-Aid, the brothers ranted _ about ``scientific
facts'' (lesbians lean to the left in the womb), anthropology
(blacks are mud people who belong in Africa), slavery (a good
thing) and current affairs (almost every black in the county has no
job, a boom box and his car up on blocks).
 &HT;    Close to midnight, the preacher walked us to the door. There had
been no threats or outbursts that evening, although he did ask if
we were nervous about winding up on Rock Cut Road, just like
``those boys'' in the 1960s. As we left his farm and headed down
the narrow blacktop in total darkness, one thought came eerily to
mind: This was the last thing that Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman
saw in the moments before they died.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Will these murders be prosecuted? I posed this question to
Mississippi's state attorney general, Mike Moore, 46, a moderate
Democrat with a solid record on civil rights. His office is now
aiding local prosecutors in the Dahmer killing, and the Neshoba
case would seem the logical next step.
 &HT;    Shortly after taking office in 1988, Moore faced pressure to
investigate the Neshoba murders. Hollywood had just released
``Mississippi Burning,'' which glorified the FBI for solving the
case, and The Clarion-Ledger, Mississippi's leading newspaper,
urged Moore to convene a grand jury.
 &HT;    The evidence is ``laid out for the world to see,'' it said,
``and has been since the 1967 trial.'' But it wasn't that simple.
Moore learned that some of the physical evidence _ the bullets,
fingerprints, the victims' clothing _ was missing. At the same
time, the cases of Evers and Dahmer gained local momentum, pushing
Neshoba to the side.
 &HT;    Many believe that a conviction of Bowers in the Dahmer case is
akin to his conviction in the Neshoba case, since Bowers was the
driving force behind most Klan murders in Mississippi. As Moore
says: ``Sometimes a man kills 10 people and we get him for 1. But
justice is served in the 9 other cases.''
 &HT;    What about Price, Killen and other suspects still walking the
streets? The Sovereignty Commission files will provide useful
material for a prosecutor _ not only the names and code names of
informants but also the knowledge that staunch segregationists,
using their own sources, concluded that the FBI compiled a very
solid case.
 &HT;    Thirty-four years ago, an agent expressed the hope that
``sometime in the future when they have had an opportunity to
review in detail information involving the subjects in this
matter,'' state officials would file murder charges. Perhaps, with
the opening of the files, that time has arrived.

 By FRANCISCO GOLDMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the earthquake of 1972 all but razed Managua _ and
the dictator Anastasio Somoza and his cronies pocketed the millions
in international reconstruction aid _ the Nicaraguan capital has
been a city where communal memory has replaced actual architecture,
where many addresses refer to landmarks that aren't there anymore:
``From where the Lacmiel restaurant used to be, go two blocks
south. ...''
 &HT;    The house of Daniel Ortega fits this used-to-be aspect of the
city. The manor belonged to the prominent Morales family until it
was confiscated in the Sandinista revolution of 1979. Comandante
Ortega and his family moved in, converting the property into his
official residence. The high walls surrounding the compound were
painted in a military-camouflage pattern.
 &HT;    Ortega lived there throughout the 1980s as leader of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), and from 1984 to 1990
as president of Nicaragua _ and has never left, despite losing the
presidency in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro (and again, in
1996, to Arnoldo Aleman). The only visible change made to the house
has been to the compound's walls, which have been repainted with
colorful folkloric murals.
 &HT;    Once inside the gated entrance, I was struck by how the house
still seemed more an ``official residence'' than a private one.
Having lived here for so long as the nation's ruler, Ortega must
now find it hard to resist the illusion that he remains the leader
of something besides an opposition political party.
 &HT;    Though still surrounded by the trappings of power, Ortega had
until recently all but vanished from the world's attentions. But in
March, he suddenly emerged in international headlines again,
accused by his adopted daughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez Murillo, 30,
of having sexually abused her for 12 years since the age of 11.
 &HT;    For the first time in a decade, Ortega faced the world's press
to deliver a tensely anticipated statement. This time he spoke one
subdued sentence, expressing his ``indignation.''
 &HT;    In late May, Narvaez followed up her initial charges by
initiating a criminal case and releasing 40 pages of testimony
graphically describing the misdeeds of her adoptive father.
Narvaez, a sociologist, claimed that during her mid-teens, Ortega
would tell her that someone as busy as he was needed regular sexual
release _ and that through her sacrifice she was helping the
Sandinista cause. ``I began to feel weighing on my shoulders,'' she
said, ``the unbearable and tortuous weight of the revolution.'' The
formerly pro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario ran the entire
testimony.
 &HT;    It was a humiliating moment for Ortega, one that also
represented a calculated challenge to his power: The Narvaez
testimony's May release coincided with a partywide congress of the
FSLN. Fortunately for Ortega, the delegates closed ranks, expelling
from party posts those who publicly defended Narvaez. In the end,
the nearly 500 delegates almost unanimously re-elected him
secretary-general.
 &HT;    Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, also came to his defense,
announcing her intention to sue those she accused of having
``brainwashed'' Narvaez against her parents.
 &HT;    Yet Ortega's troubles are far from over. In June, a Nicaraguan
judge ruled that the National Assembly _ where Ortega leads an
often-ineffective FSLN minority _ must decide whether or not to
strip Ortega of the immunity from prosecution he enjoys as a
legislator. A commission was appointed to decide the matter; its
decision is still pending.
 &HT;    If Ortega is feeling burdened by the weight of the scandal, he
was careful not to show it to me. His entrance into the compound's
conference room was sudden and brisk.
 &HT;    At 52, he is fit and thin, betraying no sign of the heart attack
he suffered in 1994, after which he spent several months in Cuba
recuperating. Here was the same somewhat doe-eyed, earnest face of
so many past images. His manner was polite and unaffected.
 &HT;    As we sat down to talk, Ortega amiably told a story about his
mother, who as a teen-ager had been imprisoned by the National
Guard for receiving coded love letters suspected of being
political. (His father was a lifelong foe of the Somoza
dictatorship, his youngest brother, Camilo, a prominent guerrilla
leader who died in battle.)
 &HT;    But when the conversation switched from personal reminiscences
to current politics, Ortega's speech became self-conscious, and he
sometimes rambled. I had agreed with his press aide beforehand not
to discuss Narvaez's accusations _ but it was obvious what Ortega
was referring to when he described himself as ``a target for those
who want to destroy me in order to demoralize the supporters and
base of the FSLN.''
 &HT;    In public statements, Ortega continues to maintain that the
charges are part of such a plot. He says that if forced to stand
trial, he is confident of being exonerated.
 &HT;    Ortega has been with the Sandinistas from the beginning. An
anti-Somoza street tough as a teen-ager in the '60s, Ortega joined
the FSLN not long after it was established, becoming an urban
guerrilla and revolutionary bank robber. Captured by Somoza's
National Guard in 1967, he spent the next seven years in prison
before rejoining the guerrilla struggle.
 &HT;    Following the 1979 revolution, he was the leading figure on the
five-person Junta of National Reconstruction. Green-fatigued,
skinny, shy, messy-haired, in heavy black-framed glasses, he seemed
an unlikely political leader. In 1984, a mere decade after his
release from prison, he was elected president of Nicaragua.
 &HT;    The Sandinista government soon dominated U.S. foreign-policy
debates. Ortega became a figurehead of the East-West confrontation
during the endgame of the Cold War. On the right, President Reagan
floridly celebrated the contra rebels' attempt to overthrow
Ortega's ``totalitarian'' government. On the left, the Sandinistas
inspired hopes of a benevolent socialism.
 &HT;    But the economic costs of the contras' war against the
Sandinistas were devastating to those hopes. What's worse, the
conflict unleashed a contra army full of vicious human-rights
violators into the countryside.
 &HT;    Of course, Ortega's leadership was itself often brutal:
Cuban-style agricultural methods were introduced to catastrophic
effect, and individual freedoms were trampled. The inflation rate
ballooned to 30,000 percent. Shortages, rationing, civil repression
and ``states of emergency'' became the norm.
 &HT;    Despite these difficulties, Ortega emerged as a wily tactician,
a man who outmaneuvered and outlasted the Reagan administration's
scandal-riddled efforts to undermine his government.
 &HT;    By unexpectedly backing the Costa Rican president and Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Oscar Arias' Central American peace plan,
Ortega effectively brought the seven-year contra war to an end,
cleverly setting the stage for the 1990 election _ one that he
fully expected to win.
 &HT;    But Ortega's confidence was misplaced. The people of Nicaragua _
repulsed by years of fratricidal war (30,000 deaths out of a
population of 3 million) and nearly apocalyptic economic collapse _
voted overwhelmingly to end the Sandinista revolution.
 &HT;    Ortega's greatest political moment may have been his Feb. 26,
1990, concession speech. That night, Ortega stepped into the
television lights to acknowledge what had been known for hours:
that his opponent, Chamorro _ the aristocratic, devoutly Catholic
widow of a revered martyr of the struggle for democracy against the
42-year Somoza-family dictatorship _ had been elected president.
Indeed, the coalition of parties she led had outpolled the
Sandinista slate throughout the country.
 &HT;    For many Sandinistas, the electoral defeat was hard to bear.
They felt it was unjust, that it was the United States, far more
than their own mistakes and failed policies, that had destroyed
their revolution.
 &HT;    There was speculation that night that Ortega, in time-honored
Central American fashion, might call on the Sandinista army to
preserve the junta's power through force. But Ortega, his voice
breaking with emotion, promised to submit to the democratic
mandate.
 &HT;    ``We leave victorious,'' he said that night, ``because we
Sandinistas have sacrificed, have spilled blood and sweat, not to
cling to government posts, but to bring Nicaragua something it has
been denied since independence in 1821. ... We feel proud, in this
unjust world divided between weak and strong, to be giving
Nicaragua and Latin America a little bit of dignity, a little bit
of democracy, a little bit of social justice.''
 &HT;    Ortega's speech seemed to promise a new beginning for the FSLN:
a chance to regain the shattered trust of so many Nicaraguans by
playing by the new rules of democracy _ not only by assuming the
role of a loyal opposition, but also by opening the party itself to
democratic reform from within.
 &HT;    But doing so went counter to everything Ortega had learned as a
guerrilla and revolutionary leader. For him and other powerful
comandantes, opposition meant trying to ``rule from below.''
 &HT;    It was a basically violent, obstructionist idea of opposition:
summoning mobs into the streets; calling strikes; encouraging
wholesale takeovers of towns _ including Esteli, Chinandega and
Matagalpa _ by soldiers loyal to the Sandinistas. It took Chamorro
until the end of her term in 1994 to loosen Ortega's grip on the
army.
 &HT;    As Sergio Ramirez, a novelist and Ortega's vice president, told
me, ``Daniel wanted to use the old strategies to destroy the
opposition, the same ones they used on the contras during the
war.''
 &HT;    Sofia Montenegro, a former editor for Barricada, the
Sandinistas' official newspaper from 1979 until earlier this year,
said: ``What was required was open discussion of the reasons we
lost power. Ethically, this was the minimum owed to the Nicaraguan
people for the thousands of dead. Facing the people, the discussion
had to be about our own mistakes. We had to explain where we'd
messed up. Half the fault was with the gringos _ they made that war
and it was brutal. But with intellectual honesty and courage, we
had to confront what was our fault.''
 &HT;    But thanks to Ortega and his allies, that open, public
discussion never happened.
 &HT;    By now, Nicaragua has 60 percent unemployment. The Sandinistas'
original gains in literacy have vanished; another innovation, free
health care, has been abandoned. When asked why the FSLN, ``the
party of the poor,'' doesn't have more support among poor people,
Ortega said flatly that it is ``hard to organize the unemployed.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the poets and intellectuals who impressed so many
foreign observers _ who seemed to represent the conscience and
better side of Sandinismo _ don't have a constituency in the
country, at least when cut off from the party machinery and
gun-waving rhetoric of the FSLN.
 &HT;    Ramirez said of Ortega: ``He's self-invented. But he was never
the most gifted. Ideology filled the hole where talent should have
been.'' Ramirez said that a key to Ortega lies in his seven years
in a prison, starting when he was just 23. ``He has a prison
personality. Lonely, solitary, mistrustful, hard.''
 &HT;    One afternoon I drove to the El Modelo prison, 45 minutes
outside Managua. It is hard to imagine a bleaker-looking place:
long poultry-house-like barracks surrounded by stark empty fields
browned by the harsh sun and heat. It was here that Ortega met his
future wife, Rosario, a poet, when she visited the political
prisoners' wing.
 &HT;    Ortega told me that in the political wing, prisoners were often
kept isolated one to a cell, forced to stand all day long without
anything even to read. He recalled that political prisoners were
taken away and executed for no obvious reason and that you never
knew who might be next, creating a climate of terrifying
insecurity.
 &HT;    Ortega was released in 1974 along with other political prisoners
and flown to Cuba in exchange for the freeing of Somoza elites and
foreign diplomats kidnapped by Sandinista commandos. Four years
later, during the FSLN's final military campaigns against Somoza,
Ortega moved to Costa Rica with Murillo and her three children from
a previous marriage _ including the 11-year-old Zoilamerica.
 &HT;    Montenegro speculates that during Ortega's years in prison _ a
period he once invoked in a poem: ``I never saw Managua when
miniskirts were in fashion'' _ his emotional development was
stunted. It was that immature man, a part of him frozen in time,
who soon became obsessed with his young stepdaughter.
 &HT;    Now, as Ortega faces the greatest challenge yet to his political
existence with the scandal, it is hard not to draw the conclusion
that it is a case in which private and public morality do seem to
merge: Ortega's desire for power as an end in itself seems
inseparable from his moral corruption, his callous disregard for
his stepdaughter.
 &HT;    ``I call him the Great Destroyer,'' Montenegro said of Ortega.
''He destroyed the FSLN. He destroyed Barricada. The destroyer of
so many hopes and dreams. And he destroyed this young girl's
life.''
 &HT;    If the National Assembly refuses to lift Ortega's immunity from
prosecution, or even if the courts eventually rule against Narvaez,
then ``that will only expose to everybody the corruption of the
politicians and the courts,'' Montenegro said. ``Then they will
have condemned themselves.''
 &HT;    Narvaez's case is aimed not just at Ortega and a political
culture of cynical pacts but at the culture of machismo as well. In
Latin America, the violation of stepdaughters is in particular a
long-tolerated pathology.
 &HT;    In the initial silence of so many political leaders _ even
Sandinista opponents _ about Narvaez's accusations, in the former
silence of so many veteran Sandinistas who said they knew about
Ortega's abuse of her all along, you witness a culture of obedience
to powerful men's prerogatives.
 &HT;    Such obedience runs deep. This spring, Alejandro Bendana,
Narvaez's husband, issued a statement confessing his shame over
years of cowed passivity in the face of Ortega's abuse of his young
wife. Nicaragua is a very small place, and everybody knows
everybody else's secrets, and that's another reason for politicians
and even religious leaders not to sound too self-righteous about
other people's problems.
 &HT;    But Montenegro doubts that Ortega's political career will
survive the scandal. By June, he seemed so weakened that President
Aleman, perhaps sensing an easy ``kill,'' personally called on his
Liberal Party legislators, who have a large majority in the
Assembly, to vote to revoke Ortega's immunity from prosecution. If
Aleman gets his way, Ortega could soon find himself back inside a
jail cell.
 &HT;    ``In the end, Zoilamerica is going to do to Daniel what Somoza,
Reagan and the contras never could,'' Montenegro said. ``But even
if he remains secretary-general of the party, so what? Who's going
to want to meet with him? Who's going to want to have their picture
taken with him? Qaddafi and Saddam _ polygamists! He's not going to
be able to go anywhere. He's condemned to be the prisoner of
Nicaragua.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What popped into your mind when you first read the headlines
about Viagra? Well, I thought about that too.
 &HT;    But as a typical, fun-loving economist I also found myself
wondering how the Commerce Department would account for the wonder
drug in its estimates of the gross domestic product _ and from
there wandered into a reverie about the meaning of economic
progress.
 &HT;    Government statisticians will, of course, have no difficulty
slotting Viagra into their estimates of ``nominal'' GDP, the sum
total of all the money spent in the economy. Viagra's contribution
will simply be the total amount that people spend on the pills, or,
equivalently, the profits earned and wages paid in the drug's
manufacture and distribution.
 &HT;    What's more, we can be pretty sure that Viagra's numbers, while
music to the stockholders' ears, will make very little difference
to the national totals. The new drug's spectacular sales are small
change in an $8 trillion economy. And besides, most of the spending
on this new product will come at the expense of spending on other
things _ say, romantic vacations and candlelight dinners.
 &HT;    But nominal GDP doesn't tell us much. Most of the time, the
economic number we care about is ``real,'' or inflation-adjusted,
GDP, which is supposed to measure the purchasing power as opposed
to the dollar income of the economy. Basically, nominal GDP is
converted into real GDP by dividing it by a price index _ a
``deflator'' _ that is supposed to measure the average cost of
goods and services sold in the economy.
 &HT;    So far, so good. But what happens with the introduction of
Viagra, or Propecia, or whatever the next big thing may be?
 &HT;    Statisticians can't compare the prices of these drugs with what
they were last year because they weren't around last year. So
inevitably, estimates of the deflator take account only of the
goods that have been around for at least a little while.
 &HT;    So what? Well, this year some men can buy something they wanted
pretty badly _ or baldly, in the case of Propecia _ and they can
get it at a reasonable price. Last year they couldn't buy what the
pills provide at any price, and probably would have gladly spent
far more at clinics or in therapy to get lesser results. So surely,
in some sense, the nation's purchasing power has increased because
of the availability of those pills.
 &HT;    Yet the numbers you see on real GDP don't reflect that increase
_ and they never will. Eventually Viagra will be in the index, and
as its price falls in the face of competition, the deflator will
fall and measured real income will rise. But at no point will the
statistics ever capture the big payoff, the one that happened when
Viagra became available for $10 a, um, pop.
 &HT;    How could the statisticians get this right? It would have to
involve a subjective evaluation: Each person would have to be
asked, and would have to answer truthfully, the question ``How much
money would you have spent last year (with your ever-growing bald
spot and that other problem) to be as satisfied as you are now?''
 &HT;    Averaging over the population, we would come up with a true
measure of the change in the cost of living, and we would deflate
GDP by that.
 &HT;    In fact, where they can, the statisticians do try to do
something more or less along these lines, adjusting the price of
automobiles and many other products by imputations for improved
quality. But nearly everyone admits that the imputations fall well
short of capturing the real improvement in living standards.
 &HT;    Officially, the median family in 1996 had only slightly higher
real income than it did in 1973; in reality, that median family
would be extremely upset if forced to go back to a 1973 standard of
living (no VCR, no microwave, no ATMs).
 &HT;    So what's the moral? Should we smugly assume that the official
statistics understate economic progress, that the New Economy is
speeding us to a new age of economic bliss? Not so fast. For one
thing, it is by no means clear that our age of technological
marvels is any more marvelous than the age our parents,
grandparents or great-grandparents lived in.
 &HT;    Viagra is only the latest in a long line of medical miracles _
antibiotics, smallpox vaccine, anesthesia _ just as the Internet is
only the latest in a line that goes back to the fax machine, the
telephone and the telegraph. While the statistics do understate
today's true rate of economic progress, they always have.
 &HT;    but there is a deeper point. the value of Viagra is not a
dollar-and-cents issue. Rather, it is a psychological question _
what we are really asking is how much better off the drug makes
people feel. But isn't that true of economic progress in general?
And once you put it that way, you have to wonder whether we are
really making that much progress after all.
 &HT;    Consider: According to the official statistics, the median
family in 1947 had almost exactly the same purchasing power as the
20th-percentile family _ just a little ways above the poverty line
_ of 1996. And the statistics surely understate the true increase
in purchasing power.
 &HT;    Does that mean that most people in 1947 were poor? Well, they
didn't feel poor. Conversely, the 60th percentile in 1996
officially had about the same real income as the 95th percentile in
1947, and again this surely understates the real progress.
 &HT;    Does this mean that most Americans are now upper-middle class?
They don't feel that way.
 &HT;    In other words, as soon as you try to think seriously about how
to measure Viagra's effect on the nation's wealth, you realize what
a dubious enterprise such comparisons are. I have nothing against
calculating real GDP as accurately as possible; we need that number
for all kinds of purposes.
 &HT;    But the rather vulgar case of Viagra reminds us that, in the
end, economics is not about wealth _ it's about the pursuit of
happiness.

 By JAIME WOLF  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the course of what Hollywood types refer to as
``development,'' a screenplay's journey from first draft to
production will frequently take it through the hands of several
writers.
 &HT;    Not long ago, I told my lawyer that the latest draft of an
action-comedy a friend and I are writing for Columbia Pictures was
nearly finished, and he replied, ``Good, you'll hand it in just in
time to be replaced.''
 &HT;    He was joking, but he also was not _ ``Small Soldiers,'' for
instance, originally written by Gavin Scott, was purchased by
Steven Spielberg in 1992, and successively revised by Anne
Spielberg, Danny Rubin, Frank Deese and Lewis Colick, before a
version by Adam Rifkin, incorporating Spielberg's suggestion that
the titular soldiers be divided into two warring factions, was
green-lighted for production last year.
 &HT;    But in a world (to borrow the phrase favored by stentorian
coming-attractions narrators) dominated by giant summer action
movies, the development process hardly stops once a movie is deemed
actually ready to shoot. These days, that's often when it picks up
speed.
 &HT;    More and more commonly, screenwriters who labor to get a movie
green-lighted merely stand at the head of a conveyor belt designed
by producers and studios to precision-tool hits, sending their
scripts along for subsequent handling by a small army of additional
writers, each one specifically directed to beef up action scenes,
to polish dialogue, to throw in some romance or ladle zingers over
the proceedings.
 &HT;    Within the industry, it's an open secret that the authors of
elevated fare such as ``Chinatown,'' ``Schindler's List,''
``Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Apollo 13'' are regularly called in
to make anonymous contributions to popcorn movies such as ``Con
Air,'' ``Twister,'' ``Eraser'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' As
Robin Swicord, who is known for her adaptions of literary material
such as ``Little Women,'' puts it: ``What's the old saying? `A
camel is an animal built by committee.' Well, these movies are like
camels.''
 &HT;    While ``The Avengers,'' just released, benefits from the
uncredited writing contributions of Nicholas Meyer, this summer's
most extreme example would be the asteroid disaster thriller
``Armageddon,'' which employed eight writers on various parts of
its scenario. After Jonathan Hensleigh conceived a story he
described as ```The Dirty Dozen' goes to outer space,'' sold the
pitch to Disney and delivered to the producer Jerry Bruckheimer a
script that mapped out the film's essential structure, he
eventually left to work on another project, which was to be his
directorial debut.
 &HT;    No doubt it seems paradoxical that big, dumb movies would
require the massed efforts of Hollywood's finest minds in a way
that more sophisticated films often do not, but the challenge of
designing something with the requisite thrills, chills and spills
to appeal to a broad international audience is easily obscured by
the simplicity of the plots involved.
 &HT;    Jonathan Glickman, president of production at Caravan Pictures,
says there are about 40 writers who are regularly relied upon to
come in and work on films that are already set to shoot. Recurring
among this summer's releases, for instance, are Hensleigh; the team
of Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, credited on ``The Mask of Zorro,''
``Small Soldiers'' and ``Godzilla''; Zak Penn, who followed Rossio
and Elliott on ``Soldiers'' and ``Zorro,'' and Scott Frank, who
adapted ``Out of Sight'' and then did uncredited work on ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    In many ways, the approach harks back to the Golden Age of
Hollywood, when studios were literally factories, operating on
assembly-line principles to produce 50 movies a year. In the '30s
and '40s, writers were more explicitly and more narrowly
specialized. Some worked only on structure, making scene outlines
from story material in plays or books or magazines. Others, often
playwrights and journalists imported from New York, excelled at
dialogue. Still others functioned as gag men, responsible for jokes
and bits of comic business.
 &HT;    That so many of the films made during that time turned out so
well was less a matter of personal artistry, argued the French film
critic Andri Bazin, than ``the genius of the system.'' Consciously
modeling his own divvying up of scripts on this method, Bruckheimer
says, ``I'm a big fan of the genius of the system.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    As a way of illustrating the process a little more completely,
meet Tim D.(1), one of those hot young screenwriters you hear about
every so often who has yet to see any of his scripts produced.
While working on an effects-driven fantasy called ``Francis Ford
Coppola's Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams,'' which
Dreamworks is developing for the famous director, Tim comes up with
a new idea: What if, in a preapocalyptic near-future with the
country riven by internal conflict, armed terrorists, in an attempt
to chip away at national morale, started hijacking entire baseball
teams, holding them hostage and forcing them to miss their games?
 &HT;    Suppose on a July 4 weekend, they kidnapped the New York
Yankees, threatening their traditional Independence Day contest
against the Red Sox? What if the Pentagon recruited an elite squad
of smooth-fielding, power-hitting anti-terrorists whose job it was
to play in the absent team's stead while also hunting down the bad
guys and rescuing the hostage ballplayers?
 &HT;    Baseball Commandos! Imagine the opening scene, when after the
Red Sox players are introduced and run onto the field, a jet plane
streaks overhead, and 15 men parachute down into the stadium, the
announcer's voice introducing them, one by one. America's team: the
Baseball Commandos!
 &HT;    Tim runs the idea by his agent, summarizing it as ```The Dirty
Dozen' on a ball field.'' His agent responds enthusiastically to
the pitch, sure that he can sell it, though he points out that
baseball teams really only have nine players. ``OK,'' Tim says,
``it's `Die Hard' in New York City.''
 &HT;    The agent reminds him that ``Die Hard With a Vengeance'' had
already been ``Die Hard'' in New York City. ``Your players, the
Commandos,'' he says, ``they should be underdogs, right? Sure, they
can defuse a bomb, but can they hit the sinking curve? It's `The
Mighty Ducks' with guns.'' This potent catch phrase, ```The Mighty
Ducks' with guns,'' along with a panoramic description of the
team's entrance, puts ``Baseball Commandos'' over.
 &HT;    It is a clear-cut summer movie, a slam-bang actionfest, with
roles for several stars. Every studio in town bids on the project,
and when the dust settles, Tim is hired to turn his idea into a
screenplay.
 &HT;    While Tim is off writing his first draft, the studio sends a
story outline of ``Baseball Commandos'' to several major stars.
Bruce Willis commits to the role of Boog Parker, the Commandos'
first baseman, hostage negotiator and team leader. Will Smith
agrees to play Freedom ``da Bomb'' Washington, a hot-shot
outfielder and demolitions expert. Kurt Russell, who played
minor-league ball in real life, also expresses interest in being on
the team.
 &HT;    In short, decisions that will affect the film's final shape
start being made before anybody has even seen a script. Indeed,
Tim's first draft is full of potential, but incomplete. It is too
schematic, simply alternating from the drama of the baseball game
between the Commandos and the Red Sox to the battle between the
evil terrorists and the Commandos. There is something flat and
video-game-ish about it.
 &HT;    This is always the crucial point, where the studio considers
pulling the plug, but there are other considerations, including the
actors' commitments _ how can you not make a movie with Willis and
Smith? _ and deals for promotional tie-ins. Ultimately, the
decision is made to crash the project through.
 &HT;    The studio calls in Jonathan Hensleigh (2) to address the
overall structure of the script. Beefing up the suspense and
dramatic logic of the story, Hensleigh disguises the Commandos as
the Yankees' Newark farm club, flown in to substitute.
 &HT;    To make Spartan Sizemore, the terrorist leader, a more
compelling villain, Hensleigh has the group now not only hold the
Yankees hostage, but also wire the stadium to blow. Overall, he
punctuates the film with a steady rhythm of escalating action
sequences.
 &HT;    When he is finished, casting continues: to appeal to women, Lucy
Lawless, Linda Hamilton and Roseanne are cast as Commandos, a move
that will necessitate the rewriting of their parts. Callie Khouri
(3) is brought in for the job, contributing, among other things, a
memorable line spoken by Roseanne's character, catcher Ruth
``Babe'' Orsini: ``You gotta wonder about ballplayers who run
around calling themselves Pee Wee.''
 &HT;    Separately, Michael Tolkin (4) and Steven Zaillian (5) are hired
to work on the human element, deepening the story lines of several
of the fans in attendance at the game: a pair of Boston teen-agers
who ride the bus to New York City for the first time; a Puerto
Rican from East Harlem and his girlfriend, and a Bronx homegirl who
takes her brother's ticket after he is shot by a man who turns out
to be one of the terrorists and who ultimately helps Will Smith
find the detonator beneath the stadium.
 &HT;    Ron Shelton (6), who doesn't usually do rewrite work, is
prevailed upon to take over the baseball scenes, adding the part of
an autistic relief pitcher _ for Pearl Jam's lead singer, Eddie
Vedder, in his first major film role. (He also agrees to write and
perform for the soundtrack.) For a motivational speech that Willis
delivers during the seventh-inning stretch, Shelton cribs from the
writings of A. Bartlett Giamatti, comparing baseball to Renaissance
poetry.
 &HT;    However, his metaphorical master stroke is a gambit that Willis'
character will deploy, called ``throwing the screwball,'' in which,
by means of calculated double talk and nonsense, he consistently
confuses and disarms the terrorists.
 &HT;    When the Japanese superstar ``Beat'' Takeshi Kitano is cast _
ratcheting up both the hipness quotient and the appeal to Asian
audiences _ Quentin Tarantino (7) is hired to write his character.
It is his idea that first Smith, and then ultimately the whole
team, refer to Kitano as Astro Boy, in homage to the famous
Japanese TV cartoon.
 &HT;    Tarantino models Kitano's character on the fabled Tokyo Giants
home-run king, Sadaharu Oh, who refined his batting technique by
studying traditional Aikido and sword-fighting skills, which come
in handy during a skirmish with Sizemore's terrorists on the D
train between the third and fourth innings.
 &HT;    As shooting is about to start, Zak Penn (8) and Carrie Fisher
(9) are brought in to address the humor of the story, a job made
easier by the casting of Steve Buscemi as the Commandos'
smart-aleck batboy, Bill Murray as an addled play-by-play announcer
and Garry Shandling as the vain, craven Yankees owner.
 &HT;    Finally, Sean Connery, who has agreed to play the terrorist
Sizemore, requests a writer to polish his dialogue. Frank Darabont
(10) is brought in for the job.
 &HT;    Unhappy at being shunted aside so quickly, Tim leaves ``Baseball
Commandos'' to write a new script, a clever twist on an old idea
called ``Viet Kong,'' concerning a giant ape discovered in the
jungles of Southeast Asia and trained to fight U.S. and South
Vietnamese troops. Warner Brothers buys it for Oliver Stone to
direct, and Tim's off on the rewrite treadmill once again.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Producers and studio executives tend to justify this approach in
terms of insurance: They're spending $100 million, and want to know
that every moment, every gesture, every line is as good as it can
be. A script is never perfect. It's never right enough, it's never
funny enough, there's not enough suspense. So producers want to be
able to call on writers who can do those things.
 &HT;    Says Glickman: ``Everyone wants a guy who's done it before. You
have to understand, it extends beyond writers _ you want a director
who's already made a big movie, a cinematographer, an editor. The
stakes are so high.''
 &HT;    Members of the elite and publicly invisible class of writers
created by the system can earn as much as $200,000 a week for their
contributions. Yet many writers, despite the lucrative inducements
to rewrite others, are increasingly unhappy with the seeming
disposability of their own work and have begun more vocally to
decry the practice.
 &HT;    But to the blockbuster way of thinking, a script is far less a
literary or an imaginative undertaking than it is a business plan
for a start-up company that requires some $70 million to $100
million in initial capitalization. In essence, studios are
investment banks that specialize in financing this kind of venture.
Their executives are experts in evaluating such plans in terms of
particular elements that are thought to guarantee a good return.
When these elements are deemed to be in place, then the business is
financed and the movie is made.
 &HT;    A cynical person might conclude that the scripts for movies like
``Baseball Commandos'' are fairly irrelevant _ a point of view
supported by Steven Spielberg's court testimony regarding the
genesis of ``Twister,'' in which he stated that its screenplay was
responsible for only about 5 percent of the film's success relative
to special effects, star power, advertising and marketing.
 &HT;    But no one who is about to spend the equivalent of the GNP of
Tonga ever sets out to make a bad movie. Even under ideal
circumstances, as David Koepp, whose blockbuster experience
includes both ``Jurassic Park'' movies and ``Mission: Impossible''
as well as this summer's ``Snake Eyes,'' has pointed out, the more
fantastic the premise of a film, and the more effects technology it
necessitates, ``it's difficult to have any kind of human drama that
doesn't seem incompatible.''
 &HT;    Says Daniel Waters, whose quirky sensibility has informed movies
like ``Hudson Hawk'' and ``Demolition Man'': ``People who've
written a big-budget screenplay never blame the script. People who
haven't always do. I remember coming out of the first `Batman'
movie and saying: `Oh, my God, they had such amazing visuals! If
only there had been a decent script!' Then, three years later,
after I'd done heartbreaking work writing `Batman Returns,' I was
walking out of the premiere, when I overheard someone saying: `Man,
what a great-looking movie. If only they had a good script. ...'''

 By JAIME WOLF  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the course of what Hollywood types refer to as
``development,'' a screenplay's journey from first draft to
production will frequently take it through the hands of several
writers.
 &HT;    Not long ago, I told my lawyer that the latest draft of an
action-comedy a friend and I are writing for Columbia Pictures was
nearly finished, and he replied, ``Good, you'll hand it in just in
time to be replaced.''
 &HT;    He was joking, but he also was not _ ``Small Soldiers,'' for
instance, originally written by Gavin Scott, was purchased by
Steven Spielberg in 1992, and successively revised by Anne
Spielberg, Danny Rubin, Frank Deese and Lewis Colick, before a
version by Adam Rifkin, incorporating Spielberg's suggestion that
the titular soldiers be divided into two warring factions, was
green-lighted for production last year.
 &HT;    But in a world (to borrow the phrase favored by stentorian
coming-attractions narrators) dominated by giant summer action
movies, the development process hardly stops once a movie is deemed
actually ready to shoot. These days, that's often when it picks up
speed.
 &HT;    More and more commonly, screenwriters who labor to get a movie
green-lighted merely stand at the head of a conveyor belt designed
by producers and studios to precision-tool hits, sending their
scripts along for subsequent handling by a small army of additional
writers, each one specifically directed to beef up action scenes,
to polish dialogue, to throw in some romance or ladle zingers over
the proceedings.
 &HT;    Within the industry, it's an open secret that the authors of
elevated fare such as ``Chinatown,'' ``Schindler's List,''
``Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Apollo 13'' are regularly called in
to make anonymous contributions to popcorn movies such as ``Con
Air,'' ``Twister,'' ``Eraser'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' As
Robin Swicord, who is known for her adaptions of literary material
such as ``Little Women,'' puts it: ``What's the old saying? `A
camel is an animal built by committee.' Well, these movies are like
camels.''
 &HT;    While ``The Avengers,'' just released, benefits from the
uncredited writing contributions of Nicholas Meyer, this summer's
most extreme example would be the asteroid disaster thriller
``Armageddon,'' which employed eight writers on various parts of
its scenario. After Jonathan Hensleigh conceived a story he
described as ```The Dirty Dozen' goes to outer space,'' sold the
pitch to Disney and delivered to the producer Jerry Bruckheimer a
script that mapped out the film's essential structure, he
eventually left to work on another project, which was to be his
directorial debut.
 &HT;    No doubt it seems paradoxical that big, dumb movies would
require the massed efforts of Hollywood's finest minds in a way
that more sophisticated films often do not, but the challenge of
designing something with the requisite thrills, chills and spills
to appeal to a broad international audience is easily obscured by
the simplicity of the plots involved.
 &HT;    Jonathan Glickman, president of production at Caravan Pictures,
says there are about 40 writers who are regularly relied upon to
come in and work on films that are already set to shoot. Recurring
among this summer's releases, for instance, are Hensleigh; the team
of Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, credited on ``The Mask of Zorro,''
``Small Soldiers'' and ``Godzilla''; Zak Penn, who followed Rossio

adapted ``Out of Sight'' and then did uncredited work on ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    In many ways, the approach harks back to the Golden Age of

assembly-line principles to produce 50 movies a year. In the '30s
and '40s, writers were more explicitly and more narrowly

 By MARK LILLA  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    August was the cruelest month. After the Tet offensive and the
escalation of the Vietnam War in early 1968, after the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and
then riots and looting in several major cities, Americans ended the
summer watching the Democratic Party implode at its Chicago
convention while policemen beat demonstrators on the streets
outside. The country seemed to be coming unglued.
 &HT;    Or was it the whole Western world? The situation in Europe
certainly made it seem so.
 &HT;    In the spring, universities in Madrid and Rome were closed after
clashes between students and police, while in West Germany the
leader of the largest student organization was shot, setting off
arson attacks by a newly formed terrorist group called the Red Army
Faction.
 &HT;    The following month, a student strike at a suburban university
outside Paris metamorphosed into the now famous ``events of May,''
which began with marches and the occupation of buildings and ended
with barricades, Molotov cocktails, hand-to-hand street combat and
a general strike that brought the French economy to its knees.
 &HT;    In the summer of `68 it seemed safe to assume that America and
Western Europe were undergoing the same ``revolution,'' a word that
came easily to the lips back then. But within a few years it became
obvious that very different dramas were being played out on the two
continents.
 &HT;    After a brief but significant flirtation with armed violence on
the fringes of the ```60s movement,'' the American left began to
turn its attention from strictly political issues, such as
segregation and imperialism, to new cultural ones, such as
feminism. As the war in Vietnam de-escalated, a cultural war that
is still with us began at home.
 &HT;    In Europe, however, it was the political repercussions of `68
that remained most significant over the next decade. French
students and intellectuals made a fetish of Chairman Mao and
genuflected before it, while German and Italian terrorists
kidnapped, ``kneecapped'' and murdered leading figures in business
and government.
 &HT;    The coldblooded execution of the former prime minister, Aldo
Moro, by the Italian Red Brigades on the 10th anniversary of May
`68 was only the most spectacular of these attacks, which lasted
into the 1980s.
 &HT;    Given these violent political contestations, you might expect
passions about the `60s to run higher in Europe today than in the
politically stable United States. Instead, the tumult has
disappeared: the `60s are over in Europe.
 &HT;    This past spring, the 30th anniversary of May `68 was calmly
commemorated across the continent without bloodshed _ indeed,
without significant controversy. Conferences were held, TV specials
were broadcast, day-by-day chronicles of the events appeared in the
newspapers and hundreds of books (more than 80 in France alone)
were printed.
 &HT;    Yet as the French newspaper Le Monde reported, the anniversary
was a publishing disaster. It appears there was neither enough
nostalgia for, nor rage against, the `60s revolution to induce the
French to read about it _ especially the young, for whom it is
ancient history.
 &HT;    This indifference is common today, though not because Europe has
returned to some pre-`68 slumber. It is simply that Europeans have
made their peace with the revolution's successes and failures.
Unlike the United States, where pro- and anti-`68 factions continue
to militate in the worlds of academia, journalism and politics,
Europe has comfortably entered a post-`68 age.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: Why haven't we? Why do the American
`60s, whose political conflicts no longer rage in our streets,
continue to rage in our heads?
 -0- 
 &HT;    What distinguishes the American and European `60s is less the
nature of the political and cultural changes that eventually took
place than the spirit in which they were pursued.
 &HT;    Was the revolution, as Europeans seemed to believe, essentially
about bringing an end to an old political order that also supported
a stifling bourgeois culture? Or was it, as Americans appeared to
think, about extending the reach of a noble if imperfectly realized
political ideal into every corner of cultural life?
 &HT;    The European `60s were politically contentious from the start,
for reasons that lie in a half-century of ideological polarization.
Until World War II, much of the continent looked not much different
from the Europe of the 19th century. It was rural, religious,
socially conservative and, especially in German-speaking
territories, admiring of military virtues. This was the traditional
home of the European right.
 &HT;    The European left, on the other hand, was centered in the
rapidly growing cities and divided between Communists and Social
Democrats. These forces polarized European politics in the decades
leading up to World War II, and most observers expected the
continent to fall back into this pattern at its conclusion.
 &HT;    Yet in the three decades following the war, a social
transformation began that would eventually turn over the tired soil
that had nourished hostile political relations in Europe for so
long. Its causes were fundamentally economic and military: 30 years
of unprecedented growth in production and public investment under
the American nuclear umbrella.
 &HT;    As the bounty arrived, the centuries-long divide between urban
and rural mentalities that underlay the right-left split began to
close up. Villages across Europe were depopulated and, through
television, people who remained behind began to take part, at least
from a distance, in the life of the capitals.
 &HT;    As working-class families acquired more consumer goods, the
distinctions between classes came to depend more on taste than on
buying power. This is not to say that postwar Europe became a
classless continent, simply that traditional social divisions were
being replaced by more complex ones _ the most significant new one
being generational.
 &HT;    At bottom, ``catching up'' was what the European `60s were all
about. Although Western Europe managed to get on the
liberal-democratic rails remarkably fast in the 20 years after the
war, its ideological frame of reference was still that of the
polarized prewar era.
 &HT;    The new Christian Democratic parties were, to be sure, nothing
like the old right, yet neither were they committed to the
modernization of social institutions. The Communists came out of
the war strengthened by their (often exaggerated) role in resisting
fascism, but their language of ``class struggle'' and ``leading
role of the party'' rang hollow.
 &HT;    While European workers continued to give their ballots to the
Communists, with their wallets they _ and especially their children
_ were voting for consumer capitalism. Out of this gap between the
reality of postwar European society and its prewar ideologies a new
political force was born.
 &HT;    Because it appealed to so many of the traditional symbols of the
European left _ and even radicalized them, replacing class struggle
with generational struggle, Marx and Lenin with Mao and Che,
``socialism in one country'' with worldwide peasant revolution _ it
stood to reason that it was taken to be a ``new'' left.
 &HT;    But, in fact, it was not essentially a revitalized left but a
third force that helped to extinguish an established European left
that could trace its lineage back to 1917 and even to 1789. Its new
demands for hedonistic fulfillment and individual self-expression
had nothing to do with Marxism, as the nervous Communist parties of
Europe understood perfectly well. And its skepticism toward the
experiences of real existing socialism was such that disenchantment
with the entire revolutionary tradition was bound to set in.
 &HT;    And it did. The first shock came in 1972 with the murder of 11
Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games by the Palestinian
Black September group. Suddenly it seemed that the celebration of
terrorism and unconditional support of Third World struggles by the
most radical of the `68ers had, at least indirectly, sanctioned the
death of Jews again in Europe.
 &HT;    Then in 1974 Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag Archipelago''
appeared, convincing many younger intellectuals on the left,
especially in France, of the necessary connection between communism
and totalitarian repression.
 &HT;    The fall of Saigon brought the heartbreaking flight of the boat
people; there was the Cambodian genocide, and in 1979 a ``people's
revolution'' in Iran brought to power a reactionary religious
clique that repressed secular intellectuals, women and homosexuals.
 &HT;    Because the European left took seriously the possibility of
communism and Third World revolution, in the end it was forced to
reckon with their historical records. And while this was happening,
the leftist dogma that real reform was impossible within ``formal''
democracy was proving to be a myth. Socialist parties came to power
in Portugal and France, then in Italy and Spain.
 &HT;    The German new left, which had been Europe's most intransigent,
progressively made its peace with parliamentary democracy. This
political ``normalization'' of the European left was accompanied by
an intellectual ``normalization,'' and by the mid-'80s the radical
newspapers founded in the wake of the `60s agitation _ Libiration
in Paris, La Repubblica in Rome, Die Tageszeitung in Berlin _ had
become perfectly conventional publications.
 &HT;    Thus, when perestroika began, and as the regimes of the East
Bloc started to crumble on the bicentennary of the French
Revolution, the European left had already divested itself of its
holdings in the enterprise that had been founded in Russia in 1917.
It was now clear to almost everyone that a 50-year tradition of
thinking and living politics had come to a close. And with it ended
the political dreams of `68.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This dramatic story of the European left's political maturation,
of revolutionary promise and betrayal, of illusions embraced and
lost, was not the story that unfolded in the United States. And the
reason for this is quite simple: the fate of the Communist idea,
and even of the French revolutionary tradition, had virtually no
significance for American `68ers. Politically speaking, they were,
and by and large still are, provincials.
 &HT;    While European radicals such as Rigis Debray spent the `60s in
the jungles of South America spreading the revolutionary gospel,
students in the United States stayed on campus and demanded that
America ``come home.'' Home was where its heart was, even when it
foolishly denounced ``Amerika.''
 &HT;    What these `68ers originally demanded was that America fulfill
its own democratic promise, not that it take up a new revolutionary
mission. The temple of the American democratic ideal had to be
cleansed. A ritual cleansing began with the civil-rights movement
and resistance to the war, and was finished once Richard Nixon
resigned and the troops came home.
 &HT;    Yet it was these very successes that fed the American left's
passion for greater purification, for an extension of the `68
spirit from the strictly political sphere to the whole of American
culture.
 &HT;    Aspects of American life that hitherto had been spared the
exacting scrutiny of pure democratic principles _ family, marriage,
the regulation of morals, the authority of law, even the authority
of learning _ now seemed somehow suspect, if not illegitimate. For
the `68ers, it was perfectly obvious that the struggle begun in the
streets of Selma and Chicago's Grant Park should be followed by new
campaigns in the classrooms and bedrooms of America.
 &HT;    The line between politics and culture looked absurd to them for
the simple reason that they did not take the democratic idea to be
a merely political principle. It was, so to speak, an existential
one that deserved to be applied to every aspect of our lives.
 &HT;    This existential character of the American democratic faith has
been noted by alert European observers of our country ever since
Tocqueville and Mrs. Trollope began writing about us in the 19th
century. They immediately notice two things: that democracy in
America is considered not just a set of institutions and principles
but a way of life and that it is promoted with a unique sort of
passion.
 &HT;    We Americans have trouble entertaining the notion that there
might be aspects of life _ let alone whole parts of the globe _
where it cannot or should not apply. To suggest this might be the
case is to risk being burned by the fire of democratic passion.
 &HT;    The American Founders had a strong sense of the passions to
which democratic politics is subject, which is why they placed such
a high value on moderating and canalizing them in the system of
government they fashioned. What they did not anticipate was that
the American conception of democracy would become an existential
one progressively chipping away at the distinction between politics
and culture that they took for granted.
 &HT;    Nor did they imagine that once democratic political passions
spilled over into the morally and psychologically fragile sphere of
culture, they would be more difficult to moderate and their damage
more difficult to repair.
 &HT;    It is little wonder that since the `60s we have become such a
``sensitive'' nation, in every sense of the term, for we have
extended the democratic project into extremely intimate areas of
life: sexual identity, marital relations, authority in the family
and moral education, not to mention the eternal complications of
race and ethnicity.
 &HT;    This conception of democracy as an all-encompassing way of life
is utterly foreign to European society, in large part because its
own past, like that of most human cultures, was aristocratic and
hierarchical. Europeans have therefore been somewhat anxious about
this trans-Atlantic difference, wondering whether America is
exceptional or merely more advanced in fashioning a democratic
culture destined to spread across the globe.
 &HT;    Whatever one's views on these speculations, the Europeans are
right to think that American democratic passions are still unique
in the world. Although democracy is becoming more widely recognized
abroad as a political value, there is still only one nation on
earth that takes it to be an existential one.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that European culture has not been
transformed since the `60s, in many ways following the American
democratic example. There has been something of a continental
cultural revolution, though it has been carried out much more
slowly than our own and without our red-hot passion.
 &HT;    The list of legal reforms stemming from the `60s is long and
familiar: the legalization of abortion, the near abolition of
censorship, guarantees of sexual equality in the workplace, the
decriminalization of homosexual activity, the parity of husbands
and wives before the law and the loosening of parents' statutory
authority over their children.
 &HT;    Informal changes in cultural mores also took place after `68, as
life became more relaxed and flexible in the workplace and the
home. And, not surprisingly, many of the dispiriting repercussions
of the `60s that we have experienced have also followed this
transformation in Europe, including increased divorce and
illegitimacy rates, the decline in public civility, drug problems
and violent youth crimes.
 &HT;    Yet after the shock of `68 and the flood of accumulated cultural
demands it unleashed, the institution of these reforms in Europe
met with general social consensus, mostly because of unspoken
agreement about the limits to cultural democratization.
 &HT;    European feminists have won many victories over recent decades
without taking on the joyless militancy of American feminism,
without questioning the naturalness of family or upsetting the
psychologically delicate ritual of seduction.
 &HT;    European schools that used to be strictly hierarchical and
indifferent to laggards have become more attentive to students'
needs. The curriculum, however, remains much as it was 30 years
ago, and there are no agonizing debates about making it
``representative.''
 &HT;    In short, cultural issues Americans instinctively frame in terms
of nonnegotiable democratic principles have been treated in Europe
through an informal balancing of those principles with other,
nonpolitical ones.
 &HT;    Indeed, because the modernization of post-`68 European culture
was not brought about through the sort of messianic moral crusade
that has been so divisive in America, in certain ways its reforms
have gone further than our own, and with fewer untoward effects.
 &HT;    As the `68 anniversary was marked in France this spring, there
were calm public debates about two measures that would be
unthinkable in the United States even today. One would require that
half of each political party's candidates for office be women; the
other would establish a legal framework for recognizing homosexual
couples.
 &HT;    In short, despite the extreme political violence of the `60s,
there has been no post-`68 ``culture war'' in Europe. And the
culture warriors so familiar to us _ aging `68 professors promoting
the Glorious Revolution, agitated conservative journalists
portraying America as Gomorrah _ are nowhere to be found.
 -0- 
 &HT;    All revolutions inevitably face the same crisis: how to bring
themselves to a close. This is because revolutionary success
depends on stirring up passions that subsequently prove difficult
to cool. With modern revolutions such passions are even more
difficult to calm because they are accompanied by revolutions in
ideas, which have a way of digging in their heels and resisting
retirement after they have been overtaken by events.
 &HT;    To the extent that the European `60s revolution was driven by an
idea, it was an old conception of political revolution that had
been born in 1789, revived in 1917 and began collapsing after World
War II under the weight of a new social reality and its own evident
failures around the globe.
 &HT;    The `60s were about the end of this tradition in Europe, and
perhaps that is why they are finally over. European culture has
been, and continues to be, reformed in light of that experience,
but not in the shadow of the revolutionary ideal.
 &HT;    The American `60s were also about an idea, though not about
burying it. For better or worse, our cultural revolution has now
entered the pantheon of victories for the American democratic
project and there it will remain, flanked on one side by the
abolition of slavery and segregation and on the other by an empty
altar reserved for heroes of the next campaign.
 &HT;    Americans today see the `60s as continuing a native tradition,
not as departing from it, and in this respect our revolution was
more conservative than the European one. It does not, at least in
public perception, represent a break in our history.
 &HT;    Yet the reason this revolution continues to haunt us is that by
breaking down the last fences between democratic politics and
culture, it entered unexplored territory. And there it has begun to
lose its bearings and cause some harm _ to our families, our
schools, our cultural institutions, our public life and, indeed, to
our psychological well-being.
 &HT;    These harms are real, not the figment of the conservative
imagination. But they are virtually impossible for pro- and
anti-`68 partisans to consider dispassionately, so strong is the
grip of the democratic idea on us all.
 &HT;    Even American conservatives today can find no compelling
democratic reason to question the extension of the democratic
principle to the realms of morals, sex, family and education, which
means they can find no reason at all.
 &HT;    In this sense, our `60s are over too: We are all `68ers now. And
that is our problem. We are anxious about the America the `68
revolution has bequeathed us, but we avoid thinking too deeply
about it, fearing, perhaps with good reason, that our faith _ our
all-encompassing democratic faith _ might not stand the test.

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire
and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly
telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of
the early short stories of Raymond Carver.
 &HT;    The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea
was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were
more his than Carver's.
 &HT;    No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who
died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them.
Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written
fiction too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people
care about his work?
 &HT;    As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the
subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe
he had rethought what his contribution had been _ or simply moved
on.
 &HT;    Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the
Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver
scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one
tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary
executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with
copyright cautions and pressure.
 &HT;    I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be
published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive
myself.
 &HT;    What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of
stories such as ``Fat'' and ``Tell the Women We're Going,'' were
pages full of editorial marks _ strikeouts, additions and marginal
comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a
temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories.
 &HT;    As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she
was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules.
But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver.
 &HT;    ``I started reading the folders,'' she said, ''but then I
stopped when I saw what was in there.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken
seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon.
When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by
many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories
were beautiful and moving.
 &HT;    At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the
editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, ``America has just lost
the writer it could least afford to lose.''
 &HT;    Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster
Wallace is today, but many of his stories _ ``Cathedral,'' ``Will
You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' and ``Errand'' _ are firmly
established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980s,
Carver has become establishment fiction.
 &HT;    That doesn't capture his claim on us though. It goes deeper than
his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an
alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write
through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered
multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30s. He struggled in a
difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk.
 &HT;    Through it all he remained a generous, determined man _
fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in
with Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life.
 &HT;    ``I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the
woods,'' he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at
the Lilly. ``But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it.''
Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
 &HT;    Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that
what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap
between the early style of ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
and ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' Carver's first
two major collections, and his later work in ``Cathedral'' and
``Where I'm Calling From.''
 &HT;    In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are
mostly about the working poor _ unemployed salesmen, waitresses,
motel managers _ in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early
collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are
minimalist in style with an almost abstract feel. They drop their
characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone,
drunk at noon. The later two collections are fuller, touched by
optimism, even sentimentality.
 &HT;    Many critics over the years have noticed this difference and
explained it in terms of biography. The Carver of the early
stories, it has been said, was in despair. As he grew successful,
however, the writer learned about hopefulness and love, and it
soaked into his fiction.
 &HT;    This redemptive story was burnished through countless retellings
by Gallagher. Most critics seemed satisfied by this literal-minded
explanation: Happy writers write happy stories.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Sitting under the coffered ceiling of the Lilly, I began pulling
out folders from the two boxes marked ``Carver.'' Here were the
stories from his first two collections as well as from
``Cathedral'' in versions from manuscript to printer's galleys.
 &HT;    I had previously seen some manuscripts in the Carver holdings at
Ohio State University, an archive to which Gallagher has said she
will ultimately give the Carver papers in her possession. The
manuscripts at OSU are clean, almost without editing marks, as if
they'd gone straight from author to typesetter. Where there are
multiple drafts of a manuscript, the procession is unremarkable:
The annotations in Carver's tiny handwriting drive the story
confidently from draft to draft until the story achieves its
finished form.
 &HT;    The Lilly manuscripts are different. There are countless cuts
and additions to the pages; entire paragraphs have been added.
Lish's black felt-tip markings sometimes obliterate the original
text.
 &HT;    In the case of Carver's 1981 collection, ``What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love,'' Lish cut about half the original words
and rewrote 10 of the 13 endings. ``Carol, story ends here,'' he
would note for the benefit of his typist.
 &HT;    In ``Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit,'' for example, Lish cut 70
percent of the original words. With a longer story, ``A Small, Good
Thing,'' in which a couple anxiously wait for their child to come
out of a coma, Lish cut the text by a third, eliminating most of
the description _ and all of the introspection. He retitled it
``The Bath,'' altering the story's redemptive tone to one of
Beckettian despair. In Lish's version, you no longer know if the
child lives or dies.
 &HT;    Lish was constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's
creeping sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's
characters talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When
they do bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they
stopped crying. They stopped feeling.
 &HT;    Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he freely wrote them in:
``The women, they weren't there when I left, and they wouldn't be
there when I got back'' (``Night School''). Other times, he cut
away whole sections to leave a sentence from inside the story as
the end: ``There were dogs and there were dogs. Some dogs you just
couldn't do anything with'' (``Jerry and Molly and Sam'').
 &HT;    On occasion, Carver reversed his changes, but in most cases
Lish's handwriting became part of Carver's next draft, which became
the published story.
 &HT;    ``Fat'' was one of the first stories Carver gave Lish to edit.
It became the lead story in ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
In ``Fat,'' a restaurant waitress recounts to her friend Rita a
large meal she served to a ravenous but melancholy obese man. The
waitress's lover, Rudy, the restaurant cook, feels jealous. When
they get home, he insists on having sex with her, but her mind
remains with her experiences in the restaurant: The fat man has
touched her in some way, made her feel dissatisfied with her life.
This was how Carver wrote it, more as an anecdote than a story.
 &HT;    It proved excellent material for Lish's talents. Some of what
Lish does is technical: He moves the story into the present tense,
for example. And he eliminates the waitress's self-reflectiveness,
so we seem more involved than she does in what she is feeling.
(Critics would later declare such touches to be trademark
techniques of Carver.)
 &HT;    Most important, Lish picks up on the ``long, thick, creamy
fingers'' Carver gives the fat man, and finds in this the story's
core _ the connection between longing and sexuality.
 &HT;    ``My God, Rita, those were fingers,'' the waitress tells her
girlfriend, who herself has ``dainty fingers.'' At the end, when
Rudy gets into bed with her, she observes, ``Rudy is a tiny thing
and hardly there at all.''
 &HT;    These lines _ and several others _ were written by Lish. In
Lish's hands, fatness becomes sexual potency, fullness, presence.
He finds the resonance Carver missed.
 &HT;    If ``Fat'' was a successful _ if unusually extensive _ edit,
Lish's efforts on another story, ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
seemed closer to a wholesale rewrite. Written by Carver in the late
1960s or early '70s, the story was unusual for him, one of the few
in which the violence implicit in his characters becomes explicit.
 &HT;    The story first made an appearance as ``Friendship'' in
Sou'wester, a small literary magazine. By the time it appeared in
the ``What We Talk About'' collection, Lish had retitled it _ and
cut it by 40 percent.
 &HT;    As I thumbed through various manuscripts at the Lilly, my face
was flushed. I wanted Carver to win, whatever that might mean. He
had shown writers the value of measuring your words. He had come
along in the early 1970s when the first ``post-modern'' novelists,
writers such as John Barth and Donald Barthelme, dominated the
literary scene. Their cerebral stories were admirable, but they
were hard to love. Carver broke up their racket.
 &HT;    Overall, Lish's editorial changes generally struck me as for the
better. Some of the cuts were brilliant, like the expert cropping
of a picture. His additions gave the stories new dimensions,
bringing out moments that I was sure Carver must have loved to see.
Other changes, such as those in ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
struck me as bullying and competitive. Lish was redirecting
Carver's vision in the service of his own fictional goals. The act
felt parasitic.
 &HT;    Lish's techniques also grew tired more quickly than did
Carver's. After a while, the endless ``I say,'' ``he says'' tags
Lish placed on so much of the dialogue felt gimmicky. In all cases,
however, I had one sustained reaction: For better or worse, Lish
was in there.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Back in New York I contacted Lish. Much has changed for
``Captain Fiction,'' as the once-dapper Lish was nicknamed during
his Esquire heyday. Now 64, he is a widower, living alone in a
spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He shuffles
around in his socks, his long white hair and loose clothes making
him look like a vanquished sorcerer.
 &HT;    ``I don't like talking about the Carver period,'' he said,
''because of my sustained sense of his betrayal and because it
seems bad form to discuss this. ... This puts me in an absolutely
impossible light,'' he continued. ``I can only be despised for my
participation.''
 &HT;    Lish already has plenty of enemies: By the 1990s his aggressive
editing, controversial private fiction seminars and taste for
publicity had cost him many friends. ``I said no to the people to
whom one doesn't say no,'' he said.
 &HT;    In 1994, after a decade in which the writers he was championing
found fewer and fewer readers, Knopf fired him. He now writes
fiction full time. His latest is titled ``Self-Imitation of
Myself.'' Reading his stories is like looking at the gears of a
clock that's missing a face.
 &HT;    It was in 1976 that Carver collected his stories in ``Will You
Please Be Quiet, Please?'' including a version of the title story
that Lish had cut.
 &HT;    In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Geoffrey Wolff,
who would later become a friend of Carver's, hailed the stories,
describing them as ``carefully shaped'' and ``shorn of
ornamentation,'' marked by ``spells of quiet and tensed
apprehension.'' In fact, Wolff wrote, Carver's prose ``carries his
mark everywhere: I would like to believe that having read the
stories I could identify him on the evidence of a paragraph.'' The
collection was nominated for a National Book Award.
 &HT;    Carver was gaining confidence from his success and writing more
ambitiously. And he was finding out the world wasn't so harsh. He
had friends now, acolytes even. He separated from Maryann and
became involved with Tess Gallagher. He bought a boat and
celebrated it in a poem in which he imagined it filled with his
friends.
 &HT;    His editor's confidence was also growing. Lish thought of
himself as Carver's ventriloquist. ``I could not believe no one had
stumbled on what was going on,'' he says. A collision was
inevitable.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Initially, Carver had been grateful for Lish's help _ or perhaps
just compliant or cowed. Carver was in a bad place in his life,
beset by drink and poverty. Lish was his way to a readership.
Nevertheless, Carver's unease was evident from the beginning.
 &HT;    Responding to an edit in December 1969, Carver wrote:
``Everything considered, it's a better story now than when I first
mailed it your way _ which is the important thing, I'm sure.'' He
echoed these sentiments in January 1971. ``Took all of yr changes
and added a few things here and there,'' he wrote, taking pains to
add that he was ``not bothered'' by the extent of Lish's edit.
 &HT;    Carver had a role in keeping the romance going too. ``You've
made a single-handed impression on American letters,'' he wrote
Lish in September 1977. ``And, of course, you know, old bean, just
what influence you've exercised on my life.'' He even offered to
pay the charges for any work Lish sends out to be retyped.
 &HT;    After ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' they began work on a
second collection, which Lish would ultimately title ``What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love.'' (Carver had called it
``Beginners.'') By that time, Lish was editing more heavily. He
treated Carver as if he barely had a vote.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carver was becoming a known literary figure. In 1978
he won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The next year he became a professor
of English at Syracuse University.
 &HT;    Carver began to object to Lish's editing, but he wasn't sure
what to object to. He wrote a five-page letter in July 1980 telling
Lish that he could not allow him to publish ``What We Talk About''
as Lish had edited it.
 &HT;    He wrote, ``Maybe if I were alone, by myself, and no one had
ever seen these stories, maybe then, knowing that your versions are
better than some of the ones I sent, maybe I could get into this
and go with it.'' But he feared being caught.
 &HT;    ``Tess has seen all of these and gone over them closely. Donald
Hall has seen many of the new ones ... and Richard Ford, Toby
Wolff, Geoffrey Wolff, too, some of them. ... How can I explain to
these fellows when I see them, as I will see them, what happened?''
 &HT;    He begged to be let out of his contract or at least to delay
publication: ``Please, Gordon, for God's sake help me in this and
try to understand. . . . I've got to pull out of this one. Please
hear me. I've been up all night thinking on this. ... I'll say it
again, if I have any standing or reputation or cedibility (sic) in
the world, I owe it to you. I owe you this more-or-less pretty
interesting life I have (but) I can't take the risk as to what
might happen to me.''
 &HT;    In the same letter, he wrote imploringly, ``(M)y very sanity is
on the line here. ... I feel it, that if the book were to be
published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write
another story.''
 &HT;    Lish does not recall being moved. ``My sense of it was that
there was a letter and that I just went ahead.'' He knew what was
best for Carver _ even if Carver didn't see it that way.
 &HT;    In the end, ``What We Talk About'' was published much as Lish
wanted. The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its
minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so,
Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He
insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would
have to keep his hands off.
 &HT;    ``I can't undergo (that) kind of surgical amputation and
transplantation,'' he wrote Lish in August 1982. ``Please help me
with this book as a good editor, the best ... not as my ghost,'' he
pleaded two months later.
 &HT;    Lish reluctantly complied. ``So be it,'' he wrote in December
1982 after giving the manuscript to ``Cathedral'' only a light edit
_ although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even
then, Carver feared a sneak attack. ``I don't need to tell you that
it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with
titles or text,'' he warned Lish.
 &HT;    Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of
telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his
stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when
he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through
again and took the commas out.
 &HT;    Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his
friends whether he should make his ``surrogate work'' public. They
advised him to keep quiet.
 &HT;    Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he
never looked back. He didn't need to. ``Cathedral'' was his most
celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow
wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for
both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
 &HT;    Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that
the title story ``went straight from the typewriter into the
mail.''
 &HT;    Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work _
stories such as ``Blackbird Pie'' and ``Errand'' _ as his best
efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the
Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national
attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended.
 -0- 
 &HT;    When interviewers used to ask Carver about his relationship with
``Captain Fiction,'' he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a
talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial
time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of
their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might
reveal for those interested in his work.
 &HT;    In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with
students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's
question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship.
 &HT;    He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's cutting of Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises,''
Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.
 &HT;    Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: ``It's
immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a
jot of difference who writes them.'' Then he paused. ``That's it.
That's it exactly,'' he said.

NEW DIVERSITY PROGRAM FOCUSES ON CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you eliminate bias?
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin with the children,'' says workplace diversity expert
Julie Baskin Brooks of New York-based QED Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   A former director of diversity at Xerox Corp. in Stamford,
Conn., Brooks came to this realization two years ago after her
7-year-old son was attacked by three fifth-grade boys who held a
pocketknife to his neck and declared, ``You're no good because
you're burnt.''
</P>
<P>
   Kameron Brooks is African-American. The boys who accosted him
are white.
</P>
<P>
   For Kameron, the experience was devastating. He withdrew from
his family; he became sad and angry; and his school work suffered.
Even more troubling, recalls Brooks, was the boy's declaration that
he hated himself. ``I'm tired of being invisible,'' he told his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a therapist, Brooks and her son got through a
difficult period, but the experience still troubled her.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced other parents and children could use help with racial
and diversity issues, Brooks approached Xerox about developing a
way to help change attitudes about race, gender, and other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   With a $68,000 contribution from Xerox, Brooks and Arlene
Tannenbaum of WFD Inc. of Brookline, Mass., a corporate work-life
services provider, created a diversity toolkit for children age 3
to 8 and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Who Am I? Who Are You? Raising Children In a Diverse
World,'' the kit includes an audio cassette tape of conversations
with parents, construction paper in shades similar to skin colors,
multicultural crayons that include white, brown, beige, burnt
sienna, and black, a list of books for children, and two workbooks
designed to help adults expand their children's horizons and their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, thousands of Xerox employees and nonprofit
organizations have used the toolkit. In January, the diversity
toolkit will be made available to companies served by WFD, which
has clients nationwide. Brooks says she also has received inquiries
from schools, churches, the Girl Scouts, and other groups
interested in promoting diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the package seems little more than a game. Take
a closer look and certain activities do more than entertain. In a
section called Questions to Ask Yourself, the authors urge parents
to take a close look at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions:
</P>
<P>
   _What kind of role model am I for my children? How do I respond
to a racist or biased remark. What do I say when someone else makes
a thoughtless or demeaning remark about my own background?
</P>
<P>
   _Do I show a positive attitude toward people who are different
from me? Do I invite them home?
</P>
<P>
   _Have I made assumptions about an entire group of people based
on my experience with one person from that particular group?
</P>
<P>
   While racial and gender biases readily come to mind when
thinking about diversity in the workplace, Brooks wanted children
to understand that differences are more complex and include
education, style, language, the way you carry and express yourself,
your height, weight, beliefs, and values.
</P>
<P>
   With those differences in mind, the toolkit offers several
activities for engaging children. Among them: construction of a
family heritage album that encourages children to talk to various
family members about their lives and work experiences; creating a
costume box with props that permit children to be someone else; and
a recipe for ``people cookies'' _ homemade gingerbread cookies
fashioned with a dough that ``lets your children make cookies that
look more like real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun, but can a workbook, a cassette tape, and a few
games really make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum believes they can. ``Some people may see this as a
tangential or back-door way of getting into the issue, but in order
to work with children you really have to examine yourself,'' she
says. ``Sometimes people are willing to take a harder look at
themselves because of their love for their children than they would
if the employer said, `You've got to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Brooks: ``When I learned what had happened to my son, I was
appalled. And yet, I did not want him to see how upset I was. I
said to him, `We will figure out how to fix this.' I also told him
that I needed him to be very honest about his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have very easily encouraged my son to be violent, but
I did not want to send that message. There was a lot of therapy and
the message to Kameron was that there are many, many different
people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Will adults get the message?
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults who will get it are the ones who are sensitive and
want to send the right message to their children,'' concedes
Brooks. ``The others won't. But that's OK. Some people cannot be
saved. So, if the kit makes a difference to one child and one
adult, it will be worth it.''

 &HT;    
 By MICHAEL MASSING  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,000 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Don't let Rudolph Giuliani fool you: Methadone works. Since its
introduction in the mid-1960s, studies have consistently shown that
the synthetic narcotic cuts addicts' craving for heroin, enabling
onetime street junkies to restart their lives. In so doing,
methadone helps boost employment, inhibit the spread of HIV and cut
crime.
 &HT;    That's why the New York City mayor's recent attacks _ he
denounced methadone as a chemical that's used to enslave people and
promised to abolish it from the city over the next few years _ have
left experts scratching their heads.
 &HT;    The mayor appears driven by a moral conviction that complete
abstinence from drugs is the only acceptable course. Yet if
Giuliani were truly interested in promoting abstinence from drugs,
he would have not simply condemned methadone but also announced a
major expansion of treatment programs whose express goal is to wean
addicts from the substance. (The city has virtually no such
programs now.)
 &HT;    He would also have announced the creation of more residential
programs that seek to change addicts' behavior. The mayor's failure
to do any of this raises the suspicion that it is not just
methadone he dislikes _ but drug treatment in general.
 &HT;    In this respect, Giuliani reflects a national mood. For nearly
20 years, the United States has waged a relentless war on drugs,
with treatment discounted as a weak weapon. Instead, the government
has sent spy planes swooshing over the Caribbean, built a
paramilitary base in Peru, mounted coca-eradication programs in
Bolivia _ and invaded Panama.
 &HT;    On the home front, narcotics agents have infiltrated hundreds of
drug gangs and busted countless drug dealers. In 1996, more than
1.5 million people were arrested for drug offenses. The nation's
prisons, which in 1980 housed fewer than 30,000 drug offenders,
today harbor nearly 300,000.
 &HT;    But this punitive approach has failed. Cocaine is cheaper than
ever, and heroin is selling at purity levels three times greater
than those of the mid-1980s. And drug abuse remains rampant. In
1996, the number of cocaine-related visits to hospital emergency
rooms topped 144,000, an all-time high. This despite an increase in
the federal antidrug budget from $1 billion in 1981 to $16 billion
in 1998.
 &HT;    Looking at numbers like these, it may seem as if the nation's
drug problem is all but intractable. But it isn't. Our penchant for
punishment has blinded us to the most effective strategy for
combating drug use: offering comprehensive treatment to every
addict who requests it.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the case for expanding our commitment to
treatment programs frequently gets drowned out by more extreme
voices. Law-and-order types such as Giuliani call for ever more
police dragnets and undercover investigations.
 &HT;    On the opposing side, reformers push for drastic measures such
as drug legalization. Legalize drugs, they say, and the vast
criminal networks that traffic in them will disappear _ much like
the repeal of Prohibition led to the demise of speak-easies and
bathtub gin.
 &HT;    The end of Prohibition, however, also led to a sharp rise in
alcohol use. Between 1934 and 1944, per capita consumption in the
United States rose from 0.97 gallons to 2.07 gallons. (Today it is
2.25 gallons.) If illicit drugs were suddenly legalized, might not
consumption similarly rise?
 &HT;    By now, the risks of legalization have become so evident that
many onetime advocates have flocked to a new standard: harm
reduction. Drugs, it is argued, are here to stay, and society needs
to learn how to live with them. Our goal should be to reduce the
harm that drugs cause. To that end, they advocate a variety of
reforms, such as expanding needle-exchange programs and creating
safe injection rooms as alternatives to shooting galleries.
 &HT;    Some of these ideas clearly make sense. Needle-exchange
programs, for one, have been shown to reduce the transmission of
HIV. Yet harm reduction has serious limitations. For the most part,
it does not seek to get people off drugs but merely to help them
use drugs more safely. To express disapproval of addiction would,
in the harm reductionists' view, reinforce society's intolerance of
drug addicts.
 &HT;    While promoting tolerance is admirable, the harm reductionists
take it too far: If you should not stigmatize addicts, neither
should you condone addiction. And with its learn-to-live-with-drugs
approach, harm reduction offers no guidance on how to bring down
the appallingly high levels of drug addiction in this country.
 &HT;    Harm reduction does, at least, acknowledge one key fact: Helping
chronic users should be the target of drug policy. Washington
doesn't understand this. From recent actions in the nation's
capital _ such as Congress' decision to earmark $1 billion for
antidrug advertising aimed at teen-agers _ you might logically
conclude that the threat drugs pose to the nation consists mainly
of adolescent use.
 &HT;    In fact, teen-age drug use, while up some in recent years,
remains well below the peak levels of the late 1970s. What's more,
most of that increase consists of marijuana use. And while pot is
not harmless, and young people should be discouraged from using it,
it is not the problem heroin and cocaine are.
 &HT;    In contrast to teen-age pot smokers, adults who regularly use
heroin, cocaine and crack do pose problems: They commit muggings,
abuse children, suffer overdoses and spread disease. In all, there
are an estimated 3.6 million hard-core users in the United States.
While these addicts constitute only 20 percent of all drug users in
the country (most of the rest being casual, occasional users), they
consume about three-fourths of all the cocaine and heroin used
here.
 &HT;    Who are these problem users? Contrary to the many media accounts
of strung-out stockbrokers and models, addicts tend to be found not
in posh condominiums or suburban split-levels but in the housing
projects of urban America. Heavy users are disproportionately poor,
unemployed and members of minority groups. No headway can be made
in alleviating the nation's drug problem without finding a way to
get such users off drugs.
 &HT;    A good place to begin is suggested by a 1994 RAND study. The
researchers C. Peter Rydell and Susan Everingham set out to compare
the effectiveness of four types of drug-control programs:
source-country efforts (attacking drug production abroad),
interdiction (seizing drugs in transit to the United States),
domestic law enforcement (arresting and incarcerating sellers and
buyers) and drug treatment.
 &HT;    How much additional money, they asked, would the government have
to spend on each approach to reduce national cocaine consumption by
1 percent? Rydell and Everingham developed a model of the national
cocaine market, then fed into it more than 70 variables, from
seizure data to survey responses.
 &HT;    They were amazed at the results. Relying solely on domestic law
enforcement, the government would have to spend an additional $246
million to reduce U.S. cocaine consumption by 1 percent. Relying on
interdiction, it would have to spend $366 million, and on
source-country programs, a whopping $783 million. Relying solely on
drug treatment, however, the government would have to spend just
$34 million more.
 &HT;    In other words, treatment was 7 times more cost effective than
domestic law enforcement, 10 times more effective than interdiction
and 23 times more effective than attacking drugs at their source.
 &HT;    Such results contradict the conventional wisdom that treatment
does not work. Many Americans know of someone who entered a program
and did well while in it, only to relapse afterward. Nevertheless,
failed treatments do not cost very much and so do not dilute the
cost-effectiveness of treatment overall. More important, study
after study has demonstrated the efficacy of treatment.
 &HT;    In one recent analysis, the government tracked the performance
of 4,400 clients who entered treatment between July 1993 and
October 1995. Those clients were interviewed at the time they began
treatment, at the time they finished and a year later; the accuracy
of their responses was checked by random drug tests.
 &HT;    Seeking to study the most severe cases, the researchers
concentrated on programs serving people in public housing, on
welfare and in the criminal-justice system. The number of clients
saying they used crack dropped from 39.5 percent prior to treatment
to 17.8 percent a year later; for heroin, the number went from 23.6
percent to 12.6 percent. All told, drug consumption decreased by
roughly 50 percent.
 &HT;    Well, skeptics will say, treatment might be effective for
addicts who receive it, but how many really want it? Junkies, it's
commonly believed, simply do not want help. And to an extent,
that's true. Drugs not only impart intense pleasure but also
provide great comfort to people coping with various crises in their
lives.
 &HT;    Yet for many, the point eventually comes when the drugs
themselves begin to cause problems, from physical ailments to
family quarrels to legal troubles. And when that happens, addicts
are often open to help. That openness, however, is usually quite
fleeting, and unless it is exploited immediately, most will end up
back on the streets.
 &HT;    The current drug czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, is a retired
four-star general who before taking office had no experience with
drug treatment, and while he has frequently acknowledged the
importance of treatment, he has made this a low priority. And so
the treatment gap persists.
 &HT;    That a focus on treatment can work is apparent from the one time
it was actually tried _ during the Nixon administration. A staunch
advocate of law and order, Nixon deferred to no one in his strident
pronouncements on drugs, but during the 1968 campaign he promised
to bring down the nation's crime rate, and once in office, he faced
the need to deliver.
 &HT;    At the time, the nation was in the throes of a raging heroin
epidemic. If something could be done to sap it, Nixon's advisers
believed, the crime wave might abate. One obvious approach was to
try to reduce the flow of heroin into the country.
 &HT;    At the time, the main conduit was the French Connection, a
5,000-mile pipeline originating in Turkish poppy fields and passing
through France. The Nixon administration began pressing the French
and Turkish governments to crack down on local drug trafficking.
 &HT;    But the more Nixon's drug officials looked into the problem, the
more they became convinced that reducing the supply of drugs would
prove futile unless something was also done to reduce the demand.
On that front, a new weapon was available: methadone. Early studies
showed that addicts maintained on methadone were much more likely
to hold jobs and far less likely to commit crimes.
 &HT;    At the time, methadone, like drug treatment in general, was
largely unavailable in most cities. An exception was Chicago, where
a young psychopharmacologist named Jerome Jaffe had set up a
network of treatment programs that was helping get addicts off the
streets. A central intake unit was opened in downtown Chicago, and
addicts appearing at it were assigned to the type of program they
needed _ detox, residential, methadone maintenance,
methadone-to-abstinence and so on.
 &HT;    Impressed, President Nixon announced in 1971 the creation of a
Drug Abuse Prevention office; to head it, he brought in Jaffe from
Chicago. Once in place, Jaffe found that about 30,000 people were
on treatment waiting lists; resolving this problem became his top
priority.
 &HT;    He faced resistance from many quarters, including Congress, the
bureaucracy and his fellow mental-health professionals, but Jaffe _
a brilliant if prickly iconoclast _ managed to outmaneuver them
all. By the fall of 1972, treatment was available to all those who
wanted it.
 &HT;    The impact was immediate. In New York City, the crime rate in
1972 dropped 18 percent, and in Washington, 26.9 percent.
Nationally, the crime rate fell by 3 percent, the first decline in
17 years. Declines were also recorded in the rate of
heroin-overdose deaths, hepatitis transmission and drug-related
hospital visits _ strong testimony to the efficacy of a national
treatment system.
 &HT;    Yet from the moment it was created, that system came under
attack. And so in the 1972 presidential campaign, Nixon began
shifting the focus back toward drug enforcement. During the Ford
and Carter years, the treatment budget suffered from the effects of
both inflation and neglect.
 &HT;    The real turning point came under Reagan. In his view, addicts
were morally responsible for their behavior and therefore
undeserving of government help. As Nancy Reagan toured the country,
urging Americans to just say no to drugs, her husband slashed the
funding for drug treatment and boosted it for drug enforcement.
 &HT;    By the time crack hit in the mid-1980s, the treatment system
Jaffe built had been gutted, and addicts _ showing up at clinics
desperate for help _ were regularly turned back onto the streets,
there to commit more crime.
 &HT;    It was not until the late 1980s that the federal government
finally began pumping more funds into treatment. In fact, the
nation's treatment budget is now larger than it was in the 1970's.
Sadly, our drug problem is larger as well, as long waiting lists
attest. It is time to follow the example of Jaffe and make
elimination of those lists a top priority.
 &HT;    But how much would that cost? According to in-house calculations
by the drug czar's office, filling the nation's treatment gap would
require increasing the federal treatment budget by $3.4 billion a
year. Of the $16 billion Washington now spends to fight drugs,
$10.6 billion goes for supply reduction and $5.4 billion for demand
reduction.
 &HT;    If the overall budget was held constant but the allocation for
these two areas equalized at $8 billion, the demand side would
receive an additional $2.6 billion _ close to the sum in question.
But the Clinton administration _ worried about looking soft on
drugs _ seems little interested in making such a transfer.
 &HT;    By itself, of course, such a change would not solve the nation's
drug problem. Rooted as it is in low-income communities, that
problem is inseparable from the nation's other social ills, like
inadequate housing, poor schooling and unemployment.
 &HT;    Until these conditions are addressed, drug abuse will remain a
fixture of American life. But by following the public health
approach outlined here, Washington could reduce that problem to a
far more manageable scale. When it comes to drug policy, Americans
need not choose between their hearts and their heads; in this area,
compassion is itself cost effective. Clearly, the war on drugs is
not.

SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's spending on health care is expected to double over the
next decade to a whopping $2.1 trillion, straining both taxpayers
and companies that have to shoulder the tab, according to estimates
released by government actuaries Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Health care expenditures will also take up a greater portion of
the national economy, ballooning to 16.6 percent of gross domestic
product in 2007, from an estimated 13.7 percent this year, the US
Health Care Financing Administration projected in a study to be
published in this month's issue of Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The projections are the strongest indication to date that health
care spending could return to the double-digit increases seen in
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent cost drivers: consumer insistence on
access to more specialists; newer drugs and better medical
technology; a strong economy that is lifting both income and demand
for health care; and a tight labor market that forces employers to
offer generous health benefits to attract workers. The report also
cited the slowdown in the rush to managed care. With 85 percent of
the insured population already in managed care plans, much of the
savings from abandoning indemnity insurance have already been
realized.
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts, the news is a mixed blessing. The state's
employers and consumers will probably have to shell out more money
than ever for health care _ premiums, co-payments and deductibles
will all go up, the report projected. The added spending, however,
is expected to pump up the state's already substantial health care
sector, bringing more jobs to the state. About one in 10 workers in
Massachusetts is employed in health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of new jobs will be generated,'' said Paul Harrington,
economist with Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market
Studies. ``The question is, what will those jobs look like?''
</P>
<P>
   The study by HCFA, which oversees the federal Medicare program
for seniors, gave a few hints.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on hospital care will grow at a modest 3 percent a
year, the study said. With managed care and Medicare putting
pressure on hospitals to cut costs and send patients home sooner,
more care will be delivered in smaller clinics and at home. That
means physicians will be busier than ever with demand soaring 7.3
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs will also eat up a larger share of health
care costs. Though the study put annual increases in drug costs at
just under 10 percent for the next 10 years, many health care
specialists believe the increases are likely to be much higher as
pharmaceutical companies continue to crank out must-have drugs such
as Viagra and Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs are a key driver of costs,'' said Susan Connolly,
principal at William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm in
Boston. Connolly said some insurers are reporting up to 18 percent
annual increases for retiree drug costs and up to 14 percent for
those under 65.
</P>
<P>
   As dramatic as HCFA's projections are, many believe that the
actual increase in health care spending could very well top
government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fairly conservative growth rates,'' said Stuart H.
Altman, professor of national health policy at the Heller Graduate
School at Brandeis University. ``The actual growths could be
substantially higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman said current political pressure to ease the restraints of
managed care could result in unfettered health care spending. ``The
more we reduce the power of managed care to control spending by
restricting services, the more we are going to take the pressure of
providers to constrain spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Altman also pointed out that the report, which projects to the
year 2007, does not include years that are likely to see the
biggest increases in health care spending, the period after 2010,
when millions of so-called Baby Boomers start hitting 65. ``The
really big growth is yet to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the HCFA report cited several factors that will
help cool spending, including efforts by US Congress in 1997 to
trim Medicare reimbursements.

HURRICANES FORMING, BUT NO SERIOUS THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're 2-0, which in years past would have meant an automatic
Top 25 berth.
</P>
<P>
   But these are different times, and the Big East is no longer
Miami's private playpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes barely have gotten a sniff in the polls, but that
could change if they beat Virginia Tech _ something Miami has not
done in Butch Davis's three-year tenure _ in the Orange Bowl
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Hurricanes back to the form that won them four national
championships between 1983 and '91? Of course not. They may never
get to that level again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer,'' said Davis. ``But we still have only 10
seniors, and only four of them play.''
</P>
<P>
   To be an elite team, according to Davis, you need a nucleus of
at least twice that many seniors. But the Hurricanes, still feeling
the affects of NCAA probation, are not even at full scholarship
level; they have only 75, 10 below the NCAA maximum.
</P>
<P>
   How close is Miami to contending for national honors?
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years away,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks should be this season's first litmus test.
With back-to-back home games against unbeaten Virginia Tech and
unbeaten UCLA, Davis knows that if Miami is 4-0 at the end of
September, his goal of getting the Hurricanes back into bowl
consideration will be halfway achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer naturally had words of praise
for the 'Canes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real close to that dominating stage,'' he said.

   Boston College coach Tom O'Brien continues to preach caution
despite the Eagles' 2-0 record and two upcoming games against
winless teams, starting with Temple Saturday. ``They're an option
team,'' said O'Brien. ``We've not been a great defender of that
since I've been here. Our mission is to keep getting better each
week.'' ... Ask Pittsburgh coach Walt Harris the problems he'll
face against longtime rival Penn State this week and he minces no
words: ``Size, speed, and strength. That's about it.'' ... Syracuse
coach Paul Pasqualoni on the continuing development of quarterback
Donovan McNabb: ``There's improvement every week, there's
improvement every year. It's not like he's tapped out. If this
continues, there is no question in my mind, he's the best
quarterback in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Numbers do lie
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Go figure: Virginia Tech quarterback Al Clark was only 4 of 20
at the end of the first half in Saturday's game against Clemson,
yet the Hokies had a 34-0 lead. The 37-0 final marked the first
time Clemson had been shut out at home since 1979 ... With 104
points, Miami has tied the school's two-game record ... With 60
career touchdown passes, McNabb is one pass short of tying the Big
East record held by former BC quarterback Glenn Foley ...
Syracuse's 38-28 win over Michigan was its first road victory over
a ranked team since a 20-9 win over No. 20 North Carolina State
Sept. 2, 1995 ... Temple may be 0-2, but the Owls are not having
trouble running the ball. With 597 yards in two games, the Owls are
No. 4 in the country in rushing ... Virginia Tech has allowed only
3 points in two games, its best effort since 1927. The Hokies lead
the nation in scoing defense ... With three nonconference wins
Saturday, the Big East matched its best day since Sept. 10, 1994
... Clemson may want to think again before putting Big East teams
on its schedule. The last two times, the Tigers have been
outscored, 98-0 ... If BC beats Temple, the Eagles will be off to
their best start since 1992, when they began 7-0-1 ... Syracuse,
which meets Rutgers Saturday, has outscored the Scarlet Knights,
92-3, in the last two meetings ... Before the season, Temple fans
looked at a schedule that began with Toledo, Akron, BC, Maryland,
and William &AMP; Mary, and considered them all winnable games. But the
Owls are 0-2 and it is conceivable that they could be 0-5, which is
why Saturday's game against BC has become vital.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,800 words) available on request  
 &HT;    For some time now, the Nike swoosh has been showing up in the
oddest of places, dropped like an inadvertent product plug amid the
news of the day.
 &HT;    Just before 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult swallowed a
suicide brew last year, they laced up their new black Nikes for a
post-mortem chase of a spaceship they believed was trailing the
Hale-Bopp comet.
 &HT;    Benjamin Walker, a victim of the Springfield, Ore., school
shooting in May, was so heavily swooshed in T-shirt and cap in the
photo released by authorities that media outlets felt compelled to
crop him to a tight facial mug.
 &HT;    And then there's O.J. Simpson, the last athlete any company in
the world wants to endorse its product, recently seen wearing a
Nike cap.
 &HT;    Sports are the heart of American culture, says Philip H. Knight,
Nike chairman and co-founder. He has believed this ever since he
started peddling waffle-soled running shoes out of his car trunk
more than 30 years ago. He spoke then in a language understood only
by people who could run a mile in less than five minutes.
 &HT;    Now his company slogans are uttered by presidents and
schoolchildren the world over. By Nike's own research, the swoosh
brand is recognized by 97 percent of Americans, and every man,
woman and child in the United States spends an average of $20 a
year on the company's products.
 &HT;    But be careful what you wish for: The swoosh, never more
ubiquitous, is in turnaround. Having plastered the world with a
corporate icon rivaled perhaps only by Coca-Cola's cursive, Nike is
trying desperately to tone it down, hide it, possibly even lose it.
The week before an anxious annual shareholders meeting, Nike still
looks in the mirror and sees a sleek rebel, but others see a bully
with a beer gut.
 &HT;    ``You can make a lot of mistakes around here, but the brand is
sacred,'' says Knight. ``I messed that up.''
 &HT;    Knight is pacing inside the John McEnroe Building, the
intensive-care ward for the ailing swoosh and the center of power
inside the earthen berm at Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton,
Ore. He is a reddish-haired, somewhat bulge-eyed hypercompetitor;
at 60, he still runs regularly.
 &HT;    When sneakers became a cultural force more than a decade ago,
Knight was dubbed the most powerful man in sports. But he has been
angry much of this year, hearing his company described as the
symbol for everything that is wrong not only with sports but also
with global capitalism itself.
 &HT;    Knight checks in frequently with Gordon Thompson, the company's
lead designer. Thompson's current challenge is the biggest yet: how
to persuade a new generation of consumers to latch onto a brand
trying to reinvent itself after two years of hard hits.
 &HT;    ``Hard to believe,'' says Thompson, showing a chart that
illustrates the evolution of the company logo. ``But the swoosh has
been a stand-alone logo for only four years. We were growing and
growing and growing here in Beaverton, and I guess we didn't
totally realize what happened to this thing that was supposed to be
just a sports logo.''
 &HT;    On new shoes, Thompson has started to shrink the icon down to
just a wisp of a swoosh, barely visible. ``The question we've been
asking ourselves a lot here,'' he says, is whether we should just
go ahead and take the swoosh off. That's been a pretty hefty
debate.''
 &HT;    Just a year ago, on Nike's 25th birthday, coming off the best
financial 12 months in the company's history, there was no hint of
a future without the swoosh. Its fate, the company said, was linked
to the march of sports into every corner of the planet.
 &HT;    ``The 'swooshification of the world' should more appropriately
be deemed the Sportsification of the world,'' Nike officials wrote
in the company's annual report for 1997. ``We will mature in tandem
with the inexorable penetration of sports into the global psyche.''
 &HT;    Brave words. But, as it turns out, the swoosh and sports do not
always move in tandem. Profits at Nike, the world's leading
athletic-shoe-and-apparel maker, plunged 49 percent this fiscal
year, despite record sales of $9.6 billion. More and more Nikes are
being sold by discounters, lowering the profit margin.
 &HT;    The stock price has dropped more than 50 percent this year from
highs of a year before. Two months ago, Nike reported its first
quarterly loss in 13 years, prompting the largest layoffs in
company history and a teary apology from Knight.
 &HT;    Nike still sells more than 160 million pairs of athletic shoes a
year, and nearly one out of every two pairs in the United States.
But the company had pegged its future growth to Asia, where Nike is
one of the most visible American victims of the ongoing economic
crisis.
 &HT;    Worldwide, Nike has about one-third of the total market for
athletic shoes. Its nearest competitors, Adidas and Reebok, are far
behind in the United States and abroad, but Adidas is gaining
ground. And with Michael Jordan, Nike's franchise player, bound for
retirement either this year or next, the company has yet to
discover, or manufacture, anyone even close to him.
 &HT;    Those are just a few of Nike's problems. Purists say that the
company has corrupted sport. Critics of Nike's overseas factories
abound, citing the more than 500,000 workers who often earn about
$1.50 a day. Some of these critics peg Nike's current woes to their
own efforts to tarnish the swoosh _ or the swooshsticka, as the
more rabid Nike-haters call it.
 &HT;    ``We figured out two years ago that the only way to make our
campaign against Nike's labor practices work was to try to make the
swoosh uncool,'' says Medea Benjamin, co-director of Global
Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights group.
 &HT;    From Day 1, Nike has insisted it is a company for athletes. But
the greatest secret of the sports-footwear-and-apparel business is
that most of the product is bought by people who may want to be
like Mike or Ken Griffey Jr. or the Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo,
but seldom leave the couch.
 &HT;    ``The reason the basketball shoes have worked so well is because
80 percent of the people who buy them never set foot on a
basketball court _ it's a fashion statement,'' says Vince Francom,
a footwear-industry analyst in Seattle. ``The problem with fashion
is that tastes change very quickly. There's a big backlash against
Nike under way. The skateboard generation doesn't want to wear
Nikes because their fathers wear them.''
 &HT;    And it is the swoosh that has become emblematic of all of Nike's
troubles: a fashion statement losing its edge; a sports pyramid
that starts with cheap day labor and ends with poor kids trying to
pony up $140 for the shoes, and the lost innocence of young
athletes.
 &HT;    Knight and his closest executives have heard so much criticism
that they have started to parody it. They've hung anti-Nike
cartoons all over their walls and filled their annual report with
consumers' hate mail. So the inside question is not whether the
swoosh has gotten Nike in trouble, but how quickly to act.
 &HT;    ``We're a company founded by distance runners _ some of them
pretty slow _ so we have a certain amount of patience,'' wrote
Knight in his most recent letter to shareholders. ``Nonetheless, we
prefer to be timed by a stopwatch, not a calendar.''
 &HT;    Inside Nike's main laboratory in the Michael Jordan Building,
product developers are finishing a shoe modeled after a goat's hoof
_ the Goatster, they nicknamed it, designed to grip vertical rock
terrain. It's a niche-market shoe, of course, but who knows how
many eighth-graders might want to have the latest in extreme-sport
fashions.
 &HT;    Nike is also preparing to sell snowboards, boots, hockey sticks
and golf equipment but has dropped a curious new baseball glove.
About one-third of the company's sales last year came from clothes,
gear, watches, eyewear and other products not worn on the foot. The
swoosh is no longer being cloned along with fresh product; instead,
new logos, with separate identities, are sprouting forth.
 &HT;    A new line of Michael Jordan shoes will soon march out of the
factories, carrying the Jordan ``Jumpman'' logo. (For the recent
fiscal year, every major category of Nike footwear sold in America
suffered a decline in sales, except one _ the Jordan brand, which
increased 57 percent.) An Alpha line of shoes and clothing, vaguely
defined as ``innovative,'' will be unveiled later this year,
carrying a new logo _ five dots, a sort of elongated ellipsis.
 &HT;    Everything, it seems, is in play. Nike's most famous slogan,
``Just Do It,'' disappeared for a time this year after a
decade-long run. As it turns out, women did not take to the
admonition quite as enthusiastically as men. ``I Can'' worked
better with women, but it also sounded something like a Special
Olympics plug, and didn't go over so well with men.
 &HT;    ``The saying 'I can' sounds so weak!'' one man wrote to Nike
this year. ``And I ain't weak.'' Just what is the company slogan
these days? ``We use them all,'' says Lee Weinstein, Nike's chief
spokesman.
 &HT;    At a time when other shoe companies are backing away from
endorsements, Nike is still building its roster. It now has more
than 3,000 athletes in the fold worldwide, including 72 percent of
the players in the National Basketball Association, 60 percent in
Major League Baseball and half the players in the National Football
League. More than 200 universities fly the flag of swoosh.
 &HT;    The multipierced illustrated man of basketball, Dennis Rodman,
was once a Nike guy, but the company revoked his swoosh. ``He's a
great player,'' Knight says, ``but he's crazy.''
 &HT;    Shaquille O'Neal, the telegenic center with the high-wattage
smile, showed up a few years ago at the Nike campus for a
get-acquainted session _ swathed in Reebok gear. Things went
downhill from there.
 &HT;    Knight likes winners, of course, but rebels are closest to his
heart. The NBA tried to ban the first Air Jordans (they weren't
considered regulation sneakers), much to the delight of Knight.
There was cheering inside the John McEnroe Building when Casey
Martin, the disabled golfer whose cause Knight took up when it
looked like a long shot, challenged the golf establishment and
became the first man to play the United States Open in a powered
cart.
 &HT;    ``What we are all about,'' Knight says, ``is being against the
establishment.'' Yes, but what happens when you are the
establishment, when the swoosh shows up in more country clubs than
asphalt alleys?
 &HT;    Nike's response has been to try new ways of ``branding.'' Nike,
of course, is not alone in this pursuit. The idea is simply to
create a connection between consumer and product, a link often
having nothing to do with what is actually being sold. Nike has
always tried to sell something more than leather and nylon,
promoting the swoosh as a personal statement.
 &HT;    But the retail world is littered with once-thriving brandings
that have ended badly. L.A. Gear, for example, was an upstart
sneaker company that rode the aerobics craze to dizzying heights,
then crashed when it tried to put its label on too many other
things.
 &HT;    But if the swoosh does not light up advertising focus groups the
way it used to, Nike has another icon that has yet to show a
downside: Jordan. Last June, in the midst of Nike's deepening
troubles, came the most glorious 59 seconds of the year for the
company.
 &HT;    Just when it was said that the greatest person ever to play the
game was past his pull date, the old man did it again. In Game 6 of
the NBA Finals, Nike's franchise player singlehandedly pulled off a
victory _ and the championship _ while wearing a pair of Air Jordan
XIV's, which retail for about $150. The shoe sailed out of stores.
 &HT;    Clinging to Jordan as long as possible, Nike may bring out a
line of Jordan casual shoes, following up with everything from
Jordan socks to suits. Nike executives figure that if Tommy
Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, neither of whom ever did anything
dramatic on a basketball court, can sell billions of dollars worth
of clothing, the world's best-known athlete can do the same, or
much better.
 &HT;    If Nike takes this step with Jordan, it would mark a huge leap
into relatively unfamiliar retail territory. The last time the
company tried such a thing, selling so-called ``brown shoes'' in
the mid-1980s, it was clobbered. Knight says the company learned
its lesson. Still, Jordan's name is so strong that Nike cannot seem
to resist what they see as his Midas touch.
 &HT;    Jordan, arguably the company's best asset, is planning to tour
the Nike factories in Asia, arguably the company's worst liability.
It was Jordan's idea, says Weinstein, the company spokesman. Jordan
has grown tired of all the questions about factory wages and says
he wants to see firsthand what the fuss is about.
 &HT;    Still, his tour is designed not so much to cheer up factory
hands in Hanoi as to connect with a particular brand of swoosh
consumers: females. The labor issue keeps coming up in focus groups
with girls as young as 12, Nike executives told me.
 &HT;    Knight has seen the future of his industry and it does not have
an Adam's apple. Twenty-five years ago, he says, only 1 in 30
school-age girls played sports; today it's 1 in 5. Nearly 40
percent of high-school athletes are girls. And so the Nike poster
athlete of the new millennium is a female American soccer player,
Mia Hamm.
 &HT;    I ran this name by many of my sports-loving friends, all of them
ESPN habitues, runners and soccer parents. We buy gear and
channel-surf with the best of them. Our reaction was the same: Who?
 &HT;    Then I asked my 11-year-old daughter about Mia Hamm, and she
looked at me as if I were as dumb as a fence post. With Hamm, Nike
has managed to go below adult radar, just as Tom Clarke alluded to
on our run.
 &HT;    Hamm is 26 years old, from Chapel Hill, N.C., winner of an
Olympic gold medal and a World Championship title. She is
beautiful. She can use a verb. She has the right hint of attitude.
And if enough people ever start watching women's soccer _ Nike is
heavily promoting next year's Women's World Cup, to be staged in
the United States _ she may be gold for the Beaverton sneaker
company.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't girls around the world say, 'I want to be like
Mia?''' asks Katherine Melchior Ray, the head of Nike women's
footwear.
 &HT;    At Nike, that refrain can sound like a prayer.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long Lindsay Davenport, US Open champion, walked the
walk.
</P>
<P>
   She gracefully stepped up onto the short wall around the
Unisphere just outside the National Tennis Center grounds and with
a half-dozen kids frolicking in the fountains behind her and a few
dozen photographers capturing the moment in front of her, she
walked this way, then that, on the wall _ showing her stuff.
</P>
<P>
   She raised high the silver cup that will now bear her name after
her straight-set win over Martina Hingis in Saturday's final. She
held it in front of her. She held it beside her. She kissed it. And
a rainbow formed behind her in the spray from the fountain.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the feel-good moments of the 1998 Open.
</P>
<P>
   There was the rise of Australian Mark Philippoussis, who in 1996
showed all kinds of promise in blasting Pete Sampras out of the
Australian Open and is now adding the rest of the game and mindset
to go with a biggest-in-the-major-leagues serve.
</P>
<P>
   There was the fun-loving Patrick Rafter, who defeated
Philippoussis in the final. Gotta like a mate who seemed to get
nearly as much a kick out of the Pearl Jam and Ben Harper concert
he attended Thursday night between his quarterfinal and semifinal
wins _ ``one of the best concerts I've ever been to'' _ as he did
his second Open title.
</P>
<P>
   There was the good-natured and refreshingly forthright Carlos
Moya. After losing in the semifinals to Philippoussis, Moya said
he'd better not comment on the officiating in the match, and
proceeded to do just that. First, he said, there really was no need
for a chair umpire since they never overruled anything; things
might as well be left in the hands of the linespeople. But then he
remembered one of the calls that got him going and seemed to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say, but the woman was a little bit old,'' Moya
said. ``You know, the ball was like 130 miles. How can she see that
ball?''
</P>
<P>
   There was Hingis, smiling still, coming back from her loss to
Davenport to team with Jana Novotna to beat Davenport and Natasha
Zvereva for the women's doubles title, finishing off a doubles
Grand Slam. Hingis teamed with Mirjana Lucic to win at the
Australian Open and then joined Novotna for wins at the French and
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   There was the balance in the world of tennis that this
tournament again demonstrated. With Rafter winning his second
consecutive title, there were four different men's winners of this
year's four majors _ the Australian Open won by Marcelo Rios, the
French by Moya, and Wimbledon by Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing on the women's side, with Hingis in the Australian,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the French, Novotna at Wimbledon, and
now Davenport. The win in Australia gave Hingis three straight
majors, and it looked as if she was ready to dominate. That hardly
seems likely this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must she contend with veterans Sanchez Vicario, Monica
Seles, and Steffi Graf, but there are Novotna, the Sister Williams,
and a host of others, especially Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   After getting back to the hotel Saturday, she reveled in her win
and the on-court festivities _ ``the stuff that happened on the
court, it's all a blur'' _ and caught about a half-hour for herself
before she and family and friends went out to celebrate her win and
her mother's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about what I had done, that I had accomplished the
goal I wanted to do,'' she said, ``you can't describe things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a goal she achieved against most bets. At 6 feet 3
inches, she was too lumbering, not fit enough, not athletic enough,
many tennis followers said. She made herself plenty fit. She covers
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, 22, blew Venus Williams, 18, off the court in the
semis. She blew Hingis, 18 later this month, off it in the finals.
She never lost so much as a set in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And while handlers arranged this television appearance and
turned down that one Sunday, she was being whisked around the
Tennis Center grounds on a golf cart, from this press conference to
that photo opportunity, the US Open champion.

<P>
   While deploring the loss of his own privacy this summer,
President Clinton set out boldly to invade mine. His administration
promised me a healthier life if I would accept assignment of a
computer code _ a number or thumb print or retina marker or other
electronic gizmo to be called a UHI, a unique health identifier.
</P>
<P>
   It would instantly disclose my medical record to anyone needing
to treat me anywhere, and also to those who labor to improve
medical science with research.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could even calculate the probable costs and benefits of
UHIs, shouts of protest forced the president to retreat. Americans,
it seems, fear snoops even more than they fear germs. Many, in
fact, responded as if their privacy were an absolute right,
guaranteed by the Constitution and not available for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights does indeed forbid ``unreasonable searches
and seizures'' of my person, home, papers and effects. But
society's increasing invasions of my privacy have taught me that
``reasonable'' is actually a term of taste, describing a shifting
community standard, such as permissible beach attire.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike freedom, which is inviolate, privacy has long been
treated by Americans as a possession that they can trade in the
marketplace. For example, we tolerate the intrusion of telephone
sales calls at dinnertime in exchange for the convenience of phone
service around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought a UHI was worth considering. As explained by Sheryl
Gay Stolberg in The New York Times, Congress ordered the creation
of a health identifier in 1996, as part of the law that allows
Americans to keep their medical insurance whenever they switch
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was supposed to devise a UHI plan by
February but did nothing until mid-July, when it scheduled public
hearings instead. Just one week later _ and freshly sensitized by
his president to issues of privacy _ Vice President Gore signaled a
retreat and tossed the matter back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of UHIs foresaw vast benefits. With my
identifier, I would always be given reliable diagnoses and be
consistently treated no matter how often I changed doctors or
hospitals; my medical ailments and idiosyncrasies would be
instantly accessible. My medical bills would be streamlined, saving
me money. And adding my records to a national database would
facilitate scientific studies to improve the health of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that the government would never properly
guard my records. Once they leaked, I would run the risk of higher
insurance premiums and possibly job discrimination. Even if
relatively healthy, I would be endlessly badgered by peddlers of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and assorted snake oils. I might grow so
fearful or angry that I would lie to my doctors just to keep my
file pristine.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadine Healy, the former director of the National Institutes
of Health, warned during the debate that government could not be
trusted with such ``sacred secrets'' as sexual practices,
impotence, abortion, depression, suicide attempts, abuse of alcohol
and drugs and a range of ``potentially prejudicial'' illnesses,
procedures and medications.
</P>
<P>
   And the vaunted national research, she said, would violate a
fundamental ethical principle: It would lack the informed consent
of its human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were grave enough to tempt me to join the
opposition. But then I reflected on the privacies we have already
traded or given away. I do not think of myself as a ``human
subject'' just because the census regularly records my existence,
types me by income and national origin and counts my children,
toilets and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It's an intrusion that mainly benefits commercial enterprises,
but I have always accepted it in exchange for my fair
representation in Congress, for the insight that social statistics
give into American life and for my share of federal subsidies. And
that is only one of the many ways in which I exchange privacy for
some larger benefit.
</P>
<P>
   I have long possessed a unique number to qualify eventually for
Social Security payments. That number now doubles as my Medicare
ID, and Medicare, of course, vigorously logs all my late-life
illnesses and infirmities. The same number links all my income-tax
returns and bank accounts, including one that compiles an
electronic record as it pays my bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several more numbers unique to me record my charge-card
transactions, including meals eaten in and out, movies rented or
attended and cash withdrawn, even in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   I value privacy. I once renounced the purchase of a desirable
apartment because I would not let the co-op board members keep
copies of my tax returns. But I have since claimed the right to
inspect the tax returns of political candidates and think it only
fair that my alma mater inspects the tax returns of families
applying for student financial aid. Thus does privacy often yield
to decency, or expediency.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of children, I no longer object to disclosure of
a nanny's criminal record. To obtain sizable discounts, I no longer
resent registering my medications in the computers of pharmacists
and drug manufacturers. For obviously good reasons, I announce all
my trips away from home with my newspaper deliverer, elevator
operator and building superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   For the convenience of a Visa card, I tolerate the disclosure of
my buying habits to countless merchants who sell and resell my
profile and clog my mailbox with catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   When I can, I resist new computer-age incursions until the
benefit outweighs the cost. But that makes my privacy less a fixed
right than a fluid commodity, more a matter of taste, commerce and
custom than of principle. Americans are obviously not ready to
trade their health records for vague promises of better care, but
as the medical advantages accrue, and insurers make it worth our
while, we will, and should, cut a deal.

</P>
<P>
   Several more numbers unique to me record my charge-card
transactions, including meals eaten in and out, movies rented or
attended and cash withdrawn, even in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   I value privacy. I once renounced the purchase of a desirable
apartment because I would not let the co-op board members keep
copies of my tax returns. But I have since claimed the right to
inspect the tax returns of political candidates and think it only
fair that my alma mater inspects the tax returns of families
applying for student financial aid. Thus does privacy often yield
to decency, or expediency.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of children, I no longer object to disclosure of
a nanny's criminal record. To obtain sizable discounts, I no longer
resent registering my medications in the computers of pharmacists
and drug manufacturers. For obviously good reasons, I announce all
my trips away from home with my newspaper deliverer, elevator
operator and building superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   For the convenience of a Visa card, I tolerate the disclosure of
my buying habits to countless merchants who sell and resell my
profile and clog my mailbox with catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   When I can, I resist new computer-age incursions until the
benefit outweighs the cost. But that makes my privacy less a fixed
right than a fluid commodity, more a matter of taste, commerce and
custom than of principle. Americans are obviously not ready to
trade their health records for vague promises of better care, but
as the medical advantages accrue, and insurers make it worth our
while, we will, and should, cut a deal.

NEW O'BRIEN BOOK TACKLES LOVE OBSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you approach Tim O'Brien's ``Tomcat in Love'' with an open
mind, with no preconceived notions, you're likely to rave about the
book.
</P>
<P>
   But if you come in with any kind of moral baggage, built up over
years of seeing people at their best and worst, ``Tomcat in Love''
may give you some problems. O'Brien knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomcat in Love'' (Broadway Books, New York, $26, 347 pages),
the seventh book by the author of ``Going After Cacciato'' and ``In
the Lake of the Woods,'' is the story of a self-deluding,
skirt-chasing, revenge-obsessed professor of language who wallows
from one love-starved episode to another. Sometimes he's funny.
Sometimes he's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say he's the kind of guy I'd want to have dinner
with,'' O'Brien said in a telephone interview from Cambridge, Mass.
``It's like going to a cocktail party and coming home to tell your
wife, `I can't believe the guy I met at this party _ he was
hair-splitting, equivocating, bombastic. I didn't like him, but I
was fascinated by him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The character, Thomas A. Chippering, grew out of O'Brien's
attempt to write a memoir about his Minnesota childhood. ``I
thought I was writing a nonfiction piece,'' he said. ``I was trying
to be faithful to the facts, to the dialogues. But the farther I
got into it, I had to resign myself to the fact I was writing
another novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Chippering, owning up to an age of 49, maybe more, is a tall,
raw-boned Abe Lincoln look-alike who fancies himself the pudding of
life for any woman half his age. He hits on them anywhere, any time
_ in a bar, in a shop, in the classroom _ while pushing away a
beautifully honest woman who's trying to give him the romantic life
he keeps saying he wants.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien didn't start out seeing himself in Chippering. ``He was
a totally separate character. But you work from your experience.
Certainly I like girls, and ... in the course of the novel, I felt
I became him.''
</P>
<P>
   With its narrative of a gentleman ranker on a lifelong spree,
there are bound to be comparisons between O'Brien's book and the
works of Elmore Leonard and Kingsley Amis. But O'Brien never gave
them a thought while he was pounding away, any more than he
anticipated the Clintonesque saga you can read into ``Tomcat in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien started a nationwide book tour earlier this month _
``three months on the road, selling your own brand of snake oil.''
Before he's through, O'Brien expects to get plenty of questions
about President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and the women in between,
partly because there's a passage in the book that could have been
lifted verbatim from the post-confession dialogue surrounding
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It reads, ```Thomas, for God's sake,' she said forcefully, out
of the feminine nowhere, `just this once I wish you'd stop
justifying everything. Just one time in your wishy-washy life! ...
I mean, Jesus, you're like some fickle, randy old tomcat,' Mrs.
Kooshof was saying, loud enough to attract the attention of a buxom
young businesswoman across the aisle. (Jade eyes. Toshiba computer.
A come-hither upper carriage that had caught my eye back at the
boarding gate in Tampa.) `I'm serious, you should be neutered _ no
morals at all. Can't you at least apologize?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the presidential romances, O'Brien said, ``When I started
this book four years ago, none of this stuff was known. Chippering
is probably like Clinton, probably a lot like all of us. He craves
affection. He craves love. He'll tell little white lies for love.
He'll go to war for love. He'll do a lot of things for love, both
good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why he's sympathetic,'' O'Brien said. ``For all
his bravado, he has a hole in the side of him that he's trying to
fill up with love, wherever he can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Chippering argues that his craving for affection is
``like some horrid cancer ... the benign became malignant.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is love, not sex, he says, pointing out he's had
carnal knowledge of ``a paltry four women. (Or three. Depending.)''
On the other hand, Chippering lists 128 near misses, 212 love
letters and ``well over five hundred significant flirtations and
alliances and dalliances. (I keep books. I do a rigorous monthly
tally. The count counts.)''
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet the quantities never proved sufficient,'' he says. ``I
had to keep fueling the furnace, refilling the hole, topping off my
leaky love tank.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien chuckled, remembering Chippering's comeback to women who
claim he ``just doesn't get it'' _ ``Hey,'' the professor says. ``I
get plenty!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Chippering puts the moves on two hookers in a hotel bar,
only to wake up penniless in the pew of a plasticized church, it's
a bag of grins. But every scene like that is tempered by malevolent
ones like Chippering getting pantsed in front of his class, playing
the fool as a kids'-show host or walking around with Mason jars
filled with gasoline, threatening mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The book's beginning, with young Chippering and his friend,
Herbie, moving to crucify Herbie's sister, offers no hint that
``Tomcat in Love'' is supposed to be a knee-slapper. Chippering's
courting of Lorna Sue, prom queen in a houseful of weirdsmobiles,
is a mix of mock horror and high-school humor, and the professor's
studied revenge on Lorna Sue, her brother and her new lover _ built
on a lie of incest _ winds up being both ugly and grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomcat in Love'' also touches on Vietnam, in a tongue-in-cheek
search-and-destroy mission with Green Berets who leave Chippering,
a headquarters geek, alone in the jungle. Chippering finds them in
a dream villa on the edge of the paddies and calls an air strike
down on the position, leaving the Berets scorched and angry _
setting up later forays into Chippering's life that become, oddly,
some of the most moving moments in the book.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who served in Vietnam, has been labeled a Vietnam War
writer. ``But I think of myself more as a love writer than a war
writer. I use the war like other writers use the ocean ...
Everybody defines something that's singular and permanent in their
histories, and Vietnam was a huge part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going After Cacciato'' is filled with surprise passages of
almost-poetry _ ``Blue gunpowder haze produced musical sighs in the
gloom, a stirring at the base of Buddha's clay feet.'' So is ``In
the Lake of the Woods'' (``Tracer rounds corkscrewed through the
glare, and people were dying in long neat rows. The sunlight was in
his blood.'')
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer of those moments in ``Tomcat in Love,'' but the
book still has the O'Brien touch _ ``I am forever astonished at the
longevity of childhood. How it never ends. How we are what we were.
How turtles and engines and stolen kisses leave their jet trail
across our gaping lives.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an underlying heartbreak behind ``Tomcat in Love,''
O'Brien said. ``We're all blind to the bounties around us. That's
one blindness we all have. There's this incredible opportunity for
love and affection, and we can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there,'' he said. ``Most people have.''

   GATESVILLE, Texas _ On the northern reaches of Fort Hood, where
camouflage-painted trucks stir the Central Texas dust, a narrow
gravel road meanders off to a remote pasture that is studded with
hundreds of charred stumps from old prairie fires, budding new
mesquites and protected by a towering chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the fence lies the Comanche National Indian Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a cemetery specifically for Comanches, nor is it
administered by the federal government. It is a repository of
sorts, a place where the displaced bones of American Indians can be
returned to the ground with dignity and reverence. It is a place
for repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 105 repatriations,'' said Dortch Short, chairman
of the cemetery. ``We have Comanche, Kiowa, Tonkawa and
Coahuiltecan. We have some Wichita and Caddo scheduled to come in
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Short has been associated with the cemetery for six years. It
was established in 1991 and is operated through an agreement among
Fort Hood, The American Indian Resource and Education Coalition,
and the Comanche Tribe of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Short, 70, a retired Army sergeant major and former Fort Worth
resident, works as a volunteer for the Indian Coalition, based in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Smith, a staff archaeologist at Fort Hood, also works
with the cemetery. He said the military has been active for several
years in trying to preserve bones and artifacts found on the post
or those brought to federal property for disposition.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Army contacted individual tribes to take
possession of the remains, but only the Comanches had an active
cemetery committee to help. The tribe believed, however, that
because the Comanche remains at the fort were actually uncovered
there, they should be reburied there, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it was then that the Army decided to set aside 5
acres for the cemetery. The land is designated specifically for
repatriation of remains, and is not for new burials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cemetery is on ancient ground,'' Short said. ``There used
to be a Comanche village here.''
</P>
<P>
   When land owners or construction workers uncover remains on
their property, they often contact the fort and deliver the bones.
Smith conducts an analysis to determine at least a partial
identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, with donated remains, we do minimal analysis,''
Smith said. ``We determine how many people there are; sometimes we
just get bones in a box. We can get a ballpark age on them, we can
determine the sex. If we get other evidence or artifacts along with
the remains, it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Short complain that too many of the original
grave sites have been vandalized by souvenir seekers. They point
out that each tribe has its own burial ceremonies, characteristic
clothing, tools or rituals.
</P>
<P>
   When the artifacts are removed from a grave site, and only the
bones are left, it becomes nearly impossible to determine their
origin.
</P>
<P>
   There is one grave at the cemetery that contains the remains of
49 children. No one knows to what tribe they belonged. The cause of
death was never understood. It could have been a massacre, or a
sweeping illness.
</P>
<P>
   Without accompanying evidence or artifacts, no one can be
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas does not have a state law protecting burial grounds on
public or private land,'' Smith said. ``We have been trying to get
one through the Legislature for the past 10 years, but it never
makes it out of committee for a full vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, when remains can be identified as being from a
certain tribe, the tribe is contacted and given the responsibility
for reburial. The Army ensures that the cemetery is accessible and
that training does not disrupt the ceremony, but the tribe takes
care of the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Native Americans police themselves as to the activity,''
Smith said. ``The only restriction is that it must be a traditional
Native American ceremony. They decide who can and can't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Short and Smith enforce the policies of the tribes. No photos
can be taken of the graves, and no one is allowed to watch the
repatriations without approval of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a holy place,'' Short said. ``It is our job to honor
it.''

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ If there's an inexorable inertia in
political events, it's valid to say that President Clinton will
resign the presidency in six months to a year. Public opinion,
which up until a few weeks ago had been so favorable to him, is
moving slowly in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what could be expected, a majority of the citizens
have been curious and indifferent; they haven't condemned the
scandal. Instead, the fallen idol has been censured above all by
those who were his most loyal allies: the liberal press and the
Democratic Party's top brass.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's image and leadership capacity have been eroded more by
the fierce editorials of The New York Times _ which less than two
years ago came out for his reelection _ and by the moral warnings
of Sen. Kenneth Liberman, Clinton's friend of three decades, than
by the bloodhound's harassment of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's Sept. 3 address to the Senate deepened the general
feeling of shame among politicians. The fact that a U.S. president
is ``the distillation of the common people in one man'' _ but that
his sexual incontinence is the object of cruel jokes even in the
brothels of Quito and Karachi _ is more than can be tolerated by
the proud fathers and mothers who protect the ``American way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simmering down each time Clinton admits his relations
with Monica Lewinsky were inappropriate, the holy indignation of
the national leaders boils hotter each time. First, the president
wouldn't admit to an adultery that was clear to all; then he lied
under oath and tried to hide behind sophisms about sex; then he
wouldn't show remorse. Now, of course, we have the Starr report
with its lurid narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Finally cornered, Clinton assumes the image of a man who is
remorseful _ but only when his time has run out. It is almost the
same, with a shade of difference, as the hypocrisy that preceded
the fall of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, this American tragedy is met only by ironies
and puzzlement. Used to innumerable adulterous, womanizing
presidents _ some of whom have had an official wife for protocol
functions and an illegitimate one for domestic happiness _ Latin
Americans can't understand why a private affair is causing so many
public storms.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody forgets, of course, that falseness and perjury,
intolerable in any culture, are especially so in the American
culture. I spoke about it with a prominent businessman in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and the former president of a South American country
_ both of them respectable husbands and family men who would never
have a clandestine love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's position is so exalted and he's been told so many
times each day that he is ``the world's most powerful man,'' he
can't avoid a certain feeling of omnipotence, the ex-head of state
told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John F. Kennedy was almost a sex addict who had affairs in
the White House, and FDR had a secret love for 20 years, what's to
stop Clinton from thinking his historical image won't be as pure as
those predecessors'?'' the businessman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what should stop him?'' the ex-national leader
replied. ``The fact that this information is in everybody's hands
today. Four or six decades ago, governments could stop intimate
stories from being filtered to the media. Nothing can be hidden
these days. The press has been more tolerant of Clinton than is
commonly thought. It ignored the case of Gennifer Flowers, the
model; paid no credence to the accusations of Paula Jones. But
Monica Lewinsky's affair went beyond everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, you have to put yourself in the president's place:
Where is the adulterous husband who voluntarily confesses his love
adventures? And what man, when cornered, doesn't feel like telling
his lover to keep quiet?''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Clinton's sexual adventures are much less
scandalous than those of _ to cite one example _ the Venezuelan
dictator Juan Vicente Gomez, who passed away unmarried in December
1935, it is said, without ever having spent a whole night with one
woman. This wasn't an obstacle to his having two homes at the same
time and begetting seven sons with one woman and eight with
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentinean Juan Peron also had such leanings. In 1954, a
year and a half after he was widowed for the second time, Peron _
who was then 59 and attracted to junior high school girls _
developed a strong interest in a 14-year-old, Nelly Rivas. She
lived with him, playing with her dolls and listening to radio soap
operas, until the president was deposed in September 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, when I asked Peron in Madrid about that
episode, he answered with a phrase which afterward would become
commonplace among the strongmen of Latin America: ``Yes, I was
accused then of liking women too much. I don't see what's wrong
with that. It would be bad if I liked men.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Carlos Menem, the Argentinean president, repeated
that phrase, almost to the word.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Carlos Andres Perez,
the Brazilian Fernando Collor de Melo _ who used to turn off the
lights in his office when he was with one of his lady friends, to
warn his secretaries he did not want to be bothered _ they all had
erotic affairs that did not erode their popular ratings one bit
and, in fact, probably increased them.
</P>
<P>
   None of the womanizing leaders of Latin America owed political
decline to sexual incontinence. There were other reasons:
corruption, military putsches, ineffective policies. For them,
bedroom stories, as Clinton would like to say, were not an affair
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within current American culture, if the charges against
Clinton continue rolling down the same slanted plane, it's hard to
imagine how he will he able to avoid stepping down. Now, shortly
before the crucial elections for Congress, the democratic
candidates have turned their back on him in an open stampede. They
think the immense ridicule that has centered on the president, and
which has immeasurably affected the country, will spread by
contagion to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Every future news story and speech makes it worse. ``For he who
has committed a mistake, nothing is as terrible as hearing about it
again,'' said Pericles, in Shakespeare's play of the same name.
</P>

Novel'' and ``Santa Evita.'' He is chairman of the Latin American
studies department at Rutgers University and travels widely as an
editor and journalist.) &LR;

<P>
   ``If John F. Kennedy was almost a sex addict who had affairs in
the White House, and FDR had a secret love for 20 years, what's to
stop Clinton from thinking his historical image won't be as pure as
those predecessors'?'' the businessman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what should stop him?'' the ex-national leader
replied. ``The fact that this information is in everybody's hands
today. Four or six decades ago, governments could stop intimate
stories from being filtered to the media. Nothing can be hidden
these days. The press has been more tolerant of Clinton than is
commonly thought. It ignored the case of Gennifer Flowers, the
model; paid no credence to the accusations of Paula Jones. But
Monica Lewinsky's affair went beyond everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, you have to put yourself in the president's place:
Where is the adulterous husband who voluntarily confesses his love
adventures? And what man, when cornered, doesn't feel like telling
his lover to keep quiet?''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Clinton's sexual adventures are much less
scandalous than those of _ to cite one example _ the Venezuelan
dictator Juan Vicente Gomez, who passed away unmarried in December
1935, it is said, without ever having spent a whole night with one
woman. This wasn't an obstacle to his having two homes at the same
time and begetting seven sons with one woman and eight with
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentinean Juan Peron also had such leanings. In 1954, a
year and a half after he was widowed for the second time, Peron _
who was then 59 and attracted to junior high school girls _
developed a strong interest in a 14-year-old, Nelly Rivas. She
lived with him, playing with her dolls and listening to radio soap
operas, until the president was deposed in September 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, when I asked Peron in Madrid about that
episode, he answered with a phrase which afterward would become
commonplace among the strongmen of Latin America: ``Yes, I was
accused then of liking women too much. I don't see what's wrong
with that. It would be bad if I liked men.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Carlos Menem, the Argentinean president, repeated
that phrase, almost to the word.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Carlos Andres Perez,
the Brazilian Fernando Collor de Melo _ who used to turn off the
lights in his office when he was with one of his lady friends, to
warn his secretaries he did not want to be bothered _ they all had
erotic affairs that did not erode their popular ratings one bit
and, in fact, probably increased them.
</P>
<P>
   None of the womanizing leaders of Latin America owed political
decline to sexual incontinence. There were other reasons:
corruption, military putsches, ineffective policies. For them,
bedroom stories, as Clinton would like to say, were not an affair
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within current American culture, if the charges against
Clinton continue rolling down the same slanted plane, it's hard to
imagine how he will he able to avoid stepping down. Now, shortly
before the crucial elections for Congress, the democratic
candidates have turned their back on him in an open stampede. They
think the immense ridicule that has centered on the president, and
which has immeasurably affected the country, will spread by
contagion to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Every future news story and speech makes it worse. ``For he who
has committed a mistake, nothing is as terrible as hearing about it
again,'' said Pericles, in Shakespeare's play of the same name.
</P>

Novel'' and ``Santa Evita.'' He is chairman of the Latin American

NO NEED TO PANIC AS YEAR 2000 NEARS &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The year 2000 problem is a computer programmer's nightmare that
has spawned a community of survivalists convinced that bad software
will have apocalyptic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear is that computer programs unable to recognize the
year 2000 will paralyze the banking system, throwing our economy
into total havoc.
</P>
<P>
   They're entitled to their beliefs, but I don't see this as a
time to write a column for financial planning Armageddon-style.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some bread-and-butter issues raised by what is
better known as the Y2K issue.
</P>
<P>
   While bankers said they've got the situation under control, it
could pay to hold onto paper records of bank transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't hurt to carry some extra cash on New Year's Eve
1999 _ just in case your money machine fails you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Reserve Board plans to stock up on cash in
case nervous Americans want more of it in their pockets on the eve
of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that Americans might worry about whether credit
cards and automated teller machines will still work after the new
century dawns and want to be holding more cash just in case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOSING TRACK OF TIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem, also known as the ``Millennium Bug,'' is the
name given to problems with computer programs that use only the
last two digits of the year to keep track of dates. Most older
programs, which were written this way to reduce the amount of code,
are unable to distinguish between the current century and the
previous one.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem isn't fixed, it could cause chaos in all sectors
of the economy, especially in the technology-dependent financial
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about not being able to get your money
out,'' said Jerry Miller, president of Regcom in Geneva, Ill., a
bank consulting firm. ``It brings the highest level of panic and
fear into a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, which use computer systems for such tasks as financial
calculations, tracking deposits and loan payments, transferring
funds and making direct deposits, said they've long been working on
eliminating the Millennium Bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very diligently as part of our plan to make Year
2000 pretty much a non-event,'' said Eroy Wilkins, vice president
and manager of the Year 2000 Program office of Chase Bank of Texas.
``We're not going to be losing any records. We won't lose any
service at all with any of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said banks are more prepared than many other industries
for the Y2K bug because banking regulators have laid down a strict
schedule for bringing computer systems up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't foresee any major problems in the banking industry
with respect to anything that a bank can control,'' said Al
Watkins, a partner and banking attorney at Gardere Wynne Sewell &AMP;
Riggs in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are conducting periodic examinations to ensure that
banks are working on the problem and are also requiring banks to
work with their suppliers and other outside partners to ensure that
their systems link properly when 2000 comes around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KEEP RECORDS, JUST IN CASE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever had your bank records messed up, you probably
feel the need to be sure things will work right when 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Start keeping records of bank transactions made a few months
before Jan. 1, 2000. These records will help you resolve any
account errors that might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic that there will not be significant problems
for customers,'' said Janis Gogan, assistant professor of
accountancy at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., who teaches a
graduate course on Y2K projects. ``However, I would nevertheless
hang on to paper copies of bank statements, ATM slips, etc., in
order to easily reconstruct balances should systems fail and cause
erroneous data to show up on statements early in January 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the banks said they can't guarantee something won't go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too early for the prudent scholar or professional
to make any type of prediction on what can fail and what the impact
is,'' said Louis Barton, vice president and program director for
the Year 2000 at Frost Bank in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are even preparing plans in case of a breakdown in power
or telecommunications lines, said Sally Pope Davis, an analyst at
investment bank Goldman Sachs in New York, which recently held a
conference on the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the presenters at the conference emphasized that there
will be some failures post Jan. 1, 2000, and Electronic Data
Systems even applied a version of Murphy's Law: That which cannot
fail, will,'' Davis said in a report.

   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CALVADOS (St. Cyr de Ronceray, France) _ Normandy is so close to
Paris that wise guys sometimes call it the 21st Arrondissement.
Which no doubt explains why, in the old days, Normandy's Calvados,
or apple brandy, was the capital's favorite tipple. To a degree, it
still is _ not so much in the grand hotels and the restaurants
showered with stars, but in the bars, bistros and brasseries
frequented by ordinary folk. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-WARES (Undated) _ Kenneth Johnson, the chef at Terrace
Restaurant on the Upper West Side, uses pantyhose to strain
consomme. It may sound strange, but actually, he says, it works
better than cheesecloth. It is a clever little trick, but one of
many in the restaurant world. And some of them are useful in the
home, too. Chefs are always devising new ways to execute their
ideas: while being pressured to be original, time is at a premium
and so is money. So when conventional kitchen equipment can't
accomplish what they want it to do, they look for other ways to get
the job done. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   BONE-MARROW (New York) _ It's dinnertime at Judson Grill in
Midtown, and, typically, a good number of customers have ordered
the grilled dry-aged sirloin with rosti potatoes, bone marrow, pea
leaves and carrots. The marrow comes tucked into a section of bone
standing at attention alongside the steak, a tiny spoon at the
ready. I happen to love marrow, and can remember, as a child,
fighting with my mother over which one of us would get the marrow
when she made braised veal shanks. By Florence Fabricant.

   MANHATTAN-CHERRY (New York) _ The maraschino cherry is a
necessary evil in the world of cocktails. No one may actually want
to eat it, but what is a manhattan without one? Peter Hoffman, the
owner of Savoy restaurant in SoHo, decided to find out. He served
manhattans without cherries. Then he tried reconstituted dried

are not necessarily perjury, the White House plans to name new
attorneys Tuesday to the team that is coordinating the response and
dealing with Congress. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JURY _ WASHINGTON _ Did the grand jury that heard
testimony on President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
have any role in what went in or was left out of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress? Will the grand jury be
the one that ultimately decides what, if anything, is sufficient to
indict Clinton? What is the grand jury's role now? (Malone, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JUDICIARY _ WASHINGTON _ The Judiciary Committee that
will conduct any impeachment hearings is composed of diverse
factions likely to go in many different directions once the
questioning begins. We handicap the committee, looking at who will
likely to be the defenders to the end, the harshest critics and
those in between. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GADELEGATION _ WASHINGTON _ Now that Congress has had a
chance to read the Starr report, what are the members of the
Georgia delegation saying and what are their constituents telling
them. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   FLAFIRES _ Florida's wildfire crisis may have been extinguished
two months ago, but some areas are still suffering the lingering
impact. Daytona Beach just closed out its normally busy summer
season with a disappointing Labor Day weekend that was hampered by
cloudy skies. Many merchants say the dismal business climate has
never recovered since the fires caused the wholesale cancellation
of the July 4 weekend, normally the summer's busiest. Some hope the

   UT-MINORITIES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas, trying
to build a diverse student body without affirmative action,
enrolled slightly more black and Hispanic freshmen this fall,
indicating that a law requiring state colleges to admit freshmen in
the top 10 percent of their high school class could be helping.
What is clear at UT is that a higher percentage of black and
Hispanic freshmen came from the ranks of the top 10 percent than
those enrolled in the past two years. (Roser, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

PET OWNERS CONSIDER IMPLANTS FOR THEIR NEUTERED ANIMALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it came time to have her pooch neutered, Glenda Nelson
decided to give him a couple of extra ``treats.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the chow lost his, er, doghood, he gained a set of
canine testicular implants known as Neuticles so he could still
feel intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels better about himself (with the implants),''
Nelson says. ``Animals are like people in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of implanting fake testicles in a pet sounds like
something the characters on ``Seinfeld'' might joke about.
</P>
<P>
   But the product is drawing qualified praise from animal-control
experts for soothing the qualms of some people _ usually men _ who
might otherwise be hesitant to neuter their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a guy thing,'' says Spring veterinarian Debra
Garrison, the owner of Treaschwig Veterinary Clinic. ``They feel
their dogs aren't masculine unless they have something hanging
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, more than 14,000 pairs of Neuticles
have been implanted in dogs and cats around the nation and in nine
foreign countries, says Gregg Miller, inventor of the product and
president of the Missouri-based company that makes them.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came up with the idea for the product after taking his
bloodhound, Buck, to the vet to be neutered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many dog owners, I hesitated at neutering Buck because
Buck would no longer be Buck,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Miller went ahead with the procedure but asked his veterinarian
if there was an implant so Buck could look the same afterward. The
vet said he had never heard of such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, Neuticles were born,'' Miller says. ``It's a
simple idea that has blossomed into a worldwide procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the jelly-bean-shaped implants are available in five sizes
_ to fit dogs ranging from Chihuahuas to Great Danes. They cost
from $25 to $32 a pair for the polypropylene version, which feels
like hard plastic, and $89 to $129 for a silicone pair, which has
the feel and texture of a Gummi bear.
</P>
<P>
   There are also miniature models for cats and extra-large models
for horses or bulls. Implanting the Neuticles occurs at the same
time the animal is neutered and adds only about two to three extra
minutes of surgical time, Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that the product is so close to the real thing
that the pet will not even know he's been neutered upon waking up
with a set of Neuticles, even though his sex drive will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People underestimate the intelligence of dogs. Common sense
will tell you the dog misses his testicles,'' Miller says. ``If
he's hungry, he wants to be fed. When he has a flea, he scratches.
Why wouldn't he miss a familiar body part?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lyn Johnson, a resident in companion animal behavior at
the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&AMP;M University, scoffs
at the notion that the pet would know what he's missing. She says
the testicular implant replacements are for cosmetic reasons only
and have no medical value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neuticles are definitely something for treating the owners and
not the pet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who raises and breeds Pembrook Welsh corgis, says she
would never consider Neuticles when neutering her dogs that are not
of breeding quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't care if I look between their hind legs and
see something there or not,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she concedes that a lot of men are hesitant to neuter their
pets because they identify with the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put themselves in the dog's place (and think): `How would
I feel if I did not look like I was intact?' '' she says. ``The
dogs truly don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the product encourages someone to neuter his pet, Johnson
sees nothing wrong with it. The Houston Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals agrees with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of animals die in Houston-area shelters every year
simply because people won't spay and neuter their pets,'' HSPCA
spokeswoman Stacy Fox says. ``If this will convince someone to
neuter their dog or cat and it doesn't harm the animal, then it
would be something we would certainly support.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Blessman, a veterinarian at Kings Crossing Animal Hospital
in Kingwood, found that in at least one case where a dog needed to
be neutered for medical reasons, his owner was relieved when she
mentioned Neuticles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made it easier for him to make the decision,'' Blessman
says. ``There's not a medical reason to do this, but I don't think
it hurts (the pet) in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 { years ago, Gene Pahnke had his German shepherd and
Labrador mixed-breed dog neutered and made a spur-of-the-moment
decision to have Neuticles implanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought was that it was for him psychologically.
But after I got him home and thought about it, I said, `Wow, that
was kind of dumb.' What is he going to know? He's a dog,'' Pahnke
says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dog has suffered no complications from the
Neuticles, Pahnke would not have them implanted if he had it to do
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pahnke has found that his decision to give his pet some
Neuticles has been a good conversation starter, although no one has
told him it was a silly thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Nelson, who won the Neuticles in a radio
contest two years ago, had no qualms about having had the procedure
performed on her chow named Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know the difference, and he still has big ideas
when other dogs come around,'' she says. &QL;

ARTIST TAKES A POPULIST APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  with 4 photos 
 
By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Stephen Keene deftly choreographs his movements. With
a rhythmic dip, dab, dab, dab, he makes identical brushstrokes on
each of 20 or 30 plywood panels lined up around him. Dip, stroke,
stroke, stroke, and a thicker brush with a different color of paint
fills in another part of the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the dips and dabs, strokes and sloshes coalesce into
a recognizable image _ a landscape, the corridors of Rice
University, a flower.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old artist from Brooklyn is a one-man assembly line.
He takes himself and his painting seriously, he asserts, but he
also wants it to be fun. Not only that, but Keene also wants to
dissolve distinctions between Art with a capital A and art that
everyone can understand and afford. Price tags range from $1 to
$20, but most cost $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to get a fresh idea of what art is, what an art
exhibit can be,'' Keene said. ``It's just what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene has set up shop inside the Rice University Art Gallery,
where he will paint and sell his work over the next five weeks. The
gallery is already crammed floor to ceiling and wall to wall with
some 2,000 paintings and painted objects he brought with him as
start-up inventory. They create a kind of maze; at its center, the
paint-splattered artist works on 20 or 30 panels simultaneously.
He's arranged buckets of acrylic and house paint, in colors from
yolk yellow to hot pink and black, on a tarp on the floor for easy,
one-swoop reach.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that by the time his residency ends in Houston on
Oct. 18, he will have produced _ and sold _ some 1,000 original
works of art. Because he works 10 hours a day, six days a week, and
churns out 40 to 60 paintings each day, can there be any doubt
he'll meet predictions?
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1957, Keene received his bachelor's degree in fine arts
from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1981, and his master's
degree from Yale three years later. He was once a more conventional
artist, spending a lot of time on a single landscape that might
sell for $400 _ until, as he tells it, he changed tactics primarily
to relieve his boredom.
</P>
<P>
   His friends are musicians, not visual artists. He's designed
numerous covers for CDs, and, until recently, he held his
exhibitions in rock clubs and performance spaces, not art venues.
His exhibition last fall at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia
was his first in a formal academic setting. It sparked a flurry of
publicity, including a one-page feature in Time magazine, with
everyone taking sides _ roughly, delighted buyers on one side,
outraged professors on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He's been called everything from cynical and mean-spirited to
the Johnny Appleseed of art. Keene shrugs it all off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be provocative. I don't feel connected to
any kind of artwork or movement,'' he says. ``I feel like a baker
making cakes, making a good-quality object that's affordable to
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   There is neither pretense nor coyness in Keene's words and
attitude, just some welcome levity as he stands perfectly
camouflaged in paint-splattered T-shirt and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of this whole room as the work,'' he says, gesturing
at the painting-choked space, ``with the individual pieces as
souvenirs. I think of the paintings as props of a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an apt analogy. At Rice, with its glass-fronted gallery,
it's art as sideshow. So, what's wrong with that? Nothing, really.
Keene is skillful in his performance, and his populist attitude is
refreshing. But there is an important caveat. The viewer should
understand that there is a difference between Art _ a painting by
Diego Velazquez, say, with its enduring impact on eye and psyche _
and Keene's pictures and antics, which elicit a momentary smile.
</P>
<P>
   Keene doesn't argue with the principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the greatest art in the world,'' he says, ``it's just
my art.'' &QL;

STUTTERS FIND DEFECT NO REASON TO PAUSE IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Joy Emery has been married for 26 years. Only in
recent years was she able to say her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Emery, 59, stutters. And words that start with
``L'' or ``W'' _ like ``love,'' ``wedding'' and ``Wyman,'' the man
she married on July 14, 1972 _ are especially troublesome. Today,
after more than 50 years of therapy, frustration and fortitude,
Emery is finally speaking with a fluency she never imagined
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been brought up to think something is wrong with me,''
said the Clifton Park, N.Y., woman, who began stuttering at age 3.
``Even my family thought something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, studies show that the estimated 3 million Americans who
stutter do not suffer from nervous or personality disorders. They
are normal, except for their inability to speak fluently. The list
of notable people who stutter, past and present, confirms this:
Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, James Earl Jones, Carly Simon
and John Updike, who summed up the condition in his memoir,
``Self-Consciousness'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The defect arises, it would seem, from self-consciousness _ a
failure to let the intricate muscular events of speech be
sub-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons no one can explain, the problem usually goes away
when people sing, whisper, speak in chorus or do not hear their own
voice.
</P>
<P>
   If you've noticed that the above list is mostly men, you've
picked up another important fact: Stuttering affects four times as
many men as women. It has been around as long as the spoken word.
The effects can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go to parties,'' Emery said. ``I didn't feel like I
had any friends in school ... I didn't go to college because they
felt the stress of it was going to be too tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of study, stuttering is still one of the most
misunderstood disorders, usually affecting children between the
ages of two and seven as they learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say identifying the problem as early as possible is
important to treating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``An absolutely clean definition that fits everyone doesn't
exist,'' said Sister Charlene Bloom, who has made stuttering her
life's work at the College of St. Rose in Albany, where is a
professor of communications disorders and coordinates the Capital
District Council of Fluency, a weekly therapy session for people
who stutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex, multidimensional disorder. There isn't an easy
answer or an easy cause,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't kept researchers from trying to develop a cure based
on new evidence that stuttering may be caused by the part of our
brain that controls speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials are currently under way in California to test
the effectiveness of the drug Risperdal to reduce stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, the studies have to be long-term and
with a greater number of people before I say it's the treatment of
choice,'' said Charles Diggs, of the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment is speech therapy. People who stutter are
encouraged to try various strategies, from stuttering as much as
they can to controlling the way they breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming fluent has been a lifetime challenge for Dr. Robert
Brown, a retired Albany anesthesiologist and native of Scotland,
who practices at weekly meetings of the Capital District Council of
Fluency.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 74-year-old speaks with only occasional hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, I love going on a journey, a plane, a ship and
finding someone to talk to. In my earlier life, I never would have
done that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emery, too, said she's making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great deal more assertive now,'' she said. ``I can stand
up for myself now.''

SQUIRRELS DRIVE GARDENER NUTS &HT;

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Q. I would like to know how to keep squirrels from digging the
plants in my flowerpots. I have tried red pepper and black pepper,
and it doesn't keep them away.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.L.D., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A. &UR;  &LR; You might try dusting the area with garlic powder. But you
may need to resort to a physical barrier such as 1- to 2-inch wire
mesh placed on the soil or stretched across the top of the pot. You
will need to cut and secure the wire. You might also stretch strips
of a green-colored tape across the top of your pots. Leave spaces
for air and water. Perhaps it would help, too, to lure the
squirrels away from your containers by placing a dish of seed
elsewhere in the garden. Maybe other gardeners can share home
remedies that have worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am badly in need of advice as to what to plant in flower
beds that get lots of sun. I need plants that need little watering
as I use a cane and cannot move my hose constantly. It was
suggested to me that I use Mexican heather in the back of the
flower bed and use the purple wandering Jew (Tradescantia) as a
ground cover in the remaining space.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any other suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ P.M., Freeport &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A. This summer has certainly been a true test for plants that
will survive sunny, dry conditions. The two recommendations you
mention are among the toughest plants out there. I have seen them
live through total neglect. Freezing temperatures will take the
tops of both, so for a while following a cold winter you will have
bare spots. Mexican heather may or may not return from the roots,
but it does reseed to some extent. You may need to fill in with new
plants after a winter with several freezing spells. The
Tradescantia usually returns vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider an evergreen to use with these two plants.
Giant liriope is extremely durable. This is a larger version of the
liriope widely used to border walkways and flower beds. Giant
liriope is attractive in the landscape, can mature to at least 3
feet in height and form a large clump. It produces the purple
flowers as does the shorter version.
</P>
<P>
   Dwarf yaupon is a dense, compact globe that is also evergreen.
It, too, is tough, and would give your bed some texture as would
the giant liriope. Either or both would work well with the heather
and Tradescantia. Midsize nandina would also be a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   Purple coneflower is an excellent perennial that would mix well
in such a bed. These, too, go down in a freeze, but return in
spring. ``New Gold'' or ``Silver Mound'' lantana would be nice
perennial additions, too. The globelike blooms of purple or pink
gomphrena would work into the scene late spring until frost.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, even drought-tolerant plants need adequate moisture
until they are established.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Q. Could you please explain what is making my tulip tree or
pink magnolia bloom at this time of year? It also has new leaves
now since old leaves have dropped due to this year's intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ E.J.P., Rosenberg
</P>
<P>
   A. Saucer magnolias (Magnolia soulangiana) are one of the
earliest flowering trees here _ and one of the most beautiful. They
like an acidic loam that drains well. In summer, those exposed to
afternoon sun can suffer. Their leaves burn. They may shed foliage.
So it's a good idea to plant them where they will be protected not
only from the hot sun, but also from winter winds. Sometimes the
buds are destroyed in wind or freezing weather, and we get leaves
but no flowers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too rare for deciduous saucer magnolias to put on a
second round of blooms in late summer/early fall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been given a beautiful esperanza, and I need all the
information I can get to take good care of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ N.W., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A. Esperanza, also commonly called yellow bells or yellow elder,
is botanically known as Tecoma stans. This vigorous shrub/small
tree has the potential of reaching 20 feet, but we mostly see it in
the 6- to 8-foot range. During the past few years it has become
more widely available, and Texas gardeners have been smitten with
this native.
</P>
<P>
   The multibranched shrub can be trained into a standard. The
foliage is arranged in leaflets; the vivid yellow blooms are
heavily clustered at the tips of the branches. Narrow green seed
pods form after the flowers. Remove these to encourage more of the
2-inch, flared, funnel-shaped blooms. Let some pods remain on the
plant until they turn brown; harvest and sow the seed if you wish
to propagate.
</P>
<P>
   You can trim this plant during the growing season to shape and
control height. It is generally root-hardy in Zones 9-10. If you
plant it in the garden, do so in a sunny spot in a well-draining,
decently fertile soil. Mulch the roots well during winter to ensure
protection. It is beautiful in a mixed bed with other summer
bloomers such as jatropha, hamelia, lantana and the blue butterfly
bush, Clerodendrum ugandense.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep it in a pot, you'll find you will soon need a large
container as this plant is a fast grower. Move to a protected area,
as you would tropical hibiscus, during cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza/yellow bells is drought-tolerant once established, but
it appreciates moderate to regular watering. Container plants
especially will benefit from monthly applications of a balanced
fertilizer since they will be watered more frequently, therefore
more quickly leaching nutrients from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: We planted lantana as a ground cover over a rather large
area. We chose the ones with yellow flowers in particular because
we found them literally bursting with blooms practically everywhere
_ around malls, gas stations, etc., apparently with little care.
However, we are not getting continued bloom.
</P>
<P>
   We also planted pink lantana that bloom in the cooler months but
not the summer.
</P>
<P>
   We have tried heavy watering, light watering, no watering,
feeding and no feeding.
</P>
<P>
   _ T.K.B., Galveston
</P>
<P>
   A: Lantanas have on-and-off bloom cycles. They flower, rest,
then flower again. Some are touted as blooming more of the time,
including ``New Gold'' and ``Silver Mound.'' Some, such as Lantana
montevidensis ``Imperial Blue,'' will carry on longer in the cooler
months.
</P>
<P>
   Try to practice consistent culture. Lantana will flower best
given full sun and well-draining soil. Do not overwater, but water
deeply from time to time during long, dry spells. Then let the soil
dry before watering again. Lantana blooms on new growth, and the
moisture will encourage this.
</P>
<P>
   You might also periodically trim the plants to remove old
blooms. It is especially helpful to remove spent blooms from those
lantana that berry, or seed, to encourage more flowers. Always cut
lantana back after winter, whether the plants have suffered freeze
damage or not.
</P>
<P>
   Do not overfertilize. You want to give the plants enough food so
that they will grow well, but often heavy applications of
phosphorus are wasted as this element becomes tied up in the soil
and unavailable to the plant. Fertilize in spring with a
long-lasting, complete and balanced formula. You might reapply
every couple of months during the growing season.

LATIN SUPERSTAR CARLOS PONCE ROCKETS TO STARDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Even before the entourage of publicists, agents and
promoters ushering Latin music superstar Carlos Ponce through a
back door of the Astrohall were visible, the nonstop screaming
began.
</P>
<P>
   Two hits _ ``Decir Adios,'' his current single, and ``Rezo,''
the ballad that introduced Ponce to music fans and shot to the top
of the charts _ have made his a virtual household name in the
Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the other scheduled acts performing onstage just
behind them during the recent all-day Mexican Independence Day
celebration, a few hundred fans _ most of them females of varied
ages _ threatened to pour through the gated barriers keeping them
within arm's reach of Ponce, whose self-titled debut album of pop
ballads, acoustic rhythms and Latin grooves has hovered near the
top of the Latin charts for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the confusion, a pair of ecstatic teen-age girls managed to
climb over the gates, only to be scolded back to their places by
security guards, who were visibly amused at the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   When the hysteria finally settled down to a dull roar, Ponce
signed autographs, shook hands and posed pretty for a barrage of
cameras. He even helped a few nervous fans who were having trouble
setting their flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce, 26, clearly enjoys mingling with his fans, but the speed
of his success is something that still surprises him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually I would be successful, because I put a lot
of passion into what I do, and I don't do it unless I know that
it's going to work _ or at least I think very positively that it
will get there. But I had no idea it was going to be so quick,'' he
said backstage after a three-song set.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce is no stranger to the spotlight, though. The Puerto-Rican
born entertainer moved to Miami with his family at the age of 14,
where he landed steady commercial work and attended the New World
School of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   He stole quite a few hearts on the Spanish ``novelas'' (soap
operas) ``Guadalupe'' and ``Sentimientos Ajenos,'' and he served as
host and producer of the youth-oriented variety and music show
``Control'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectly timed acknowledgment of Ponce's burgeoning success
came in June of this year, when he was selected by People en
Espanol to grace the cover of their 25 Most Beautiful issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came at a great time in my life, because it was just like
right smack in the middle of my CD coming out, so it was good
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   While that high-profile exposure was a sure-fire boost, Ponce's
current career of choice is something that's been in the works for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first intention was the music. Little things came here and
there, and I think it's just basically God giving me more
instruments to learn because each one of them complements the
others,'' Ponce said. ``In a way, I'm very thankful. I was looking
for the music, but now I can't pick. I tried that. I do love music
... and I don't do them all at the same time. It's been almost two
years since I've done a television show, with the exception of
little appearances here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those ``little'' appearances included a stint on an
upcoming episode of ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which airs Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play a rich guy who comes and takes one of the girls out of
the episode, but they leave it open for the option of both of us
coming back, because she is one of the lead roles. I take her away
to Paris,'' Ponce said with a slight grin. ``It was great. It was a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponce's success seems surprising, considering his peers in the
market _ Enrique Iglesias, Ricky Martin, Alejandro Fernandez _ each
have at least three albums under their belts. It's an intimidating
level of competition, but Ponce welcomes it with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't sound too vain, but I wasn't too nervous,''
Ponce admitted. ``I just wanted to make sure it was what I wanted
to do and not what they (record company) wanted me to do. I knew it
was going to be good. I never dreamed that it was going to be so
quick. I just thought it was going to take me a little while _
maybe a second CD _ but that doesn't mean that I had lack of faith
in the content of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity on the album is refreshing, and it's a point Ponce
was concerned with from the beginning. The process of selecting
tracks for the album _ three of which were written by Ponce _ took
more than six months, while the recording was done in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style is pretty eclectic, so that's what I did. I had fun
with each and every song because they were hand-picked.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping Ponce assemble a first-rate product were notable
writer/producer Kike Santander and Emilio Estefan Jr., who has
worked his magic on artists like Jon Secada, Thalia and, most
notably, his wife, Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did bring my music to Emilio _ being probably one of
the most successful producers that I have met _ he was the only one
that told me what I wanted to hear, which was, `OK, what is it you
want to do, and I'll work around that,' instead of `This is what we
want you to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Along with artistic freedom, Ponce is hoping to reap another
benefit of working with Estefan: crossover success. He is currently
in the midst of recording three songs in English for the
international release of his album, and Ponce also performed a
``Spanglish'' version of ``Rezo'' a few weeks ago on ``Regis &AMP;
Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about (a crossover) ever since I released
my record, and that was one of the main reasons why I wanted
Estefan to be my producer, because he's done Gloria, and he's done
Jon Secada,'' Ponce said. ``I don't know anybody else who has
successfully done strong crossovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponce already had the chance to realize another dream this
summer, when his theatrical background almost had him kicking up
his heels in two high-profile Broadway revivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you want to do comes when you can't do it. I was
offered `The Pirates of Penzance,' which they're going to redo on
Broadway now. I was offered `On The Town.' I can't do it, either,''
Ponce said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York stage may have to wait a while while Ponce fulfills
his duties promoting his music, but it's likely he will find solace
in the adoration of his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've come to Houston. You can tell you
have to make a little bit of an extra effort, being a ballad or a
pop artist, but the audience was very nice and very receptive,''
Ponce said. ``So I was very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the cheering fans who waved banners and sang along during
Ponce's set, the feeling was undoubtedly mutual. &QL;

   I was visiting some time ago with a fellow travel journalist
whose main expertise is the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is your favorite island?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica,'' she replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed mild surprise at her answer. ``Don't you find some
people there a tad aggressive toward tourists?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they don't bother me,'' she said. ``I only go to the
all-inclusive resorts and never leave until it's time to fly
home.''
</P>
<P>
   How sad. Nothing against Sandals or Breezes or Couples or
Hedonism II. (Dare I admit that many, many years ago I spent a week
at Hedonism I?) These and other properties offer self-contained
products enjoyed by many Houstonians. But if the sole purpose of
our travels is to be chained figuratively to one resort, with no
desire to explore beyond, why go all the way to Jamaica?
</P>
<P>
   And yet that's the way an increasing number of travelers look at
a country whose beauty and charm, so ripe for exploration, are too
often hidden beneath the misguided actions of a few unruly
residents.

VOTING WORTH THE EFFORT, EVEN WITH SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ I wish Texas Secretary of State Al Gonzales a lot of
luck, and he probably will need every bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   As the state's chief elections officer, Gonzales has taken on
one of the most difficult jobs in state government right now _
encouraging people to get out and vote in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnouts in the party primaries last spring already had
signaled that Gonzales had his work cut out for him. Now, the
Clinton scandal in Washington, which escalated last week with the
release of the independent counsel's report to Congress, has made
Gonzales' task even more formidable.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzales is still trying, seeking a magic theme, public
relations slogan or other motivation that could somehow convince a
respectable number of Texans to exercise their basic right of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretty ironic case of timing, Gonzales plans to announce a
new emphasis for his get-out-the-vote campaign this week. He will
bring Texas children into the act, just as many Texas parents are
hustling their children out of the room when news of the highest
elected official in the free world comes on television.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to get children excited about the act of voting and
hope that they will talk it up with their parents. Gonzales will
kick off the initiative with a news conference at an Austin
elementary school, where 5- and 6-year-olds will report about
recent class votes on such relevant (for them) issues as favorite
ice cream flavors.
</P>
<P>
   They and other young students also will be featured in a public
service announcement to be distributed to network and cable TV
stations throughout Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no connection, of course, between Gonzales' election
awareness program and the scandal over Clinton's relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And there certainly is nothing wrong with educating children
about the importance of voting. I'm all for it. But it's pretty sad
that our most identifiable government figure, who should be a hero
to our children, has become such a disreputable example of what the
act of voting can produce.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the U.S. House will use Kenneth
Starr's report to impeach the president, but already there is a lot
of speculation about how Clinton's behavior will affect the
upcoming elections in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic candidates are trying to put as much distance
between themselves and the Democratic president as possible. John
Sharp and Paul Hobby, who are waging uphill but potentially
winnable races for lieutenant governor and state comptroller,
already have sharply criticized Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A notable exception is Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry
Mauro, a longtime Clinton friend. Mauro said he still planned to
have the president, who already has raised a lot of money for
Mauro, appear at additional fund-raisers in Houston and San Antonio
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, whose chances of unseating Gov. George W. Bush appear to
be slim-to-none, says friendship is friendship. And he apparently
believes he has little to lose anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts predict that the Clinton scandal _
including independent counsel Starr's assertion that he has
compiled ``substantial and credible'' evidence of possible
impeachable offenses by the president _ will hurt Democratic
candidates in a number of congressional and other key races around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   If even a small percentage of Democratic voters are disgusted
enough to stay home on Election Day, or so the theory goes, the
party's candidates, particularly in close races, will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans obviously are disgusted by Clinton's behavior.
Many others are less concerned about his affair with Lewinsky than
they are about his lies about it and attempts to cover it up. And
still others are tired of reading and hearing about it.
</P>
<P>
   What effect the scandal will have on voters won't be known, of
course, until Election Day. But the furor may very well turn off
people of all political persuasions from voting _ for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   This could particularly be the result in Texas, where the
governor's race, by far the most visible race on the ballot, is
perceived as a runaway anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I believed it was premature to fret over the
lower-than-normal turnout in both the Democratic and Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems that the fretting may have been justified.
President Clinton and the tawdry details of Monica-gate may simply
reinforce the perception of millions of marginal voters that no one
in public office is worthy of their trust, confidence _ or votes.
</P>
<P>
   The country will recover _ with or without a presidential
impeachment or resignation _ but this Election Day may be a
difficult test for democracy.

PAPERWORK TURNS INVESTMENT CLUB BEARISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ For this investment club, the devil was
in the details, not in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The Willow Tree Stocks Investment Club, whose members are all
women, is cashing out its joint investments just a couple of years
after organizing. A core group of members will reconvene as the
Willow Tree Friends, an information- and resource-sharing group for
women who want to learn more about personal finance topics.
</P>
<P>
   While investment clubs have earned lots of positive publicity in
recent years for bringing ordinary people together to learn the ins
and outs of investing, Willow Tree's experience demonstrates a
common pitfall: too much work for too few people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the clubs that are started in the next 18 months, about
half will fold,'' predicted Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the board of
trustees of National Association of Investors Corp., which guides
37,000 clubs nationwide. That high mortality rate exists despite
the fact that the organization has computer software that helps
groups with record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble signs, if they are to appear, show themselves early,
O'Hara said. ``It's getting past the first couple of years,'' he
said. ``We have hundreds that are more than 35 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   A common problem among clubs that disband is that they have too
few active working members to share the administrative load, O'Hara
said.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have been the quandary for Willow Tree Stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It had as many as 15 investors, including the silent partners
who didn't want to handle decision-making or bookkeeping chores but
only seven or eight active members. That ratio just didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably needed more bodies than that for handling the
investments for that many people,'' said Bev LaBarge, one of the
organizers and a continuing member of the reincarnated group.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury functions are especially time-consuming, said Ann
Cunningham, another active member.
</P>
<P>
   Members must track dividends, savings accounts and follow IRS
rules. ``The paperwork is astronomical,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   The women hadn't envisioned that their monthly meetings at the
community room in the local Kmart would be so dominated by
accounting intricacies. After all, they had wanted to learn about
the world of investing by talking about their holdings in Pepsi,
Maytag, Oracle and Rubbermaid _ some of their more successful
purchases _ and in Boston Chicken and Shanghai Petroleum, which
didn't fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   So the club is now in the process of cashing out and
redistributing holdings to individual members, many of whom will
invest on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exercise was useful in many ways, Cunningham said.
She went from being a semiretired grandmother who knew little about
finances to being a woman who now reads the business pages of
newspapers daily and Barron's.
</P>
<P>
   Other members, whose ages ranged from 30 to 70, also learned
more about finances.
</P>
<P>
   The revised format of the club opens up new possibilities,
LaBarge and Cunningham said. Now they don't have to stick just to
investing topics. They can discuss leasing a car, buying a home,
starting a business, funding health care or any of the other
financial decisions that women are increasingly making on their
own, said LaBarge, a widow who markets her own invention, a
traveling case for tournament-level chess players.

   CALVADOS (St. Cyr de Ronceray, France) _ Normandy is so close to
Paris that wise guys sometimes call it the 21st Arrondissement.
Which no doubt explains why, in the old days, Normandy's Calvados,
or apple brandy, was the capital's favorite tipple. To a degree, it
still is _ not so much in the grand hotels and the restaurants
showered with stars, but in the bars, bistros and brasseries
frequented by ordinary folk. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   KITCHEN-WARES (Undated) _ Kenneth Johnson, the chef at Terrace
Restaurant on the Upper West Side, uses pantyhose to strain
consomme. It may sound strange, but actually, he says, it works
better than cheesecloth. It is a clever little trick, but one of
many in the restaurant world. And some of them are useful in the
home, too. Chefs are always devising new ways to execute their
ideas: while being pressured to be original, time is at a premium
and so is money. So when conventional kitchen equipment can't
accomplish what they want it to do, they look for other ways to get
the job done. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   BONE-MARROW (New York) _ It's dinnertime at Judson Grill in
Midtown, and, typically, a good number of customers have ordered
the grilled dry-aged sirloin with rosti potatoes, bone marrow, pea
leaves and carrots. The marrow comes tucked into a section of bone
standing at attention alongside the steak, a tiny spoon at the
ready. I happen to love marrow, and can remember, as a child,
fighting with my mother over which one of us would get the marrow
when she made braised veal shanks. By Florence Fabricant.

   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE TONTO WOMAN &QL; 
 &UR; Elmore Leonard (Delacorte, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   Long before he hit it big writing crime novels, Elmore Leonard
supported his family by writing copy for an advertising agency by
day, and Western stories for pulp magazines at night. He didn't
know much about the West, so he subscribed to ``Arizona Highways''
magazine and cribbed from it when he needed to describe the
landscape. That technique doesn't sound very promising, so it comes
as a surprise that this collection of Leonard's early Western
stories is so much fun to read. The characters are essentially the
same as those in his later fiction _ only the names and places have
changed _ because they are written in accordance with Leonard's
conviction that, as he puts it, ``the bad guys aren't bad all
day.'' He (begin itals) likes (end itals) these people, and so do
we, despite the fact that they are as capable of violence and sin
as they are of humor and the occasional good deed. Most of the
stories here are set in Arizona. And the landscape? It's dusty and
gritty and everything you'd want it to be in tales of the Wild
West. Not a sign of ``Arizona Highways'' anywhere. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD GROWS UP &QL; 
 &UR; Andrew Tobias (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   On the dust jacket, under the author's name, are the words ``No
Longer Known as John Reid.'' That's a reference to Tobias'
coming-of-age memoir, ``The Best Little Boy in the World,'' which
was published 25 years ago under the Reid pseudonym because Tobias,
who was then 26, did not want to acknowledge his homosexuality
under his own name. He had not yet told his parents that he was gay
(he finally broke the news to his mother just as his book was
coming out in paperback _ her response was, ``Don't tell your
father.''). Here, the author of ``The Only Investment Guide You'll
Ever Need'' (never mind that he would later revise it) continues
his story with his familiar, funny, chatty tone and honest but
discreet approach. He covers the aftermath of the release of his
first book, his success as an investment adviser (and consequent
appearances on television talk shows), the AIDS epidemic and the
deaths of many of his friends, and the changes in his experience as
a gay man in America. To coincide with publication of this book,
Random House has released ``The Best Little Boy in the World'' in a
Modern Library edition. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FIELD OF THIRTEEN &QL; 
 &UR; Dick Francis (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here is a collection of short fiction from the acknowledged
master of the racetrack tale. In ``Raid at Kingdom Hill,'' a bomb
scare at a crowded track provides a lucrative opportunity for two
unlikely thieves (Francis notes that the story, written in 1975,
presaged a bomb hoax that halted the running of the Grand National
Steeplechase in 1997). In ``Song for Mona,'' an elderly groom dies
a lonely death and her vindictive, social-climbing daughter suffers
comeuppance at the hands of her mother's employers. In ``Bright
White Star,'' Francis describes the theft of a prize colt from an
auction, and in ``Nightmare'' the theft of a brood mare and her
unborn foal. In ``Spring Fever,'' a middle-aged owner falls in love
with her 24-year-old jockey. In all there are eight previously
published and five new stories _ a fine field of 13. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE AMERICAN WEST &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Howard R. Lamar (Yale, $60)
</P>
<P>
   The pseudonym ``Mark Twain'' was first used in the early 1800s
by Mississippi river pilot Isaiah Sellers, who wrote letters to New
Orleans newspapers under it (Mark Twain was an old river term, the
call for a sounding of two fathoms, which meant safe water). Cowboy
hats were poorly made until 1865 when a fellow from New Jersey _
John B. Stetson _ opened a one-man shop in Philadelphia and began
making the hats that would come to represent the American West (by
1906, he had 3,500 employees and made 2 million hats a year). The
trivia is fun, but you have to dig for it in the more substantial
entries (the ``Mark Twain'' tidbit can be found under ``rivermen'')
in this big and valuable book. First published in 1977 as ``The
Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West,'' it has been revised
to include 2,400 entries on the history, geography and culture of
the West, arranged alphabetically by keyword. Includes a time line
of Western history and more than 600 maps and illustrations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY &QL; 
 &UR; Michael S Lief, H. Mitchell Caldwell and Ben Bycel (Scribner, $26)
</P>
<P>
   The authors have assembled a selection of what they consider to
be the finest closing arguments in American history. Each is
presented with a brief historical introduction, a biographical
sketch of the lawyer who delivered the argument, and an analysis of
the argument. Included are prosecutor Robert H. Jackson's closing
in the trial of Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg; Vincent Bugliosi's
closing in the trial of Charles Manson; Aubrey Daniel's closing
argument at the court martial of William L. Calley Jr. for his
actions at My Lai in Vietnam; Gerry Spence's arguments in the case
brought by Karen Silkwood's family against Kerr McGee Inc.; and
Clarence Darrow's argument that saved murderers Richard Loeb and
Nathan Leopold from the gallows in 1924. &QL;

`CANYON' TAKES READERS ON GRAND TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
HOW THE CANYON BECAME GRAND 
Stephen J. Pyne (Viking, $24.95) 
 
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nervous Nellies who dread the approaching turn of the millennium
would do well to contemplate the story of the Grand Canyon, where a
millennium's laughable big-picture insignificance is revealed. A
millennium is to the Canyon what an ounce is to Moby Dick.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, historian Stephen J. Pyne writes of ``the power
of the Canyon not to reveal time so much as to obliterate it
through sheer immensity.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation comes at the end of ``How the Canyon Became
Grand,'' in which the Arizona State University professor gives a
fascinating, often compelling account of the enormous scholarly,
artistic and political energies that the Canyon has inspired. It is
a sort of intellectual history of America's most evocative place.
</P>
<P>
   Those Canyon-born energies, in turn, have determined the
enormous place that the Canyon claims in the national imagination
as a sublime wonder and geological showplace.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book for the casual reader of Canyon literature,
any more than a rim-to-rim hike is for the casual hiker accustomed
only to short jaunts on the rim. It is both a stimulating and
challenging journey, for Pyne is a student of intellectual history
who has read widely and studied the literature of the Canyon
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Pyne, of course, tells the Canyon tales of such widely known
Canyon figures as John Wesley Powell, the first to lead a
river-borne expedition through the Canyon, and Clarence Dutton, who
recognized the Canyon as ``a great innovation in our modern ideas
of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also explains how the Canyon shaped the science of
geology and the art of landscape. And he provides an excellent
account of how the Canyon shaped the modern environmental movement
_ through battles against those who would dam its eastern and
western ends.
</P>
<P>
   Those battles were some of the most important in the history of
the American West, for they shaped an aesthetic that some things
simply must be preserved, even in a region where supplies of water
and power sometimes demand the sacrifice of the natural world. As
Sierra Club head David Brower said, ``If we can't save the Grand
Canyon, what the hell can we save?''
</P>
<P>
   Pyne manages to tell most of his tale in language that is vivid
and imaginative. But at times he strains for an arresting image.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the period in the 1920s when Southwestern art
slighted the Canyon as it focused on New Mexico, Pyne writes
``Emblemat ically the defining Southwest novel of the era, Willa
Cather's `Death Comes for the Archbishop' (1927), ends with the
erection of a cathedral, not the evolution of a canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   But such awkward moments snag the book only briefly as Pyne
tells a story that begins with the Canyon's incomprehensibility to
the 16th century Spanish explorers and concludes with the Canyon's
emergence as a symbol of America.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Canyon demands physical rigor for those who would
probe it deeply, ``How the Canyon Became Grand'' requires a certain
intellectual sure-footedness through complex terrain. Both
experiences are richly rewarding. For those who seek to understand
the Canyon's evolution as cultural phenomenon, the book is a must. &QL;

TALENTED NOVELIST PURSUES HIS CRAFT AS LABOR OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethan Canin is on the telephone from Iowa City, where he and his
family are living out of boxes while he readies himself for the
fall semester at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just accepted a tenured professorship,'' he says in a
deep, formal voice, making fun of his own announcement. He laughs,
but still sounds nervous. ``We're not even moved in. I'm sitting
here amid unpacked boxes, living in a wreck. I'm going to teach.
Yes. I'm going to see how that goes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is news. At 37, Ethan Canin is a writer, a physician and
now _ full time and with tenure _ a teacher. He is also one of
literary fiction's brightest stars, despite the fact that his
writing and his medical education have pulled him in different
directions for more than a decade. It wasn't until he had earned a
degree in English from Stanford University and was a student at the
Iowa Writer's Workshop that he decided to study medicine. He wrote
his first story collection, ``Emperor of the Air,'' while he was at
Harvard Medical School (it was published in 1988 to rapturous
reviews and several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list).
</P>
<P>
   He followed up with a novel, ``Blue River,'' and in 1994 ``The
Palace Thief,'' a collection of novellas that solidified his
reputation as a master of understated but remarkable storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Now Canin has a new novel, ``For Kings and Planets'' (Random
House, $24). It's the story of Orno Tarcher and Marshall Emerson,
who meet in 1974 as freshmen at Columbia University and become
friends despite disparate backgrounds, talents and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Canin sounds both excited and apprehensive about the new book
and about his decision not to practice medicine. But that, to all
appearances, is typical of Canin _ he has achieved much, but seems
to view everything he does with a curious mix of relish and angst.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Why did you decide to go to medical school all those
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: I went to medical school because I figured I couldn't
support myself as a writer. I know that sounds like an intimidating
and overwhelming alternative. It was a failure of imagination,
really. I sat there and thought (begin itals) what can I do? (end
itals) A lawyer? I don't want to be a lawyer. But I'd always been
good in science, and I liked helping people. So I went to medical
school and spent 10 years being intimidated and overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You finished your residency. What's your status now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm still licensed as a doctor. I just paid the state of
California to renew my license, but I don't know why because I'm
not going to use it. At some point I realized that if I practiced
medicine I would be stepping into a $150,000-a-year job, 50 hours a
week, and I would never write again. I realized that if I didn't
need the money, I wouldn't write, and if I was a doctor I wouldn't
need the money so that would be the end of me as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Talk a bit about the new novel. Orno and Marshall are so
different. Why are they attracted to each other?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's hard to answer. I think those characters represent
warring instincts in myself. Ambition versus contentment. If I had
to explain it, I'd say that what Marshall sees in Orno is a
solidity, a solid center that he doesn't have. And Orno sees in
Marshall a grace and glamour that he doesn't have. I was interested
in writing about a friendship between two men over their entire
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you become attached to your characters?
</P>
<P>
   A: No I don't, because I'll tell you, it's such misery to write
a book. I basically like and trust my characters, but I don't feel
any great spring in my step just from thinking about them. It's not
like that for me. I wish it was. I'm envious of writers who say all
they do is think about their characters. But for me writing is
pretty much agony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. Maybe because over the years I've discovered
that I have an unquenchable spring. Even though it's possible to
quench it for years at a time, it seems to bubble up sooner or
later. It's a desire that comes from reading. When I read something
I like, I want to write.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If there's been a criticism of your writing, it's that it is
too understated. How do you react to that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've written some stories that are sort of poetic _ you know,
that kind of language. I can do that. But it seems to me that it's
only when the content isn't there that I start jazzing up the
prose. Maybe it's a distracting mechanism, but if the content is
strong you're not thinking so much about the prose style. One
writer I admired when I started this novel was Peter Taylor. If you
look at his prose style, it doesn't seem like anything in
particular. I'd describe it as being articulate, with a ring of
truth to it. And that's sort of what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After your first book of stories was so successful, you took
a leave from medical school and went to South America to write your
first novel. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I went to Ecuador because it was the cheapest country in
South America and they spoke fairly straightforward Spanish there.
Don't get me wrong, I loved the attention after ``Emperor of the
Air.'' I ate it up. But I also felt that I wanted to leave in the
middle of it rather than let it fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified about the novel. I'd gotten this big advance. I
was only twentysomething years old. I tried to write every day
because I knew if I didn't I'd just disintegrate. I had no plan
whatsoever. I didn't even write from one scene to the next. I just
typed. And I came home six or seven months later with a suitcase
full of unrelated scenes that I spread out on the floor of my
apartment and then tried to piece them together. It was agony.
</P>
<P>
   For the new novel, I decided that whatever happened I would
write it in order, starting on the first page. I would never skip
ahead. I wrote it from first page to last, and it was instantly
easier. I had no idea where I was going, which is frightening but I
always do it that way. Don't get me wrong _ the word ``easy''
doesn't apply to this. It's not even in the lexicon. But it was a
hell of a lot easier than the way I wrote the first one. On the
next novel, I might even try to plot things out before I start.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other writers do you admire?
</P>
<P>
   A: You admire different people over different periods of your
life. There have been dozens. During the writing of this book, I
liked John Updike at the start. Peter Taylor. I was reading Jim
Harrison for a while _ God, I love his prose. Just recently I've
been reading Philip Roth, who's a terrific writer. I read
``American Pastoral,'' and couldn't tear my eyes away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you looking forward to doing publicity appearances for
``For Kings and Planets?''
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm dreading it. I used to love publicity, but there's this
kind of shame that comes with it. I've gotten so I'm pretty good in
front of a microphone, but you feel so (begin itals) false. (end
itals) Not only that, but the stuff that I'm hoping for with all my
heart _ like to make the bestseller lists and earn a lot of money _
well, it just seems so (begin itals) empty. (end itals) In the
sense that if you make No. 5 on the bestseller list you'll wish you
were No. 3. Nothing will ever satisfy you. No good review is good
enough and a bad review is devastating. It's a pretty miserable
time. On the other hand, I'm very glad I'm doing it. So there you
go. That's Orno and Marshall for you. &QL;

HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY SEES DECLINE IN GLOBAL ACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. exports of high-tech products are on the
decline, a new report says, and increased demand for American goods
in some parts of the world offers little hope for immediate
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of 1998, exports of high-tech goods
from the United States to Asia fell 12 percent, or $3.7 billion,
according to the American Electronics Association. That decrease
was almost entirely offset by healthy increases to Europe, Canada
and even China.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting overall decline of U.S. electronics exports was
valued at $311 million, or 0.38 percent, compared with the same
period in 1997. The exports include computers, semiconductors,
consumer electronics and photonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad, considering,'' said AEA spokesman John Hatch in
Santa Clara, Calif. ``Actually, we would like to see increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say increases are unlikely to appear soon because of
worldwide financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The export figures have enormous importance to California,
because electronics and electrical equipment, industrial machinery
and computer equipment represented 53 percent of total California
exports during the first half of 1998, according to the state Trade
and Commerce Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, following a moderate 3 percent growth in 1997,
exports of electronics and electrical equipment declined 2.3
percent and industrial machinery and computers fell 2.1 percent
during the first half of the year, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months, Mexican numbers were impressive.
There was a 16 percent growth, or a $1.2 billion increase, of
high-tech exports to that country, the AEA said.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech exports to the European Union were strong, up 5
percent, or $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   China was the notable exception in the general decline of
exports to Asia. High-tech exports to China grew by $500 million,
or 50 percent, from January through June, over the year-earlier
period.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's figures overall, however, were miserable. American
high-tech exports to Indonesia were down 64 percent; to South
Korea, down 37 percent; to Thailand, down 26 percent; and to Japan,
down 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are no cures on the horizon for these and other troubled
markets, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going to get worse before they get better,'' said
Richard Carlson, chairman of Spectrum Electronics in Palo Alto,
Calif., management consultants to numerous Silicon Valley clients.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted, the AEA numbers represent shipments, which
lag orders, and, secondly, ``all the places we are relying on are
in trouble. Canada, Latin America and Europe are all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The AEA noted that exports to Latin America had been vigorous in
the first six months. Following a 31 percent surge between 1996 and
1997, high-tech exports increased 9 percent during the first half
of 1998. One harbinger of concern is Brazil, the largest export
market in Latin America, where high-tech exports fell 8 percent, or
$190 million.
</P>
<P>
   There were surges elsewhere, said the AEA. Exports to Costa Rica
doubled to $200 million, and to Venezuela they surged 61 percent,
to $640 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are widespread fears that the regional financial
crisis will deepen in Latin America, and no good news is expected
soon from elsewhere, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is turning around yet; that does not add up too well,''
he said. ``All major raw material-producing countries are really
being hit. Canada is on the top of that list, and that includes
Australia, much of Latin America, the Middle East. The question is,
`Does it turn around by the end of this year or the middle of next
year?'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets of optimism, to be sure. Last week, bellwether
Intel Corp. said its third quarter should be better than expected:
about 10 percent higher than the $5.9 billion reported in the
second quarter. Its sales are up in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell said his company was
having a great third quarter. And Hewlett-Packard Co. reported a 1
percent increase in net earnings and a 5 percent growth in revenue
for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of reason for long-term optimism, but this is
going to be at least a tough six months, and I hope it is not a
tough 12 months,'' Carlson said. ``The only market worldwide that
is strong right now is the U.S. We are just dragging the whole
planet's economy, and that is a hell of a load.''

MOST TEXANS IN POLL WANT CLINTON TO STAY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans' views of President Clinton and his sex scandal were
virtually unchanged by independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress, according to a poll conducted for the Houston
Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans continue to think Clinton should stay in office,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   And most continue to separate Clinton's presidential actions
from his personality. They still approve of his job performance but
not him.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of what should happen to Clinton in light of his
sexual encounters with former intern Monica Lewinsky and his
subsequent testimony, 42 percent said the matter should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Another 14 percent said Clinton should be censured _ officially
condemned _ by Congress. Such action would allow him to remain on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent said Clinton should resign, and 11 percent
said he should be impeached _ an option under strong consideration
by Congress. The remaining 6 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 505 adult Texans has a margin of error of 4.5
percentage points. It was conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin Associates
Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a virtually identical poll of registered voters Sept. 3, 24
percent said Clinton should resign, and 9 percent said he should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report was made public Friday on the Internet and
subsequently in newspapers across the nation. It contains
allegations that Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power. It also contained graphic details of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``However negatively Texans may feel about President Clinton as
a person, they clearly continue to approve of the job he is doing
as president and want him to remain in office,'' pollsters
Micheline Blum and Julie Weprin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas results mirror numerous national polls taken since the
Starr report was released. The Chronicle-Morning News poll also
showed no signficant split between men's and women's attitudes on
Clinton's fate and his ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of Texans surveyed said they approve of the
job Clinton is doing as president. Thirty-two percent percent
disapproved, and 5 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sept. 3 poll, 60 percent approved of Clinton's
performance, 37 disapproved, and 3 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, 61 percent said Monday they had a negative
opinion of Clinton _ a separate measure of the person rather than
his job performance. Thirty-one percent said they had a positive
opinion, and 8 percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   National polls that asked the same question came out slightly
better for Clinton after Starr's report went public. It was 56
percent negative, 37 percent positive in a national poll for CNN
and USA Today conducted by Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's poll, Texans who want Clinton to remain on the job
saw the case as a sexual matter instead of a legal one, while those
who want his resignation or removal saw the case more as a legal
matter instead of a sexual one.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who said the case should be dropped, 83 percent said it
was mostly because the case concerns a private matter that has
nothing to do with Clinton's job performance. Another 8 percent
said it was because they do not believe Clinton broke the law.
Three percent said ``both.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who said Clinton should resign, be impeached or
censured, 56 percent cited the belief that Clinton lied in his
testimony or encouraged others to lie. Fifteen percent said it was
because Starr's report shows he is morally unfit to be president.
Twenty-four percent cited both reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 53 percent of the total survey said Starr included
graphic sexual details in his report mostly to embarrass Clinton
rather than mostly to prove that he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Texans still are split about the way Starr has performed as a
special prosecutor, according to the poll, with 45 percent
disapproving of Starr's performance and 44 percent approved. Eleven
percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier survey before the release of Starr's report showed
no significant difference on that question.
</P>
<P>
   One of the respondents to Monday's poll, retiree Agnes Bradley
of Sulphur Springs, said the case should end without any official
action against Clinton because Lewinsky's testimony has already
damaged the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for him standing in there,'' she said, adding Clinton has
done a good job, especially with ``handling those foreign
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The 89-year-old Democrat said she has vivid memories of many
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``hasn't done anything worse than all of the other
presidents that's been there,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ex-Marine Morris Halsey, an education student at
Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, said Clinton has
performed well as president but should be impeached for testifying
falsely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has done a good job; I can see that,'' said Halsey,
a 36-year-old Republican. ``But morally, with me going into the
profession that I am, which is teaching, I couldn't in any way,
shape or form come near what he has done and hope to maintain a
semblance of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Halsey said that Clinton, in his explanations of the sexual
encounters, has acted as if the public lacked intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened,'' he remarked. ``Don't dance around the
issue. Face it, take your licks and continue to march.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Williamson of San Antonio, a political independent, said
Clinton has committed a personal wrong but that he has also been
the subject of a vendetta by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he thinks Clinton should not quit or be punished
by Congress, the 34-year-old human resources consultant said,
``What really irritates me is that they have allowed (Starr) to
spend $40 million doing this ridiculous investigation when we have
a lot of things in the United States of America that are better
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites and non-whites were split on their rating of Clinton as a
person, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-four percent of blacks and 51 percent of Hispanics said
they have a positive opinion of Clinton as a person; only 20
percent of whites did. &QL;

IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH REBA MCENTIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Newport News, Va.; originally moved 8/2)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``new'' Nashville is a hotbed of changing scenes and faces,
so you can't blame some veteran country acts for having trouble
figuring it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive, and there are so many new people in
here these days that I don't know half of them,'' says singer Reba
McEntire. ``I have to go to the awards shows and watch the CMT
(Country Music Television) videos to catch up and keep familiar
with everyone. It is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but here's the rub. The newcomers also have to keep up with
Reba -- and that's never been easy for anyone. She remains one of
the hardest-working entertainers in any genre. She always seems to
have a new record, a new movie, a new concert tour. If this woman
rests, it's not often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a doer,'' she says with candid simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she's doing another concert tour with Brooks &AMP; Dunn.
Together, they had the top-grossing country tour of last year --
and decided to do it again after recording a duet, ``If You See
Him, If You See Her,'' for McEntire's new CD, ``If You See Him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any plans to tour again until the song came
up,'' McEntire says of the track, co-written by Tommy Lee James,
Jennifer Kimball, and Terry McBride. ``But it's like family going
out with them. We toured together in 1992 and 1993 as well. They're
very easy to get along with. I know all of their crew and band.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire, who has won numerous Grammy and Country Music
Association awards, is virtually country royalty at this point in
her 22-year career. She could likely demand constant headliner
status. Instead, she's willing to do a co-billing with Brooks &AMP;
Dunn, which means that they flip-flop the headlining role from
night to night. (There are also two opening acts, in Terry Clark
and David Kersh.) ``You have to get your ego out of the way,'' says
McEntire. ``But, you know, the best slot on the show is really the
third act. We all say that. So I think we're all flip-flopping for
that third slot instead of closing! It's not an ego thing with us,
because we get along so well. They understand what I've done and I
understand how successful they are. So we really respect each other
and like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, unlike last year, McEntire is again able to use a
large-scale stage production, complete with the choreography she so
loves. She had cut that way back last year in the wake of a skiing
accident in Park City, Utah, in which she broke her knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until you see the stage now! I've lost quite a bit of
weight running around that thing,'' she says. ``And I worked with
my choreographer, Jerry Evans, and got some new dance steps. My leg
is doing a lot better. It feels good. I've also had a personal
trainer and done a lot of physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you appreciate coming back and just being able to
walk. You don't take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's been her philosophy ever since she was a girl
in Oklahoma, the daughter of a rodeo competitor. It also explains
why she expects to return to skiing. ``Yes, I'll go back and try it
again,'' she says of skiing. ``It's kind of the way I was brought
up. If I got thrown off a horse, my daddy would always say, `Go,
get back on. No matter what, you got to get back on.' `` McEntire
also has starred in many movies, including ``Gambler IV'' (with
Kenny Rogers), in which she played a reformed madam. And she has an
upcoming film, ``Forever Love,'' due on CBS-TV in September, in
which she plays a woman who wakes up from a 20-year coma to
discover that her husband has changed radically and that hro
dramatic role, but I'm comfortable with it. And it has some funny
things in it. The writing is really good. . . . You cry and you
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The only misgiving of her recent career is that she had to give
up a role in the blockbuster film, ``Titanic.'' She auditioned for
director James Cameron and won the role of Molly Brown (later
played by Kathy Bates), but needed to give it up to fulfill some
concert commitments. ``I had the part, but then he needed me for
another three months beyond the three months we had already
scheduled. And I had my concert venues selected by that time,''
says McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have no regrets. Everything happens for a reason,'' she
adds. ``It would have been a wonderful movie to be a part of,
because it will in the history books forever as one of the greatest
movies of all time. But you can't cry over spilled milk. You've
just got to keep going.''

MAN ACCUSED OF SMUGGLING CHINESE IS SENTENCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The West Coast ringleader of a group that
smuggled 281 Chinese immigrants on two crowded fishing boats has
been sentenced to three years and nine months in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described John Luong, 27, of Elk Grove, Calif., as
the leader of a gang that led the immigrants ashore south of San
Francisco, where they were to be taken to New York to work off the
price of their passage.
</P>
<P>
   Luong, who was sentenced Monday, was one of 23 people charged in
the case. Of that group, 17 pleaded guilty earlier while Luong and
five others were convicted in March after a nine-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Luong ``supervised and directed the others'' in purchasing and
equipping the fishing boats used to smuggle the immigrants to
California, according to U.S. District Court records. In exchange
for $650,000, the records said, Luong arranged for the fraudulent
purchase of two vessels that met a trawler off-shore that had taken
the immigrants from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luong, in sum, was a ringleader in charge of a critical
component of the extensive smuggling operation,'' prosecutor Steven
Gruel said in court records.
</P>
<P>
   One boat landed at near Monterey, the other at Half Moon Bay on
the same day in June 1993. All the passengers were captured
immediately except for 19 who escaped and were found later in New
York, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of them were deported, except for a few who were
granted political asylum or married U.S. citizens, said Thomas
Schiltgen, district director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we have made a dent in this organized alien
smuggling'' with the conviction of Luong and his co-defendants,
Schiltgen said. ``Clearly in 1993 we were seeing a large increase
in the number of boats smuggling people in. ... He was clearly one
of the main organizers of this group.''
</P>
<P>
   The passengers paid $27,000 to $30,000 each for the trip and
were expected to work off the debt in brothels or other gang-run
operations in New York, Gruel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members testifying for the prosecution said three New
York-based Asian gangs met with California gangs to plan the
operation, and Luong agreed to arrange the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Luong's lawyer, Maureen Kallins, denied he was the ringleader
and asked for a sentence of about 2 1/2 years, the term given to
three other defendants in the case. She said he had a traumatic
childhood in wartime Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gruel sought a five-year sentence, saying the immigrants were
forced to live in miserable conditions below decks during their
four-day voyage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Let the Congress vote a reprimand, or whatever it needs
to get the Clinton sex scandal out of the way. It's not a matter of
forgiving Clinton; he demeaned himself. It's a matter of whether,
in the desire to punish him, the country and indeed the rest of the
world should be punished by distorting or incapacitating the U.S.
political system.
 &HT;    The United States has had some incompetent, dishonest, dreadful
presidents, and the system has survived them because the formal,
official decision of the voters is not taken lightly. Clinton has
irreparably tarnished himself, but he is by no means one of the
worst.
 &HT;    This man's difficulty in telling the truth about himself was
already on display in his first presidential campaign and he hasn't
improved. Now, his decision to defend himself with semantic
arguments is more of the same, on a level with the tawdry details
of Kenneth Starr's report of his dalliance in the corridors of
power.
 &HT;    There's something sophomoric about it, a contrast with the
energy and earnestness Clinton brings to public issues such as
education, health, the budget, foreign affairs. If that becomes a
reason to get rid of him, what kind of personal failing or
unpopularity might the precedent be enlarged to justify the next
time around?
 &HT;    There is a strong undertone of revenge from the right for the
ouster of Richard Nixon in this case. But any comparison of the two
cases is unwarranted because this is not about the exercise of
public power entrusted to the highest office. It is about the sort
of man he is, still a kind of defiant baby boomer when much of the
country wants to swing back from the excesses of the
counterculture.
 &HT;    He apparently can't change that part of himself, too bad for him
but not a danger to the national well-being. The danger comes if he
is rendered incapable of doing the part of his job that he can do.
Americans cannot expect to be understood by the citizens of any
other democracy if they put distaste for Clinton's personal
behavior above responsibility for performance in office.
 &HT;    In a way, the whole issue and its salaciously insistent public
airing is in tune with the violence and sex that have come to
dominate entertainment. What are we looking for, what do we reward?
 &HT;    The outpouring of admiration for the baseball star Mark McGuire
shows how much the country yearns for a hero who epitomizes hard
work and skill. But Americans are not likely to get politicians
with the traits they seek if the winners risk exposure and disgrace
for private habits.
 &HT;    The issue is no longer Clinton's behavior and evident character
flaws. It is about governance and constitutional precedent, not so
much the president but the presidency. In what circumstances is the
duly registered decision of the American electorate to be set
aside, invoking the provision for his removal from office?
 &HT;    The paralysis of the White House sex-and-lies scandal is hurting
not only the United States but all the countries affected by its
role in the world.
 &HT;    It is not surprising that in France, where unsanctified sex is
no scandal, President Jacques Chirac said, ``At a time when the
world is confronted with serious political and financial
uncertainty, it is essential for all of us that the president of
the United States is able to carry out his duties fully.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister Tony Blair echoed
the thought.
 &HT;    Everybody needs to know what Washington is up to. Everybody
wants Washington to pay attention to the major problems of wars,
nuclear risks and economic distress that are confronting the world.
Is that a reason for Clinton to resign or be impeached and tried?
 &HT;    I say no. The constitutional precedent is too dangerous. In
American history, only one president ever resigned because
impeachment was almost certain and conviction quite possible. That
was Nixon, who faced grave charges of abuse of public power.
 &HT;    To expand these grounds to forcing out a president because he
has been shown to be a moral embarrassment in his private affairs
and because of his tricky attempts to avoid admitting them in
public would be a big step toward changing the whole system and
opening it to further, more arbitrary reasons for overruling an
election.
 &HT;    The American system, unlike that of parliamentary countries,
relies on fixed election dates that cannot be changed. No lack of
confidence can unseat the chosen leader, and if he dies or is
unable to continue, there is a clear list of succession determined
by the previous election. Recourse is to be found in the next
election.
 &HT;    Of course, it is dismaying to find that a president does not
live up to the higher than average standards which the country
would like to see in its chief representative. Whether they approve
of him or not, people would like a president they can respect.
Maybe next time.

<P>
   &UR; Through Customs In 15 to 20 Seconds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The quick passage through immigration control that is now used
by business travelers at six airports may soon be open to leisure
travelers who re-enter the country at least three times a year. The
electronic recognition system gives the green light to an enrolled
passenger in 15 to 20 seconds; 70,000 business travelers are
enrolled now.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The system, which reads a plastic card, then recognizes a
traveler's hand inserted in a kiosk that looks like an ATM, is in
operation at international terminals at John F. Kennedy, Newark,
Miami, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Immigration offices at these airports approve business travelers
for a free one-year certification to use the system, which is
called Inspass: Immigration and Naturalization Service Accelerated
Service System. Inspass is free now, but Thomas Andreotta of the
Immigration Service says that eventually there will be a charge for
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will soon join the list of Inspass airports; in
1999, Honolulu, Seattle and Washington Dulles will, too. After that
will come, not necessarily in this order: Atlanta, Chicago,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis and Montreal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of Canada, Bermuda and 26 other countries in the Visa
Waiver Pilot Program who enter the United States regularly may also
qualify for Ins-pass. Steps to open it to other frequent travelers
are planned for next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to speed through travelers who are considered low
risk so the Immigration staff can concentrate on the rest.
Application information is available from the INS offices at the
six airports. INS form I-823 can also be obtained from the
Internet: www.usdoj.gov/ins/forms.

   &UR; Minneapolis Celebrates Enlarged Art Museum &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of renovation and expansion, the Minneapolis
Institute of Arts plans to make merry next Sunday with live bands,
food, street performers and carriage rides on its premises and in
the adjacent park.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to celebrate. The institute's 1915 neo-classical
building, designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, has 33 new galleries
behind the original structure and 74 renovated galleries.
Exhibition space is up by 65 percent, making room for 4,000 works
of art, more than triple the number exhibited in 1988. The $150
million ``revitalization'' also included the restoration of the
museum's original Beaux-Arts ceiling and skylight, hidden since a
1930's renovation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that building and scrubbing allowed for a reinstallation of
the museum's permanent collection. Along with the European and
American paintings, which include Rembrandt's ``Lucretia'' and
works by van Gogh, Cezanne, Poussin, Monet and Picasso, visitors
will see more art from Asia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two new galleries are devoted to some 1,500 Asian
objects, which range from Chinese paintings, sculpture, ceramics,
jade and textiles to paintings, screens and sculpture from Japan,
as well as Buddhist, Southeast Asian, Indian, Islamic and Himalayan
art. They opened in late August.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include a section of Frank Lloyd Wright's 1914
Francis W. Little house, which is being brought in from Deep-haven,
Minn., and 20 interactive computer kiosks that allow visitors to
custom-design tours.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, which is closed on Monday, is
at 2400 Third Avenue So.; (612) 870-3000. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Coming-Out Party for Grand Central &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, habitues of Grand Central Terminal had to think
hard to recall a time when the place wasn't a mess, first from
neglect, more recently as a construction site. But as the 500,000
people who pass through daily may have noticed, the vast two-year
project to restore and modernize the 85-year-old station is just
about over at last.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, the station will be rededicated on Oct. 1 at 11
a.m. in an hourlong ceremony in the Main Concourse presided over by
E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. Festivities will include a trapeze act by the Big Apple
Circus, a laser show, a documentary by the History Channel and a
performance by the Westchester Philharmonic of ``Grand Central,'' a
commissioned work replete with the sound of whistles and clattering
trains by Bruce Saylor, a New York composer. Antique trains will be
parked on the tracks from Oct. 1 through 5. And the Big Apple
Circus and artists from Music Underground will perform for
commuters in the Main Concourse on Oct. 2 at 7:30 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The station's most obvious improvements are those befitting a
world-famous architectural landmark. Every inch of the fabled Sky
Ceiling, Caen stone walls and Tennessee marble floors will have
been cleaned and repaired. A new staircase on the concourse's east
side, following the original design of Grand Central's architect,
Whitney Warren, will enhance the building's symmetry. The former
Main Waiting Room, now Vanderbilt Hall, will offer art exhibitions,
concerts and civic events. And the balcony will be home to a series
of restaurants that overlook the cleaned-up concourse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More restaurants and snack shops are due on the lower level,
which offers two public dining areas. And perhaps best of all,
Grand Central Terminal is now fully heated and air-conditioned.

DIGGING FOR FATTY TREASURES IN ANIMAL BONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is dinnertime at Judson Grill in midtown
Manhattan, and typically, a good number of customers have ordered
the grilled dry-aged sirloin with rosti potatoes, bone marrow, pea
leaves and carrots. The marrow comes tucked inside a section of
bone standing at attention alongside the steak, a tiny spoon at the
ready.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than just marrow in the bone. Beneath slices of
the tender, unctuous, delicately meaty tasting substance, there is
a bit of shallot-and-red-wine custard, a perfect complement to the
marrow's seductively mellow texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the time the bones come back empty,'' William
Telepan, the chef, said. ``But plenty of people don't even touch
them; they just want the steak and potatoes. People either like
marrow or they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   I happen to love marrow, and can remember, as a child, fighting
with my mother over which one of us would get the marrow when she
made braised veal shanks. Later, as an adult, I would be
disappointed when my portion of osso buco in a restaurant had an
empty bone instead of one filled with what I considered to be a
treat.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone who loves marrow, indulging in it has suddenly
become easier. Judson Grill will even serve the
marrow-and-custard-filled bones separately, without the steak. One
of the most attention-grabbing appetizers at Michael Jordan's the
Steakhouse N.Y.C. in Grand Central Station is a plate of marrow
bones with coarse salt, wild herb salad and mustard-toasted
baguette.
</P>
<P>
   And for the last six years, the most popular dish at Blue Ribbon
in SoHo has been marrow bones served with oxtail marmalade, foie
gras on toast and salted parsley. Bring your own cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dish is pretty tough to beat when it comes to fatty,''
Eric Bromberg, an owner of the restaurant, said. ``So many people
order it that we're starting to serve it at the bakery,'' he said,
referring to Blue Ribbon Bakery, his new restaurant in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow is the soft, fatty substance found primarily in long
bones, like the shin and shanks. It is one of the richest foods. An
ounce of marrow has nearly 300 calories, and is virtually all fat,
according to statistics published by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations and the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Like foie gras, which is also buttery soft and fat, bone marrow
begs for a sharp counterpoint, like a few grains of salt or a touch
of acid, to balance the richness. The flavor is mildly meaty.
</P>
<P>
   When roasted inside the shank bone instead of being poached
separately, bone marrow sometimes takes on a slight nuttiness. And
depending on how it is prepared, its color can range from pale to
rosy to caramel brown.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little consensus, especially among chefs, as
to how marrow is best prepared and served. At Firebird in the
Theater District, Ari Nieminen, who uses marrow to enrich borscht
and places a bone marrow flan alongside roasted salmon, also serves
marrow bones simply roasted with toast, sea salt and a tangy bit of
parsley relish like a gremolata, the classic garnish for osso buco.
</P>
<P>
   At Citronelle in Washington, Michel Richard uses a hollowed-out
cylinder of a roasted potato instead of a bone as a container for
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest method is simply to roast it in its bone. Alain
Sailhac, the executive vice president of the French Culinary
Institute, recommends wrapping sections of marrow-filled bones in
foil and putting them in the oven for about 30 minutes. ``Keeping
it in the bone protects it,'' he said. ``The foil prevents it from
melting out.''
</P>
<P>
   The butcher will saw marrow bones to the length you want; two to
three inches is usually the best size. Longer than that and it
becomes difficult to extract the marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Child, who applauds a return to foods in the classic
French tradition, like bone marrow, said that the French also opted
for simplicity. ``We just cracked the bones, dug out the marrow and
poached it,'' she said. ``But it wasn't something we'd do on a 90
degree day.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the French love marrow so much that an excellent little
restaurant in Paris is named L'Os a Moelle _ the Marrow Bone. Just
try a name like that in New York. You might as well call your
restaurant Tripe.
</P>
<P>
   The English and French often spread marrow on toast, but it is
not one of those items that shows up with any frequency in
cookbooks. And you have to be careful, because in cookbooks from
England, marrow, or vegetable marrow, is also the name used for for
green squash.
</P>
<P>
   Clear instructions for handling marrow are in ``La Varenne
Pratique'' by Anne Willan (Crown Publishers, 1989). The essential
point to remember, Ms. Willan writes, is that when poaching marrow
that has been extracted from the bone, the liquid must never boil.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking time is rief; otherwise the marrow will melt.
Poaching it in milk, as some chefs do, instead of in salted water
or broth, will keep the color whiter.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs first soak the bones or the extracted marrow in
several changes of salted water for anywhere from several hours to
several days to remove the blood. Sailhac said that step is not
necessary for home cooks. ``Restaurants do that so the marrow will
keep better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, they need to keep marrow on hand, and not only
to serve in stately bones. Instead of a pat of seasoned butter, a
slice of warm marrow to garnish a steak is a time-honored
preparation that can be found at Chanterelle in TriBeCa and Patroon
in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs, including Geoffrey Zakarian at Patroon, use marrow
to thicken a sauce, especially the classic Bordelaise.
</P>
<P>
   Marrow has also been a partner for seafood, typically rouget,
the assertively-flavored Mediterranean red mullet. I recall eating
baby turbot with marrow in red wine sauce at the Dorchester Hotel
in London in the mid-1980s. It was the first time I had marrow with
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now at Aquavit in midtown, Marcus Samuelsson adds a puree of
marrow and shallots to his halibut. At La Fourchette, a new
restaurant on the Upper East Side, Marc Murphy tops seared sea
scallops with slices of lightly caramelized marrow and fresh
truffles, a dish he learned when he was working at Miravile in
Paris.

 NEW YORK: in Paris.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tangle of salad in vinaigrette dressing helps marry the
flavors. Gilles Epie, the former owner of Miravile who has moved to
America, prepares a dish of scallops with marrow at Gilles, his new
restaurant in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where marrow lovers can count on osso buco, marrow is
used to enrich risotto, which Zakarian does at Patroon.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that serve marrow slices do not have to bother with
special implements. But for eating marrow in style, there are the
long narrow marrow spoons made in Europe. And about the only source
for them is Savoir Vivre, a company in Philadelphia that
specializes in hard-to-find utensils for cooking and serving. (The
Georgian-designed, silver-plated spoons are $38 each, or $400 a
dozen; for information, 215-625-7964.)
</P>
<P>
   An espresso spoon, which many restaurants use, is a reasonably
effective substitute. But now at Michael Jordan's, David Walzog,
the chef, has started splitting the marrow bones, roasting them
open-face and serving them flat on the plate instead of like tree
trunks. It is easier to eat, Walzog said, and the marrow becomes
more caramelized and tasty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all this fancy presentation and cachet, bone marrow is
really pretty lowly stuff. We're not talking about caviar or
truffles here. A pound of bones, containing enough rich marrow to
sate at least three people, will set you back 99 cents at Oppenheim
on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   At Lobel's, a carriage trade Madison Avenue butcher, the bones
are $1.98 a pound. And they'll crack them for you and even scoop
out the marrow, if you prefer, at no extra charge. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BONE MARROW CANAPES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 3-inch beef marrow bones
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 baguette, about 2 inches in diameter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wrap bones individually in a
double thickness of cheesecloth, then in foil. Place in a roasting
pan, and bake for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. While bones are baking, combine shallots and wine in a small
nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a simmer, and cook until almost all
the wine has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Allow roasted bones to cool until they can be handled. Remove
marrow, and discard bones.
</P>
<P>
   4. Chop the marrow finely, and place in a mixing bowl. Add
shallot mixture, parsley, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   5. From the baguette, cut 12 slices, { inch thick. Toast until
golden brown. Mound the marrow mixture on the toasts, and serve as
an hors d'oeuvre. The marrow mixture may also be served without
toast as a topping for filet mignon or grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings (12 canapes).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BONE MARROW FLAN WITH STEAK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Judson Grill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 6 hours, including refrigeration &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 2-inch beef marrow bones, both ends cut to expose the marrow
(the bones should be smooth and cylindrical for the most attractive
appearance)
</P>
<P>
   { cup minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   } cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups milk
</P>
<P>
   8 10- to 12-ounce boneless sirloin strip steaks
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Chill marrow bones at least one hour. Using a long thin
knife, cut around the inside surface of the bone and push out the
marrow in one piece. Place marrow in a bowl of cold water, and
refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. While marrow is refrigerated, place empty bones in a pot and
cover with water. Simmer until all the fat and meat scraps can
easily be scraped away, about 2 hours. Remove bones from water,
scrape them clean and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare flan: In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine
shallots and wine. Bring to a simmer, and cook until almost all the
wine has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow
to cool. In the container of a blender or food processor, combine
cream, eggs and shallot mixture. Puree until smooth. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Strain through a fine strainer, and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place teakettle of water over
high heat to bring to a boil. Wrap one end of each bone tightly,
first with plastic wrap, then with foil. Stand each bone up in a
deep roasting pan with the foil on the bottom. Pour the flan
mixture into the bones, filling them up halfway. Cover pan with a
lid or heavy-duty foil, and place in oven. Bake for 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven but keep in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   5. Prepare a hot grill or broiler. Remove marrow from cold
water, and cut into slices { inch thick. Grill or broil the strip
steaks to taste. While steaks are cooking, place milk in a small
skillet over low heat and bring to a slow simmer. Add marrow
slices, and poach until the surfaces are smooth and they are heated
through, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, place each steak on a plate. Carefully remove the
foil and plastic from each bone, and place a bone, flan side down,
on each plate. Fill the empty top halves of each bone with the
poached marrow slices. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

unlikely to be recognized. Within the Industry, however, it has
absolute resonance. Limato is one of a handful of talent agents at

TOO BUSY? SAVOR SAKI AS A CURATIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people who once read much now read not at all. I hear their
complaints. They would like to read but are altogether too busy to
tackle a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Short stories, perhaps? Too busy even for that. Time enough to
skim the newspaper and that's all.
</P>
<P>
   I have a solution that will make happy readers of even the most
time-pressed folk, while also acquainting them with superior
literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Simple. They must read Saki.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't an Oriental liquid or vehicle conveyance. It's an
author, well nigh an inimitable one.
</P>
<P>
   Stories by Saki are short, shorter, shortest; and almost every
one is some kind of literary gem. In five or six pages, more often
three or four, sometimes only two, this once-to-a-world author
offers well-carpentered tales that have beginnings, middles, and
delicious endings. It's entertainment all the way as Saki parlays
Wodehousian drollery with O. Henry trickery. While en route, he
adds touches of Damon Runyon and Stephen King, always lacquering
the issue with an irony entirely his own.
</P>
<P>
   Who was he?
</P>
<P>
   Hector Hugh Munro was born in Burma (1870) of English parents,
both of whom died during his early childhood. He was raised in
England by two maiden aunts, but in adulthood he returned to Burma
as a military policeman. At age 29, he settled in London, intending
a career as a historian; and just before the century's turn his
``The Rise of the Russian Empire'' was published _ the only work
under his baptismal name.
</P>
<P>
   While roving Europe as a newspaper correspondent, Munro was
making a name for himself _ another name _ via short, fanciful
pieces that appeared in various periodicals. They were bylined
Saki; no one knows why. The early tales centered on an irreverent
young Englishman named Reginald; and in 1904 ``Reginald'' was
Saki's first published collection, followed six years later by
``Reginald in Russia.'' He abandoned Reginald in favor of Clovis, a
similarly constituted fellow; and 1912 brought ``The Chronicles of
Clovis'' as well as ``The Unbearable Bassington,'' the first of
Saki's two novels.
</P>
<P>
   The Reginald and Clovis vignettes were satirical high comedies.
But in 1914, the great collection ``Beasts and Super Beasts''
broadened Saki's range and made him a household name, as he dipped
into the supernatural and the malevolent powers of dogs and other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with fame assured, Munro/Saki at age 44 volunteered for
military service in the Great War and was killed in France two
years later, in 1916. The collections ``The Toys of Peace'' and
``The Square Egg,'' incorporating some of his war experience, were
issued posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Saki only fortifies the notion that he was a really odd
bird, odd but a delight to read. For a stylistic sample, here's the
opening of ``The Open Window,'' one of my favorite Saki charades:
</P>
<P>
   `` `My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,' said a very
self-possessed young lady of fifteen; `in the meantime you must try
and put up with me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Framton Nuttel endeavored to say the correct something which
should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly
discounting the aunt that was to come. Privately he doubted more
than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total
strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was
supposed to be undergoing ...''
</P>
<P>
   The niece tells Nuttel of her aunt's ``great tragedy'' three
years earlier, when her husband and brothers perished in a bog,
their bodies never recovered. They left through the open window,
and the dotty aunt believes they will return the same way. And they
do! _ some swell nerve cure for Nuttel.
</P>
<P>
   In three pages, Saki gets the reader to shivering along with
Nuttel, until the sublime final sentence implicates the duplicitous
niece: ``Romance at short notice was her specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   Try Saki, even if you have lots of time to spare.

 RANGER-ART-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM LOWE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKENBURG, Ariz. _ Tex Hill admits his time as the Lone Ranger
was little more than a single clop amid the thundering hoofbeats
from those thrilling days of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his Lone Ranger got bushwhacked.
</P>
<P>
   Never got to Silver City. Never got to Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Never got to television, either.
</P>
<P>
   Hill discusses that episode in his life quite readily in the
bookstore he and his wife operate here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in 1960, after Clayton Moore and John Hart had both
retired from playing the Lone Ranger,'' he explains to those who
question his authenticity as the masked rider. ``I was picked to
play him in a television pilot called ``The Lone Ranger Rides
Again.'' But it fizzled. Nobody bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the memory lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Hill proudly displays photographs of himself as the Lone Ranger
and as other Western movie characters in an area of the bookstore
designated the Tex Hill Movie Cowboy Museum. The pictures show him
in a variety of outfits, portraying both good guys and villains.
But mostly good guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clayton Moore was the Lone Ranger,'' he tells those who stop
by. ``The rest of us were simply actors playing the Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never got to ride a big white stallion and save the
West for millions of young fans on the TV tube, he has some fond
recollections of the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The check didn't bounce, I got to ride in a limo and yell
`Hi-yo, Silver!' _ and best of all, I got to keep the costume,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstore is named Readers of the Purple Sage and offers a
good selection of memorabilia from the days of the B Western
movies. It may be the only place in Arizona that sells
black-and-white 8-by-10 glossies of Sunset Carson and Tim Holt,
books on the films of Johnny Mack Brown, and videos starring Allan
``Rocky'' Lane.
</P>
<P>
   As well as films and tapes featuring the work of Tex Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had small roles in such upper-level oaters as ``The
Alamo,''``The Magnificent Seven'' and ``Bandolero,'' and in such TV
shows as ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Bonanza'' and ``Rawhide.'' He said he also
appeared in other flicks, all Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were small pictures,'' Hill says with a wide grin. ``The
budgets were the smallest part. They shot most of them with only
one camera, and they could afford to rent only four horses. So the
bad guys saddled up and rode past the camera, then they'd dismount
and walk the horses back to makeup. They'd spray-paint them a
different color, then we'd mount up and ride past the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I got my own horse was to shoot one of the bad
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other dissimilarities between Hill's movies and those
starring the big heroes, such as Roy and Gene and Hoppy:
</P>
<P>
   Hill got to kiss the girl.
</P>
<P>
   At least he did once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew was a bunch of jokesters,'' he says. ``They told me
and my leading lady, Linda Leone, to hold the kiss until they said
stop. Then they all went to lunch. We could have been liplocked for
an hour if I hadn't opened my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill bought some of his films and put them on video. He plays
the singing sheriff and the misunderstood gunslinger. He admits
they're not top quality but adds, ``They were family movies. Nobody
got killed real bad, not like today.''
</P>
<P>
   His last movie was another low-budget offering, made in 1976. He
left the movies after that to concentrate on a musical career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last of the singing cowboys,'' he says, pointing out
the posters and still photos that bill him as ``The Rhinestone
Ranger.'' A display near the cash register offers his compact discs
and tapes, including ``How the West Was Sung'' and ``Song of the
Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   And, although he admits to ``hair by Clairol'' and Social
Security payments, he's still a singing cowboy. He appears
frequently in Arizona, and has engagements in Texas, California and
Oklahoma this month. Then he'll settle back down for a while in
Wickenburg to tend the store and the horses he and his wife,
Claudia, raise and train.
</P>
<P>
   He can still yodel up a pretty fair country tune, and if asked,
can recite most of the Lone Ranger prologue that preceded every
radio and television show. The one that goes:
</P>
<P>
   ``A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust, and a
hearty `Hi-yo, Silver.' . . . Return with us now to those thrilling
days of yesteryear. From out of the past came the thundering
hoofbeats of the great horse, Silver. The Lone Ranger rides
again!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hill tries to keep some of that era of make-believe from
vanishing like the hoofbeats and the buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good life,'' he says. ``I was in about 70 movies, and
I always got paid. But the best part was I got to grow up and be my
own childhood hero. Can't ask for much more than that.'' &QL;

<P>
   CLINTON-SCANDAL (Washington) _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, says many members of Congress believe that censuring
President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair would amount to
``trivializing'' allegations that include obstruction of justice
and abuse of power. By BENNETT ROTH and GREG McDONALD.
</P>
<P>
   PROBE-COST (Washington) _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr says
his office has spent $4.4 million investigating the Monica Lewinsky
affair. Overall, Starr has spent some $40 million in four years
investigating the Whitewater land deal and other allegations
against the Clintons. By STEVE LASH.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-LEGISLATION (Washington) _ The news out of Congress
these days dwells on how to proceed with allegations that President
Clinton committed impeachable offenses in trying to cover up a
lusty sexual affair. But there's plenty of national business left
on Congress' agenda, including tax cuts, budget issues and
health-care. By GREG McDONALD.
</P>
<P>
   BASE-CLOSINGS (Washington) _ Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says
congressional Republicans will drop their opposition to shuttering
more military bases and approve two more rounds of base closures
after the 2000 elections. Gramm says the savings will be used for
pay increases and weapons modernization. By GARY MARTIN.
</P>
<P>
   MARIJUANA-MEDICAL (Washington) _ The House is expected to
overwhelmingly approve a resolution sponsored by Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., declaring the chamber is ``unequivocally
opposed'' to legalizing marijuana for medicinal use. By JUDY
HOLLAND.

<P>
   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)

<P>
   TX-CLINTON-POLL (Undated) _ Texans' views of President Clinton
and his sex scandal were virtually unchanged by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress, according to a poll conducted
for the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News. Most of
those surveyed continue to think Clinton should stay in office, and
most continue to separate Clinton's presidential actions from his
personality. By ALAN BERNSTEIN. (Already filed)
</P>
<P>
   TX-IMMIGRANTS (Undated) _ The Border Patrol in the McAllen
sector _ the source of most illegal border crossings in Texas _
says it is releasing 1 out of every 4 suspected illegal immigrants
arrested. The reason is that more and more of those apprehended are
from countries other than Mexico and there is insufficient space
for holding them for background checks. By JAMES PINKERTON.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The House is already politically
polarized over the question of impeachment; there is no prospect
that this will be handled impartially. The president is never going
to get off the hook; he will have to resign or accept a censure
resolution. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   BBN-ASTROS (Houston) _ One day after sewing up their second
consecutive National League Central Division title, the Houston
Astros have little time to savor their conquest as they face the
New York Mets in a doubleheader at the Astrodome. Shane Reynolds
goes for his 19th victory of the season, which would tie him for
the league lead. By JOSEPH DUARTE.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-DIERKER (Houston) _ It was a joke from coast to coast when
the Houston Astros named longtime broadcaster Larry Dierker as
their manager before the 1997 season. But after guiding the Astros
to two division titles in his first twos seasons, Dierker and the
Astros' brass are enjoying the last laugh. By JOSEPH DUARTE.

SQUASH RISOTTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (This is the fifth of eight columns by Charlie Palmer, chef and
owner of Aureole in Manhattan. Judith Choate collaborated).  
 By CHARLIE PALMER  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an Italian risotto maestro approaches the dish, it is
almost always with the intention of producing a risotto that has a
thick, creamy consistency. But some time back, I started
experimenting with a looser, lighter version that requires less
painstaking attention than the traditional approach.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to prefer it as a delicate first course or, garnished
with duck confit or sauteed seafood, as a satisfying main course.
(I haven't given up on the thicker classic, which I still think is
the better choice when served as a foundation for more substantial
portions of meat or poultry.)
</P>
<P>
   In an autumn frame of mind, and to simplify my light risotto
even further, what I present here is an uncomplicated, pure
showcase for sweet squash. Practically all parts of the spectrum of
hard-skinned squashes and little pumpkins are candidates for the
dish: Hubbard, turban, Australian blue butternut and delicata are
just a few of them. Their colors and mellow flavors sing fall at
the table.
</P>
<P>
   This risotto is enriched with a puree of squash, onion and
nutmeg. Then, in place of the duck or the seafood that I'd
typically lean toward in the restaurant, I garnish the dish with
only a bit of blanched squash and fresh herbs. The tender-crisp
squash crowning the risotto provides textural variation, of course,
but it is also a visual key to the soft flavors hidden in each
kernel of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've taken some liberties with this dish, I don't want
to yield on the quality of the rice. This risotto still requires,
as the traditional version does, one of the Italian short-grain
rices, like Arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano. All of them possess
the starchiness necessary to produce a creamy, brothlike liquid,
which will embrace the firm, al dente center of the cooked rice.
</P>
<P>
   And I want to urge you to use a good homemade chicken stock,
knowing full well that you probably won't feel you have the time to
do it (unless you're one of those foresighted individuals who
prepare a big batch and then freeze it for recipes like this one).
</P>
<P>
   More likely, you're going to turn to one of the canned broths,
but be sure to stick to the low-sodium ones or you will lose any
chance of controlling the saltiness of the final dish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WINTER SQUASH RISOTTO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { pound (about 1{ cups) finely diced fresh winter squash
(Hubbard, butternut, kabocha or sugar pumpkin)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1\ teaspoons freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   } cup medium-dry California riesling
</P>
<P>
   7 cups chicken stock or low-sodium canned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups Arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   { cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, and add 3
tablespoons of the diced squash. Cook until barely tender, about 2
minutes; then drain, and rinse under cold water. Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil, and add
the remaining squash, { cup of the onion, nutmeg, white pepper and
salt to taste. Saute, stirring frequently, until the squash is
almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the wine, and cook, stirring
occasionally, for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.
In a food processor or blender, puree until smooth. Transfer to a
bowl, and set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the stock in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to very low, just to keep the stock hot. In a medium
heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat, melt 2{ tablespoons of the
butter. Add the rice and remaining { cup of onion, and stir well
with a wooden spoon until the onion is translucent, about 5
minutes. Immediately add about 1{ cups of hot stock or just enough
to cover the rice. Simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, adding a cup of stock about every 3 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Add the winter squash puree, and stir well. Simmer for 9
minutes more, continuing to add stock every few minutes, until all
of the stock has been used. Add the remaining 2{ tablespoons of
butter and the parsley. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter
has been completely absorbed, about 3 minutes. Adjust the salt and
pepper to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Spoon equal portions of risotto into 6 warm soup bowls.
Garnish the center of the risotto with reserved squash dice.
Sprinkle each bowl with Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

VOTERS AREN'T AS DUMB AS THE POLLSTERS THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe I put too little stock in instantaneous
telephone polls or just don't grasp the big picture. But I can't
accept the idea that ``disillusioned Democrats'' are likely to
react to the Monica Lewinsky scandal by refusing to vote for
Democratic gubernatorial and congressional candidates in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   According to a number of doom-intoning news stories that I have
read, Democrats and Republicans alike believe that President
Clinton's disaster can't help but become every Democrat's disaster.
Because of hurt feelings, disgust, a sense of betrayal _ name your
victimhood _ tens of thousands of Democrats are supposed to simply
``stay home'' on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Especially women Democrats, who helped Bill Clinton and Al Gore
vanquish the Republicans in '92 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   These predictions are based on vaguely-worded opinion polls
(usually taken six or seven minutes after the latest revelation
from Capitol Hill) and on the fact that congressional Democrats
took a drubbing in '94. As that theory goes, Democratic voters were
so disillusioned/disgusted or apathetic that they didn't bother to
get off their rear ends and vote for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Monica, the primary reason was the Clinton
administration's botched attempt at health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the supposedly sophisticated exit polls and
post-election analysis, do we really know why people decide to vote
or not? For all the hundreds or thousands who tell a pollster, ``I
stayed home because of botched health care reform,'' how many
people might answer, ``I was too busy.'' Or ``I meant to, but my
kid got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, how many might admit, ``The number of ballot
measures finally paralyzed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 11 days after the president's lame apology to the
nation, a Republican pollster named Ed Goeas told The Associated
Press: ``The Democrats are not as likely to be interested in the
(November) election. They are less intense about voting and about
supporting their candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Goeas pointed to ``his own detailed survey of voter
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to cast aspersions on that or any survey, but how can
someone feel comfortable generalizing about millions of voters,
possible voters and possible non-voters? Particularly in this day
of instant and incessant ``Whaddaya think?'' queries by everybody
from CNN to your neighborhood shopping monthly?
</P>
<P>
   As disgusted, disillusioned and betrayed as I might feel by Bill
Clinton _ and, to tell the truth, I'm still not sure what I feel
about him _ I can't imagine transferring any of that to the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Why would I?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I'm a registered Democrat who tends to vote for
Democrats. Given the choice between the priorities I hear
Republicans and Democrats touting this year, I remain inclined
toward the Democratic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I know that, whether he campaigns for them or not, Bill
Clinton is not Sen. Barbara Boxer or any other Democrat who is up
for election. And Clinton's penchant for illicit sex and lying
about it hasn't been adopted by the party as behavior to be
emulated by all.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it would give me much satisfaction if Democrats picked up
the 11 seats they've got a shot at in Congress. And I would dearly
love to see a Democrat in the California governor's mansion for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to help make that happen, of course, is to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there really are millions of Democrats out there who would
feel worse going to the polls than they would at the prospect of a
Republican sweep. I'm not one of them. And it's hard to believe so
many people could be so dumb. Especially women.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenneth Johnson, the chef at the Terrace restaurant
at Columbia University, uses pantyhose to strain consomme.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound bizarre, but actually, he says, it works better
than cheesecloth. The hosiery is so fine that it prevents any small
particles from filtering through and clouding the soup. And because
it fits so snugly _ he stretches a double layer over a bowl, and
ties it under the rim _ it is easier to work with.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever little trick, one of many in the restaurant
world. And some of them are useful at home, too. Chefs are always
devising new ways to execute their ideas: they are under constant
pressure to be original, but time is at a premium, and so is money.
</P>
<P>
   So when conventional kitchen equipment can't accomplish what
they want it to do, they look for other ways to get the job done.
That may mean rigging together a few pans to make a smoker or using
a melon baller to make chocolate curls. Or it could mean heading to
the hardware or drugstore to hunt down a solution.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, impromptu innovations have turned into standard
equipment. Take, for instance, the tower of salad, that perfectly
cylindrical, compact mass of greens that sticks up like a giant
thimble on the plate at Windows on the World and Monkey Bar.
</P>
<P>
   No, the leaves are not stacked one by one like bricks to make a
tower. Instead, a paper cup that has its bottom cut off or a short
section of plastic pipe is set on the plate, filled with salad and
then lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   But David Burke, the chef at Park Avenue Cafe, takes equipment
innovation to a new level. Take this man to a Home Depot, and you
may never see him again. He especially likes his power drill. Using
a doorknob bit, he blasts holes into blocks of ice to make what he
calls ``an abstract mountain of ice that has caves in it and
ledges.'' Oysters are served on this mountain. A smaller bit is
used to shave the kernels off the ends of an ear of corn to make
handles for holding it.
</P>
<P>
   Back on planet Earth, he also has a few more practical ideas _
like his method for oiling a griddle or grill. He uses a paint
roller with a tea towel wrapped and tied around it. This gives just
a thin coating of oil and when grilling, prevents fires from
flaring up.
</P>
<P>
   Regulars at Bouley Bakery, brace yourselves. That lovely,
fragrant steamed fish is, I'm afraid, wrapped and cooked in plastic
wrap. William Schutz, the chef de cuisine, lays the fish and
seasonings on a piece of plastic wrap, closes it and places it in a
stainless-steel steamer (normally, you would place the fish
directly in the steamer). He insists the plastic wrap seals in all
the cooking juices so that none are lost in the steamer.
</P>
<P>
   But chefs are amateurs when compared with pastry chefs: they are
innovation fiends. Perpetually discontent with the tools and molds
they have at hand, they are constantly fiddling and retooling. A
trip to a junk shop or even a Staples can send tremors of creative
energy through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look for something that will set your work apart,'' said
Krista Kern, the pastry chef at the Norwich (Conn.) Inn and Spa.
``So you're not using a mold that's mass-produced.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Ms. Kern had curtain rods cut down to fit on a sheet
pan. She wraps them with 10-inch-by-12-inch rectangles of phyllo
and bakes them to make phyllo straws to fill with chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Torres, the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000, molds
chocolate with bubble wrap, among other things. He pours melted
chocolate over the bubble wrap, then chills it. It hardens into a
heavily textured layer of chocolate that can be broken up into
jagged pieces and used for garnishing. He does the same thing with
the plastic covers used over fluorescent light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Any nonporous surface can be used for molding chocolate. ``You
go to any bath supply place, and anything made out of acrylic can
be used,'' said Richard Leach, the pastry chef at Park Avenue Cafe.
He makes chocolate pops in an acrylic holder designed for
lipsticks. He coats the long thin slots with chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once solid, he fills them with a praline ganache, inserts a
Popsicle stick and freezes them. Then they come right out.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry chefs are also inclined to use almost anything as a
stencil. For cookies, Nick Malgieri, the director of the baking
program at Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, might cut a star
or some other design into the lid of a ricotta container. Then he
uses the lids to decorate the tops of cakes or cookies with
confectioners' sugar, or sets them on a baking sheet and brushes
tuile batter over them to form cookies in any number of shapes.
</P>
<P>
   For cakes, Torres likes to use the ornate grillwork seen on
prewar radiator covers. He lays the cover on an inch-deep baking
sheet lined with parchment and coats it with a sponge cake batter
tinted with food coloring. He removes the radiator grille, freezes
the parchment, then fills the rest of the pan with regular cake
batter and bakes it. When the cake is done, the geometric design is
baked into the cake. He inverts the cake and peels off the
parchment.
</P>
<P>
   Radiator stencils nothwithstanding, trying out an unconventional
tool is usually an effort at being practical, not flashy. ``A lot
of different things are for speed, but a lot are mostly out of
necessity,'' said Ms. Kern, the Norwich pastry chef.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when coating puff pastry or phyllo with melted
butter, Ms. Kern uses a plastic spray bottle rather than a brush.
``You can spray an entire surface delicately and lightly,'' she
said, and it's much quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lomonaco, the chef at Windows on the World, used to
roast salmon on expensive cedar planks. So he went to the lumber
yard and found a cheaper solution: untreated cedar roof shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, shingles. And, in fact, they get more pampering than the
fish. He soaks them in water for a few hours, then warms them on a
sheet pan in the oven and brushes them with oil. Finally the fish
is placed on top and roasted.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that no object, no tool, no doodad is denied entry
into the restaurant kitchen if it does the job.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., doesn't use
expensive pastry rings for baking, said Seen Lippert, who used to
cook there. ``Everybody brought in their empty cat food cans, and
we would cut off the bottoms,'' she said. In the dining room the
desserts were called flourless chocolate cakes. In the kitchen they
were known as cat-food tarts.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time you pay $68 for dinner there.
</P>
<P>
   So was Johnson at Terrace Restaurant just saving money when he
sprung for the pantyhose? No, he said. Inspiration struck one day
when he ran out of cheesecloth. So he went to the drugstore to pick
up some gauze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in, and I saw `sheer legs,' he said. ``And I don't
know why but a light went on.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

TAMING THE MANHATTAN CHERRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The maraschino cherry is a necessary evil in the
world of cocktails. No one may actually want to eat it, but what is
a manhattan without one?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hoffman, the owner of Savoy restaurant in SoHo, decided to
find out. He served manhattans without cherries. Then he tried
reconstituted dried cherries. Finally, he created a cherry that
might be the best part of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   When sour cherries came on the market this summer, Hoffman began
preserving them, using traditional techniques. ``We make a simple
sugar syrup with pomegranate molasses and add lemon juice,
allspice, black pepper and a few other spices,'' he said. ``We
poach the cherries in the syrup, cool them and pack them into
jars.'' The result is a delicious natural cherry with a wonderful
balance of sweet and sour.
</P>
<P>
   Having conquered the cherry, Hoffman tackled the onion, pickling
tiny fresh pearl onions in vinegar, salt, mustard seed, chili, bay
leaf and cloves. These sour morsels go into his martinis
(technically Gibsons, as martinis have olives).
</P>
<P>
   On request, Savoy makes martinis with Junipero gin, an
ultra-fragrant gin that smacks of juniper berries. It is made by
the Anchor Distilling Co. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Savoy is at 70 Prince Street, at Crosby Street; (212) 219-8570.
The manhattan and the martini are $9.

A FAST TOPPING FOR FRUIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a soft, ripe fruit, and top it with creme anglaise (a thin
custard), sabayon (a frothy egg-and-wine mixture) or another sweet
sauce. Run the whole thing under the broiler, and you have a
four-star dessert. The only problem is, luxurious sauces like these
take a fair amount of time and attention to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered, what if the fruit was topped with something fast and
easy? Thus began a lengthy process of elimination that ended only
when I made just about the easiest topping possible: sweetened
heavy cream, whipped just enough so that it held some of its body
when broiled. Even simpler, I found next, was sweetened sour cream,
which barely needs to be whisked.
</P>
<P>
   The toppings produce markedly different results. Sour cream is
thick, rich, flavorful and, obviously, sour. The whipped cream is
thinner and more saucy in texture. It also browns beautifully, and
_ especially if you begin with really good cream _ has a fresh
subtlety that cannot be matched. I like both choices, and between
the two of them I feel that I may never produce another sabayon, at
least not for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure that the fruit you use is perfectly ripe. You're going
to serve this dish with spoons, and the last thing you want to do
is have to reach for a knife and fork. In the past week, I have
used figs, pitted prune plums, strawberries, raspberries,
blueberries, peaches, and have also used them in various
combinations. They were all great, but if I had to pick a favorite
I suppose it would be peaches spiked with a few raspberries and
blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   Although this preparation is lightning-quick, cooking it takes
near-constant watchfulness. Get the broiler hot, place the dish
right under the heating element, and keep your eyes open. You want
the topping to burn a little bit _ it will smell like toasting
marshmallows _ but not too much. When the topping is nearly
uniformly brown, with a few black spots, it's done. The fruit will
not have cooked at all, but will have warmed slightly.
</P>
<P>
   10-MINUTE FRUIT GRATIN
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1{ pounds perfectly ripe soft fruit like peaches, plums,
berries, figs or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat broiler; set rack as close to heat source as possible
(even 2 inches is not too close).
</P>
<P>
   2. Wash, pit, stem and peel the fruit as necessary. Cut stone
fruit in halves or slices, as you prefer. Cut strawberries in thick
slices; leave smaller berries whole. Place the fruit (at least 2
cups full) in a baking or gratin dish just large enough to hold it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Whip cream with 2 tablespoons of sugar until it is thick and
just barely holding soft peaks; stir in the vanilla extract. Pour
cream over and around the fruit. Sprinkle with remaining sugar.
</P>
<P>
   4. Broil carefully, allowing cream to brown all over and even
burn in a couple of spots; rotate baking dish during broiling if
necessary. Remove and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Topping variation: Combine 1 cup sour cream with just enough
milk _ about \ cup _ so that you can whisk it smooth. Add 2
tablespoons sugar, and proceed as above, using 1 tablespoon brown
sugar for the topping.

 &HT;    STATES SLOW TO OBEY LAW BARRING RACE AS ADOPTION FACTOR
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not enough is being done to make sure states comply
with a law that makes it illegal to use race as a factor in placing
children adoptive homes, witnesses told Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, adoption case workers have tried to place children
with parents of the same race. But a 1994 federal law said race
could not be used as the only factor in adoptions, and a 1996
amendment went further, outlawing race as factor except in rare
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the legislation was intended to cut the length of
time children wait to be adopted. More than 59 percent of the
110,000 American children waiting to be adopted are African
American.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human
resources Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services went to great lengths to implement the 1994 act, but acted
more slowly and did less to help states implement the 1996
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy and a travesty,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw
Jr., R-Fla., the panel's chairman. ``I have long been committed to
attacking this problem of unequal treatment of minority children in
state custody, and after reading today's testimony I am even more
strongly committed to doing everything I can to shorten their stay
in foster care.''
</P>
<P>
   Compliance with the amendments varies. Olivia Golden, HHS
assistant secretary for children and families, said while some
agencies and states have been quick to enact reforms, others
continue to be cited for non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But former Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the main sponsor of
the 1994 act, blasted the department, telling the hearing that
every state has been found in violation of the 1996 law and that
the department needs to get tougher on those who don't comply,
especially those who receive federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Nadel of the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of
Congress, said HHS has done little to actually change the working
practices of adoption case workers. He said the department needs to
offer more practical advice to case workers and develop systems to
monitor how well states are complying.

WEATHER WARNING GETS STORMY RECEPTION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Listeners to two local stations were startled
recently when a tornado warning ostensibly originating with the
National Weather Service advised residents to ``grab your
bitches.''
</P>
<P>
   KROQ-FM (106.7) afternoon host Jed (the Fish) Gould added the
tag line when the original feed from the weather service was of
quality too poor to broadcast at the off-the-wall rock station.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's charming advice went out on the airwaves of KROQ and,
although he didn't know it at the time, on talk station KFI-AM
(640).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jed decided to add those three little words,'' said a KROQ
staffer who asked to remain anonymous. ``He had no idea it was
being fed to any other station but KROQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, for his part, wouldn't say what the reaction was around
the station but indicated he had gotten in a spot of trouble and
was absent from work the day after his customized weather warning.

</P>
<P>
   ``Every other format in Southern California plays only major
label artists,'' the Newport Beach-based disc jockey said.
</P>
<P>
   Poorman, who previously worked at KROQ, Groove 103.1, KIIS-FM
(102.7) and Power 106, is soliciting tapes from acts that want to
be on his Sept. 25 program, when he will attempt to break the
record for most songs played on radio within one hour.
</P>
<P>
   He's asking for tunes of a minute or less in duration.
``Anti-Radio'' can be heard from 5 to 6 p.m. weekdays on KORG,
which is based in Anaheim but broadcasts throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Send tapes to: Poorman, 177 Riverside Ave., Newport Beach,
Calif. 92663. Info: (949) 722-8785. Deadline for submissions is
Sept. 24.

SENATOR EXPECTS MORE BASE CLOSINGS AFTER 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm said Tuesday that Republicans in
Congress would drop their opposition to closing more military bases
and approve two more rounds of closures after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, R-Texas, said more bases need to be closed to slash
spending on facilities and redirect the money to pay increases for
armed services personnel and the modernization of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have two more base closure commissions, as painful as
it is going to be,'' Gramm told the group of 62 business leaders
from San Antonio, a city hard hit by the closing of the aircraft
repair facility at Kelly Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republicans in Congress have blocked the Clinton
administration's request for future rounds of base closings, citing
the president's involvement in decisions to close Kelly and
McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have charged that Clinton played politics by
intervening to protect Kelly and McClellan from immediate closure
to gain electoral support in his 1996 re-election bid, a charge the
president denied. The base closure process, established at the end
of the Cold War, is intended to be nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said ``Republicans are using Clinton's intervention as an
excuse'' to avoid the politically painful process of closing bases
no longer needed by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said he expects Congress, after the presidential election
in 2000, to ratify two additional rounds of closures to reduce
spending on installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sobering news for any community with a military
installation,'' he said, while adding that continued funding of
unnecessary bases is ``consuming money for pay increases and
modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio business delegation organizes yearly trips to
the nation's capital to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for
military missions and to protect local interests that are
intertwined with the military bases.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio lost the Kelly aircraft depot, then the largest
single-site employer in the region, during the 1995 round of base
closures. The Air Force plans turn the base over to the city in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders have lured the Boeing Co. and other tenants to the
facility as part of plans to redevelop Kelly as an industrial
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called those efforts a
success and pledged more help to shore up four other San Antonio
military bases that could be targets for future base closure
rounds.

A SEASON FOR HALLAH, BY THE THOUSAND ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOAN NATHAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Rosh ha-Shanah beginning on Sunday evening, the
Israel Beigel Baking Co., like other classic Jewish bakeries in New
York City, is in its high season for rugelach, honey cakes and the
traditional round New Year challahs _ more than 10,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers who patronize the Fairway markets, the Second Avenue
Deli and strictly kosher Ma-and-Pa groceries elsewhere in the New
York area will find round challahs and pastries from Beigel for
sale there this week _ though few outside the small community of
Bobover Hasidim of Borough Park, Brooklyn, know that this bakery in
the Williamsburg section of the borough has a heroic past.
</P>
<P>
   The Beigel family (the name is pronounced BUY-gull) had been in
business in Cracow, Poland, for five generations by the time the
Germans invaded in 1939. The Beigels are still revered for their
efforts to keep much of the community from starvation during the
occupation, when bakers were some of the few Jews who had access to
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nazis ordered us to make bread for the Germans, the ghetto
and the nearby camps,'' said Nechama Beigel Wislicki, 78, of
Borough Park, one of the few family members to survive Auschwitz.
``In the beginning, we had permission to go out from the ghetto and
carried very big pots, four of us together, and brought soup and
bread to the camps and factories where Jews were working.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Beigel house became a place where anyone who was hungry
could find not only food, but food prepared under the strictest
kosher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Nazis herded Jews into the ghetto,'' Mrs. Wislicki
said, ``the Jews sometimes sneaked to our apartment, where tables
and benches were set up, and we cooked 50 liters of soup. Everybody
got a nice piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, she recalled, about 50 people were hidden in
the Beigel home, sitting on hard benches arrayed around the
formerly elegant parlor. Many were so exhausted and famished that
they were slumped over their bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Rebbe, Schlomo Halberstam, came to us with his mother, his
mother-in-law and his sister, because they didn't have where to
go,'' Mrs. Wislicki said, speaking in Yiddish-influenced idiom.
``On Erev Yom Kippur'' _ the night before Yom Kippur, when a meal
is eaten before the fast _ ``my mother didn't have what to cook.
She served the noodles with water so they wouldn't be so dry, and
maybe a piece of bread. There was nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, the Germans liquidated the ghetto and sent
the Jewish population, including the Beigel family, to
concentration camps, where Mrs. Wislicki's parents and sister died.
The three surviving children went to New York in 1947, where they
began their lives and the Beigel Bakery from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' Mrs. Wislicki said. ``And now I have 3
children, 24 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.'' Another
branch of the family went to Israel before the war, and Beigel &AMP;
Beigel is now a famous brand of baked goods there.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish bakeries like Beigel in Brooklyn and Gertel's Moishe's on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan make challahs that are a definite
cut above the common squishy aerated commercial variety. The dark
crust gleams and the inside has a perfect balance between body and
lightness _ it's a serious hunk of bread without being heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The rugelach from Beigel look homemade _ they vary a bit in
size. The cream cheese rugelach manage to be flaky like pastry and
moist like brownies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack Lebewohl, the owner of the Second Avenue Deli, Beigel
chocolate rugelach are the only ones to pass muster. ``They're a
commercial bakery but still do it the old-fashioned way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Scharf, 83, who now lives in London, has vivid memories
of one of Beigel's five branches in Cracow. ``I have this smell
even now of the bread,'' he said. ``We Cracovians liked to joke
about the name Beigel, that it came from this bakery.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, it was the other way around: beigel is Yiddish for
bagel, and when the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II required Jews to
take surnames in the late 18th century _ what better one than this
for a local bagel maker?)  &QL;

<P>
   Time: 1 hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus two-thirds cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
</P>
<P>
   6 firm, ripe peaches, peeled and cut into medium slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   5 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract

soft peaks; do not overbeat. Using a rubber spatula, fold the
sifted flour into the egg whites. Fold the egg white mixture into
the beaten egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour the batter evenly over the fruit in the baking dish,
making sure the fruit is completely covered. Bake until golden, 30
to 40 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with confectioners'
sugar. Serve immediately.

CRISP QUICHE CRUSTS

<P>
   Q: My quiche crust is always slightly soggy. Is there a trick to
insure a dry crust?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there is, and James Beard knew it. In his ``Theory and
Practice of Good Cooking,'' he explained that quiche crusts are
subject to sogginess, since the filling is quite liquid.
</P>
<P>
   His trick was to spread the bottom of a partially baked crust
with a thin layer of beaten whole egg, beaten egg white, egg yolk
or Dijon mustard, then to return the crust to the oven to dry. The
egg or mustard creates a barrier, which helps keep the filling from
seeping into the pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Beard's instructions are: Bake the pastry at 425 degrees for 14
to 16 minutes, then brush it with either mustard or egg. Return the
crust to the oven for two minutes. Do not fill the crust until just
before baking (it can rest on a cooling rack for several hours if
necessary).
</P>
<P>
   Quiche is best hot or warm, and should not be refrigerated
before serving. Melissa Clark &QL;

SURVEY GIVES HMO HIGH MARKS FOR HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new survey of health maintenance organizations
in California gives high marks to Kaiser Permanente for both
preventive care and customer satisfaction, while lower scores went
to fast-growing Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of service to about 80,000 customers, including
reviews of 60,000 patient charts, is by the California Cooperative
Healthcare Reporting Initiative, a coalition of businesses, health
plans, physician and hospital groups set up to monitor the quality
of HMOs. It was released Tuesday to coincide with the beginning of
open enrollment season, during which workers can switch among plans
offered by their employer.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of customers surveyed had no recent complaints at
Kaiser Permanente North, which has 2.8 million members in Northern
California and is the largest in the region. Eighty-four percent
also said they'd recommend the plan to friends or family.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also scored above average for its rates of cervical and
breast cancer screenings, prenatal care, administering beta
blockers after heart attacks, and immunizing children and teens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Ralston, Kaiser's director of quality demonstration,
said the data show that the health plan's group model delivers
better care. Under it, health plan members go only to Kaiser
facilities and see doctors who are part of the Kaiser Permanente
medical group. Those doctors, in turn, see only Kaiser patients.
</P>
<P>
   The other HMOs surveyed use networks of doctors and hospitals,
who may treat patients from a variety of plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's close-knit nature and its automated patient files mean
it can keep track of members who haven't gotten recommended
check-ups. Gaps generate reminder cards that urge people to come in
for tests or immunizations, Ralston said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Blue Shield of California, while not tremendously
dissatisfied, gave their HMO less-than-average marks on its
referral process and on how well physicians explain tests and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate review of patient files, the survey found
below-average rates for cervical and breast cancer screenings,
adolescent immunizations and check-ups for mothers after
childbirth. In only one category, administering beta blocker
treatment after heart attacks, did it receive an above-average
score.
</P>
<P>
   That could be because Blue Shield, which instituted two programs
in the last year, is feeling growing pains from adding 30 percent
more members, said Dr. Alan Feren, the plan's Northern California
regional medical director. One new program lets members see
specialists in the network without a referral and another offers
coverage for alternative treatments, including chiropractic visits,
acupuncture and massage therapy.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of new patients means it isn't as easy to locate files
containing reports of screenings and other preventive care. If the
file couldn't be found, the survey counted it as a service not
rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Feren said the plan, which serves nearly 700,000 members
in Northern California, is concerned about the numbers and vows to
do better soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly that when the dust settles, we will be equal
or better than our competitors,'' Feren said.
</P>
<P>
   The report card is the first of several HMO quality scorecards
expected to be released in the coming month.

<P>
   ST.-CYR-DU-RONCERAY, France _ Normandy is so close to Paris that
wise guys sometimes call it the 21st arrondissement. Which no doubt
explains why, in the old days, Normandy's Calvados, or apple
brandy, was the capital's favorite tipple. To a degree, it still is
_ not so much in the grand hotels and the restaurants showered with
stars, but in the bars, bistros and brasseries frequented by
ordinary folk.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee and a glass of Calvados _ a ``ti Calva'' _ conclude
many a jolly Parisian evening.
</P>
<P>
   Calvados resembles the applejack beloved by old-time Yankees,
but at its best, after careful aging in wood, it has far greater
finesse. The art lies in taming the fire of the newly distilled
spirit without losing the distinctive taste of the fruit. Some
inferior Calvados is aggressive; some is smooth enough but might
have been made of potatoes or grapes instead of apples.
</P>
<P>
   Normandy lies across the channel from England, which the Normans
famously conquered in 1066. It is too cold for the successful
commercial cultivation of wine grapes. Deprived of the vine, the
Normans turned early on to the apple for everyday drinks _ spritzy
lightly alcoholic cider, traditionally served cool from a stone
pitcher for quaffing with meals, and pungent, decidedly alcoholic
Calvados for sipping afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Calvados has never achieved the renown or aristocratic aura of
Cognac. Only in recent years has it appeared in stores and
restaurants outside France. No less eminent a figure than Marcel
Proust, who spent many seaside holidays at Cabourg on the Norman
coast, vouched for it in ``Remembrance of Things Past.''
</P>
<P>
   And the American journalist A.J. Liebling, a more dedicated
eater and drinker than Proust, if not a better writer, had this to
say, in ``Normandy Revisited,'' about Calvados and its ways:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never wavered in my belief that old Calvados has a more
agreeable bouquet, a warmer touch to the heart and a more outgoing
personality than Cognac. It is less precocious, but that is only a
confirmation of its more profound character. The barrel of Calvados
laid down at an infant's birth matures with him; he is unlikely to
need it until he is at least 11, and by that time it will be
passable. If the boy is to drink Calvados at its best, however, it
is better to lay down several barrels, so he will still have some
when he is 50.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Calvados was a farmhouse product, handmade by
peasants, but in this field as in so many others, the big boys are
taking over. Mass-produced brands like Busnel, Boulard and Pere
Magloire account for the bulk of the 11 million bottles sold
annually, half of them abroad (mostly in Europe, but also in Japan
and the United States). Most of this Calvados is young and
unsubtle. These are sluggers, not boxers.
</P>
<P>
   But some small-fries persist. One of the best is Marc de
Lesdain, a convivial, red-faced farmer who has been distilling
since 1959 in the hamlet of Ste.-Foy-de-Montgommery. (Yes, with a
double ``M'' in the middle. The family that produced Field Marshal
Montgomery, of World War II fame, lived there in the Middle Ages;
it dropped an ``M'' when it moved to Ireland.)
</P>
<P>
   On the main highway in Ste.-Foy, there is a big commercial
distillery, with tanks visible through a big picture window. To
find de Lesdain, you have to cross the railroad tracks and the Vie
River and look out for a charming, typically Norman half-timbered
house and barn on your left. That's where he produces, for a mainly
regional clientele, in his own still and with the apples from his
own 10 acres of trees, a smoky, fruity, perfectly balanced
15-year-old Calvados that is 45 percent alcohol, a few degrees
stronger than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must learn to taste before you distill,'' he said one
Sunday afternoon in July, sitting at a long table covered with
trophies, and offering me tempting topaz-hued tastes from a cluster
of bottles. ``You have to know how to tell when the fruit is too
ripe, when the blend is wrong, how to correct the faults. Every
batch through the still has a personality. Now, industrialists run
everything, with their technicians and their laboratories. In the
alcohol factories, nothing is ever really bad, nothing is ever
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvados demands a certain deference on the part of the
consumer. In an otherwise-forgotten BBC situation comedy, the
hard-drinking hero warned his mate: ``It shouldn't be gulped down
by the mugful. If you do that you will lose the flavor and the
bouquet. You will also lose your power of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite, maybe, but I remember an international
conference in Normandy a decade or so ago at which the organizers
were silly enough to stock each participant's room with bottles of
the potent local hooch, and restock them when needed. The
discussions tended to wander even more than normal at such
gatherings, and a lot of us woke up every morning with a lively new
understanding of why the apple had been forbidden to Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The name Calvados is taken from that of one of the five
departments of Normandy, which extends inland from the seaside
resorts of Deauville and Honfleur and the invasion beaches of 1944.
It is a countryside of gentle green hills and shallow valleys, with
the Virgin or a crucifix at every crossroads, that seems to have
lost track of time. The department's name is said by local people
to be a corruption of Salvador, the name of a Spanish man-of-war
that was wrecked on the Normandy coast after the defeat of the
Armada by the British in 1588. Historians doubt that, but offer no
other explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the region presents one of the loveliest pictures
in all of France _ more than 9 million apple trees, blossoming
pink-white around the picturesque old farmhouses, with
black-and-white and brown-and-white cows grazing underneath the
trees or nearby. Cheese (most notably Camembert, Livarot and
Pont-l'Eveque) is another significant Norman gastronomic product.
</P>
<P>
   Calvados is distilled from cider, the pressed juice of
particular varieties of apples, just as Cognac is made from grape
juice. Cider apples, often of small diameter, blotchy and
unattractive, are too sour to be eaten with pleasure. They are
grouped in four families: sweet, bitter, bittersweet and acid. To
make a successful Calvados, juices from several of these are
blended before distilling.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best varieties came originally from the Basque
country, farther south, as early as the 13th century. (Some bear
names, like ``Bisquet'' or ``Marin Onfroy,'' that refer in one way
or another to their origins.)
</P>
<P>
   By law, Calvados can be produced only in a specified area of
Normandy, which includes the department of Calvados plus all or
part of the four other Norman departments _ Eure, Manche,
Seine-Maritime and Orne. Only cider that reaches a minimum of 4.5
percent alcohol may be distilled; most is between 5 and 6 percent.
In the region around Domfront, near the southern edge of the zone,
the cider can be made from a mix of pears (as much as 30 percent)
and apples; Calvados that includes pears is always labeled as being
from Domfront.
</P>
<P>
   The heartland is the Pays d'Auge, which lies on either side of
the little Touques River valley, running south from Deauville
through Pont-l'Eveque and Lisieux. In this area, narrowly delimited
by law, Calvados must be made in a traditional pot still. It is
always labeled ``Calvados Pays d'Auge.'' Elsewhere in the region,
more efficient columnar stills can be used. Their output, which is
usually coarser and less sophisticated, is labeled simply
``Calvados.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why coarser? Partly because the pot still offers greater
control, and partly because the pot still's product takes better to
aging in oak casks. ``To be really good,'' Waverly Root wrote in
``The Food of France,'' ``Calvados requires aging even more than
does Cognac.'' He asserts that 15 years in wood is the minimum, and
the best producers in the Pays d'Auge agree. But that much age
costs the consumer a fancy franc _ up to $60 a bottle retail in
France and considerably more in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the whole process here at St.-Cyr, in the rich,
deeply rural triangle of farmland between Lisieux, Orbec and
Vimoutiers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the headquarters of the uncrowned king of artisanal
Calvados, the firm of Roger Groult, one of the few old-style
distillers, along with Adrien Camut of La Lande St.-Leger, who
produce enough to ship their wares around the world. (Most local
people pronounce the name ``grew,'' but Jean-Pierre Groult,
himself, says ``grewlt,'' with the final consonants faintly
audible.)
</P>
<P>
   A dapper, precise fourth-generation distiller, Jean-Pierre
Groult uses apples from his own orchards, which cover 65 acres,
plus others, about a third of the total, bought from other orchards
within six miles of here. They are shaken from the trees each
October by a cable linked to a tractor, sorted according to quality
and variety and then crushed in a large hydraulic press. The pulp
is used to feed livestock, and the liquid is pumped into
stainless-steel tanks, where it ferments into cider.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment comes, months later, to make the final product,
the cider passes twice through one of Groult's three alembics, or
stills, one of which belonged to his great-grandfather. These
handsome, glistening, hammered-copper vessels, heated by wood
fires, produce an alcoholic vapor that passes through a swan's-neck
tube and eventually through a coil of tubing immersed in a bath of
cold water. That condenses the vapor into a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The first pass yields what distillers call petites eaux, or
little waters, which are 28 to 30 percent alcohol. The second
yields a rudimentary brandy, 70 to 72 percent alcohol. At the end
of each run, the harsher first and last parts of the output, called
the head and tail, are discarded.
</P>
<P>
   After aging in sheds filled with barrels large and small, and
the gradual addition of distilled water, the Calvados loses its
astringency and gains body and perfume. It has 40 to 45 percent
alcohol when it is bottled. Like all spirits and unlike wine, it
makes no further improvement while in glass.
</P>
<P>
   Groult sells only blends of various vintages, although other
distillers sell single-vintage Calvados. He thinks that they are
one-dimensional, that only by blending the produce of a number of
years can maximum richness and complexity be achieved. His own
Calvados is available in 3-, 8-, 15-, 20-, 30-, 40- and 50-year-old
bottlings, with the stated age the youngest in the blend.
</P>
<P>
   A glass of 20-year-old calva makes a refined after-dinner drink,
one in which ``there is the first happy flush of oak, a lingering
taste of fruit and no sting on the palate,'' in Groult's
enthusiastic (and accurate) words. But the Normans also use
Calvados in a surprising number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   They drink it in the middle of elaborate banquets to revive
flagging appetites, much the way fancy-pants American chefs serve
sorbets. They call this the ``trou Normand.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an essential ingredient in tripe a la mode de Caen, a
classic regional dish. It lends snap to the cream sauce in veal
cutlets or chicken Pays d'Auge. Liebling mentioned a partridge
poached in cream and Calvados in the style of Olivier Basselin, ``a
15th-century poet and drunkard,'' as the master described him.
Treated in this way, Liebling swore, the bird tastes ``like a
partridge that has been fed all its life from a bottle of Calvados
50 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   But on my most recent trip around Normandy with my wife, Betsey,
the gold star went to a towering Calvados souffle at La Bourride,
the Michelin two-star restaurant in Caen. When the waiter served
it, he lifted its top, decorated with an apple slice, and poured in
a little more Calvados, to make sure the flavor wasn't too wan.
</P>
<P>
   I barely finished the souffle, but the patron's redheaded wife,
with typical Norman solicitude, insisted on pouring me one final
glass of Calvados, a 13-year-old, 45-percent beauty from a farmer
she knew named Hubert. Its heady scent leaped from the glass to
meet my nose, and it was every bit as full-bodied as any Wagnerian
soprano. &QL;

   CALVADOS SOUFFLE WITH TAPIOCA
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Bourride in Caen, France
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 golden delicious apple
</P>
<P>
   1} cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tapioca
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   \ cup flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons sugar, plus additional for coating ramekins
</P>
<P>
   8 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Butter for coating pastry cream and greasing ramekins
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Calvados
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar, for sprinkling.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place apple on a baking sheet,
and bake until just tender but still slightly crisp, for about 15
to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow to cool. Peel and core
apple, and then cut into small dice. Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare pastry cream: In small saucepan, combine milk,
tapioca and vanilla bean. Place over medium heat, and bring to just
under a boil. Remove from heat, and allow mixture to rest for 5
minutes. Remove vanilla bean, and scrape pulp back into the milk.
In medium saucepan, combine flour and sugar until blended. Whisk
milk into flour until completely blended. Place over medium-high
heat, and boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from
heat, and set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Separate eggs. Place 7 yolks into a medium mixing bowl, and 8
whites into the bowl of an electric mixer; discard remaining yolk.
Whisk yolks by hand until light and fluffy. Whisk about { cup of
the milk mixture into yolks, and then whisk this mixture back into
the pan of milk. Place the pan over medium heat, and continue
whisking until mixture is thickened and will coat the back of a
spoon, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the hot mixture to a bowl,
and gently slide a pat of butter over the surface to prevent a skin
from forming. Allow to cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. In a small saucepan, bring calvados to a boil, and reduce by
half. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature. Fold
apple dice and Calvados into pastry cream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter 8 1-cup ramekins.
Sprinkle sugar into each ramekin, and turn so that inside is
completely coated. Set aside a fine-mesh strainer filled with
confectioners' sugar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, whip egg
whites until they hold stiff peaks. Fold a third of the egg whites
into the pastry cream to lighten it; then, add this back to the
remaining whites and fold together. Spoon souffle mixture into
ramekins, filling them almost to top. Smooth edges by running thumb
around edges of rims. Place ramekins on baking sheet, and bake
until raised and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and
tap strainer over souffles to sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
Serve immediately. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``Abandon all hope, you who enter here.'' This motto,
inscribed on Hell's front door in Dante Alighieri's ``Divine
Comedy,'' might also serve as a warning to ambitious thespians
transferring the 14th-century masterpiece to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A literary work whose mythic vision has made it a cultural
touchstone, the poem seems to defy theatrical interpretation. Its
three parts describe a tour through dizzying cosmic landscapes _
Hell, Purgatory and Heaven _ teeming with supernatural beings.
</P>
<P>
   The first section, the ``Inferno,'' is particularly fantastical.
Here the narrator (Dante) witnesses the ghastly punishments
tormenting damned souls, each of whom is assigned to one of Hell's
increasingly grim concentric circles according to the grievousness
of his or her sin. A rain of fire, a lake of boiling pitch,
centaurs, trees that bleed, a scorpion-tailed monster that swims
through the air: add to these visions scores of obscure allusions
to medieval villains and a dogmatic theology that by today's
standards seems downright brutal, and the assignment starts to
sound like a producer's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the award-winning version of the ``Inferno,''
translated from the Italian by Robert Pinsky, the U.S. poet
laureate, has found its way to the footlights. Directed by Robert
Scanlan and produced by the Unterberg Poetry Center of the 92nd
Street Y, the play, following a brief run in Boston, begins
performances in New York on Saturday at Playhouse 91 and runs
through Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The production has been in the making since shortly after
Pinsky's ``Inferno'' was published, in 1994. Critics hailed the
translation for its eloquent contemporary language and its use of
slant rhyme (tell/feel or night/thought) to reflect Dante's terza
rima rhyme scheme. The warning quoted above is Pinsky's version of
this famous line.
</P>
<P>
   The stage ``Inferno'' features four actors (including Bill Camp
as Dante) in modern dress, a classical violinist, original music by
two composers and a script adapted by Pinsky from his book-length
text. The project is the work of collaborators who fervently
believe that poetry can transcend the printed page and exhilarate a
live audience. Indeed, as Poet Laureate, Pinsky is developing an
audio-video archive of 1,000 Americans reading their favorite poems
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry by its nature is vocal,'' he said. ``Poets, in my
opinion, don't write for the page; they don't even write on the
page. Even if you're writing the words down, you're writing with
your voice.'' But he cautioned that ``vocal does not necessarily
mean dramatic; I write _ and I wrote that translation _ for the
reader's voice.'' As he waits for the theatrical ``Inferno,'' which
will rely on actors' voices, Pinsky said he was ``semi-wary.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the ``Inferno'' from page to stage began in the
fall of 1995, when Pinsky collaborated in a dramatic reading in
Cambridge, Mass. A prime force behind the project, even at that
stage, was Scanlan, an eminent director and president of the Poets'
Theater, which sponsored the reading. Old acquaintances, Pinsky and
Scanlan had both been deeply impressed by the theories of Francis
Fergusson, a literary critic who found in Dante's work ``the
perennial idea of a theater of human life and action.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky pieced together two acts of excerpts for the reading,
held in a Harvard University auditorium. He himself played Dante.
Derek Walcott, the Nobel Laureate, took the role of Virgil, the
Roman poet who guides Dante through Hell, while the actors Wallace
Shawn and Kathryn Walker portrayed assorted sinners.
</P>
<P>
   Positive reaction to that performance, Pinsky said, persuaded
him to attempt a more polished script, which he handed over to
Scanlan, with carte blanche to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan, a renowned interpreter of Samuel Beckett, has long had
an intense interest in marrying poetry and theater, two disciplines
he views as, regrettably, ``mutually suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The poetry-reading circuit,'' he said, ``strikes a lot of
theater professionals as hopeless performance. And the poets are
usually horrified by the cheap histrionics of actors reading in
their stead.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation, he believes, requires correcting. ``We need
higher distinction, better language in the theater,'' he said.
``It's one of the great failings of the American theater, the world
theater even.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan elaborated: ``We all universally acknowledge that
Shakespeare is the greatest person in the theater and the greatest
poet. A perfect union should be a point of aim, and it seems no
longer to be. People don't even aspire to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan found a kindred soul in Jonathan Levi, a founding editor
of the literary magazine Granta, who has also worked in opera. Levi
is director of the National Literary Audience Development Project,
an initiative begun in 1997 by the Unterberg Poetry Center ``to
bring theatrical audiences to poetry and bring poetry audiences to
theater,'' in Levi's words. Supporting this mission is the
60-year-old tradition of the poetry center, which arranged for
Dylan Thomas to lead the first public reading of ``Under Milk
Wood'' in 1953. But the ``Inferno'' will be the center's first
fully staged theatrical production.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To Scanlan, Levi and their colleagues, Pinsky's text presented
the ideal match between the poetic and the dramatic, the old and
the new. And Pinsky's distinction as Poet Laureate, along with the
attention the book received, have given the project a jazzy edge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, staging Dante's chapterlike cantos remains a tricky
proposition. In addition to representational difficulties, there is
the problem of the work's vast scope. ``The question is the sheer
range, the number of characters,'' said Giuseppe Mazzotta, a
professor of Italian at Yale University. The ``Inferno,'' he said,
includes enough material for dozens of plays; he pointed out that
just a few lines inspired Gabriele D'Annunzio's play ``Francesca da
Rimini.''
</P>
<P>
   An added difficulty for the stage is rhythm. ``In epic poetry,''
Scanlan noted, ``there's a sense that it's one damn thing after
another _ which applies more literally in this case than in any
other.'' One of his tasks has therefore been to insure that the
play has movement without being ``repetitiously episodic.'' At the
same time, the production needs to mirror the book's descriptive
power and its multiple meanings: Hell's lurid panorama, the
interplay of adventure, allegory and irony, and the tension between
Dante's initial pity for the damned and his ultimate affirmation of
divine justice.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan has chosen to express these literary resonances largely
through music: a two-tiered acoustic ``soundscape'' of electronic
sampling and live classical violin. The electronic score, composed
by Christopher Walker, suggests the horrors of Hell by distorting
sounds, many of them abrasive or ominous. For example, a spooky
montage of pig squeals and resounding slamming noises accompanies a
gruesome scene of dismemberment.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the perceptions and emotions of Dante against this sonic
backdrop is the violin (an instrument with a ``long history of Hell
associations,'' Levi noted) playing music by Bruce Saylor, a
composer of opera, orchestral, chamber and vocal works.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving from Scanlan a ``musical blueprint'' outlining
what parts of the script the score should illustrate, Saylor wrote
a multi-section composition to be performed by the violinist Gil
Morgenstern. The violin line, Scanlan said, is ``present
theatrically like a voice or a character.'' Accordingly,
Morgenstern will be onstage throughout the performance. In
rehearsals, Scanlan said, the actors took a musical approach in the
``balancing of their own voices, the sounding of the words and
finding the cadences, finding the verse, finding all of the
internal assonances.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, script and music coalesce, Scanlan suggested. ``You
can't handle the text the way text or dialogue is usually
handled,'' he said. ``You really have to handle it musically all
the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   But the look of the production is equally important, he said.
Camp, in the role of Dante, and Reg E. Cathey, playing Virgil, roam
over and in front of a two-story metal scaffold whose arms pivot.
Giving voice to the damned, Jack Willis and Leslie Beatty haunt the
compartments created by railings, platforms, inset gray doors and
strips of mirror that turn translucent.
</P>
<P>
   At the set's center, a screen catches projections of
expressionistic monotypes by Michael Mazur, who illustrated the
``Inferno'' hard cover. Despite the stark decor, the performance
includes playful sections, like a scene with puppets and colorful
monster masks (created by the designers Sarah G. Conly and John
Michael Deegan) and one that imitates a poetry slam.
</P>
<P>
   After the New York run the production will visit Montgomery,
Ala., Miami, Seattle, Kansas City and Los Angeles. ``The idea is
not to go to traditional theatrical venues,'' Levi said of the
tour. At each stop the local sponsors will emphasize the poem's
relevance today. In Montgomery, the play will be performed at the
King Memorial Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. first gained prominence. The setting will cast light, Levi
said, on the ``Inferno'' ``as metaphor for civil rights.'' In
Kansas City, a consortium that includes the Jewish Federation of
Greater Kansas City will be the host of a discussion about the
text's relevance to the Holocaust and race relations. And in
Seattle, a literary community center, Richard Hugo House, will hold
a writing class in which adolescents, some recently homeless, will
rewrite Dante's cantos in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Frances McCue, executive director of Hugo House, said that the
project involved ``looking around the city and seeing what sounds
there are around us that create our own little urban hell.'' The
young writers will read their work at the theater where the Pinsky
play will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Hell can one city take? A lot, according to Ms.
McCue. ``There's sort of an `Inferno' buzz around Seattle right
now,'' she said.

   TRUMP-RESORT _ PALM BEACH _ What's an ocean-to-lake club without
so much as a lounge chair on the beach? It's Donald Trump's
Mar-a-Lago Club. Hardly seems worth the $75,000 membership fee if
members have to tote their own beach chairs. Trump wants to change
that. He has plans to build a 100-foot long seaside pool, 14
cabanas with showers, a snack bar, bathrooms and two decorative
fountains on the club's 360 feet of beachfront. (O'Meilia, Palm

football times at the University of Florida. Ignore, please, the
No. 2 national ranking, because that's pretty much what head coach
Stever Spurrier is doing...and asking everybody else to do, too.
The Gators are 2-0, which isn't the problem. Well, kind of it is.
The victories have come against The Citadel and Northeast
Louisiana, which means they count only in a mathematical sense. The
Bulldogs and Indians, quite frankly, couldn't beat the Gators if
they ganged up and played 'em together. Also, it seems the Florida
offense _ having scored a mere 91 points _ is anemic. Which is why
it would be no surprise whatsoever to see Spurrier, come Saturday
night on the road in Neyland Stadium against sixth-ranked
Tennessee's nasties in the first Southeastern Conference game of
the season, fire up the engine on quarterback Doug Johnson and
throw him out there against the Volunteers. Because things get

of Florida. Lewis started the next week against Ole Miss and ran

   HKN-PANTHERS-MCLEAN _ SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers'
franchise-record losing streak was at 12 and counting when General
Manager Bryan Murray made a seemingly minor deal to acquire
goaltender Kirk McLean last March 20. ``At the time, I seriously
wondered if we would win another game,'' Murray said earlier this
summer. Three nights later, the slide ended at 13 games as McLean,
making his first start as a Panther, backstopped a 5-4 victory over
Montreal. McLean went on to go a respectable 4-2-1 in seven
appearances. So how did Murray reward him? He spent the whole
summer conducting a goalie search that ended with the free-agent
signing of Sean Burke last Saturday. Now McLean is hearing rumors
that he might be on the trading block yet again if Kevin Weekes
ends his holdout in time to make an impression in training camp.
``At this stage of the season, nothing is etched in stone,'' he
said. ``I'll be a free agent next year, and if they want to do
something, that's a business decision. All I can do is go out and
play hockey.'' (Biggane, Palm Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   Only those of a certain age will remember the Velveeta-smooth
voice of Ed Herlihy reciting recipes between the acts of the
``Kraft Television Theater.'' They always seemed to be for ``simple
Lenten dishes'' in which cream cheese figured prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten (by many) but not gone, Kraft recipes live on in the
Kraft Interactive Kitchen (www.kraftfoods.com), one of a number of
Web sites run by large food manufacturers. (And in North America,
Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris, is the largest of them all.)
</P>
<P>
   These sites are eager to help the hurried cook with weekly menu
planners, recipe searches and electronic recipe boxes to keep
favorites in. Of course, the recipes are built around the
manufacturer's products _ chemical shelf-life extenders and all.
</P>
<P>
   And some of these sites ask the user to register, which builds
customer marketing lists: even on the Net, lunch isn't exactly

</P>
<P>
   For what Kraft offers, click on Cookbook. There are hundreds of
recipes, variable in quality and redolent of cooking eras past.
Fettuccine Alfredo with scallops and peas, for instance, includes a
cup of heavy cream to serve four, reflecting the heavy-on-fat style

   ``Can can'' chicken includes a can of condensed cream of chicken
soup and two cups of Minute Rice, ideal for an old-fashioned high

Mexican chicken and rice dinner are a cup of Taco Bell salsa, two
cups of Minute Rice and a cup of Kraft shredded cheddar _ a

   But the desert fairly bursts into bloom on
www.tabasco.com/html/tasterecipes.html, the site of Tabasco, the
fiery brand of hot pepper sauce that started in south Louisiana.
The site offers hundreds of spicy recipes made from fresh
ingredients, but its foot-stomping glory is the Cajun-Creole
section, with authentic versions of bayou staples like shrimp and
sausage jambalaya, crawfish pie and seafood gumbo. &QL;

   Marilyn Wright Ford's Web site (www.littleyellowhouse.com) is
devoted to food for thought and thought for food. Her passion is
cookbooks, which she reviews energetically. ``By the time I am
ready to write a review, the book usually has splatters and
scribbled notes on it,'' she said by e-mail. ``I test at least six
recipes from each one. If more than two recipes I try from a book
are bombs, I don't review it.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a warm spot for less-known cookbooks and has most often
bought or borrowed her copies. Her reviews have a personal, quirky
flavor and include excerpts and lists of the recipes she tried and
liked.
</P>
<P>
   Among the two dozen books reviewed on her site are ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone'' by Deborah Madison, ``Desperation Dinners!''
by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross, ``The Cook's Bible: The Best of
American Home Cooking'' by Christopher Kimball and ``Nicole
Routhier's Fruit Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   All may be bought from Amazon.com, which she doesn't hesitate to
say pays her about 5 percent of each sale, but she writes that she
hopes buyers will try their local independent bookstores first.

   TRUMP-RESORT _ PALM BEACH _ What's an ocean-to-lake club without
so much as a lounge chair on the beach? It's Donald Trump's
Mar-a-Lago Club. Hardly seems worth the $75,000 membership fee if
members have to tote their own beach chairs. Trump wants to change
that. He has plans to build a 100-foot long seaside pool, 14
cabanas with showers, a snack bar, bathrooms and two decorative
fountains on the club's 360 feet of beachfront. (O'Meilia, Palm

football times at the University of Florida. Ignore, please, the
No. 2 national ranking, because that's pretty much what head coach
Stever Spurrier is doing...and asking everybody else to do, too.
The Gators are 2-0, which isn't the problem. Well, kind of it is.
The victories have come against The Citadel and Northeast
Louisiana, which means they count only in a mathematical sense. The
Bulldogs and Indians, quite frankly, couldn't beat the Gators if
they ganged up and played 'em together. Also, it seems the Florida
offense _ having scored a mere 91 points _ is anemic. Which is why
it would be no surprise whatsoever to see Spurrier, come Saturday
night on the road in Neyland Stadium against sixth-ranked
Tennessee's nasties in the first Southeastern Conference game of
the season, fire up the engine on quarterback Doug Johnson and
throw him out there against the Volunteers. Because things get
serious now. Perhaps too serious, in Spurrier's opinion, for any

   FBC-LEWIS _ KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ A year ago Tennessee could not
slow down the Florida rush on quarterback Peyton Manning. But a

true freshman, was not ready to block the various blitzing schemes
of Florida. Lewis started the next week against Ole Miss and ran
for 133 yards. Then the following week against Georgia he had 232.
If Tennessee is going to beat Florida, it will be because of Lewis.

   HKN-PANTHERS-MCLEAN _ SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers'
franchise-record losing streak was at 12 and counting when General
Manager Bryan Murray made a seemingly minor deal to acquire
goaltender Kirk McLean last March 20. ``At the time, I seriously
wondered if we would win another game,'' Murray said earlier this
summer. Three nights later, the slide ended at 13 games as McLean,
making his first start as a Panther, backstopped a 5-4 victory over
Montreal. McLean went on to go a respectable 4-2-1 in seven
appearances. So how did Murray reward him? He spent the whole
summer conducting a goalie search that ended with the free-agent
signing of Sean Burke last Saturday. Now McLean is hearing rumors
that he might be on the trading block yet again if Kevin Weekes
ends his holdout in time to make an impression in training camp.
``At this stage of the season, nothing is etched in stone,'' he
said. ``I'll be a free agent next year, and if they want to do
something, that's a business decision. All I can do is go out and
play hockey.'' (Biggane, Palm Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   NEW YORK _ With Rosh ha-Shanah beginning on Sunday evening, the
Israel Beigel Baking Co., like other classic Jewish bakeries in New
York City, is in its high season for rugelach, honey cakes and the
traditional round New Year challahs _ more than 10,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers who patronize the Fairway markets, the Second Avenue
Deli and strictly kosher Ma-and-Pa groceries elsewhere in the New
York area will find round challahs and pastries from Beigel for
sale there this week _ though few outside the small community of
Bobover Hasidim of Borough Park, Brooklyn, know that this bakery in
the Williamsburg section of the borough has a heroic past.
</P>
<P>
   The Beigel family (the name is pronounced BUY-gull) had been in
business in Cracow, Poland, for five generations by the time the
Germans invaded in 1939. The Beigels are still revered for their
efforts to keep much of the community from starvation during the
occupation, when bakers were some of the few Jews who had access to
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nazis ordered us to make bread for the Germans, the ghetto
and the nearby camps,'' said Nechama Beigel Wislicki, 78, of
Borough Park, one of the few family members to survive Auschwitz.
``In the beginning, we had permission to go out from the ghetto and
carried very big pots, four of us together, and brought soup and
bread to the camps and factories where Jews were working.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Beigel house became a place where anyone who was hungry
could find not only food, but food prepared under the strictest
kosher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Nazis herded Jews into the ghetto,'' Mrs. Wislicki
said, ``the Jews sometimes sneaked to our apartment, where tables
and benches were set up, and we cooked 50 liters of soup. Everybody
got a nice piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, she recalled, about 50 people were hidden in
the Beigel home, sitting on hard benches arrayed around the
formerly elegant parlor. Many were so exhausted and famished that
they were slumped over their bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Rebbe, Schlomo Halberstam, came to us with his mother, his
mother-in-law and his sister, because they didn't have where to
go,'' Mrs. Wislicki said, speaking in Yiddish-influenced idiom.
``On Erev Yom Kippur'' _ the night before Yom Kippur, when a meal
is eaten before the fast _ ``my mother didn't have what to cook.
She served the noodles with water so they wouldn't be so dry, and
maybe a piece of bread. There was nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, the Germans liquidated the ghetto and sent
the Jewish population, including the Beigel family, to
concentration camps, where Mrs. Wislicki's parents and sister died.
The three surviving children went to New York in 1947, where they
began their lives and the Beigel Bakery from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' Mrs. Wislicki said. ``And now I have 3
children, 24 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.'' Another
branch of the family went to Israel before the war, and Beigel &AMP;
Beigel is now a famous brand of baked goods there.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish bakeries like Beigel in Brooklyn and Gertel's Moishe's on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan make challahs that are a definite
cut above the common squishy aerated commercial variety. The dark
crust gleams and the inside has a perfect balance between body and
lightness _ it's a serious hunk of bread without being heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The rugelach from Beigel look homemade _ they vary a bit in
size. The cream cheese rugelach manage to be flaky like pastry and
moist like brownies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack Lebewohl, the owner of the Second Avenue Deli, Beigel
chocolate rugelach are the only ones to pass muster. ``They're a
commercial bakery but still do it the old-fashioned way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Scharf, 83, who now lives in London, has vivid memories
of one of Beigel's five branches in Cracow. ``I have this smell
even now of the bread,'' he said. ``We Cracovians liked to joke
about the name Beigel, that it came from this bakery.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, it was the other way around: beigel is Yiddish for
bagel, and when the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II required Jews to
take surnames in the late 18th century _ what better one than this
for a local bagel maker?)  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The maraschino cherry is a necessary evil in the
world of cocktails. No one may actually want to eat it, but what is
a manhattan without one?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hoffman, the owner of Savoy restaurant in SoHo, decided to
find out. He served manhattans without cherries. Then he tried
reconstituted dried cherries. Finally, he created a cherry that
might be the best part of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   When sour cherries came on the market this summer, Hoffman began
preserving them, using traditional techniques. ``We make a simple
sugar syrup with pomegranate molasses and add lemon juice,
allspice, black pepper and a few other spices,'' he said. ``We
poach the cherries in the syrup, cool them and pack them into
jars.'' The result is a delicious natural cherry with a wonderful
balance of sweet and sour.
</P>
<P>
   Having conquered the cherry, Hoffman tackled the onion, pickling
tiny fresh pearl onions in vinegar, salt, mustard seed, chili, bay
leaf and cloves. These sour morsels go into his martinis
(technically Gibsons, as martinis have olives).
</P>
<P>
   On request, Savoy makes martinis with Junipero gin, an
ultra-fragrant gin that smacks of juniper berries. It is made by
the Anchor Distilling Co.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy is at 70 Prince Street, at Crosby Street; (212) 219-8570.
The manhattan and the martini are $9.

WINE TALK: YES, THERE IS LIFE AFTER CHARDONNAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see sidebar, WINE-TOP10) 
 (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are tennis fans who so love the U.S. Open that they devote
two full weeks each year to watching it. Not in the comfort of
their homes but in the stands in New York, day after day, broiling
like lamb chops in the pitiless sun. I don't envy them,but I don't
hate them for it. Nor do I harbor the slightest antipathy toward
bungee jumpers, crossword puzzle addicts or people who enjoy
Tex-Mex food. I don't care for any of those things, but I wish
those who do only the best.
</P>
<P>
   So the September issue of Wine Spectator magazine came as a
shock. In a column titled ``Hot Air and Chardonnay Don't Mix,''
James Laube, a senior editor, goes after ``wine snoots who gloat
that they're part of the `ABC' crowd _ the Anything but Cabernet
(or Chardonnay) roosters.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC faction is a recent development among wine drinkers,
prompted, I thought, by the proliferation of mediocre chardonnay.
Laube includes cabernet sauvignon. So far as I know, it's a
loose-knit group, probably fanatics dedicated to the cause of
sauvignon blanc. But Laube knows the ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief among these loathsome ABCers are wine writers, some of
whom write for major publications and otherwise prominent
metropolitan newspapers,'' he asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hurts. Of course, he may have been thinking of someone
at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or Corriere della Sera, but I
doubt it. Laube continues: ``I don't care if they'' _ meaning the
loathsome ABCers _ ``don't like cabernet or chardonnay; just don't
disparage those who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's disparaging? A plug for some nice little riesling isn't
meant to insult some hapless chardonnay lover, however misguided he
or she may be. There are probably 700 California chardonnays on the
market; only a few truly bad, but far too many dull and
forgettable. At the same time, chardonnay is an almost overwhelming
presence in the wine world _ the winemaker and wit Randall Grahm
once observed that we live in a chardocentric society.
</P>
<P>
   Is it so wrong, then, to let it be known that there is life
after chardonnay, that there are other roads to take? In a mildly
confessional mood, Laube recalls _ with a shudder _ slogging
through a tasting of some 200 merlots. ``Right now, the mere
mention of merlot makes me cringe,'' he writes. But, he adds, ``you
won't catch me at a restaurant, wine bar or party trashing merlot
drinkers.'' Perhaps not, but I certainly hope he trashes a few of
those boring merlots.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the ABC phenomenon is not that its adherents
disparage other wine drinkers; it is that, like most movements,
it's simplistic. There are excellent California chardonnays. As
recently as July, Wine Spectator, under Laube's direction, surveyed
some 420 California chardonnays from the 1995 and 1996 vintages and
rated about 120 of them ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent ABCer would have difficulty turning down a
glass of some of the top-rated wines from Beringer, Kistler, Villa
Mount Eden, Williams Selyem and Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are all those dull, overoaked, oversweet
chardonnays that deserve to be criticized. Some of these wines are
extremely popular. Newcomers to wine _ and more than a few old
hands _ love them because they are fizzy, colorful and sweet _ in
other words, very unwinelike.
</P>
<P>
   Should these wines be criticized when they are so popular? Yes.
The critic's job is to point to the best. A music critic bored by
an evening of Johann Strauss will offend people who like Strauss.
They may even feel that he is patronizing them. Is he? No, he's
just tired of Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Laube confines his polemic to California wines, but of course,
chardonnay is not confined to our shores. Most of the world's best
white table wines are made from chardonnay grapes, and more than a
few come from France, Italy and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The entire discussion of good and bad chardonnay illustrates a
serious flaw in our practice of identifying wines by the grape
they're made from. We ask for ``a glass of chardonnay,'' unaware
that the styles of chardonnay range from the soft, slightly sweet
stuff found in three- and five-liter bag-in-the-box containers to
Le Montrachet of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, which sells for
about $1,000 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap chardonnay from the Languedoc can't be compared to a
great chardonnay from Burgundy or the Napa Valley, and yet they are
compared or, more precisely, lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, American winemakers are retreating from their
once almost total use of varietal names. Now, the label from a top
California chardonnay will name the viticultural region from which
the grapes came (Sonoma Coast, for example), the specific vineyard
and sometimes the block of vines within that vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The French have altered their thinking to allow varietal names
on inexpensive wines, but thay retain geographical names for almost
everything else _ except in Alsace, where the varietal tradition is
an old one.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ABCers, like all dissidents they serve a purpose:
they stir up controversy. And with wine, as with so many other
things, there is nothing wrong with that.

NEW RECIPES FOR THE NEW YEAR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many Jewish families, the menu for Rosh ha-Shanah dinner,
from the chicken soup to the honey cake, is set in stone, and has
been for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, you can count on new cookbooks to appear just
before Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year celebration, which
begins this year at sundown on Sunday, ushering in the High Holy
Days. The older generation probably needs no help preparing the
chopped liver or the chicken soup, but publishers are hoping a
younger generation now taking to the stove will want a recipe for
hallah or some new menu ideas, or, for that matter, the precise
requisites for Rosh ha-Shanah or other holidays.
</P>
<P>
   This year ``Cucina Ebraica,'' by Joyce Goldstein (Chronicle
Books, $29.95), might inspire a dinner that strays from the tried
and true, with its recipes for Italian Jewish dishes from a
culinary tradition that dates to Roman times. Will there be howls
of protest if kreplach, the meat-filled pasta similar to wontons,
are replaced with stroncatelli, a kind of handmade pasta that Ms.
Goldstein, a chef and former restaurateur in San Francisco,
suggests for Rosh ha-Shanah?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the cook can expect only compliments for the
chicken roasted with orange, lemon and ginger; the gratin of
potatoes and ripe tomatoes with garlic and parsley (better done on
top of the stove than in the oven), or the quinces in spiced sugar
syrup. This is a well-researched cookbook, which traces the history
of the Jews in Italy as well as the evolution of their cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Though quite a few Sephardic recipes appear in ``The World of
Jewish Entertaining,'' by Gil Marks (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30), the
book is more practical than innovative, explaining, for example,
how to prepare a small holiday dinner or a buffet reception. Though
the focus is on Jewish holidays and cooking, it offers useful
information for anyone who ever wondered how much in the way of
crudites or wine you need for 40 people or how to tackle meatballs,
mashed potatoes and vegetable slaw for 80.
</P>
<P>
   Marks' Rosh ha-Shanah recipes for mock chopped liver made with
mushrooms, veal roasted with figs and plum tart are worth adding to
the repertory. In general, though, I found that his fish dishes,
like the Moroccan yellow fish and the baked fish with vegetables,
needed less than the specified cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking,'' by Marcy Goldman
(Doubleday, $25), is filled with clearly written recipes for items
as varied as rugelach and rye bread. The rich, spice-laden New
Year's honey cake, in particular, was excellent, as were the
honey-butter squares, easy-to-make cookies. Ms. Goldman, a
professional baker and food writer, offers some very good tips
about baking with honey. I was also intrigued enough to try her
recipe for topping a plum tart with shredded dough, made by grating
frozen pie dough, and was delighted with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe in the Goldstein Italian Jewish book for an unusual,
delicious carrot tart makes a perfect Rosh ha-Shanah dessert.
Carrots are sweet, to guarantee a happy year, and the Yiddish word
for carrots, mehren, has another auspicious meaning: to multiply or
increase. But the next time I prepare the tart, I might freeze the
dough for the top crust and shred it, instead of rolling it out.
It's something I might do for any fruit tart, no matter the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOUBLE-CRUSTED CARROT AND GINGER TART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adapted from ``Cucina Ebraica,'' by Joyce Goldstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 2 hours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2\ cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for rolling dough
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   14 tablespoons (1} sticks) chilled unsalted butter, diced
(margarine can be substituted)
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds carrots, peeled and coarsely grated (7 to 8 cups)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a bowl or the container of a food processor, combine
flour, { cup sugar and the salt. If using a food processor, whirl
ingredients briefly to blend them; add butter, pulse until mixture
is crumbly and transfer to a mixing bowl. By hand, cut in the
butter with a pastry blender or two knives to make a crumbly
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   2. Beat 1 egg with the vanilla, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon
cold water. Sprinkle this mixture over the flour mixture, and stir
and toss lightly with a fork until the mixture can be gathered
together to form a ball of dough. You may have to add a little more
water. Divide dough in two slightly unequal portions, flatten each
into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   3. Combine carrots and remaining sugar in a heavy saucepan. Stir
in a couple of tablespoons of water. Place over medium-low heat,
and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and
jamlike. You may have to add a little more water to prevent the
carrots from scorching. Stir in the ginger, and remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. On a lightly floured board, roll
out the larger portion of pastry and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan.
Spoon in the carrot filling. Roll out the smaller disk of dough,
and place it over the filling. Trim edges. Beat remaining egg with
2 tablespoons water, and brush some of this egg wash on the edges
of the pastry. Press the two layers together, and turn them under
to form a slight rim. Crimp rim with your fingertips, or press with
the tines of a fork to make a pattern. Cut a Star of David in the
center of the tart, and brush the surface of the pastry with
remaining egg wash. Tart can also be finished with a lattice crust
on top.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a
rack, and cool fully.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

NEW YORK CELEBRATES RIGHTS MOVEMENT BY HONORING FAMOUS WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Imagine the boldness of Julia Blanche Stover
Clum, a diminutive woman who lived in the tiny village of Valley
Falls in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Clum and her husband sheltered Susan B. Anthony, the famous
suffragist who was passing through town, when another family would
not. She once upset an officious ribbon-cutting by riding her horse
over a new bridge so that she could be the first to cross it. In a
vintage group photograph, in the middle of somber women clothed in
black, Clum posed with her chin in her hands, a slight grin on her
face. Spirited and strong-willed, Clum clearly embraced life, her
granddaughter, Julia Hoag, said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hoag tells these stories with a good deal of relish and,
significantly, her 11-year-old grandson recently raised his hand
and offered Clum's tale when the social studies teacher asked for
examples of famous people.
</P>
<P>
   This passing down of the contributions of women, some of whom do
not have the household names of Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, is precisely the point of a New York celebration marking
the 150th anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of relay runners will traverse a 500-mile course this
week from Buffalo to New York City's Battery Park, passing a torch
along the route to mark the women's rights sesquicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Why a run?
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have been running and charging for the last 150 years,
to be heard and seen and have parity among men,'' said Barbara
Drago, a volunteer co-chairwoman of ``Women Run New York,''
sponsored by a governor's commission established especially for the
sesquicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a weeklong celebration, with church choirs, children's
speeches and a traveling mural for runners to sign, communities in
each county will permanently note the contributions of women with
metal markers of purple and gold, the colors of the suffragists.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 50 women nominated by county historians are
Agnes DeMille, the great modern dance choreographer from Sullivan
County, and the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, who painted for a time in
Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County is honoring C.J. Walker, the nation's first
black millionairess and a great philanthropist. Herkimer County has
Mary Myers, or ``Carlotta the Lady Aeronaut,'' known for her
balloon voyages. Schuyler County claims Queen Catharine, a Seneca
chief and matriarch in the Iroquois Grand Council.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of each put them well ahead of their time.
The driven personalities behind those good works also make their
lives far more fascinating than those honorary markers could ever
explain.

   CALIFORNIA -- OCSTARR. The Orange County delegation reacts to
the Starr report, and talks about the possibility of impeachment.
Zaret
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- IMPEACH. (Working.) The Colorado delegation weighs
in on each of the 11 counts that Kenneth Starr says are impeachable
acts. Which are the stronger and weaker counts, which are more
likely to be impeachable? Zaret
</P>
<P>
   -- SKAGGS/SCHAEFER. Working on project. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- SIERRA. It certainly sounded like a campaign ad.
Pronouncing that the ``Connecticut (River)'s future just got
brighter ... because Congresswoman Nancy Johnson helped get it
named an American Heritage River ...'' the radio ad touted the New
Britain Republican's efforts for the environment. But the Sierra
Club, the group that sponsored the advertisement, insists it was
merely intended to ensure Johnson continues to vote for clean water
and other environmental causes. Maggi

<P>
   FLORIDA -- WELDON. Rep. David Weldon is the latest Florida
Republican to call on President Clinton to resign in the wake of
the Lewinsky scandal. (Brief.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   -- MILLER. The House is expected to take up late today a
nonbinding resolution sponsored by Rep. Dan Miller, R-Bradenton,
calling for the U.S. to renegotiate its treaty with Mexico to
prevent capital punishment from becoming an issue in the
extradition of murder suspects. The measure stems from the Del Toro
case in Sarasota. (Working.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- CLINTON. U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., is holding
a news conference this afternoon to talk about the Starr report and
the White House response to the special prosecutor's charges
against President Clinton. (Working.) Williams
</P>

   LOUISIANA -- ABORTION. Legislation to ban partial-birth abortion
may be passed this Friday in the Senate. Supporters of the ban say
they may have the necessary three votes to override President
Clinton's veto. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   MAINE -- CALLS. The phones have been ringing off the hook at
congressional offices, with a substantial number of callers to
Maine's delegation suggesting that President Clinton step aside.
And that's in a state that gave Clinton a 20-percentage-point
margin in his re-election less than two years ago. Kane
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- KERRY-CLINTON. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said
Tuesday he is disappointed with President Clinton's admission to
having an ``inappropriate relationship'' with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. He also called for a speedy resolution to
the matter for the good of the country, and said even if Clinton
maintains the presidential helm, he will be ineffective for the
next two years. Preston

   MICHIGAN -- TEAMSTERS. Late Wednesday, a federal judge ruled
that balloting for the Teamsters rerun election will begin in early
November, with results known by the end of the year. (Working.)
Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   -- AUTOS. A new law being debated in Washington would change how
drivers buy auto insurance. While advocates say it will make
insurance more affordable, opponents claim it creates a two-tiered
system that would make it hard for low-income drivers to recoup
damages in court. (Working.) Wolfberg

   MULTICHANNEL -- PROJECT. Working on project. Maggi

   OHIO -- DEWINE-IMPEACHMENT. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is
considering putting together a special Senate task force to study

<P>
   -- FARMERS. (Possible.) With dueling philosophies, Ohio farm
group representatives descended on Capitol Hill this week to lobby
for solutions to the farm crises facing rural America. While the
National Farmers Union pushed for removing loan caps and
re-evaluating the 1996 Farm Bill, the Pork Producers Council and
Farm Bureau concentrated on increasing trade opportunities by
getting funding for the International Monetary Fund and passing
fast-track legislation. Hurt

   -- BOEHNER-CONSTITUENTS. (Re-sent.) A spokesman for Rep. John
Boehner, R-West Chester, said calls to his office have been coming
in 97-to-1 demanding President Clinton be removed from office.
Includes Boehner's comments from his appearance on ``FOX News
Sunday.'' Eckstein

<P>
   -- OXLEY-CONSTITUENTS. (Re-sent.) A spokeswoman for Rep. Mike
Oxley, R-Findlay, said the number of calls from constituents was
way up over the weekend, and she said that ``the president doesn't
seem to have a lot of friends in the Fourth District.'' Eckstein

   -- YOUNGSTOWN-STARR. (Re-sent.) Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr used a Youngstown case in his report to Congress last week to
help make the argument that President Clinton isn't above the law.
Gorman
</P>
<P>
   -- OXLEY-ANTI-BRIBERY. (Re-sent.) Emphasizing the importance of
leveling the international playing field for American businesses,
Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Findlay, chaired a subcommittee hearing last
week devoted to the International Anti-Bribery and Fair Competition
Act of 1998, which was introduced by Oxley in July. The bill is
intended to bring the United States into compliance with the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention,
which sets an international agenda for eradicating the bribery of
foreign officials in order for companies to win contracts in the
international marketplace. Hurt

   TEXAS -- HUD. Millions of dollars in federal funds will flow
into the Rio Grande Valley next year to fund public works projects,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced this
week. Marlin

representatives from several national farmer organizations traveled
to Washington anxious to make sure that their lawmakers did not
forget about the problems back home. Brown

   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- PR. A tight legislative schedule and a lack of

   Pots, Pans and Food From Alain Ducasse
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An impulse purchase at Bergdorf Goodman? It can often
be slipped into a shopping bag. But last Wednesday, James V.
Ruocco, a writer who was browsing on the seventh floor of the
store, fell for something considerably more imposing _ a massive
12-quart copper saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   The saucepan was part of a new line of cookware, tableware and
food products bearing the imprimatur of Alain Ducasse, the
multistarred French chef. It has just been introduced into this
country and is available only at Bergdorf.
</P>
<P>
   At $275, the epic saucepan (fill it with stew, and you'd need a
forklift to take it off the stove) was reasonably priced, as were
the other magnificently heavy, beautifully finished copper pots and
pans; they start at $95 for a small saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake on the price,'' Ruocco said
of his purchase.
</P>
<P>
   He might have spent his $275 on just one pair of silver-plated
Alain Ducasse lobster shears or his copper and stainless-steel
Japanese grater. Had he really wanted to splurge, there is a set of
six lethal steak knives for $695, or a huge granite mortar, which
would do nicely as a birdbath, for $1,875. Then again, he could
also have decided to outfit his kitchen with a genuine Ducasse
stove for $28,000 _ perhaps too gorgeous to cook on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducasse food products include carnaroli rice for risotto
($15 for about a pound), and excellent minced dried tomatoes in
olive oil, and herbaceous pistou with a sharp, salty bite (each $12
for about 6 ounces). Ligurian extra virgin olive oil is $25 for
about 17 ounces. The tableware includes attractive glazed wicker
chargers for $35 each.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher Foie Gras From Israel
</P>
<P>
   It's not chopped liver. But the L'Oie Royale goose foie gras
from Israel could certainly get a Rosh ha-Shanah dinner off to a
sumptuous start. This is not a mousse or pate, but solid foie gras
that is also kosher. The best way to serve it is to chill it in its
glass jar and to then slice it with a sharp knife dipped in hot
water and serve it, not with brioche, but with the next best thing:
slices of toasted hallah. A six-ounce jar is $25.99 at Fairway,
2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street).
</P>
<P>
   Parisian Bread in New York
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Poilane has bided his time in bringing his famous
Parisian bread to New York. Nearly 20 years ago he explored the
possibility of opening a bakery here. Nothing came of it. Since
then, the quality of the bread available in the city and elsewhere,
from many new bakeries, has improved at least 1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But starting Thursday, his big, round, crusty four-pound
sourdough miches, his earthy currant loaves and his golden butter
cookies will be flown in once a week by Marc Strausman and sold at
his store, Campagna Home, 29 E. 21st St. The miche is $9.95 for a
quarter loaf, the currant bread is $12 a pound, and the cookies are
$21 a pound. They arrive on Thursdays and must be reserved in
advance: (212) 420-1600.

   WASHINGTON _ Who could quarrel with the call from Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, the principal congressional Democratic spokesmen, for
political ``common sense'' in deciding President Clinton's fate?
</P>
<P>
   Wise counsel. But the president, Congress and the American
people will all be required to apply such fair-minded sobriety, and
that may take a miracle. We're not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   This sorry saga will never end until the president resigns, is
censured by both chambers or is impeached. The latter is absurdly
disproportionate to the sin, but not inconceivable. That
possibility makes one of the two other courses absolutely
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense will have little to do with determining the
outcome. Politics will have everything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott gave the game away Tuesday
when he said that impeachment would not even require Clinton to
have violated a law _ ``abuse of the public trust,'' however that
might be defined, would be sufficient. The Republicans have the
president on the ropes and they do not mean to let him up, even if
it results in the presidency of a presumably more popular Albert
Gore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is not clear what Daschle and Gephardt meant to
achieve, beyond venting their irritation at the president's
legalistic nit-picking to avoid admitting perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic leaders have been ambiguous about how the
president should be punished for trying to cover up his reckless,
illicit affair with Monica Lewinsky. They want to resolve this as
rapidly as possible to avoid bringing down Democratic candidates in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have any magic formula for resolving the crisis,
short of sending Clinton to the political guillotine, which they
are not yet prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the congressional process expected to lead to
impeachment hearings is already taking on an inexorable life of its
own, unstoppable and uncontrollable. And even in this preliminary
stage the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee is sharply
divided along party lines, quibbling about procedural questions
involving timetables, subpoena powers, document releases and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   That particular committee has a long history of partisan
brawling and there is little hope of a sudden bipartisan approach
now. Members have been known to shout each other down and yell
``shut up'' when challenged. One GOP member, Georgia's Bob Barr,
called for Clinton's impeachment last year long before the world
ever heard of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional comment, cloaked in supposedly neutral language,
also reflects predictable partisan bias. Republicans tend to find
their constituents eager to have the president impeached, Democrats
to feel that constituents are reluctant to kick him out.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollsters point to an ominous decline in the
president's credibility and character ratings; Democratic pollsters
point to his continued high job approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The country, like the Congress, is polarized. Nobody defends
what Clinton did. But nobody likes what Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr did either. There is no consensus about what to do next,
except that SOMETHING must be done.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will complete its review of
Starr's voluminous documents by Sept. 28, shortly before Congress
is scheduled to adjourn to allow members to campaign for
re-election. The panel is expected to recommend hearings into
potential impeachment, which could extend far into next year and
include testimony from both Lewinsky and the president.
</P>
<P>
   If the House voted for impeachment, the Senate would sit in
judgment in a lengthy trial to convict or acquit the president.
This ordeal could consume the entire two years remaining in the
president's second term.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, further Starr documents will be released,
including the president's secret grand jury videotaped testimony
vividly depicting the demeaning questions and evasive answers,
keeping the scandal and the political turmoil alive. The
Republicans, naturally, want everything disclosed and the Democrats
don't.
</P>
<P>
   This is not going to quietly fade into the woodwork. Even
censure will not make it go away, so long as Clinton remains in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to distract us with apologies, pastoral counseling,
Starr-bashing and a display of carrying out his governing duties.
It isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about sin, that isn't the basic problem. We
expected him to run the country, not direct our spiritual lives.
What he has lost is us. We are sick of this.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution for Clinton, his party and the country is his
resignation at that point when the political weight of his problems
becomes too oppressive to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That time is not quite now, but it is coming _ sometime after
the House churns up more stuff and the November elections have
determined the shape of the next Congress that could be asked to
vote on impeachment.

   To recognize those who create humor from their uniquely American
experiences, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington is establishing a Celebration of American Humor and a
prize named for Mark Twain. The center announced Tuesday that the
first recipient of the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize will be
Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor will be honored in the Concert Hall on Oct. 20 in the
culmination of three days of lectures, symposiums and master
classes beginning on Oct. 18. The center said participants in the
program, expected to be an annual event, will include Chevy Chase,
Morgan Freeman, Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg, Damon Wayans and
Robin Williams. It is to be televised in January on the Comedy
Central cable channel.

<P>
   All advance tickets for a major van Gogh exhibition beginning
next month at the National Gallery of Art in Washington have been
issued, but as many as 2,500 free tickets for same-day entry will
be issued beginning at 10 a.m. daily to people who wait in line at
the gallery's West Building.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Ziska, the gallery's spokeswoman, said that while almost
197,000 tickets for ``Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces From the
van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam'' had been issued in just two weeks by
the gallery and Ticketmaster, arrangements had been made to provide
the same-day tickets. The show, from Oct. 4 to Jan. 3, is expected
to be among the most popular exhibitions ever mounted at the
gallery.

   Naysayers
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian censors have rejected the script of a film that would
depict the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Islamic
fundamentalists. Agence France-Presse reported Tuesday that the
security services, empowered to approve or ban all scripts dealing
with military matters, had rejected the screenplay for ``The Day
Sadat Was Killed'' without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The film's producer and director, Mahammad Radi, said the script
was based on ``The Assassination of a President'' by an Egyptian
author, Adel Hammuda, and that Omar Sharif had been chosen to
portray the defense lawyer in the trial of the assassins. Four men
found guilty of the slaying of Sadat, who governed Egypt for 11
years, were executed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   There He Is
</P>
<P>
   A life-size bronze statue of Bert Parks, the longtime master of
ceremonies of the Miss America Pageant, is now on display in
Atlantic City. The $35,000 creation in the courtyard of the
Sheraton Atlantic City Convention Center is equipped with motion
sensors that, when tripped by the head of a visitor, activate a
recording of Parks singing ``There She Is,'' his serenade to each
year's winner. Parks died in 1992 at 77.

 &HT;    ANALYSTS DISAGREE OVER CLINTON 'SEX ADDICT' DIAGNOSIS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    Editors: In a story distributed last week, Cox News Service
erroneously identified the author of the book, ``The Clinton
Syndrome,'' as Stanley Renshon. Renshon is not the author of the
book, and the views expressed in the story were incorrectly
ascribed to him. The views were expressed in an interview by Jerome
D. Levin, who is the author of the book. A corrected version of the
story follows.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before details of President Clinton's
extramarital sexual activity were made public, some mental health
professionals have concluded that the cravings that supposedly
steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Other psychotherapists caution that understanding the mental
underpinnings of human behavior _ or even learning exactly what
happened _ usually takes hours of one-on-one exchange between
patient and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Psychiatric Association, in its mammoth
compendium of diagnosable mental disorders, ``Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual,'' does not even recognize ``sexual addiction''
as a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   To those therapists who believe there is such a mental disorder,
sexual addition refers to repeated, constant and compulsive sexual
activity. ``Weird'' sex does not appear to be a necessary element
in any of the definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe Clinton is slavishly addicted to sex are
finding willing outlets for their views.
</P>
<P>
   From the rumor-relaying Drudge Report on the Internet to tabloid
newspapers and respected dailies to well-known book publishers,
media outlets are providing sex experts and other therapists space
to psychoanalyze Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying he did whatever he did because:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His mother was a gambler and a very intelligent woman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His stepfather was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He never knew his biological father.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He has developed a lifelong habit of pushing the envelope of
disapproval to the limit, then escaping punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychodynamics are at play: The president compartmentalizes. The
president needs approval in the face of misconduct, a sort of
I-love-you-despite-anything-you-do reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addiction ``is the only thing that really makes sense,''
said Jerome D. Levin, director of the Alcoholism and Substance
Abuse Training Program at the New School for Social Research in New
York. ``If you look at his biography, he has all of the
predisposing factors. Genetically, there was a great deal of
addiction on both sides of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Levin believes, Clinton's abusive stepfather caused
the future president to ``yearn for a father'' and to develop
problems with self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs continual reassurance that he's lovable and loved,''
Levin said in a telephone interview during a pause in his tour to
promote his book, ``The Clinton Syndrome: The President and the
Self-destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction'' (Prima Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, he said, sex becomes a way of ``avoiding very
painful feelings of shame, guilt, rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin acknowledged that he does not know how many times Clinton
has had sex in the past 10 or 20 years or with whom. The total
number of alleged encounters, proven, acknowledged or otherwise,
would amount to far fewer than constant, repetitive, ``sex addict''
behavior would suggest, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. The fact that someone has an affair does not make
them a sex addict,'' he said. But ``the total disregard of
consequences, the willingness to ignore (Independent Prosecutor)
Kenneth Starr and the press, are further manifestations.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin also suggested that grief over the assassination of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who he said was a ``father
figure'' to Clinton, may have combined with other political
pressures to make the president lose control of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the sexual addiction diagnosis) is obviously not the
only way to understand what happened, but it's one way, and I think
it is a reasonable way,'' Levin said. ``I had my doubts working on
the book. There's an enormous responsibility in making a public
statement of this sort. As events unfolded, I don't lack confidence
in my diagnosis now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lonnie Barbach, a Mill Valley, Calif., psychologist who
specializes in treating sexual problems, does not buy the ``sex
addict'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``An addiction is something where you are physiologically forced
to continue,'' she said. ``In terms of sexuality, I don't think
that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``there may be things that you get out of sex to
create this feeling that you can't make it if you're not sexual,
but that's not addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Clinton, she noted, ``we don't know what happened.
If we knew what happened, we don't know how many times it happened
or under what circumstances. We don't know what his relationship
with his wife is. We just don't have the data, and without the
data, I don't see how you can jump to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbach, author of ``Going the Distance: Finding and Keeping
Lifelong Love,'' said she would have to ``have a number of sessions
with a patient before I could even find out what's going on, much
less being able to understand why it's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Marcotte, a Fayetteville, N.C., psychiatrist and spokesman
for the American Psychiatric Association on the subject of ``sexual
addiction,'' said that even if evidence eventually shows that the
president is the victim of a compulsive or obsessive disorder with
regard to sex, that is not the same as an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Diamond, a Willits, Calif., clinical social worker, goes a
step further than labeling Clinton a sex addict. In his view, the
president is a sex addict who is experiencing male menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, author of ``Male Menopause,'' (Sourcebooks), defined
that as a time when ``hormonally and physiologically men are sort
of going through puberty in reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who are going through these hormonal changes need to pay
attention to them, President Clinton included,'' Diamond said. He
acknowledged that he had no specific knowledge of Clinton's current
hormonal status and does not know how many sexual liaisons the
president has had in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're speculating here,'' he said, ``but I would
say from 35 years of clinical practice, I am seeing the tip of a
familiar iceberg.''

 &HT;    NEW TELECOM MEGA-MERGERS MAY FACE FEDERAL ROADBLOCKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress may have to move soon to foster
competition in the nation's telephone markets, two key senators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said after a hearing on a spate of new
major telecommunications deals that he would urge federal
regulators to put the brakes on further consolidations unless the
government can first ``guarantee that any mergers that are allowed
will have some clear pro-competitive benefits to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee chaired by
DeWine, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, said a joint letter calling
for an early policy review will go later this week to Justice
Department antitrust chief Joel Klein and Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see more tangible evidence that consumers have real
choices, the pressure will continue building to reopen the (1996
Telecommunications) Act and break the stalemate,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   As deep divisions on how best to proceed emerge among the
remaining industry giants, there are signs that regulators are
listening to the go-slow message from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kennard questioned whether there should be any more
big mergers in the long distance arena following the pending $37
billion union between MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will once again
be poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard
said. Future mergers ``of this or similar magnitude ... in the near
future should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday focused on the newly proposed link between
Bell Atlantic and GTE, which, if approved, would control about a
third of U.S. phone circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who favor these mergers claim that they will provide
companies with the financial and technical ability to compete in
the engine domestic and world markets for bundled information
services,'' DeWine said. ``Those who oppose them say these deals
are more of the same _ big companies getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses then promptly proceeded to voice both points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s chief executive officer,
said industry trends point ``toward the formation of a half-dozen
or so nationwide and worldwide organizations that can give
customers what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to retain what Seidenberg called ``artificial geographic
boundaries'' fail, he said, ``to take into account the needs of the
information-age consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint Corp., said two planned telecom mega-mergers _ the Bell
Atlantic-GTE deal and one between SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. _ ``are over the line and must be blocked'' because
they would in sum control two-thirds of U.S. local telephone access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Said Esrey, who heads the nation's third-ranked long-distance
carrier: ``Federal policy makers must step in and stop the local
telephone industry from transforming itself into, basically, a
Bell-West and a Bell-East monopoly.''

AN ARTIST AND A DOG THAT BECAME A CULTURAL ICON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Russians did not ask for a Blue Dog when
George Rodrigue visited the Soviet Union with President Ronald
Reagan a decade or so ago, but they thought a horse would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I painted Reagan on a white horse,'' said Rodrigue, the artist
from Cajun Louisiana who, before becoming so famous for his spooky,
comical and wildly prosperous renderings of cobalt-colored dogs,
painted other things, like heads of state. ``I painted Gorbachev on
the ground, holding out his hand in friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Soviet officials, including those who Rodrigue swears were from
the KGB, were unhappy with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it looked like Gorbachev was begging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted Mikhail Gorbachev painted on a horse, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he had a horse,'' Rodrigue told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't,'' one Soviet official answered.
</P>
<P>
   People can say what they like about Blue Dogs, Rodrigue's
paintings of what seems to be the same dog stuck almost like a
postage stamp on various landscapes, portraits and situations _
works that some critics, with sneers intact, dismiss as fad or not
really art at all.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a man's painting of his long-dead dog _ actually,
three different dead dogs lent inspiration for Blue Dog _ has
become a lasting sensation, with more than 1,200 Blue Dog paintings
since 1984. They hang everywhere from the White House to Whoopi
Goldberg's house, in Tom Brokaw's house and in the houses of no one
in particular. A Blue Dog hangs on the set of ``Friends'' and
stares from Neiman Marcus and Absolut vodka ads. You can't swing a
dead cat without hitting a Blue Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Famous people buy them and rich people buy them and even a few
drunk conventioneers buy them when they stagger into Rodrigue's
gallery in the French Quarter and are captivated by the little blue
dog with the round yellow eyes, but no one buys them cheaply. They
can range from a few thousand dollars to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The artist has earned millions and created a cultural icon. And
year after year, those who do not see what the big deal is about
ask the same thing: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Even Rodrigue, whose sometimes dark and eerie landscapes of his
native state made him a respected artist decades before Blue Dog,
is a little surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Before his Blue Dogs, he was acclaimed by Le Figaro as the
``Louisiana Rousseau.'' Italy awarded him its Gold Medal for the
arts, and he was honored by the Salon des Artistes of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by people's reactions,'' he said. It is not
unusual, he said, to have people stare at the Blue Dog paintings
and cry. ``The yellow eyes are really the soul of the dog,'' he
said. ``He has this piercing stare. People say the dog keeps
talking to them with the eyes, always saying something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics' claims that Rodrigue has hit on a modern-day
version of soup-can art just slide off him. If it is fashion, it is
fashion that has lasted almost 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have seen a Blue Dog painting always remember it,''
he said. ``They are really about life, about mankind searching for
answers. The dog never changes position. He just stares at you. And
you're looking at him, looking for some answers, `Why are we here?'
and he's just looking back at you, wondering the same. The dog
doesn't know. You can see this longing in his eyes, this longing
for love, answers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a dog,'' he added, but a dog trapped in that
same uncertainty all people feel. And no matter how many landscapes
the dog travels to, its expression never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the most famous Blue Dogs is one commissioned by
President Clinton for his inauguration, showing him and Vice
President Al Gore striding confidently into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Dog's creator comes from a people shackled by water. Drive
along the long, flat ribbons of asphalt through Cajun Louisiana,
and it often seems as if there is no dry land at all, just thin
stretches of road between black trees and swamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees are always very dark,'' he said of his early
paintings, ``but the people are in white,'' almost glimmering in
contrast to their surroundings, their feet barely touching the
ground. They seem ghostlike, their eyes staring straight ahead,
searching the face of the person who is searching their own faces
from the other side of the canvas. They seem to hang suspended in a
landscape, but the spirit inside them shines through, like a
lighted window from a cabin surrounded by swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue, the son of a bricklayer, was born in 1944 in New
Iberia, La. ``When I was in the third grade I got polio and had to
stay in bed a year and half,'' he said. ``That's when my mother
gave me some crayons and some clay.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 18, he went off to study at the Art Center College
of Design in Pasadena, Calif., and came home to find the bayou
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture was eroding and disappearing,'' he said. ``I
wanted to preserve that heritage, and I started painting the people
I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a good living painting the dark trees, doing portraits,
some from old photos, of Louisiana legends like Huey Long and his
brother, Earl. He did coffee table books and collaborated on an
acclaimed book of poetry. Often at his side as he painted was his
dog Tiffany, who lived from 1968 to 1980, just a little dog with
pointy ears.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he was asked to paint, for a collection of Cajun ghost
stories, a picture of a monster from his childhood, the ghost dog,
or werewolf, which appears blue in the moonlight. Here, people
called it the loup-garou.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tiffany had not been very fierce, Rodrigue used the
little dog as his model. He painted her blue, gave her red eyes and
positioned her on a grave. The image haunted him, trapped in the
canvas, searching. He could never get the dog out of his head.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he hung a Blue Dog painting with his other works at his
New Orleans gallery. People seemed to like it. The image of the dog
changed with time as memories of other dogs crept into his
paintings _ changed in its shade of blue (except when it is
possessed by spirits, and then it is red) and even a little in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained, well, a Blue Dog _ a Blue Dog with a naked
woman, a Blue Dog in a cowboy hat, a Blue Dog in a suit and tie, a
Blue Dog over the Manhattan skyline, a Blue Dog with . . . you name
it, you got it.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue paints in solitude at his cabin in the Atchafalaya
basin and always has to watch for floods. ``But I work from a
raised cottage. I'm on a platform about 12 feet above the water, so
I should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   An art critic in Atlanta called the dogs ``badly painted,'' but
people drove to one Atlanta show from as far away as Myrtle Beach,
S.C. A critic in New Orleans called the images ``lowbrow,'' but a
tourist from New York recently stood beside a $25,000 painting and
wondered aloud if she could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when Rodrigue started painting Blue Dogs
almost full time, he was reported to have made $4 million in one
year. He bought Mercedeses and Rolexes and other baubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People willing to spend $25,000 on a painting are in the
market for real art,'' he said. ``They know what they like. It
never was a fad. It's art.'' A Japanese buyer was said to have
spent $250,000 for one.
</P>
<P>
   When executives at Viking Studio Books saw a proposal for a book
about Blue Dog in 1994, they decided to raise the price, originally
no more than $19.95, to $45, convinced that it would sell
successfully at the high end. It did.
</P>
<P>
   The artist has no plans to stop painting Blue Dog, though he now
also enjoys doing Cajun landscapes in which no dogs appear. And he
likes to work on larger canvases now, some the size of pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a few steps from his French Quarter gallery is a gallery
that sells, almost exclusively, red cats _ red cats with
sunglasses, red cats with cows jumping over the moon, red cats on
the Empire State Building. Rodrigue does not seem flattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets $200 for a piece; I get $25,000,'' Rodrigue said. ``I
wish him luck, but a real artist wouldn't do that, you know.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Book 'em, Danno.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talkin' suspects, we're talkin' tickets. With the new
fall season in opera, theater, dance, art and music upon us, this
is the time to start planning ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the year's best beach days have waned, the months of
September through December have traditionally been the time to
rediscover the arts. And in a city as jam-packed with stuff to do
as Los Angeles, the choices are as vast as the freeway system that
carries us to our destination.
</P>
<P>
   Another good thing about our city is the sense of informality
that goes hand in hand with even the classiest occasions. In some
cities, classical music or opera performances are viewed as
quasi-religious events.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Los Angeles, where a relaxed atmosphere often prevails
in such hoity-toity venues as the Music Center downtown. Of course,
that doesn't mean T-shirt and jeans are acceptable for every event,
but one can usually get by in any outfit that's neat, clean and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the seasonal highlights this fall include the musical
``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance'' at the Ahmanson Theatre,
the L.A. Opera's ``Fantastic Mr. Fox,'' the ``Sunshine &AMP; Noir: Art
in L.A. (1960-97)'' exhibit at the Armand Hammer Museum and
Cultural Center and the acclaimed New York City Ballet at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular-music world, fans are anticipating evenings with
Elvis Costello &AMP; Burt Bacharach, PJ Harvey, Celine Dion, Christian
McBride, Massive Attack and Lucinda Williams, to name a few.
</P>
<P>

forthcoming album releases. &QL;

 &HT;    NEW TELECOM MEGA-MERGERS MAY FACE FEDERAL ROADBLOCKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress may have to move soon to foster
competition in the nation's telephone markets, two key senators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said after a hearing on a spate of new
major telecommunications deals that he would urge federal
regulators to put the brakes on further consolidations unless the
government can first ``guarantee that any mergers that are allowed
will have some clear pro-competitive benefits to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee chaired by
DeWine, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, said a joint letter calling
for an early policy review will go later this week to Justice
Department antitrust chief Joel Klein and Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see more tangible evidence that consumers have real
choices, the pressure will continue building to reopen the (1996
Telecommunications) Act and break the stalemate,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   As deep divisions on how best to proceed emerge among the
remaining industry giants, there are signs that regulators are
listening to the go-slow message from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kennard questioned whether there should be any more
big mergers in the long distance arena following the pending $37
billion union between MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will once again
be poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard
said. Future mergers ``of this or similar magnitude ... in the near
future should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday focused on the newly proposed link between
Bell Atlantic and GTE, which, if approved, would control about a
third of U.S. phone circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who favor these mergers claim that they will provide
companies with the financial and technical ability to compete in
the engine domestic and world markets for bundled information
services,'' DeWine said. ``Those who oppose them say these deals
are more of the same _ big companies getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses then promptly proceeded to voice both points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s chief executive officer,
said industry trends point ``toward the formation of a half-dozen
or so nationwide and worldwide organizations that can give
customers what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to retain what Seidenberg called ``artificial geographic
boundaries'' fail, he said, ``to take into account the needs of the
information-age consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint Corp., said two planned telecom mega-mergers _ the Bell
Atlantic-GTE deal and one between SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. _ ``are over the line and must be blocked'' because
they would in sum control two-thirds of U.S. local telephone access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Said Esrey, who heads the nation's third-ranked long-distance
carrier: ``Federal policy makers must step in and stop the local
telephone industry from transforming itself into, basically, a
Bell-West and a Bell-East monopoly.''

A PREVIEW OF WHAT COULD BE THE BEST FALL IN YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry. Alice Walker. Hunter S. Thompson with a novel.
Patricia Cornwell with a novella. One of the best best-known
American authors, Tom Wolfe, and perhaps the best of the
least-known, Pam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fiction, this fall could rank with the best of
literary times.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some exceptional nonfiction, too, from the likes
of Stephen Ambrose, Edmund Morris, A. Scott Berg and former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a month-by-month look at fall books:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones'' (Scribner, $28) arrives. The
one-time boy wonder of publishing has fallen on hard times,
saleswise, and has left longtime affiliate Viking to join Scribner.
King promises ``Bag of Bones'' will be both scary and literary.
</P>
<P>
   _ We also get ``The Loop'' (Delacorte, $25.95) from Nicholas
Evans, who apparently won't be a one-hit wonder with ``The Horse
Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't miss Pam Houston's short-story collection ``Waltzing the
Cat'' (Norton, $23.95). A half-dozen years ago, Houston's ``Cowboys
Are My Weakness'' established her as a fine young writer.
``Waltzing'' proves she's fine, period. If fall '98 only marks
Houston's breakthrough with mainstream readers, that alone would
qualify it as a significant milestone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Historians will drool over A. Scott Berg's ``Lindbergh''
(Putnam, $30). Berg's biography of Max Perkins is considered a
classic, and advance word pegs this book as better.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A World Transformed'' (Knopf, $18) teams President Bush with
Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser. Big news here is
Bush's reasoning behind stopping Desert Storm troops short of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Though less heralded, Julia Alvarez's ``Something to Declare''
(Algonquin, $20.95) promises excellence. It examines the
deceptively simple appearance of being a writer.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   OCTOBER
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Jordan is listed as author of ``For the Love of My
Game'' (Crown, $50), a photo-filled, ghost-written tome that
undoubtedly will outsell more scholarly titles like Paul Theroux's
``Sir Vidia's Shadow'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24), which detail's
Theroux's crumbling friendship with V.S. Naipaul.
</P>
<P>
   _ Melissa Muller's ``Anne Frank: A Biography'' (Holt, $23)
attempts to reconstruct Anne's brief life and even suggests which
informer might have betrayed the Franks to the Gestapo. It's
possible this book might be released in late September.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Updike reintroduces a favorite character in ``Bech at
Bay'' (Knopf, $23).
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Higgins Clark has a Christmas mystery, ``All Through the
Night'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17).
</P>
<P>
   _ Walter Moseley tries science fiction with ``Blue Light''
(Little, Brown, $25).
</P>
<P>
   _ Philip Roth returns with ``I Married a Communist'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $26).
</P>
<P>
   _ Alice Walker will please her fans with ``By the Light of My
Father's Smile'' (Random House, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hunter S. Thompson finally publishes his long-rumored novel
``The Rum Diaries'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   _ Other _ ahem _ authors we'll be meeting again in October
include Anne Rice with ``The Vampire Armand'' (Knopf, $26.95) and
Nora Roberts with ``The Reef'' (Putnam, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ Of special Texas interest are Dan Jenkins with ``Rude
Behavior'' (Doubleday, $24.95, may come out in September) and
Janice Woods Windle's ``Hill Country'' (Longstreet, $25).
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   _ November is traditionally the best month for fall books, as
publishers care so much about making early Christmas shopping
convenient. It begins, of course, with Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in
Full'' (Ferrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27.50), which possibly will be
pushed to late October. Wolfe's ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,''
published 10 years ago, remains the literary masterwork of the
'80s. ``A Man in Full,'' chronicling an Atlanta athlete accused of
rape, is supposed to be as good or better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Kingsolver is back with ``The Poisonwood Bible''
(HarperFlamingo, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   _ Alice Munro brings us ``The Love of a Good Woman'' (Knopf,
$24).
</P>
<P>
   _ Joyce Carol Oates attempts Gothicism with ``The Collector of
Hearts'' (Dutton, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ Perennial bestseller-list presences James Patterson (''When
the Wind Blows,'' Little, Brown, $25) and Danielle Steel (''Mirror
Image,'' Delacorte, $26.95) also have new titles on sale.
</P>
<P>
   _ In nonfiction, Stephen Ambrose (highly influential in ``Saving
Private Ryan'') completes his World War II trilogy with ``The
Victors: Eisenhower and His Boys'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $28).
</P>
<P>
   _ Political junkies, rejoice; November also brings Edmund
Morris' ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' (Random House, $30)
and ``All Too Human: A Political Education'' (Little, Brown,
$27.95) from former Clinton White House senior adviser George
Stephanopoulos. One suspects Bill and Hillary won't like what they
read there.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DECEMBER
</P>
<P>
   _ Larry McMurtry tries a third visit to Thalia with ``Duane's
Depressed'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26).
</P>
<P>
   _ David Baldacci, a lesser talent but recent bestseller-list
presence, is back with ``The Simple Truth'' (Warner, $25).
</P>
<P>
   _ In nonfiction, Tony Bennett has an autobiography (''The Good
Life,'' Pocket Books, $25) and historians Robert Lacey and Danny
Danziger tell us about ``The Year 1000: What Life Was Like a
Thousand Years Ago'' (Little, Brown, $22).

DEMOCRAT DECRIES LINK TO CLINTON'S CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Denouncing an effort to link him to a wounded
President Clinton, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis said California voters were
less interested in candidates' sex lives than in their stands on
public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor said his opponent,
Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren, might see his attempt to
use Clinton's character as a campaign issue backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want candidates to talk about what the
candidate's personal life is about,'' Davis said after a
fund-raising luncheon in San Francisco on Monday. ``They want them
to talk about issues that affect voters. How can you improve the
schools? How can you make the environment better? Are you
pro-choice? Those are the issues people want to hear about.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democratic women who attended the luncheon, which
raised $100,000 for Davis, expressed concern that female voters
disgusted with Clinton's character would stay away from the polls
in November, hurting Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go back to women and remind them that voting is
about issues that matter in their lives,'' said Ellen Malcolm,
president of Emily's List, which raises money for Democratic
candidates who are women.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' comments came as a new poll released Tuesday showed him
with a lead of 9 percentage points. The poll of 1,046 likely voters
by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 47 percent
supported Davis, while 38 percent backed Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has sought to capitalize on Clinton's troubles, saying
he would make character a central issue in the race. In a
television commercial entitled ``Character,'' Lungren says: ``You
can't tell people to do one thing while you do another. From the
White House to the school house ... that's what we ought to be
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   While he has not accused Davis of lying or adultery, Lungren has
criticized his opponent for, among other things, lacking the
character to take a stand on the North American Free Trade
Agreement because of his strong support from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jane Harman, who lost to Davis in the Democratic primary,
said she thought the link to Clinton was tenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are discerning,'' said Harman, who hosted the luncheon
for Davis. ``They certainly know that Gray Davis is not the same
person as Bill Clinton, and they also know that Bill Clinton's name
is not on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign tour in San Francisco, Davis turned attention to
issues on which he believes Lungren is weak: abortion, education
and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spoke of his support for abortion rights _ which Lungren
opposes _ and his opposition to Lungren's plan to give parents
school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis joined state Assemblyman Don Perata, a Democrat from
Alameda, in urging Republican Gov. Pete Wilson to sign Perata's
bill to limit assault weapons. Wilson is expected to veto the bill,
which would ban copycat versions of illegal assault weapons and
magazine clips of 20 rounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also attacked Lungren, who has not taken a position on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren spokesman Rob Stutzman said the attorney general was not
taking a position on the issue because he was defending the current
assault weapons bill, which is being challenged in the California
Supreme Court. Lungren has previously supported legislation
limiting the size of magazine clips on assault weapons, Stutzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Davis told reporters that while he condemned
Clinton's private behavior as ``inexcusable, indefensible and
embarrassing to all of us,'' he continued to support the
president's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just urge all Americans not to come to a final
conclusion until all the facts are in and both sides have made
their case,'' Davis said.

ROAD TO LEAN, MEAN PAVED WITH PIE-IN-THE-THIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>

By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like me, you've probably wondered why some women wear high heels
with shorts.
</P>
<P>
   I consider shorts casual clothing even if they are made of silk
or have some designer's name on them. Casual clothing calls for
casual footwear. Shorts and heels is not a bad look if the woman
has nice legs. It's just unusual, like a fellow wearing wingtips
with a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in ``live and let live'' for the most part, but that
doesn't stop me from being puzzled about certain things. So, as
luck would have it, I recently had an experience that solved this
mystery for me and, because you and I are close, personal friends,
I'm going to share it with you.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned in a previous column that I had surgery on my
shoulder a few weeks ago. I am considerably better now, but during
my recovery, I spent most of my time in bed eating and watching
television. In retrospect, it occurs to me that I could have
exercised my lower body even though my upper body was temporarily
disabled. Live and learn, eh? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I'm going to bypass the chewing all together and
just slit my thighs and stick the pie and cake right on in there.
That's where it's going anyway. Why bother with all that swallowing
and digesting? If I get my doctor to install a zipper, I can reduce
my lunch hour to 30 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was at physical therapy the other day sitting on a
bench and struggling to lift a small weight over my head when I
happened to glance into the mirror beside me. I was wearing shorts
and a T-shirt because it was a warm day and I wanted to be
comfortable during my exercises. My eyes zeroed in on my thigh, and
I was so disgusted that I dropped the weight on the floor. My thigh
looked like it had hail damage! Cellulite city!
</P>
<P>
   When on earth did that happen, I wondered. It's amazing my
therapist didn't hurl. No wonder he kept walking away and talking
to other people.
</P>
<P>
   I had to finish all my repetitions with the weights. I couldn't
just stand up and run out of the room like I wanted to do. I
managed to lift my legs off the bench just a bit by raising the
heels of my athletic shoes off the ground. My legs looked
infinitely better, and mercifully, my calf muscles bulged just a
bit. That's better, I thought. That's when I noticed that all of
the other women in the room were wearing long pants except for this
one big-boned lady who was wearing shorts and high heels. When I
looked at her face, she winked at me and smiled. Live and learn,
eh?
</P>
<P>
   I went home and got on my stationary bike. I started pumping as
hard as I could, determined to reverse a month of idleness in a
half-hour. As so often happens on these occasions, my mind began to
wander. I thought seriously about changing my name. When folks hear
the name ``Monica'' now, they don't think of the saint or the
teen-age singing sensation. They think of the Starr report and
cigars. The odds of someday having a granddaughter named after me
are very unfavorable at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I recalled the days when ``cool'' referred to moderately
cold temperatures. Now it means ``extraordinary.'' ``Funky'' once
meant ``foul smelling,'' and now it also defines something that is
``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe someday the name ``Monica'' will again be
associated with extraordinary _ no, make that exemplary _ women.
Unfortunately, that event and my leaner, meaner body are gonna take
a while.

ONCE-AWKWARD AMATEUR BECOMES LATE-NIGHT TV's HIPPEST HOST 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to remember the time before Conan O'Brien was CONAN
O'BRIEN, scrappy late-night survivor, after-hours star. That was
when O'Brien seemed like NBC's worst nightmare, a jittery,
red-haired kid with a cartoon face and a head shaped like a partly
bulldozed skyscraper. He'd amble onto the ``Late Night'' set with a
wicked, sly smile; after a barrage of biting but wildly uneven
comedy bits, he'd slither into his seat and face the day as the
interviewer with no clue.
</P>
<P>
   You can't seem to talk about O'Brien these days without speaking
of his rather unnoticeable rise (''Has it been five years?'' was a
comment I heard the other day; ``Is he still on?'' was another). Or
how his slow, methodical crawl to respectability is now measured by
a fawning, apologetic press and a network confident enough to trust
him with a prime-time special (Wednesday on NBC) to celebrate five
years on the air.
</P>
<P>
   How O'Brien survived can be found in the material presented
Wednesday, an hour of the skits and interviews that have evolved
along with their star. Watch, and you might see how O'Brien has
matured, how the timing of his stoic and affectless expressions
became quicker and sharper, along with the cocking of an eyebrow or
the grave nod of the head in that kind of ``yeah, right,'' attitude
that often mocks his guests.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years after a horrible debut and a string of
near-death experiences at the hands of NBC executives who wanted
nothing more than to right their wrong, ``Late Night With Conan
O'Brien'' is as hot as it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, O'Brien, now 35, has become the David Letterman of
a generation who think that the gap-toothed one on CBS is an
outdated old fogy. College kids flock to O'Brien's World Wide Web
site and to his show, which now attracts nearly as many 18- to
49-year-olds as Letterman did in his last season on NBC, amid
fiercer competition, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Part of O'Brien's appeal to young adults is the return of the
host-as-bully approach. There's a reason CBS snatched Craig Kilborn
from Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show'' to go toe-to-toe with
Conan next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, after spending time with the other court jesters of late
night, Letterman and Jay Leno, you can't help but notice O'Brien
and his steadfast refusal to operate from their political
correctness guideline _ that one that states you ought not offend
the delicate sensibility of even ``one'' person in our fragile
land.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Letterman is more or less a pop culture
irrelevancy, and Leno's ``Tonight Show'' has become so traditional
it verges on the archaic. With such blandness darkening the
landscape, it's no wonder O'Brien has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   And how resilient he has been. When he began hosting ``Late
Night With Conan O'Brien'' in 1993, media members (myself included)
brought out long, sharp knives to cut him to pieces, ripping NBC
for hiring a man whose claim to fame was writing for ``The
Simpsons'' and ``Saturday Night Live,'' and whose on-camera
experience was practically zilch.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism mounted after O'Brien went on. He was visibly nervous
and awkward. He often looked down at his notes instead of at
guests. Comedy skits were inventive but flat, edgy but uneven,
irreverent but often tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien admits now that he was literally in a state of panic, a
place he doesn't mind being because it keeps him focused. He kept
the faith even though NBC kept him on a string of short-term deals
while privately searching for a real host.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambivalence gave O'Brien time to build. Slowly, ``Late
Night'' developed a soul and direction, becoming a regular haunt
for comedians such as Janeane Garofalo and musical acts such as
Green Day, Goo Goo Dolls and Jewel. Soon Conan was the clever
hotshot, bent on getting buttoned-down guests to step out of their
personas, quite the Letterman thing to do. (Seeing NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw pulled from his anchor desk by a Godzilla-size creature was
priceless.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's producer, Jay Ross, insists that even during the bad
days they never wavered. All they had to do was stay afloat long
enough for the host to learn how to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, O'Brien is far more relaxed and inventive with his
comedy skits, and has improved vastly as an interviewer. His
follow-up questions are witty and logical, not stilted and
mechanical; his comebacks are snappier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, O'Brien got ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' Sarah
Michelle Gellar to talk about the lameness of horror films. Gellar
found it ``weird'' for slasher victims to be sitting at home
wearing high heels and then delivered the punch line, ``I don't
know about you, but I don't wear heels in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   This prompted O'Brien to quickly re-punch the punch line:
``Well, `I' do. It's comfortable and makes me look more
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this air of improvised looseness that stands out.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you think of this: Many ``A''-list stars plugging
their latest whatever may begin to sidestep O'Brien for Letterman
and Leno, where they are certain to find hosts far more agreeable
to their often self-serving, empty chatter.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Brien would mutter, ``Who ever would have thunk it?''

hundreds of charred stumps from old prairie fires, budding new
mesquites and protected by a towering chain-link fence. Behind the
fence lies the Comanche National Indian Cemetery. It is not a
cemetery specifically for Comanches, nor is it administered by the
federal government. It is a repository of sorts, a place where the

STRATEGIES FOR MAKING VEGETABLES PALATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no better time than right now _ OK, you could have
started earlier in the summer _ to get into what nutritionists call
the Five-a-Day habit: eating five servings of fruits and vegetables
every day.
</P>
<P>
   This is a habit that scientists suggest can help prevent a host
of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and stroke. But it is
a habit that very few people have cultivated because most of us
prefer the taste of potato chips to fresh potatoes and
fruit-flavored candy bars to fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   That's stiff competition, but at this moment, when many fruits
and vegetables are local and at their peak of flavor, they have a
fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes here suggest ways to bring out the best flavor of
what's in the market _ green beans and potatoes, tomatoes and
plums. You might also consider taking vegetable-hating children to
pick-your-own farms and letting them help harvest what you want
them to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Locally grown fruits and vegetables are better for reasons
beyond freshness. The varieties grown locally differ from what is
grown thousands of miles away because they do not have to withstand
a long arduous journey. They can be selected for flavor, rather
than hardiness.
</P>
<P>
   A fruit can be picked at the moment of ripeness, when it has the
perfect balance of sweetness and acidity; a vegetable can be picked
while it is immature, that is, young and tender.
</P>
<P>
   This makes perfect common sense but has been difficult to
document because little scientific work has been done on the taste
of fruits and vegetables picked at the right moment for eating,
versus those picked to travel well for thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the Produce for Better Health Foundation, which
was created by the produce industry and others to promote the
Five-a-Day plan, its president, Dr. Elizabeth Pivonka, sidestepped
the question of which tastes better, local produce or produce that
travels across the country or across the world. Instead, Dr.
Pivonka said, ``There is a lot of good fruit from Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is, and I'm sure the Chileans enjoy it at the
peak of flavor. With an increasingly global economy, we will get
more fruits and vegetables from the ends of the earth, but eating
nectarines in February and asparagus in November is no way to learn
how they should truly taste.
</P>
<P>
   At least one scientist, Dr. Alley Watada of the Agricultural
Research Service of the Agriculture Department in Beltsville, Md.,
has been studying the difference in taste and nutrition between
locally grown tomatoes picked when perfectly ripe and those picked
while ripening. Watada said, ``Without question, the red ripe
tomatoes had the most nutrients and tasted the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The taste was determined at the Horticulture Crops Quality
Laboratory by a sensory panel, a group of people trained to
recognize differences in taste. The ripest tomatoes also had about
5 percent more nutrients like vitamin C than those that were not
fully ripe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Watada has done work with honeydews, too. And
guess what he said? The locally grown honeydews now in the market
taste better than the ones that come from Chile in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   PLUM COMPOTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 to 30 minutes, plus chilling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   4 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 3-inch stick cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   16 large, firm ripe red or black plums, stemmed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine the sugar, wine, one cup of water, cloves, cinnamon
and lemon zest in a saucepan large enough to hold the plums. Bring
the ingredients to a boil, and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Add plums, and bring mixture back to a boil; lower heat, and
simmer plums for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on their ripeness,
until they are tender but still hold their shape. Some plums will
be ready before others; remove them as they are. Then when they are
all cooked, return the plums to the syrup, remove from heat and let
cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Chill plums in the syrup. Serve over vanilla ice cream or
frozen yogurt with some of the syrup, or serve with their syrup
topped with whipped cream or creme fraiche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BEANS AND POTATO SALAD  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 to 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds tiny new potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 pound young green beans or haricots verts (French green
beans), washed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cook potatoes in water to cover for 10 to 20 minutes,
depending on their size, until they are tender but firm; drain, and
cut in quarters or halves, again depending on size. Meanwhile,
steam the green beans 5 to 7 minutes, depending on their thickness;
drain, and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Cut in
quarters or thirds, depending on size.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, lemon juice
and mustard; stir in the thyme and onion. When potatoes are cooked,
stir them into the dressing. If the salad is not to be served
immediately, do not add the green beans: the acid of the dressing
will turn them gray. Cover the beans well, cover the dressed
potatoes and refrigerate separately.
</P>
<P>
   3. To serve, let the vegetables return to room temperature. Stir
the green beans into the potatoes and dressing, and season with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   MEDITERRANEAN COUSCOUS SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 35 to 40 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 cups vegetable or chicken stock or broth
</P>
<P>
   2 cups instant whole wheat couscous
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 2 oranges
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 jalapenos, trimmed, seeded and finely minced
</P>
<P>
   2 dozen green or black medium French, Italian or Greek olives,
pitted and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped capers
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (about 10 ounces) julienned red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 pound zucchini, cut into julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely diced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced fennel
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-large ripe tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring stock to boil in covered pot. Add couscous, remove from
heat and allow to sit for five minutes, until liquid has been
absorbed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk oil, vinegar, mustard and garlic in a serving bowl. Add
orange zest, jalapenos, olives and capers, and mix well. Stir in
the red pepper, zucchini, onion and fennel, and season with salt
and pepper. Stir in the couscous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. If not serving immediately, refrigerate without the tomatoes.
No more than 30 minutes before serving, cut up the tomatoes and
stir in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

NOSTALGIA VIES WITH MODERNITY IN MONET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Sept. 20.)  
 (HLW)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Not so long ago, 20 or 25 years maybe, Monet wasn't the
immensely popular figure that he is now. If you go back yet another
25 years, people were actually talking about the need to reconsider
his career, or part of it: in the early 1950s, American critics
looking for antecedents to what the Abstract Expressionists were
doing latched onto Monet's late works, like the Water Lilies, which
had been mostly disregarded for a quarter century. To the critics,
Monet suddenly justified Pollock, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the 1980s that a Monet show, like the one
opening here today, was guaranteed, no matter how good or bad it
might be, to bring in hundreds of thousands of people and to
require the whole elaborate system of advance sales, ticketing by
the hour, membership incentives, gift paraphernalia and group
tours.
</P>
<P>
   The progress of Monet's reputation says something, I suspect,
not just about ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' which is the name of
the show now at the Museum of Fine Arts, but also about the
public's relationship to 20th-century art generally.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he so popular? Lots of great artists aren't. He didn't
cut off any ears or fail to sell his paintings before he died _ in
fact for much of his life he was immensely rich and successful _ so
there's no obvious biographical angle, though when Giverny was
opened to the public in 1980 it did give a place to his fame. It
became a pilgrimage site, art's Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the answer must be in the pictures, and I think
it involves the essential soft core of the art: the way works like
the Water Lilies become passive receptacles for nostalgia. Monet's
popularity reveals our desire for art as both refuge and spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Diderot famously distinguished between two kinds of painting.
One was all-over sharp-focus; he talked about ``the law of
universal finish.'' The entire surface of the picture was evenly
articulated, so that, as he put it, ``my relation to such a picture
is like my relation to the nature that was the painter's model.''
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of painting imitates what a scene looks like from
a painter's vantage point. Rembrandt was Diderot's example. Objects
are in focus or out of focus; they lose definition when you back
away from the picture or when you move in closer than the artist
was standing from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's late Water Lilies fit neither of these descriptions.
They're all-over evenly unarticulated and everywhere out of focus,
meaning your eye lands nowhere, it drifts, and the effect doesn't
really change as your position does. Nothing in them is more
important than anything else: everything, water, water lily, sky,
cloud, air, river grass and willow converge and are consumed in the
fluid surface.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds a little like what's sometimes said about Pollock's
art, but Pollock's drips make an impossible entanglement. There's
so much going on in them that you can't take them apart _ which is
to say that they're all-over evenly articulated. You eye races
restlessly over his busy, impenetrable surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   That's a crucial difference. With Monet's pictures we want to
immerse ourselves, to achieve a mood that is akin to theirs, which
is a kind of keen but hallucinatory state not unlike the condition
of memory.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean by this that Monet was a nostalgic painter. He was
too rigorous to be nostalgic. But his images show reflections in
water and they themselves seem reflective: they suggest the quality
of experiencing a thing indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be a bit ashamed to be thinking about little
investigations into forms and colors while so many people suffer
and die for us,'' he said about the work he was doing during World
War I. This was precisely the criticism leveled at him then and
also between the wars: that in the midst of chaos, he retreated
into meditations on nature while more responsible artists were
turning to orderly forms of neo-classicism.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we feel differently about order in art today. Among
other things, after having seen how Hitler and Stalin embraced
neo-classicism, Monet's eye candy no longer seems so bad. He is now
perceived by the public, I think, as a painter of sufficient but
comprehensible modernity and unthreatening beauty, which for many
people clearly comes as relief from all the aggressive and
incomprehensible art of the last few decades. His appeal grows as
the gap between new art and public taste widens.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cliche that Monet's expanding fame has created conditions
in which it's impossible to appreciate him: you can't lose yourself
in front of pictures with hundreds of other people jostling for
repose. No doubt Boston will be mobbed. At least ``Monet in the
20th Century'' isn't a flabby event like so many recent Monet
shows. It comes with an important catalog. Pictures are in the
exhibition that haven't been seen before. The show is intelligently
organized around a proper armature _ the chronological unfolding of
his work between 1900 and his death in 1926, at 86.
</P>
<P>
   From his paintings of London and Venice and his early views of
Giverny we're led past the big sketches and unfinished works on
which he spent the rest of his life. Most of them he never
exhibited; they were preparations for, or variations on the
Orangerie murals in Paris, his last great project, which got such a
tepid response when it opened.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a revelation here it involves the leap Monet made
from the London and Venice works to the later ones: his art became
both much wilder and monumental. At the end of his life he made
Impressionism serve a new purpose, not just to mimic the effect of
light in a landscape but also to approximate the actual scale of
the landscape: to place us in physical relation to an image that
is, as it is in nature, much larger than we are.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Picasso translating Cubism to mural proportions for
Guernica. That work is iconic but awful: Cubist faceting, enlarged,
flattens into billboard planes, and the picture is a cartoonish mix
of symbolism and abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's art, by comparison, was much more adaptable to shifts in
scale. The reason is that it was about surface effect. And the
larger the surface the bigger the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a way of saying it's superficial? Paul Tucker, the Monet
scholar, prefers to see symbolism in the late art. After the
Dreyfus Affair, he argues in the catalog, painting ravishing
pictures in France ``was not conservative escapism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By returning to the fundamentals of his craft in 1899 _ to the
purity of touch, the clarity of light, the distinctiveness of form,
and the readability of space _ Monet was not retreating,'' Tucker
writes. ``He was providing a clarion call for France to re-examine
her building blocks, to encourage an honest accounting and to start
anew. It is appropriate, of course, that his vocabulary is an
intensified form of Impressionism. By 1899 Impressionism was hailed
as a national style, one that rightfully and properly represented
the best characteristics of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, though the forms mostly look indistinct. Especially in
the very last paintings, space seems to collapse and fold. You
might as easily say that these pictures turned their backs on
everything else happening in the world then: that this is exactly
what makes them enduringly popular.
</P>
<P>
   They're decorative. There's nothing the matter with decoration.
In Monet's great view of Parliament at sunset, the building
dissolves in a sulphurous blue-gold haze, the soft paint like
brushed fur. ``Bridge Over the Water Lily Pond'' from 1900, the
version that belongs to the Art Institute of Chicago, captures
perfectly what happens in the late afternoon, when the low sun
picks out a willow behind the bridge, which is in shadow, and
creates an effect of back lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowd pleasers here will no doubt be the final Water
Lilies. I prefer the sketches from a little earlier. A group of
unfinished works from the mid-teens, saturated in color, look as if
they're drawn with pastel, the lines like confetti streamers. In
``Wisteria,'' spaghetti squiggles float high against a sky-blue
ground, a virtual abstraction and a pure, simple pleasure. Guston,
Sam Francis and a slew of other painters come to mind. The picture
tells you everything you need to know about Monet's legacy to the
20th century.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Haimes used to be fat. He dropped 55 pounds
several years ago, down to a trim 170 on a 5-foot-10-inch frame,
resolving to live long enough to see his two children grow up. And
though he looks like he has always been fit, Haimes has never been
cavalier about conquering his weight problem. He keeps his fat
pictures around to remind him not to overeat, worried that without
absolute vigilance, the large man inside of him could easily emerge
again.
</P>
<P>
   This goes a long way toward explaining how Haimes, 42, has
become a success in the theater: not with great strides or grand
gestures, but through dogged, painstaking work and the sense that
at any moment it could all fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe these insecurities and these self-doubts make me work
harder,'' he said last week. ``All I know is, I feel about my job
the way I feel about my weight _ I never feel complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   This combination of confidence and caution may be what the
executives at Livent Inc., the financially troubled producer of
theatrical blockbusters, were banking on when they selected Haimes
earlier this month to be their new artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes has been cast in the most closely watched offstage drama
in theater. After running the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company
for 15 years, he is now entrusted with a crucial role in the rescue
of Livent, the only major publicly traded company exclusively
devoted to theater, one known for extravagant productions and
expensive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Livent, which owns and operates five theaters in the United
States and Canada, has seven acting companies in five productions
worldwide, including ``Ragtime'' in New York. The company also has
several new productions in the works, such as ``Parade,'' being
produced with the Lincoln Center Theater, and ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes took the helm amid allegations that Livent's founder and
artistic director, Garth H. Drabinsky, along with the company's
co-founder, Myron I. Gottlieb, had kept two sets of financial books
to conceal excessive spending. Both were suspended by the owners
last month, the stock has been frozen since early August, and irate
stockholders have filed a class-action lawsuit against Livent.
</P>
<P>
   And Haimes, who has assumed the duties of the flamboyant
Drabinsky, is expected to somehow make it all better.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haimes pulled the Roundabout through tough times, this
is nevertheless new territory. He comes from institutional theater,
where he had to satisfy subscribers and a board of directors;
Livent, based in Toronto, has to show annual profit increases that
will please shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout has been known for featuring plays by Arthur
Miller and George Bernard Shaw in its two theaters in Manhattan,
which seat 500 and 400; Livent made a name for itself by producing
splashy musicals like ``Ragtime'' and ``Show Boat'' for theaters
that seat 1,800 and 1,900, with hopes of cloning them for touring
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout has an $18 million annual operating budget and
pays actors between $650 and $1,000 a week, even stars. Livent's
budget last year was more than $250 million, not including the
amortization of pre-production costs and administrative expenses.
(A spokesman said it does not disclose actors' salaries.)
</P>
<P>
   Haimes has extensive theater experience and is widely credited
with making the Roundabout successful. But his experience in
commercial theater is limited to sending several productions to
Broadway houses, all of which failed to recoup their investment in
the hands of new producers, despite critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Haimes' mandate from Livent's owners, the
New York investment banker Roy Furman and the Hollywood power
broker Michael Ovitz, is just to pick up the pieces or to take the
company in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said he thinks he is expected to do a bit of both. ``The
message I got from Roy and Michael was twofold,'' Haimes said. ``To
do what Livent has been doing but in a much more financially
efficient and effective way, and to be able to serve a wider range
of artists in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Some theater professionals see Haimes' leap to Livent as
dramatic, given the historically distinct worlds of institutional
and commercial theater. ``The whole motive of a not-for-profit is
to do worthwhile events that aren't necessarily commercial,'' said
John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer and chairman of the Theater
Development Fund. ``Therefore, the artistic imperative often comes
right up against the commercial reality. A commercial venture is
not necessarily set up solely for the public good; it's a different
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   But others suggest that the two spheres have become increasingly
reciprocal and that Haimes' appointment reflects that shift. ``In
terms of the 90's and culture and the arts, it seems to be an
incredibly sensible move to me,'' said Neil Pepe, the artistic
director of the Atlantic Theater Company, a nonprofit theater in
Chelsea. ``Just look at some of the successful straight plays on
Broadway _ a lot have come out of not-for-profits. It's a clear
sign that the two should be working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Haimes insisted that artistic excellence and commercial
success need not be mutually exclusive and said he plans to bring
some of his Roundabout sensibility to Livent. `
</P>
<P>
   `Clearly the financial underpinning of Livent is the bigger
musicals that fill the bigger theaters that we own. There's just no
getting away from that and that's great,'' Haimes said. ``But one
of my interests is expanding the work of Livent to serve all
different levels of production. Five years from now I'd like to see
the same director who directs a large musical also direct a new
play for Livent in a 300-seat theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my dream is to see whether there's a commercial model
for a large institutional theater,'' he continued. ``I don't know
the answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of unanswered questions, the move to Livent is
also risky for Haimes. Many in the theater community question
Livent's very survival. Perhaps, cynics may suggest, this is why
Haimes is also hanging on to his post as artistic director of the
Roundabout through the 1998-99 season, as a hedge against Livent's
potential downfall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Haimes said he had confidence in Livent's longevity and that
he is staying on at Roundabout because he does not want to leave
the theater in the lurch, particularly as it prepares to move to
its new home in the Selwyn Theater on 42nd Street. ``My work is not
finished,'' he said. ( Furman said Haimes' commitment to the
Roundabout was fine with him.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Haimes will have to adapt to a new corporate
culture. He used to chat casually with reporters in his office at
his convenience, for example; now a Livent public relations person
schedules his interviews and sits in on them, taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether he is up to his new task, Haimes was typically
self-deprecating. ``I do sort of worry about my ability to do for
Livent what I want to do for Livent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Haimes knows he must have done something right
to get to this point, and says that Livent is really just the
Roundabout on a larger scale, although some might question that
perception. ``I have found that the only way I feel comfortable
doing this is to trust my instincts,'' he said. ``And up to now,
they've been more often right than wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said he has weathered worse than Livent's difficulties.
The Roundabout has endured bankruptcy, near financial collapse and
the recent construction accident in Times Square, which temporarily
closed three of his productions, including the highly successful
``Cabaret,'' causing losses of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, having earned an MBA at Yale and come up on the
management side of the arts, Haimes makes no apologies for wanting
theater to make a profit. ``I truly believe that theater is a
business,'' he said. ``Artistic success is the most profoundly
moving, but I can't separate that from financial stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said the Roundabout has run in the black since he became
managing director there in 1983. Since then, the theater has grown
from a start-up in a supermarket basement to the second-largest
nonprofit theater after Lincoln Center's. Last season, the
Roundabout's three Broadway productions _ ``Cabaret,'' ``A View
From the Bridge'' and ``1776'' _ were nominated for 17 Tony Awards
in 14 of the 21 categories and won 6.
</P>
<P>
   Furman, who was instrumental in flagging Livent's financial
disarray and suspending Drabinsky, said Haimes was his choice for
two main reasons: ``He understands the bottom line, he's greatly
respected in the theater community.''
</P>
<P>
   As Haimes rides the fine line between what's good and what
sells, some people in the theater say he has already had
considerable practice at the Roundabout, which has generally staged
accessible works that please a broadly based audience of 35,000
subscribers, whose contributions make up 20 percent of the
theater's budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Haimes takes issue with the suggestion that the Roundabout
is risk-averse, saying that opening ``Cabaret'' in a small theater
was a major gamble and that, had ``1776'' failed to take off, the
results would have been financially devastating. ``I honestly feel
we pushed the envelope,'' he said. ``I have no apologies at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a theater community often known for its backbiting
competitiveness, people had generous words for Haimes. ``I think
it's a great appointment,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of
Jujamcyn Theaters. ``He's obviously very fiscally responsible and
realistic, he understands what a budget is and how it works, he has
good taste and he's a very personable kind of guy who I think
inspires confidence in the people he deals with.''
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Richardson, who starred in the Roundabout's productions
of ``Cabaret'' and ``Anna Christie'' and now serves on the
theater's advisory council, said of Haimes, ``He is a truly rare
thing in this business in that he is not an opportunist and he's
not an egotist.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said he knows he's in for a difficult year. He has
already been struggling to balance his intense loyalty to work and
to fatherhood (he has a daughter, 11, and a son, 10). And he
acknowledged that his career has strained his 16-year marriage to
Alison Bender Haimes, a neuroradiologist he met while working on a
college production of ``Kiss Me Kate'' at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he looked forward to the work and that he
hoped his sense of self-abnegation would serve him well. ``I am
sort of a half-empty person, not a half-full person,'' he said.
``Even after this successful season at Roundabout, I never feel,
`Wow, I'm on top of the world.' I always feel, `How am I going to
keep this level up?'''

</P>
<P>
   `I admit that wasn't good, but you did it for a good cause.`

<P>
   `Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,` said the husband. `Why
do you ask such a question?`
</P>
<P>
   `Would you remarry?` persevered the wife.
</P>
<P>
   `No, of course not, dear` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Don't you like being married?` said the wife.
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I do, dear` he said.
</P>
<P>
   `Then why wouldn't you remarry?`
</P>
<P>
   `Alright,` said the husband, `I'd remarry.`
</P>
<P>
   `You would?` said the wife, looking vaguely hurt.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Would you sleep with her in our bed?` said the wife after a
long pause.
</P>
<P>
   `Well yes, I suppose I would.` replied the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `I see,` said the wife indignantly.` And would you let her wear
my old clothes?`
</P>
<P>
   `I suppose, if she wanted to` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Really,` said the wife icily. `And would you take down the

</P>
<P>
   `Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.`

<P>
   `Is that so?` said the wife, leaping to her feet.

<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week, Mr. Clinton saw a Broadway play. Bad
move. Would you have seen ``The Lion King'' if you were known as
the lyin' king?
</P>
<P>
   The Starr Report alleged 11 grounds for impeaching Mr. Clinton.
Odd. There are only 10 Commandments anyone can break.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's job approval ratings remain high in the polls. To
celebrate, he'd do well to avoid lighting up a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes of evidence Ken Starr sent to Congress are stored in a
locked, soundproofed, guarded room near the Capitol. In other
words, a place that might be attractive to Mr. Clinton for a sexual
liaison.
</P>
<P>
   What symmetry. Monica Lewinsky started out starry-eyed and has
ended up Starrized.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the next desk says he's tried to read the Starr
Report but finally has decided just to wait for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``Usually people riding buses hide racy
magazines behind the newspaper. But I've seen three people today

   Mark McGwire's 62nd home run -- big story. Right after he hit
it, he forgot to touch first base . He was going right to second
base, passed by first base completely. Sounds like a date with
Monica Lewinsky.

   According to this week's Time magazine, more teenagers know
Leonardo DiCaprio than know Al Gore. You know the difference
between Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore? See, Al Gore knows what it's
like to be on a sinking ship. Leonardo, he's just in a movie.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week, Mr. Clinton saw a Broadway play. Bad
move. Would you have seen ``The Lion King'' if you were known as
the lyin' king?
</P>
<P>
   The Starr Report alleged 11 grounds for impeaching Mr. Clinton.
Odd. There are only 10 Commandments anyone can break.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's job approval ratings remain high in the polls. To
celebrate, he'd do well to avoid lighting up a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes of evidence Ken Starr sent to Congress are stored in a
locked, soundproofed, guarded room near the Capitol. In other
words, a place that might be attractive to Mr. Clinton for a sexual
liaison.
</P>
<P>
   What symmetry. Monica Lewinsky started out starry-eyed and has
ended up Starrized.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the next desk says he's tried to read the Starr
Report but finally has decided just to wait for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``Usually people riding buses hide racy
magazines behind the newspaper. But I've seen three people today
hide their Starr Report edition of the newspaper behind a naughty
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recent polls show Americans favor letting Mr. Clinton stay
in office. We agree _ at least until he's gotten rid of any carpet
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Some days it seems as if the name of our paper should be The
Kansas City Starr.

   &UR; THE SINNER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was about a month ago when a man in Amsterdam felt that he
needed to confess, so went to his priest:
</P>
<P>
   `Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. During WWII I hid a
refuge in my attic.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` answered the priest, `that's not a sin.`
</P>
<P>
   `But I made him agree to pay me 20 Gulden for every
</P>
<P>
   week he stayed.`
</P>
<P>
   `I admit that wasn't good, but you did it for a good cause.`
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, thank you, Father; that eases my mind. I have one more
question...`
</P>
<P>
   `What is that, my son?`
</P>
<P>
   `Do I have to tell him the war is over?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEN AND WOMEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two women were at a bar. One looked at the other and said, `You
know, 80 percent of all men think the best way to end an argument
is to make love.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` said the other woman,` that will certainly revolutionize
the game of hockey!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `Dear,` said the wife. `What would you do if I died?`
</P>
<P>
   `Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,` said the husband. `Why
do you ask such a question?`
</P>
<P>
   `Would you remarry?` persevered the wife.
</P>
<P>
   `No, of course not, dear` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Don't you like being married?` said the wife.
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I do, dear` he said.
</P>
<P>
   `Then why wouldn't you remarry?`
</P>
<P>
   `Alright,` said the husband, `I'd remarry.`
</P>
<P>
   `You would?` said the wife, looking vaguely hurt.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Would you sleep with her in our bed?` said the wife after a
long pause.
</P>
<P>
   `Well yes, I suppose I would.` replied the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `I see,` said the wife indignantly.` And would you let her wear
my old clothes?`
</P>
<P>
   `I suppose, if she wanted to` said the husband.
</P>
<P>
   `Really,` said the wife icily. `And would you take down the
pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.`
</P>
<P>
   `Is that so?` said the wife, leaping to her feet.
</P>
<P>
   `And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too.`
</P>
<P>
   `Of course not, dear,` said the husband. `She is left-handed.`

`THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN': SEARCHING FOR A LIFE, HE FOUND THE
LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subtitle of Simon Winchester's new book, ``The Professor and
the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford
English Dictionary,'' suggests one of the odder thematic
combinations in recent publishing history. One might even suspect
that no true story could bring these three elements together. But
in fact ``The Professor and the Madman,'' the story of two oddly
matched figures who were instrumental in creating the monumental
OED, entirely fulfills its subtitular promise.
</P>
<P>
   The madman of Winchester's title (and the murderer of the
subtitle) is William Chester Minor, an American doctor who served
in the Civil War, then went to London in 1871 and, out of what we
might now call a psychotic fantasy of persecution, killed a man he
had never met. The professor is James Murray, the philologist and
lexicographer who directed the enormous project to compile a
complete record of the history and meanings of every word in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester, a British journalist who has written many books, has
laid out a fascinating, spicy, learned tale in his account of the
strange collaboration between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The book starts with an apocryphal story. Minor, living in a
town called Crowthorne, about 50 miles from Oxford, was one of many
volunteers who supplied information to the compilers of the
dictionary. Murray, appreciative of Minor's contribution, traveled
to Crowthorne in 1896 to meet him, and once there he discovered to
his shock that his lexicographical helpmate was an inmate at the
Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But as Winchester's historical detective work reveals, the
meeting of the two men did not happen exactly that way. Murray knew
before he went to meet Minor that he was an inmate of the asylum.
Two decades before this first meeting, which Winchester places in
1891, Minor was found not guilty by reason of insanity for the
murder. Murray's appreciation of his unorthodox colleague was based
on 10 years of Minor's prodigious volunteer work on the dictionary,
work in which he established a unique role among the thousands of
people who provided information for the great project. His role in
the OED was a kind of penance, but the eerie paradox of these
fateful crossings of paths is that had Minor never committed
murder, he would never have been committed to Broadmoor, where he
had endless time, and he would never have made his remarkable
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Minor is the most interesting of the three main characters in
Winchester's story, Murray and the OED itself being the other two.
He was 37 when he went to London and murdered one George Merrett, a
father of seven, in the early hours of a frigid morning in Lambeth,
the dreary borough on the South Bank of the Thames famous for its
bawdy music halls, its prostitutes and the 12th-century Lambeth
Palace. Minor was born to missionary parents in Ceylon, went to
Yale Medical School before serving in the Union Army, and developed
a morbid fear of the Irish, a strange phenomenon but well explained
by Winchester. His paranoia sent him to an asylum in Washington
when the war was over, and it was on his release in 1871 that he
went to London in search of a new life, a search that led him very
quickly to Broadmoor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Murray, the son of a tailor and draper and a
prodigious scholar, became the head of the ambitious project of the
London Philological Society to compile what became, after 70 years
of labor, the OED. As he does with every one of the dramatis
personae (including the man killed by Minor), Winchester artfully
brushes in the necessary background, including a brief and
fascinating history of British lexicography going back to before
Samuel Johnson. When the new dictionary was conceived, he says of
the OED, ``it was a project of almost unimaginable boldness and
foolhardiness, requiring great bravura, risking great hubris.'' It
was, in short, a perfect emblem of British pride and power in the
Victorian age.
</P>
<P>
   To compile it, Murray enlisted the help of a large corps of
volunteers who would pore through every book that had been
published in English up to that time and cull quotations
demonstrating each word's uses. This is where Minor came in. Most
of the volunteers simply noted interesting quotations in the books
assigned to them. Minor created what we might now call a data base,
a vast collection of word lists and indexes, so that ``he stood
ready now to help the dictionary project as it needed to be helped,
by sending over quotations at the precise time the editors needed
them.'' His first word was art. Whereas most volunteers came up
with a couple of quotations, Minor delivered 27. He was ``able to
tap deep into wells of knowledge and research.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchester, who says that he had access to files closed for a
century, follows Minor for his entire life, and uncovers some
episodes that make for painful reading. ``The Madman and the
Professor'' is a kind of case study of mental illness, the quietly
mighty struggle of a man to create a world of significance even as
his disease became more virulent and horrible as time went by.
Winchester leads one to visualize the afflicted, guilt-ridden,
demon-obsessed Minor alone in his cell patiently compiling his vast
lists, corresponding with Murray and ardently seeking recognition.
The vision is exceedingly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minor wants desperately to know that he is being helpful,''
Winchester writes. ``He wants to feel involved. He wants, but knows
he can never demand, that praise be showered on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor also tried to make amends to the widow and children of the
man he murdered, in particular by giving them money. But his
enduring monument is the great dictionary that he worked on for 20
lonely years, striving to invest meaning into a ruined life.

was, in short, a perfect emblem of British pride and power in the
Victorian age.
</P>
<P>
   To compile it, Murray enlisted the help of a large corps of
volunteers who would pore through every book that had been
published in English up to that time and cull quotations
demonstrating each word's uses. This is where Minor came in. Most
of the volunteers simply noted interesting quotations in the books
assigned to them. Minor created what we might now call a data base,
a vast collection of word lists and indexes, so that ``he stood
ready now to help the dictionary project as it needed to be helped,
by sending over quotations at the precise time the editors needed
them.'' His first word was art. Whereas most volunteers came up
with a couple of quotations, Minor delivered 27. He was ``able to
tap deep into wells of knowledge and research.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchester, who says that he had access to files closed for a
century, follows Minor for his entire life, and uncovers some
episodes that make for painful reading. ``The Madman and the
Professor'' is a kind of case study of mental illness, the quietly
mighty struggle of a man to create a world of significance even as
his disease became more virulent and horrible as time went by.
Winchester leads one to visualize the afflicted, guilt-ridden,
demon-obsessed Minor alone in his cell patiently compiling his vast
lists, corresponding with Murray and ardently seeking recognition.
The vision is exceedingly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minor wants desperately to know that he is being helpful,''
Winchester writes. ``He wants to feel involved. He wants, but knows
he can never demand, that praise be showered on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor also tried to make amends to the widow and children of the
man he murdered, in particular by giving them money. But his
enduring monument is the great dictionary that he worked on for 20
lonely years, striving to invest meaning into a ruined life.

 &HT;    STARR GRAND JURY POISED FOR INDICTMENTS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 23 ordinary Washington residents, the grand
jurors whose names have been kept secret as they have had a front
row seat for the biggest presidential scandal in a quarter of a
century, the most crucial decisions are still ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to more than 70 witnesses as independent counsel
Kenneth Starr built his case for Congress to impeach President
Clinton, the grand jury could soon begin handing up criminal
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly make sense for the grand jury to pursue
individuals who it believed were involved in efforts to obstruct
justice or suborn perjury,'' said George Washington University law
professor Jonathan Turley, who predicted Tuesday that indictments
would come within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Starr told Congress that ``all phases'' of his
probe were near completion. Among the most likely areas for
indictments are allegations of obstruction of justice and witness
tampering involving:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Attempts to discourage White House volunteer Kathleen Willey
from testifying that she had been sexually harassed during a visit
in the Oval Office study with the president.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Efforts to encourage Monica Lewinsky's to conceal her sexual
affair with Clinton when the former White House intern became a
witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, who secured a job in New York at
Revlon for Lewinsky just as the Jones case was heating up, is
mentioned frequently in the report to Congress. ``It ultimately
depends on whether the grand jury concludes that Mr. Jordan's
conduct was poorly timed, but innocent, as opposed to part of a
criminal pattern,'' said Turley.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors could take action against Clinton himself,
according to legal experts. They could indict him, although the
courts have yet to rule on the constitutionality of indicting a
sitting president, or they could indict his aides and list him as
an ``unindicted co-conspirator.''
</P>
<P>
   And they could also focus on Linda Tripp, a central witness in
the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Defense Department are under suspicion for
illegally releasing private personnel information about Tripp in an
apparent effort to damage her credibility. Tripp taped hours of
conversations in which her former Pentagon coworker and friend
Lewinsky described her sexual liaison with Clinton. Starr has used
a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., near the Pentagon, to investigate
that aspect of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp herself is apparently a target, as revealed in the Starr
report. It raises questions about the reliability of her testimony
that the 27 audio tapes that she handed over to the FBI were
originals. Some were found to be duplications, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr could also wrap up his investigation by asking the
Washington grand jury for indictments on earlier phases of his
probe: the Whitewater real estate development in Arkansas, firing
of the White House travel office and the improper storing of FBI
files on 900 people by the Clinton White House. However, actions
resulting from those cases are considered improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the issue of indictments, the grand jurors have
performed a crucial function for the investigation, said former
federal prosecutor Victoria Tonsing: ``They are also used a vehicle
for gathering evidence. In gathering evidence you need power. You
want to talk to me, I can tell you to 'kiss off.' But you get me
with a grand jury subpoena, and I've got to appear, or I'm subject
to arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most juries, grand jurors are permitted to question
witnesses. When the president testified from the White House Map
Room Aug. 17, for example, the jurors who sat in their windowless
federal courtroom and watched a closed circuit video were active
participants. One juror relayed a question to the prosecutors,
asking the president why he had suddenly withdrawn his assertion of
executive privilege to block White House aides from testifying just
as the case reached the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to advance an executive privilege claim
in this case beyond having it litigated,'' Clinton responded.
</P>
<P>
   Although grand jury testimony is considered secret at the time
it's given, it can be used in court once an indictment is returned,
Tonsing said. Or, in the case of Starrr's report, the grand jury
information became available for use after it was given to
Congress, as required by the independent counsel law. Starr took
the precaution of also securing a federal court order for release
of the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rationale for keeping it secret is so that people will not
hear nasty rumors, so reputations cannot be besmirched,'' said
Tonsing. ``But that falls to the wayside when there's sufficient
evidence for an indictment.''

 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are tennis fans who so love the U.S. Open that they devote
two full weeks each year to watching it. Not in the comfort of
their homes but in the stands in New York, day after day, broiling
like lamb chops in the pitiless sun. I don't envy them, but I don't
hate them for it. Nor do I harbor the slightest antipathy toward
bungee jumpers, crossword puzzle addicts or people who enjoy
Tex-Mex food. I don't care for any of those things, but I wish
those who do only the best.
</P>
<P>
   So the September issue of Wine Spectator magazine came as a
shock. In a column titled ``Hot Air and Chardonnay Don't Mix,''
James Laube, a senior editor, goes after ``wine snoots who gloat
that they're part of the `ABC' crowd _ the Anything but Cabernet
(or Chardonnay) roosters.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC faction is a recent development among wine drinkers,
prompted, I thought, by the proliferation of mediocre chardonnay.
Laube includes cabernet sauvignon. So far as I know, it's a
loose-knit group, probably fanatics dedicated to the cause of
sauvignon blanc. But Laube knows the ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief among these loathsome ABCers are wine writers, some of
whom write for major publications and otherwise prominent
metropolitan newspapers,'' he asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hurts. Of course, he may have been thinking of someone
at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or Corriere della Sera, but I
doubt it. Laube continues: ``I don't care if they'' _ meaning the
loathsome ABCers _ ``don't like cabernet or chardonnay; just don't
disparage those who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's disparaging? A plug for some nice little riesling isn't
meant to insult some hapless chardonnay lover, however misguided he
or she may be. There are probably 700 California chardonnays on the
market; only a few truly bad, but far too many dull and
forgettable. At the same time, chardonnay is an almost overwhelming
presence in the wine world _ the winemaker and wit Randall Grahm
once observed that we live in a chardocentric society.
</P>
<P>
   Is it so wrong, then, to let it be known that there is life
after chardonnay, that there are other roads to take? In a mildly
confessional mood, Laube recalls _ with a shudder _ slogging
through a tasting of some 200 merlots. ``Right now, the mere
mention of merlot makes me cringe,'' he writes. But, he adds, ``you
won't catch me at a restaurant, wine bar or party trashing merlot
drinkers.'' Perhaps not, but I certainly hope he trashes a few of
those boring merlots.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the ABC phenomenon is not that its adherents
disparage other wine drinkers; it is that, like most movements,
it's simplistic. There are excellent California chardonnays. As
recently as July, Wine Spectator, under Laube's direction, surveyed
some 420 California chardonnays from the 1995 and 1996 vintages and
rated about 120 of them ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent ABCer would have difficulty turning down a
glass of some of the top-rated wines from Beringer, Kistler, Villa
Mount Eden, Williams Selyem and Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are all those dull, overoaked, oversweet
chardonnays that deserve to be criticized. Some of these wines are
extremely popular. Newcomers to wine _ and more than a few old
hands _ love them because they are fizzy, colorful and sweet _ in
other words, very unwinelike.
</P>
<P>
   Should these wines be criticized when they are so popular? Yes.
The critic's job is to point to the best. A music critic bored by
an evening of Johann Strauss will offend people who like Strauss.
They may even feel that he is patronizing them. Is he? No, he's
just tired of Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Laube confines his polemic to California wines, but of course,
chardonnay is not confined to our shores. Most of the world's best
white table wines are made from chardonnay grapes, and more than a
few come from France, Italy and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The entire discussion of good and bad chardonnay illustrates a
serious flaw in our practice of identifying wines by the grape
they're made from. We ask for ``a glass of chardonnay,'' unaware
that the styles of chardonnay range from the soft, slightly sweet
stuff found in three- and five-liter bag-in-the-box containers to
Le Montrachet of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, which sells for
about $1,000 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap chardonnay from the Languedoc can't be compared to a
great chardonnay from Burgundy or the Napa Valley, and yet they are
compared or, more precisely, lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, American winemakers are retreating from their
once almost total use of varietal names. Now, the label from a top
California chardonnay will name the viticultural region from which
the grapes came (Sonoma Coast, for example), the specific vineyard
and sometimes the block of vines within that vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The French have altered their thinking to allow varietal names
on inexpensive wines, but thay retain geographical names for almost
everything else _ except in Alsace, where the varietal tradition is
an old one.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ABCers, like all dissidents they serve a purpose:
they stir up controversy. And with wine, as with so many other
things, there is nothing wrong with that.

   Pots, Pans and Food From Alain Ducasse
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An impulse purchase at Bergdorf Goodman? It can often
be slipped into a shopping bag. But last Wednesday, James V.
Ruocco, a writer who was browsing on the seventh floor of the
store, fell for something considerably more imposing _ a massive
12-quart copper saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   The saucepan was part of a new line of cookware, tableware and
food products bearing the imprimatur of Alain Ducasse, the
multistarred French chef. It has just been introduced into this
country and is available only at Bergdorf.
</P>
<P>
   At $275, the epic saucepan (fill it with stew, and you'd need a
forklift to take it off the stove) was reasonably priced, as were
the other magnificently heavy, beautifully finished copper pots and
pans; they start at $95 for a small saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake on the price,'' Ruocco said
of his purchase.
</P>
<P>
   He might have spent his $275 on just one pair of silver-plated
Alain Ducasse lobster shears or his copper and stainless-steel
Japanese grater. Had he really wanted to splurge, there is a set of
six lethal steak knives for $695, or a huge granite mortar, which
would do nicely as a birdbath, for $1,875. Then again, he could
also have decided to outfit his kitchen with a genuine Ducasse
stove for $28,000 _ perhaps too gorgeous to cook on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducasse food products include carnaroli rice for risotto
($15 for about a pound), and excellent minced dried tomatoes in
olive oil, and herbaceous pistou with a sharp, salty bite (each $12
for about 6 ounces). Ligurian extra virgin olive oil is $25 for
about 17 ounces. The tableware includes attractive glazed wicker
chargers for $35 each.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher Foie Gras From Israel
</P>
<P>
   It's not chopped liver. But the L'Oie Royale goose foie gras
from Israel could certainly get a Rosh ha-Shanah dinner off to a
sumptuous start. This is not a mousse or pate, but solid foie gras
that is also kosher. The best way to serve it is to chill it in its
glass jar and to then slice it with a sharp knife dipped in hot
water and serve it, not with brioche, but with the next best thing:
slices of toasted hallah. A six-ounce jar is $25.99 at Fairway,
2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street).
</P>
<P>
   Parisian Bread in New York
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Poilane has bided his time in bringing his famous
Parisian bread to New York. Nearly 20 years ago he explored the
possibility of opening a bakery here. Nothing came of it. Since
then, the quality of the bread available in the city and elsewhere,
from many new bakeries, has improved at least 1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But starting Thursday, his big, round, crusty four-pound
sourdough miches, his earthy currant loaves and his golden butter
cookies will be flown in once a week by Marc Strausman and sold at
his store, Campagna Home, 29 E. 21st St. The miche is $9.95 for a
quarter loaf, the currant bread is $12 a pound, and the cookies are
$21 a pound. They arrive on Thursdays and must be reserved in
advance: (212) 420-1600.
</P>
<P>
   A Balducci's on Long Island
</P>
<P>
   Balducci's has established a toehold on Long Island. A selection
of its products, including fresh pastas, sauces, cured meats,
olives, cheeses, olive oils and vinegars, are available in a new
Balducci's Boutique at Sutton Place Gourmet, Jericho Turnpike (near
Woodbury Road), Woodbury, N.Y. &QL;

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with a persistent plume of
tropical moisture emanating in the Gulf of Mexico will occur from
eastern Texas to the Delmarva Peninsula Wednesday. The showers will
be most widespread from the lower Ohio River Valley to northeastern
Texas where heavy rains associated with the remnants of Frances
instigated flooding. Wednesday's rains should not be widespread
enough to aggravate the flooding situation further. Thundershowers
will also douse sections of central and southern Florida as a
tropical disturbance combines with afternoon sea breezes to lift
the humid air over the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably sultry air will plague the interior Southeast again
as expansive high pressure at 18,000 feet suppresses cooling
showers. High temperatures will reach into the 90s from Alabama to
Virginia. A weak cold front moving southward into the Middle
Atlantic States will temper the summery warmth and humidity that
has been controlling the region as of late. Clouds will be slow to
break behind the front, leaving only northern New England with the
likelihood of abundant sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will grace the upper Middle West, northern Plains and
northern Rockies as high pressure remains in place. Only in the
southern Rockies are isolated afternoon thundershowers associated
with the monsoon possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the West Coast States will be mainly sunny and
seasonably warm with the exception of low clouds and fog along the
immediate coast. Temperatures will range from near 70 at the coast
to the lower 100s in the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: PARCHED EUGENE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   School had only been out for a short time when the last
raindrops fell on Eugene, Ore. Tuesday marked a record 80th
consecutive day without measurable rain, a feat that has not
occurred since weather reports were first kept in 1890. Farther
north, in Portland, 45 days have transpired since the last showers
dampened the city, but this dry spell is only in 10th place of long
dry periods for Oregon's largest city. A large high pressure system
will give way late this week as a push of cold, moist air from the
North Pacific is likely end both dry periods during this coming
weekend.

 &HT;    HOUSE TO VOTE ON MORE VISAS FOR HIGH-SKILLED IMMIGRANTS

   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House will try again
Thursday(cq) to win passage of a long-delayed increase in visas for
highly skilled foreign workers, House Majority Leader Dick Armey
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of House action has kept high-tech lobbyists busy
during the last week, and they fanned out across Capitol Hill on
Tuesday trying to refocus House members' attention on an issue that
matters deeply to the computer companies and software firms that
have been complaining for months about shortages of engineers and
other specialists.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are H-1B visas, which allow companies to hire specially
skilled foreign workers for up to six years. This year's supply of
65,000 visas was supposed to last until Sept. 30, but was used up
by early May. Since then, Congress' efforts to create more visas
have stumbled over the insistence of the Clinton administration and
conservative Republicans in the House that the employers of foreign
workers be required to make more efforts to hire U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans worked out their differences in early August, but
Democratic support evaporated after President Clinton's top
advisers recommended that he veto any bill that did not require
employers to certify that they made substantial efforts to hire
U.S. workers and that no U.S. workers were laid off from jobs
filled by foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that we would bring that (legislation) to the floor
before the August recess, then the White House signaled the
Democrat members to vote against it,'' Armey said Tuesday. ``Our
vote count dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and business groups, including the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, now think they have enough votes in line to
pass an increase, which would raise the annual allotment of H-1B
visas to 95,000 beginning Oct. 1 and eventually reach 115,000 visas
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all worked hard, we think we've got it back together
and, hopefully, we'll get it passed,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is a compromise version of Senate legislation,
which passed in June.

`PERMANENT MIDNIGHT': MEMOIRS OF A HOLLYWOOD DRUG ADDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
(Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Jerry Stahl recounts in his blistering 1995 memoir,
``Permanent Midnight,'' drug addiction turned him into a skittish,
distracted, hugely self-involved individual. And since he happened
to be working in Hollywood, no one really noticed.
</P>
<P>
   While an addict, Stahl managed to pass for a plausible husband
and employable television scriptwriter, even though drugs could
render him capable of citing ``Nosferatu'' and ``The Patty Duke
Show'' in the same sentence. What kept him afloat? ``I stood out,
in short, as that most beloved of 80s entertainment commodities,''
he writes. ``Safe edge, the `dark' guy who took a little explaining
but got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The film version of Stahl's story plunges fearlessly into the
self-inflicted humiliations that went with this territory. In a
fine, rivetingly caustic performance, Ben Stiller plays a man on a
fashionably decadent slide all the way to rock bottom. The film's
Jerry is just out of rehab when he recalls this story for Kitty
(Maria Bello), a stranger who joins him for the sexual and
confessional marathon that frames the film. The conversation counts
for more than the sex, at least initially. ``I've never done this
straight before,'' Jerry tells Kitty acerbically. ``Trust me, on
smack I was a real stud.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long flashbacks that form the bulk of the film, Jerry's
only real sign of dysfunction is his indifference to Elizabeth
Hurley's character, an ambitious Englishwoman named Sandra who has
her own high-powered television career. However implausibly (though
some version of this happened to Stahl), Jerry is asked to do this
clever, poised, gorgeous creature a favor. They have barely been
introduced when he agrees to marry her so that she can become an
American citizen. ``I think she saw us as a professional Hollywood
power couple in the making, which is kind of like love,'' he
explains to Kitty.
</P>
<P>
   This haunting first feature by David Veloz, one of the
screenwriters credited with ``Natural Born Killers,'' sees all the
paradoxes in Jerry's situation, and all the rich potential for
destruction. The film watches aghast as Jerry gives vent to his
cruel streak and courts professional destruction, most notably
while writing for what he calls an ``alien puppet sitcom.'' (Stahl
actually wrote for ``ALF,'' as well as ``Thirtysomething'' and
other programs.)
</P>
<P>
   In an intensely physical performance, Stiller is seen trying to
pass for creative television talent while hunched in a shiny green
leisure suit, feet up, making sense only to himself. The real
Stahl, who has a small role as a stern doctor, supervised the
wardrobe verisimilitude and other small, scarily authentic details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight'' is as enveloping as it is darkly
cautionary, thanks to the effectively varied layers of Veloz's
direction and the bitter intensity Stiller brings to his central
role. Ms. Hurley, in a graceful performance, makes herself an
especially bright light in the film's unmistakably Californian
landscape. (``I was an L.A. junkie,'' Jerry says, explaining why he
runs five miles. ``I had to stay fit.'') And Stahl's story is
crowded with memorable minor figures, from the television star
(played by Cheryl Ladd) who recognizes Jerry's problem because she
has had it herself, to the eagerly inquisitive agent (played by
Janeane Garofalo) whom Jerry enjoys confounding.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Greene is scarily authentic as the worst guy Jerry could
possibly meet at a methadone clinic, a drug dealer who sends Jerry
into a spectacular debacle involving his and Sandra's baby. (It's a
tossup as to which of them shed more blood at the time of delivery,
where Stahl described himself as behaving like ``hell's own creepy
beast.'') This episode, hair-raisingly confessional and apparently
a watershed for Stahl, should settle any questions of whether
``Permanent Midnight'' makes drug use look like a good idea.
</P>

   THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ In his first meeting with reporters since
the Starr report was released, President Clinton will hold an
abbreviated news conference Wednesday with President Vaclav Havel
of the Czech Republic. As he prepared for that session, Clinton on
Tuesday vowed to help economically stricken farmers and to ensure
that U.S. military readiness remains high. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   Editors: In a story distributed last week, Cox News Service
erroneously identified the author of the book, ``The Clinton
Syndrome,'' as Stanley Renshon. Renshon is not the author of the
book, and the views expressed in the story were incorrectly
ascribed to him. The views were expressed in an interview by Jerome
D. Levin, who is the author of the book. A corrected version of the
story follows.
</P>
<P>
   SEXADDICT-CORRECT _ WASHINGTON _ Even before details of
President Clinton's extramarital sexual activity were made public,
some mental health professionals have concluded that the cravings
that supposedly steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex
addict.'' (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1000).

   CLINTON-DEFENSE _ WASHINGTON _ With even Democratic leaders
warning that a legalistic, linguistic defense won't work on Capitol
Hill, President Clinton named a trusted team of attorneys and
lobbyists Tuesday with congressional ties to deal with the threat
of impeachment. To ``quarterback'' the response to Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's referral on the Monica Lewinsky affair,
Clinton picked Gregory B. Craig, who attended Yale Law School with
the president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.(Dart, Cox News

   CLINTON-JURY _ WASHINGTON _ They are major players in the
biggest presidential investigation in a quarter-century, and yet
the role of the 23 grand jurors is barely visible in the report
released last week by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. For this
panel of ordinary Washington residents, whose names are kept
secret, the most crucial decisions are still ahead. After listening
to more than 70 witnesses, including the president of the United
States, as Starr built his case for his report to Congress on
possible impeachment of President Clinton, the grand jury could
soon begin handing down criminal indictments. (Malone, Cox News
Service).

   CLINTON-JUDICIARY _ WASHINGTON _ The Judiciary Committee that

   TELCOM-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Congress may have to move soon to
foster competition in the nation's telephone markets, two key
senators said on Tuesday. After chairing a hearing on a spate of
new mega-sized telecommunications deals, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,
said he would urge federal regulators to put the brakes on any
further consolidation in the phone business unless the government
can first ``guarantee that any mergers that are allowed will have
some clear pro-competitive benefits to consumers.'' (Glass, Cox

What is clear at UT is that a higher percentage of black and

TBS BANKS ON `SEINFELD' RERUNS  
 EMMYS GET UNIMPRESSIVE RATINGS  
 LONGEST-RUNNING TV SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Might ``Seinfeld'' be the last great hit television show
produced by the broadcast networks?
</P>
<P>
   That possibility is one reason that Turner Broadcasting paid
more than $1 million per episode for the cable rerun rights to
``Seinfeld,'' even though TBS will not be able to carry the show
until four years from now _ and even though it will still be in
reruns on broadcast stations then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to realize the scope of the hit that this show
is and the broadcast networks' inability to continue to generate
big, megahit shows like that,'' said TBS Superstation president
Bill Burke on Tuesday. ``This may be the last big hit sitcom to
come off the networks ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke based his comment partly on the erosion of broadcast
networks' prime-time audiences, which grow smaller as viewers
increasingly tune to cable networks as readily as to the
established broadcast networks, and partly on the broadcasters'
recent track record of not developing standout hit shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two other reasons for paying so handsomely for ``Seinfeld,''
Burke said, were the solid Nielsen ratings it has earned in
off-network syndication already, proving its continuing value, and
the fact that the show's humor isn't particularly topical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a lot of references to the present day,'' he
said. ``The only one I can think of is to George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that ``Seinfeld'' left NBC as the No. 1 show
on television and was only the third show in history to do that,
joining ``I Love Lucy'' and ``The Andy Griffith Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the deal stunned some television executives. The
show's syndicator, Columbia Tri-Star Television Distribution,
received not only $1 million per episode in licensing fee but also
two 30-second commercial spots in each episode to be shown by TBS,
spots that would be valued now in the vicinity of $300,000 a piece.
With 180 episodes, that could be worth at least $100 million more
to Columbia Tri-Star.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Seinfeld'' episodes will still be running in syndication
on broadcast stations when TBS's rights to run them start. (In New
York, Channel 11 has them until 2001, then Channel 5 has them for
five more years.) Many broadcast stations have ``Seinfeld'' rerun
rights until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Still, TBS executives weren't the only ones who thought it was
worth it banking on ``Seinfeld'' to remain a valuable commodity
well into the next century; at least three other cable networks
also bid for the show.
</P>
<P>
   TBS also has rights to reruns of ``Home Improvement,''
``Friends,'' ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Roseanne,'' among
others. Burke said that adding ``Seinfeld'' to that lineup was part
of the cable network's ``ongoing pursuit of parity with the
broadcast networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics think it sounds more like parity with TVLand, the cable
network devoted to golden oldies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be if those shows were all 30 years old,'' Burke
said. ``But even in the year 2002, we fully expect `Friends' and
`Drew Carey' to still be on the networks. And `Seinfeld' would be
too if Jerry and the cast hadn't decided to move on and do
different things.''

   Blame It on Wise Guys
</P>
<P>
   Americans watch television in far bigger numbers and a lot more
often than they go to the movies or listen to record albums; but
that apparently does not translate into interest in seeing
television stars pick up awards.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it would seem from the less-than-stellar ratings for the
television industry's biggest award, the Emmy, which celebrated its
50th anniversary Sunday night with a party that, if not quite a
flop, was certainly far from the social event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for the telecast, which NBC went to great pains to
turn into a special event this year, barely eclipsed the number
from last year's show, with a 13.6 rating this year compared with a
13.5 last year, when the show was broadcast by CBS. (This year a
rating point is worth a bit more, however, 994,000 homes, up from
980,000 homes last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Far more telling is this comparison: the last Oscar telecast, on
ABC, got a gigantic 34.9 rating. The Grammy Awards in February on
CBS scored a 17 rating. Even the once denigrated Golden Globe
Awards, which NBC has skillfully turned into a far more glittering
event, put the Emmy show to shame, with a 15.9 rating in January.
</P>
<P>
   Why is television's biggest award night so much less an event?
One reason may be sheer familiarity, on two levels. First, the
stars on the Emmy show are pretty much the same ones people see in
their living rooms every week. Second, the winners (and most of the
nominees) tend to be the exact same people every year.
</P>
<P>
   If this were ``Jeopardy,'' Kelsey Grammer would be a retired
champion by now. How many times do people really want to see Paul
Reiser have to stand up and kiss his co-star, Helen Hunt, winning
an award?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an upset and surprise here and there (Andre Braugher
finally getting his due for ``Homicide,'' Garry Shandling winning
some long overdue recognition for writing ``Larry Sanders,'' David
Letterman re-emerging as a winner in the variety category), the
show is full of predictable moments and speeches from people who
gave pretty much the same speech several times before.
</P>
<P>
   With the other awards shows, the competition more or less leaves
the field rather than face the slaughter. With the Emmy Awards, the
networks not broadcasting the show that year (it rotates among the
four big networks) are expected not to drag out any heavy guns that
might embarrass the industry on its big award night. For the most
part, the other networks offer repeats as competition.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, even under these restrictions, an
effective counterprogramming strategy has taken shape. Last year
Fox used a repeat of the action film ``True Lies'' and did some
serious damage to the Emmy show.
</P>
<P>
   Later a Fox executive called CBS to apologize for inadvertently
denting the award ratings, saying the intention was only to pick up
some of the male viewers known to be drifting to cable out of
disinterest in the Emmy show.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS apparently noticed how well the strategy worked and this
year scheduled a male-oriented film of its own, Martin Scorsese's
``Goodfellas,'' which also drew some male viewers away from the
Emmy show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course so did an NFL football game on ESPN. But one reason
the Emmy show also may have fared less well than NBC hoped was the
additional hour NBC added to try to underscore that this year's
show was an even bigger event than usual. The show ran from 7 to 11
p.m. instead of from 8 to 11. Some viewers apparently didn't get
the message. The show's lowest rating came in its first hour. But
the final hour, the Emmy show was even getting close to Golden
Globe territory.
</P>
<P>
   _ By BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   Si, No Repeats
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the
longest-running television series in history without a single
repeat episode is ``Sabado Gigante,'' the three-hour weekly variety
show, which has been a fixture on Univision, the Spanish-language
network, in the United States since the mid-1980s and in South
America since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was not represented in the Museum of Television and
Radio, the nation's major television ``library,'' with branches in
New York and Los Angeles. This year, in honor of the 30th
anniversary of Channel 41, the Univision station in New York,
executives there decided to donate a wide array of Spanish-language
programming to the museum, including classic episodes of ``Sabado
Gigante.''
</P>
<P>
   The Univision network began in 1961, with San Antonio's KWEX
(also Channel 41, by coincidence) the first United States
affiliate. New York's Channel 41 joined in 1968.

SLUGGISH AUGUST RETAIL SALES RAISE WARNING FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sales at retail stores rose only mildly in August,
the government said Tuesday in a report that gave modest but not
compelling evidence that a slowdown in consumer spending is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are watching Americans' shopping habits closely these
days for signs that their free-spending ways are over. Many believe
that the volatile stock market and the global financial turmoil
will make people more wary of spending money, which would cause US
economic growth to slow. Consumer spending is responsible for about
two-thirds of US economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 0.2
percent in August from the prior month, after falling a revised 0.6
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   The August increase was less than many analysts expected.
However, some analysts said the numbers do not necessarily indicate
that a general slowdown in spending, or a poor Christmas sales
season, is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish auto sales, possibly dampened by low inventory at
strike-addled General Motors, brought down the overall retail sales
figures. When autos are excluded, retail sales grew 0.3 percent in
August after rising 0.6 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation and cheap imports have made it hard for many
retailers to raise prices, which also dampen the increase in
overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a late Labor Day this year meant that many
back-to-school shoppers who usually visit the stores in August
waited instead until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, however, the general lackluster quality of August
is just a little more intense than we had anticipated,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a New Jersey
forecasting firm. ``We are essentially seeing a deceleration in
consumer spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, anecdotal evidence suggests that stores are
doing ``very well'' during this year's back-to-school season, said
Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.
``Is it way ahead of last year? I don't think so, but you have to
keep in mind that last year was a banner year from start to
finish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With inflation being so low, just meeting last year and
hopefully beating it is probably a good thing,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest surveys show a slip in consumer confidence _ but from
record-high levels. The Conference Board, which tracks consumer
confidence nationally, recently said its index slipped in August to
133.1, down from 137.2 in July. The index had hit a 29-year peak of
138.2 in June.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, consumer confidence has also slipped slightly,
according to the Mass Insight-New England Economic Project
quarterly survey. The survey's index dropped to 122 in July from
129 in April, the second straight quarterly drop.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that consumers delayed their car purchases in
August because of a shaky stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in stock prices ``was probably enough to explain the
drop in auto sales,'' William Wilson, an economist at Comerica
Inc., told Reuters. ``Autos are unlike most other consumer goods in
that their purchases can be deferred, and that's what probably
happened when we had the correction in equity prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnard said that the up-and-down stock market and the Asian
financial crisis was not the major culprit in the spending
slowdown, though they might prompt wealthy shoppers to delay luxury
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barnard blamed high consumer debt for the reported
shopping slowdown. People are spending nearly everything they earn
and more, he said, bringing total credit card debt to about $539
billion, up from $438 billion a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in the process of coming to our senses ...
and because of that people are beginning to curb their spending a
little bit,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Several retail chains have reported lackluster sales gains or
declines in recent months. At Framingham-based TJX Cos., including
Marshalls, August sales rose 1 percent compared to the same month
last year at US stores open at least one year. Sales were up 7.1
percent at Saks, down 3.7 percent at Talbots, and down 0.7 percent
at the May department store chain.

CLINTON SCANDAL'S IMPACT ON MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT WEIGHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Just when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
needs a firm US diplomatic hand, specialists said the Clinton
administration is too distracted by the threat of impeachment to
provide the strength to break an 18-month deadlock in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   US Mideast envoy Dennis Ross has been shuttling between both
sides over the last week to bring Palestinian and Israeli leaders
together on the next phase of Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank. But both sides predicted Tuesday that Ross's trip would
end in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a failure, there hasn't been progress,'' said a
senior Israeli official. Added Palestinian Authority spokesman
Nabil Abu Rodayna, ``The effort has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kimche, head of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations
and former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, said,
``The peace camps on both sides had been hoping that the Americans
would be a bit more insistent on seeing movement. But because of
what has happened in the White House, and the distractions in
dealing with it, there is the feeling on both sides that there will
be no such determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Khatib, director of Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center and a former member of the Palestinian delegation that
produced the peace agreement, agreed that the Lewinsky scandal has
undercut hope for movement forward on the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It weakens the president and weakens his ability to apply the
pressure that is needed to push the process forward. So the
situation is worse than it has ever been,'' Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu is making perfect use of this,'' he added. ``He
understands American politics very well. He senses that Clinton
cannot exert pressure on him, so I anticipate he will harden his
position further.''
</P>
<P>
   But some officials close to the talks, speaking on background,
maintained that the possibility of a breakthrough was still
possible. They suggested that the scandal could provide an added
incentive for the White House envoy to bring home a deal that could
trumpet Clinton's foreign policy and draw attention from the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts of the peace process considered such comments
wishful thinking and remained largely pessimistic about the
possibility of any movement on the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the peace accord was signed in Oslo, the
process is mired in mistrust by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed a further withdrawal of Israeli
troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who had anticipated a 30 percent withdrawal in
this phase of the peace process, agreed to the US proposal for 13
percent providing there was to be an additional phase of withdrawal
in the future. The Netanyahu government has refused to accept the
US plan, arguing that it did not provide adequate security
guarantees. The Israelis have also stated that this withdrawal
would be the final one before the so-called ``final status'' talks.
</P>
<P>
   Kimche said the continuing stalemate in the peace process poses
a threat to the region. If the deadlock continues, Palestinian
president Yasser Arafat has vowed to declare unilaterally a
Palestinian state by May of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said such a declaration would be a breach of the
peace accord and would prompt them to respond militarily if
necessary. Analysts have predicted that the looming crisis could
result in open, armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clock ticking toward May 1999, and Netanyahu knows
if there is not an agreement the scenarios that could unfold are
ominous. It is a time when all sides need movement forward,''
Kimche added.

 &HT;    CLINTON ASSEMBLES DEFENSE TEAM FOR CONGRESS
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With even Democratic leaders warning that a
legalistic defense won't work on Capitol Hill, President Clinton
named a trusted team of attorneys and lobbyists with congressional
ties Tuesday to deal with the threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To ``quarterback'' the effort, Clinton picked Gregory B. Craig,
who attended Yale Law School with the president and First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will report directly to Clinton and hold the title of
assistant to the president and special counsel. He is a former law
partner of David Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney, and worked
on Clinton's Whitewater defense team before going to the State
Department last year as Director of Policy and Planning last year.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran Washington attorney, Craig defended John Hinckley in
the 1983 attempted assassination of President Reagan. Hinckley was
found not guilty for reasons of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining the damage-control team is Steve Ricchetti and
Susan Brophy, two of Clinton's former lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Craig would coordinate the response to
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's referral on the Monica Lewinsky
affair. But the deep congressional experience of the new team
members suggested that their immediate goal would be to stop an
erosion of support among Democrats on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of staff Erskine Bowles led presidential aides and lawyers
to the Capitol to join the weekly closed-door Democratic Senate
caucus. Afterward, Bowles gave an emphatic ``no'' when asked
whether any senator had called for Clinton to leave office, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Normally talkative senators declined comment on the substance of
the meeting. ``We were just basically briefed,'' said Sen. Max
Cleland, D-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   However, another longtime Clinton backer joined a Democratic
chorus calling for the president to stop the semantic defense by
his lawyers, David Kendall and Charles Ruff. The lawyers insist
that while Clinton may have made misstatements to Starr's grand
jury, he technically did not commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for the president to come clean and allow this
matter to be resolved,'' said Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., issued statements
criticized Clinton for relying on legal hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   But White House press secretary Mike McCurry said no shift in
strategy was planned.
</P>
<P>
   The president is ``not going to use any legalisms, and he said
that on Friday,'' said McCurry. ``His lawyers are going to defend
him against the narrow legal charge of perjury, if they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ruff represents the institution of the presidency as White
House legal counsel, and Mr. Kendall will continue to be the
president's primary attorney, representing him on the personal
matters that arise,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The new members of the president's defense team have long ties
both to Clinton and to Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 53, graduated from Harvard University in 1967 and studied
at Cambridge University in England before going to Yale and
studying law with the Clintons, as well as with Kendall, his former
partner at the law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   He is a friend of John Podesta, the presidential aide expected
to become White House chief of staff when Bowles steps down at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Craig is also close to the Kennedy political dynasty. He served
as a foreign policy adviser on the staff of Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., from 1984 to 1988. After returning to Williams &AMP; Connolly,
he represented Kennedy in connection with the Palm Beach, Fla.,
rape trial of the senator's nephew, William Kennedy Smith. Two
year's after Smith's acquittal in 1992, Craig defended him in the
in aftermath of fight Smith had with bouncer in a Georgetown bar.
Smith pleaded no contest to assault charges and performed 100 hours
of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Craig left his law practice after being recruited by
Madeleine Albright and Strobe Talbott to head the State Department
agency charged with taking a long-term, strategic view of foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of expertise and a lot of wisdom,'' said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   The other members are also familiar faces in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Ricchetti was Clinton's deputy assistant for legislative
affairs before leaving the White House last year to become a
lobbyist in private practice. During the 1996 presidential
campaign, he was one of those who portrayed Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole in mock debates with Clinton in the 1996
campaign. Earlier, Ricchetti was executive director of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan Brophy was also a Clinton lobbyist on Capitol Hill until
this year, when she moved overseas with her husband, Gerald
McGowan, the U.S. ambassador to Portugal and Clinton's former
roommate at Georgetown University. Clinton introduced Brophy to
McGowan, a widower with five children, on a presidential trip to
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Brophy's career in Democratic politics stretches over 20 years
and includes work for former Lt. Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill III of
Massachusetts and in Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign.
Brophy was the White House point person in the unsuccessful
confirmation fight over Clinton's appointment of former Gov.
William Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, to be ambassador to
Mexico.

OFFERING BALANCE AS A BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Leasa E. Huffman needed to take her son to the doctor
because of an ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   It took Huffman, assistant vice president of the sales and
marketing support department at Security Benefit, about 10 minutes
to pick him up from the company child-care center and take him to
the on-site doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Hallmark Cards Inc. employee Andrea Zeorlin
needed child care, she saved hours by calling Family Care Choices,
a child- and elder-care resource and referral agency.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as these earned Hallmark Cards, Security Benefit
and St. Luke's Hospital a spot on /{Working Mother/} magazine's
best 100 companies for working moms.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, family friendly policies are the right thing to do,
but what these three have proved is that it's the only thing to do
if you want to attract and retain the best employees in a tight
labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Howard R. Fricke, chairman and chief executive officer
of Security Benefit. Sure, his 3-year-old grandson attends the
company's day-care center, which has a sliding fee scale.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason the company has so many of these benefits is that
``it helps our bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may cost the company something in the short run,'' he said.
``But by providing fair and reasonable benefits, we're able to
attract better people.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company is able to train and keep people such as
Huffman, who started as a secretary and is completing her MBA with
company tuition reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   She has had calls from headhunters, but ``the family orientation
of the firm makes it the best place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Zeorlin's flexible schedule and the programs she has
used, including sick-child care, have kept her at Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like if I hadn't had the opportunity to work a
part-time schedule, I wouldn't be in the work force today,'' said
Zeorlin, work//family specialist at Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Luke's, family friendly policies that include a
child-care center, flexible scheduling and part-time benefits have
enabled the hospital to attract and retain employees, something
especially difficult in many medical fields. Turnover of its
nursing staff is less than 7 percent, compared with a general
turnover rate of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're able to recruit and retain high-quality staff,
you're able to provide high-quality care,'' said Patricia A. Soper,
senior operating officer for St. Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's, Hallmark and Security Benefit have proved that
people are more productive and more loyal if they work in places
that enable them to balance their work and family lives.

SEWARD'S FOLLY TURNED OUT TO BE A BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEWARD, Alaska _ When the Dutch slickered the Indians out of the
island of Manhattan in 1626, they paid for it with pots and pans,
axes and bolts of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1867, when Secretary of State William H. Seward
negotiated the purchase of Alaska from the Russians, sweetheart
deals like that weren't available anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had all the pots they needed, so he had to show
them the cash _ $7.2 million, which back then must have been
serious money. Critics and nitpickers called it Seward's folly.
</P>
<P>
   With a total area of 591,004 square miles, Alaska is larger than
all but 37 of the present 190 nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Seward had added to the holdings of the United States a
territory not only rich in valuable furbearers, fish and other
wildlife, but also underlain by vast mineral treasure _ gold,
copper, oil.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even to mention the breathtaking beauty of what
would become, in 1959, our 49th state. In other words, at a price
of just under two pennies an acre, it was a folly too good to pass
up.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the man that struck the bargain, this town on the east
side of the Kenai Peninsula is a stopping-off place for cruise
ships. In fact, one was in the harbor when we drove down from
Anchorage yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The immense vessel, larger by a good deal than any structure in
the town itself, seemed an odd sort of behemoth, preposterously
beached.
</P>
<P>
   Seward is young _ as all of Alaska is, in a sense, a youngish
place. Established in the early years of this century, it has the
look and feel of a community still inventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its population, about 1,800 in the 1980 census, has nearly
doubled to 3,500 today, mirroring the increase across the state.
During the decade of the '80s, the number of Alaskans grew by 37
percent, to 607,000.
</P>
<P>
   That computes to slightly more than one person per square mile,
although, since well over half of them are concentrated in the
three largest communities of Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, many
of those square miles are empty indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Seward is the departure point for excursions by boat into Kenai
Fjords National Park, a magnificent area of brilliant waters,
looming cliffs and glacier-carved canyons. We went on that outing
today, and after a spell of foul weather the morning cleared and
warmed.
</P>
<P>
   There was, we were told, a fair chance of seeing whales. And,
indeed, whales did present themselves _ a small pod of orcas, or
killer whales, and one solitary humpback.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't breaching or sporting or crooning as whales are
sometimes said to do. These were just cruising sedately,
occasionally blowing. But a whale's a whale, and we were mighty
glad to see them just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Also there were otters, sea lions, seals, cormorants, eagles
wheeling overhead, and on the high cliffsides white specks that
were alleged to be sheep or goats.
</P>
<P>
   A splendid shore lunch of grilled salmon broke the journey. And
after a visit to Holgate glacier and a bit more exploring among the
austere rock formations beyond the mouth of the bay, we turned
north again, back toward Seward, encountering the cruising orcas
once more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   We rode outside on the boat's upper deck, and the day was
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   /{``Otter!''/} someone would cry out then.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would rush together to the rail on that side, and there
would come to mind those tragedies you read about of capsizing
Asian ferries. But our boat was a sturdy one and hardly listed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Puffins especially interested us. We'd seen them the evening
before in their enormous glass-walled tank at the Alaska SeaLife
Center, a wonderful research and educational facility that, alone,
would make the trip to Seward worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The puffin is a comical-looking bird, black with a white head
and a ludicrously oversized orange beak. Those at the SeaLife
Center share the tank with their plainer relatives, the murres.
</P>
<P>
   Both are gifted divers, able to reach considerable depth in
their search for food. But they do not swim underwater in any
ordinary sense. They actually /{fly/} below the surface _ graceful
wingbeats propelling them through the watery medium exactly as if
it were air.
</P>
<P>
   We'd stood in front of that glass wall for most of a half-hour,
marveling at Nature's virtuosity: to have created birds as agile,
as at home, under the sea as above it. So it was interesting to see
puffins in their true environment, riding the light chop of open
water, then plunging below to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   It's evening, now, though not yet dark. And after a good dinner
at a restaurant on a woodland road beyond the edge of town, we've
walked down from our lodging to look a last time across the water
at the mountains rearing on the bay's far side.
</P>
<P>
   The air is bluing, and the salmon fishermen out in small boats
are motoring back in toward shore.
</P>
<P>
   A rising breeze comes off the water, sea-scented and fresh. It
reminds us that we have been three whole days away from the
salacious news _ three days without hearing the names Monica and
Linda and Ken even once spoken.
</P>
<P>
   I can forgive Bill Clinton much. But it's hard to excuse him for
letting those three unsavory characters become fixtures in our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   People here are concerned with real things, though. They have
fish to catch, and winter wood to get in. So the scandal seems not
to be of overpowering interest.
</P>
<P>
   We have another two weeks of this blessed relief. There's no
knowing, at the end of it, how refreshed and cleansed we'll be.

LEADING DEMOCRATS URGE FORGIVENESS BUT HARBOR ANGER AGAINST
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While leading Democrats are urging forgiveness and
understanding for President Clinton's behavior in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, they also harbor a growing sense of anger over
the likely damage he has done to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brought shame on the office,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, one of several congressional Democrats to make the rounds
of the television talk shows Sunday. ``He's let his friends down.
He's let the nation down.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking Democrat
in the House: ``Members of our own party are very angry at the
president, and the American people are very angry at the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as these lawmakers scorched him, an effort to push
censure as an alternative to impeachment appeared under way. A
``public rebuke,'' Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in Democratic circles seemed to be that independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report did not deliver the ``fatal blow''
for impeachment. Several Democrats said that, while laden with
lurid sexual detail, it did not offer anything substantially new
about the president's involvement with his much younger White House
subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, regardless of Clinton's fate, many Democrats are
resigning themselves for the worst, come November. If the
president's televised admission last month of his extramarital
affair didn't put a chill in their hopes to avoid a possible
electoral bloodbath, the Starr report was like an arctic blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that all this hard work is down the
drain,'' said an aide to a senior Democrat in Congress. ``Just a
couple of months ago, there was a good possibility that we could
pick up enough votes to recapture the House and there was
absolutely no expectation that we would lose many seats in the
Senate. And we had great issues in the patients' bill of rights and
the minimum wage and education programs. Now that's all but
conceded that it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But they plan to press ahead. Senate Democrats hope for a vote
this week on a minimum wage increase, and they plan events on
managed care. The president, accompanied by Vice President Al Gore
and leading congressional Democrats, also will hold unity rallies
this week in New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' said Joan Menard, chairwoman of the
Massachusetts Democratic Party and president of the Association of
State Democratic Chairs. ``But he is the president, and he has been
our leader. I think most of us are very loyal people and we will
stand by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A breach between Clinton and the members of his own party in
Congress is nothing new. Though known for his network of friends,
the president has never had smooth relations with the Democrats on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never developed strong personal friendships with
members of Congress,'' a White House aide familiar with Capitol
Hill politics said of the president. ``It's been based on
dealmaking, and I think it's a double-edged sword. Part of what has
made him effective is part of what could hurt him now as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Many blame him for a number of problems, including making House
Democrats cast costly votes to no avail _ such as the proposed
energy tax in 1993 that Clinton abandoned when the measure got to
the Senate. And many Democrats have never forgiven him for the
Democratic debacle in the 1994 when they lost control of both the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as the leader of the ``New Democrats,'' a group
of political activists and thinkers dissatisfied with traditional
Democratic politics who were looking for an alternative to
off-the-rack liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pushed the North American Free Trade Agreement _
anathema to labor and its Democratic allies in Congress. He signed
a welfare reform bill that many Democrats thought was too
stringent. And he introduced the word ``triangulation'' to the
political lexicon, that is staking out ground away from his own
party, as well as the GOP, to gain public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's pursuit of his legislative agenda in a
Republican Congress requires a level of conciliation with
Republicans, which makes it harder for Democrats to make issues as
sharp as they want them to be,'' said Howard Paster, a former
congressional lobbyist for the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton was more conservative than the House
Democratic leadership and more conservative than most of the
members of the Democratic caucus,'' said Jim Slattery, a former
Democratic congressman from Kansas. ``There was a begrudging
respect for Clinton's political skills, but there was a lot of
skepticism about his political philosophy from the liberal
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's skepticism about Clinton's legal strategy, which
still holds fast to the assertion that his testimony in the Paula
Jones case where he denied sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky
was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle on Monday urged Clinton
not to continue ``the legal jousting that serves no constructive
purpose.'' He said people ``have grown inpatient with hairsplitting
over legal technicalities.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri agreed,
saying, ``The considered judgment of the American people is not
going to rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument
but on straight talk and the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk within Clinton's own party this week shows the
White House can expect Democrats on the Hill to push only so hard
for the censure idea in the face of more political sacrifice for
their president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not rule out any action to meet public demand for a
prompt, appropriate conclusion (in) the public interest,'' Daschle
said, leaving open the possibility of an impeachment inquiry.

   CLINTON-POLL (Undated) _ The public's view of President
Clinton's moral character has sunk to the lowest level of his
presidency, but the Lewinsky scandal has not eclipsed the widely
held view among Americans that Clinton is a vigorous leader who
should not be impeached or forced to resign, the latest New York

   CLINTON-REPUBS (Washington) _ Do Republican operatives see any
electoral risk in trying to drive Clinton from office when the
public wants him to stay? By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS (Washington) _ For many liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans, getting a fixed reading on what the folks
back home think about President Clinton's behavior was not too
tough a task. But for the rest of Congress, those members in swing
districts or who hail from places where reactions tend to be more
muted and tempered, the messages from home about the independent
counsel's report have been decidedly more mixed and difficult to
sum-up in a simple sound bite, which makes their jobs considerably
more difficult. By Lizette Alvarez and Eric Schmitt.

<P>
   Moving by  &UR; 8 p.m. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-COUNSEL (Washington) _ The political taboo against any
sort of counseling except pastoral seems to keep Clinton from
considering marriage counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists or
some other help, except from ministers. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ Much of political Washington,
especially the elders who have lived through all this once before,
was searching Tuesday for a way out of the crisis into which
President Clinton has plunged the nation's political system. But
everywhere they looked they saw a roadblock. A news analysis by

   CLINTON-DAY (Washington) _ The House Judiciary Committee on

on Monica Lewinsky as the president moved to strengthen his defense
against impeachment by hiring three new advisers to lobby Congress.
By James Bennet.

   For many, Kansas has a conservative reputation when it comes to
alcohol. Perhaps that's because Kansas was the first state to ban
alcohol, 40 years before the national Prohibition took effect.
Perhaps it's because in Kansas, unlike Missouri, people still can't
buy a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But 120 years ago, Kansas was one of the country's biggest wine
producers. And now, decades after the end of Prohibition,
winemakers finally are making a comeback in the Sunflower State.
</P>
<P>
   Seven wineries have sprung up in Kansas since the state
legalized commercial wineries in 1983. That's not many, compared
with Missouri, which has more than 30. But wine-backers in Kansas
think the fledgling industry has grown enough to warrant the
initiation of the first wine-judging contest at the state fair in
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at 6 p.m. Wednesday in the Pride of Kansas Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is just to let people know we are in Kansas and
that the wine industry is starting up in Kansas and to look us
up,'' said Greg Shipe of Eudora, who runs the Davenport Winery
north of Kansas 10 with his wife, Charlee Glinka.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, letting people know the wineries are around is what the
contest is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``So few people in the state even know you can grow grapes in
Kansas,'' said David Ross, a spokesman for the Kansas Grape Growers
&AMP; Winemakers Association, which is sponsoring the contest. ``People
just don't realize it's even possible here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1880, Kansas was one of the nation's top 10
wine-producing states, said John Brewer, the owner of Wildwood
Cellars in Mulvane, and the president of the state's winemakers
association. Kansas had more than 7,000 acres of grapes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That year, however, Kansas became the first state to ban
alcohol. Its vineyards were neglected or torn down. The national
Prohibition was lifted in 1933, but Kansas did not legalize alcohol
until 1949. It was one of the last states to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taken us a long time to understand that wine is not
a sinful thing,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas lawmakers didn't legalize commercial wineries until 1983,
some 20 years after wineries were legalized in Missouri. That's why
Missouri is further along in its wine-producing efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also had a prosperous wine industry before Prohibition.
Its comeback began in 1965 when Jim and Betty Held began making
wine again at the Stone Hill Winery in Hermann. The winery, which
originally opened in 1837, was the second largest in the United
States before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the winery offers tours every 20 minutes and a restaurant
where visitors can order wine by the glass. Stone Hill produces
158,000 gallons of wine a year, more than any other winery in
Missouri, said Patty Held-Uthlaut, who helps runs the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Kansas' largest winery, Fields of Fair Winery,
produces 33,000 gallons a year, said Sue Harris, a winery
spokeswoman. Fields of Fair opened in Paxico in 1988 as the first
licensed winery in Kansas. It has a deli and a gift shop, and many
travelers on Interstate 70 west of Topeka stop in, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest is just not as attached to wine as other areas,''
Harris said, explaining why wineries are catching on slowly in
Kansas. ``(Midwesterners) maybe have a glass of wine occasionally,
as opposed to people who regularly have wine with dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The winery run by Glinka, 51, and Shipe, 46, is the state's
newest. They got into growing grapes by chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, while visiting Kansas State University officials to
talk about a blight on their pears, Glinka saw a bunch of grapes on
trellises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `...Aren't these pretty?' '' Glinka recalled. ``I
wanted to plant some.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipe was against the idea. He thought they had enough to do on
their 160-acre farm. They already were growing apples, pears,
peaches and soybeans, among other crops.
</P>
<P>
   So they started out small, with table grapes. Eventually, they
planted varieties. By 1993, they were producing so many grapes that
they tried making wine.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they were picking up ribbons in amateur contests in
Kansas. Last year, they won first place in an international amateur
contest in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our friends and relatives had been drinking this stuff
and saying, `Wow, this is really good. When can we buy some from
you?' '' Glinka said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in August, they obtained a commercial license. Sales
are good so far, they said. Their wines include Aurore, a dry
white, Norton, a dry red, and Steuben, a sweet red. Visitors can
taste before they buy. (Call the winery at 785-542-2278 for store
hours.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the two won first in a statewide commercial
contest for their Foch, a French hybrid that produces a dry red.
</P>
<P>
   The orchard has five acres of grapes and 13 varieties. It's
expected to produce 1,000 gallons of wine this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shipe and Glinka hope their winery will grow. They'd like to get
a financial return for all the hours they spend pruning and
picking.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he expected that the number of wineries in Kansas
would grow slowly, perhaps by one or so a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slower taking on than I think it did in Missouri,'' he
said. ``It's not the ground, really, it's more of a political
climate and a tradition.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine that you've just been put in charge of a
680-seat concert hall that in recent years has presented a season
balanced between new-music concerts and standard repertory recitals
and chamber music. When you finish sketching out your first season
of about 60 performances, you have a handful of concerts that cover
the 14th through 18th centuries, virtually every flavor of
20th-century music, from Serialism and Minimalism to art-rock and
1960s vintage soul _ but not a single work by Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt or Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Will you get away with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be true that in other places I wouldn't,'' said
George Steel, the 31-year-old executive director of the Miller
Theater at Columbia University, whose first season fits that
description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you can make the season work, you can do it this
way. It's really a question of where your own priorities are, and
my priorities lie in doing things that I'm passionate about, and
that just aren't the scope in this city otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel raised the curtain on his season last night with a fully
staged production of Viktor Ullmann's ``Kaiser von Atlantis,'' an
anti-Hitler satire composed in the Theresienstadt concentration
camp, and a centerpiece in the recent revival of works by composers
who were killed by the Nazis. In this opera, a mad king wages a war
so brutal and unrelenting that Death becomes disgusted and goes on
strike, refusing to allow the wounded to die until the king agrees
to die first. There are also performances tomorrow evening and on
Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the Miller prospectus include Shirish
Korde's ``Rasa,'' a monodrama for soprano, chamber orchestra and
electronic tape, about a woman who moves to the United States from
India and must negotiate the cultural differences, and
``Ravenshead,'' a rock-based work by Steven Mackey and Rinde Eckert
about the ill-fated 1968 attempt of the Englishman Donald Crowhurst
to sail around the world solo.
</P>
<P>
   There are celebrations of Ned Rorem's 75th and Elliott Carter's
90th birthdays, and a concert of music by Marc-Andre Dalbavie, a
young French composer whose works have made waves recently in
Europe. And a series called ``Opulent Music'' looks at what Steel
describes as ``an alternative history of 20th-century music.'' It
includes works by composers from Debussy and Poulenc to Messiaen
and Takemitsu, whose styles touch on Impressionism and various
forms of expanded tonality and musical exoticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to look at this theater and expect to see
the entire world encompassed in it,'' said Steel. ``We do a lot of
different things here, but I don't feel the need to do redundant
programming. In other words, this is not about museum style, it's
about trying to make new things. And it's a laboratory, a space
where we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel, whose oval wire-rimmed glasses give him an air of
seriousness that he likes to undercut with such informalities as
calling people of either sex, and of any age, ``babe,'' and
slipping freely into 20-something colloquialisms, came to Columbia
after working as a managing producer at the 92nd Street Y. There,
he collaborated on programming and scriptwriting with Michael
Barrett, prepared chamber orchestra arrangements of symphonic works
(most notably Leonard Bernstein's ``Songfest'') and conducted part
of a Penderecki concert with the composer in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Steel's work before Columbia has been singing.
As a child in Washington Grove, a suburb of Washington, he attended
the St. Alban's School, a choir school associated with the
Washington Cathedral, where he sang in five services a week _ first
as a treble, later as a countertenor _ in its men and boys choir.
He also studied the piano and started composing before he was 10;
some of his more recent works are in the Cathedral choir's
repertory, and he had a septet performed at the 92nd Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   After he left St. Alban's _ he said he was expelled for
neglecting his academic studies in favor of music _ he attended the
American Conservatory in Chicago. He taught for two and a half
years at the St. Augustine School of the Arts in the Bronx, then
returned to Washington and studied briefly at the University of
Maryland before transferring to Yale. After he graduated in 1994,
he moved to New York and became a freelance singer.
</P>
<P>
   He still sings: this summer he was the solo bass in performances
of Beethoven's Mass in C in Beirut, conducted by Peter Phillips of
the Tallis Scholars. He is also conducting, and possibly singing
in, one of his Columbia concerts, a program in May of choral works
by the 16th-century English composer Robert Parsons. That concert,
at St. Paul's Chapel on the Columbia campus, is one of several that
Steel has taken outside Miller Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the theater reopened after its renovation in
1988,'' Steel said, ``the idea was to put Miller on the map, and
there may have been a fear that if the Columbia connection was
emphasized, Miller would be buried. I believe that the more the
theater looks like a doorway through which people can come and
experience Columbia, the more successful it will be. And having
concerts in spaces with particular acoustical properties is a
marvelous way to get people in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel seems to have considered not only acoustics, but also
atmosphere in matching programs to spaces. Miller Theater, with its
sleek interior that makes it almost ideal for new-music programs,
would be a sterile place for early music. St. Paul's is better
suited to it, so besides the Parsons program, Steel is presenting
the Huelgas Ensemble's program of 14th- and 15th-century music at
the chapel in April. A concert in the chapel's own organ series,
Michael Bower's reading of Ned Rorem's ``Quaker Reader,'' in
October, will be linked to a celebration of Rorem's birthday by the
Lark Quartet, the pianist Michael Boriskin and the flutist Paul
Lustig Dunkel at Miller a few days later.

   Similarly, the palazzolike Casa Italiana, at 117th Street and
Amsterdam Avenue, is to be used for a performance by the Baroque
ensemble Louis Louis and a concert of piano works composed in Italy
during World War II. And for a performance by Pauline Oliveros and
her Deep Listening Band _ a group that mixes modern Western
instruments with such exotic horns as the Australian aboriginal
didjeridu _ Steel is using the rotunda of Low Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pauline Oliveros grooves in these larger spaces,'' Steel said.
``And St. Paul's Chapel is a venue that's on campus, and that we
should use. How many places have that kind of scenario?''
</P>
<P>
   Since he took the job last October, Steel has immersed himself
in the history of Columbia's concert life. If a visitor to the
theater happens to mention works like Virgil Thomson's ``Mother of
Us All,'' Benjamin Britten's ``Paul Bunyan'' or Charles Ives'
``Central Park in the Dark'' or ``The Unanswered Question,'' Steel
will stop them, point to the stage and say: ``Here! Had its
premiere right here!'' And sitting behind his cluttered desk, in an
office just outside the theater's balcony, he proffers a stack of
yellowing program booklets from the 1940s in which one finds early
performances of works by Copland, Barber, Bernstein, Otto Luening,
David Diamond and Jack Beeson, as well as Pete Seeger, who is
listed in a 1948 folk concert as a ``topical ballad singer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They set a pretty serious precedent,'' Steel said. ``It's
hard, when you push the new-music envelope all the time, to look
back and say OK, here are the pieces we've done. But there's an
amazing track record here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel's new-music plans include a series called New Music
October, which includes the Sonic Boom Festival that the hall has
presented in recent years. It begins with a New York New Music
Ensemble program split between Donald Martino and Matthew
Rosenbaum, and also includes a League of Composers/ISCM concert of
works by Ursula Mamlok and Roger Sessions, a program in which the
Ahn Trio will play world premieres by John Musto, Eric Ewazen,
Kenji Bunch and Michael Nyman, and a recital by Bruce Brubaker of
piano works by Philip Glass, John Cage and John Adams, with live
video by Ian Benton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rorem and Carter celebrations and concerts devoted fully to
George Crumb and Arvo Paert concerts are also part of the October
series, as is a Brecht tribute by Frigg, a German art-rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted our new-music concerts to focus on single composers
where possible,'' Steel said. ``If an audience hears a concert with
one work by composer X, who they've never heard of, and they don't
like it, then they think they don't like composer X. But if they
hear several works, they may like one and dislike another, but
they'll get a more complete picture of the composer.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of chamber opera, once plentiful at
Columbia but absent in recent decades. Steel is intent on restoring
it, this year in the form of the Ullmann, Korde and Mackey works.
Already on the books for next year is an Offenbach rarity, ``Le
Voyage Dans la Lune,'' which will be presented as a multimedia
paean to the space program. The score and parts _ most of them
handwritten, from the original 1875 production _ arrived from Paris
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every season is a test,'' Steel said, returning to the
question of whether a season devoted mostly to novelties will fly.
``You sit back, you watch the ticket sales, you feel the audience
reaction, you talk to the performers. If nobody shows up, will I do
things differently? Yeah. But I'll do things differently next year
anyway.''

   TOKYO _ As statistics and despair pile up in the countries of
Asia, it is becoming clear that the region's recession is
deepening, along with the economic and social devastation it
brings.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people out of work is rising, and economic output
is sinking at its fastest rate in years _ in leading countries like
South Korea and Japan, it has been decades since there has been a
decline so severe and so widespread. Banks in many nations are
shaky, and corporate failures are feeding a sense of gloom. Stock
markets in much of the region have fallen by more than half from
their peaks; Malaysia's is down 80 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has soared. Soup kitchens and rice lines are
appearing around the region, and parks and boulevards are filling
up with the new homeless.
</P>
<P>
   As governments across East Asia have released half-year report
cards in the last few weeks, hopes that there will be a recovery
anytime soon have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handful of countries are under depression,'' said Tim
Condon, regional economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong
Kong. ``People's expectations are adjusting downward. They're close
to the point of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon is one of a number of economists beginning to call the
predicament of some Asian countries a depression. He does not
compare it, yet, to the Great Depression of the 1930s, but says it
is much more severe than a mere recession, which has been the
common experience in the era since World War II and is usually
characterized by a relatively short and shallow fall in output that
leads to a moderate rise in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong and
Malaysia are undergoing severe contractions in their economies and
spikes in unemployment. Countries with stronger economies are being
affected as well. Governments are trimming their growth projections
to about 1 percent in the Philippines and Singapore, which do not
have the same structural problems as the countries now in
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has China emerged unscathed. Its pace of growth for the
first half of 1998 slowed to an official 7 percent, the lowest
since 1991. The Chinese government tried to maintain its 8 percent
growth target for this year _ in part with a plan to increase home
ownership across the country _ but had to scale back that ambition
because of the fallout from the surrounding region.
</P>
<P>
   Even Taiwan, which has become an important potential source of
capital throughout the region, now predicts its growth will reach
only 5.3 percent, compared with 6.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The agony of Indonesia is virtually in a class of its own.
Millions are slipping below the poverty line. In the first half of
this year, Indonesia's economy was officially estimated to have
shrunk, on an annual basis, by 12.2 percent. For the year, the
government says the fall in output is expected to be 13 percent,
but private economists say it could be as severe as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Falling currencies make the declines much more stark in dollar
terms. While all the statistics at this point are somewhat dubious,
the Indonesian government has said that in dollar terms, output per
person is expected to fall to $436 in 1998, from $1,055 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Europeans or Americans could really understand
how bad things are,'' said Simon Mahadevan Flint, a Singapore-based
economist who is head of research at IDEA, an independent economic
consulting group. The Indonesians, he said, ``are experiencing
massive contractions in the economy from an already low base, with
extensive discrepancies between rich and poor.'' People who had
moved out of mud huts and into wooden shacks as the economy surged
have now been thrown back into the fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's economic crisis has been compounded by political
turmoil, which in turn has brought about deeper economic troubles.
The banking system has essentially ground to a halt. Many
corporations simply cannot repay their loans, and those that can
are not doing so, partly because the banks to which they owe money
may not be around much longer. The result is that bad debts are
swelling to as much as one-fourth of all loans, according to
predictions by some economists.
</P>
<P>
   In such a chaotic environment, relying on traditional economic
measures is extremely difficult. Official figures for unemployment
in Indonesia have not been released recently, but economists
working from anecdotal evidence say it is skyrocketing and could
reach one-fourth or perhaps even 40 percent of the labor force in
urban areas next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of real economic growth, inflation and unemployment,
the worst is still very much in front of us, not behind,'' said
William Overholt, who assesses the regional economy as head of
research at BankBoston NA in Singapore. ``If Japan goes into a
tailspin, if the U.S. economy slows down, if there are devaluations
or the governments fail to save the banking systems, then all bets
are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other governments forecasting serious contractions and the
declines they expect for the year are Thailand, projecting a fall
in output of 7 percent; South Korea, 6 percent, and Hong Kong, 4
percent. The Malaysian government predicts a 2 percent decline. And
many private economists expect even worse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, recovery may be closer than conventional wisdom now
expects. Some economists say _ with caution _ that the first hint
of it could come sometime next year if Western economies remain
buoyant enough to continue absorbing Asian exports. And some
experts see a silver lining in the suddenness of the collapse,
pointing out that several Southeast Asian countries have swung
sharply from current account deficits to large surpluses in which
the countries are once again accumulating foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds, it is clear that the situation is
already far worse than was envisioned when the economic troubles
first emerged as a currency crisis in Thailand in July 1997 and
quickly spread to Southeast Asian countries and South Korea. One
reason was that Japan, the region's economic giant, was caught up
in its own economic troubles and could not provide a buffer to
cushion the shock. And many say a real restoration to economic
health will take a long time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, a turnaround may not come until 2001. ``Korea is
restructuring its old system,'' said Munkun Cheong, chief economist
at Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul. ``Old habits are
hard to break, so it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, the unemployment rate had tripled to about 8 percent
by July. In Thailand, official joblessness had nearly doubled from
the end of 1997 to May, reaching 5 percent. More recent figures,
which are undoubtedly worse, are not yet available. While those
levels appear low by comparison with those in Europe, the jump in
Asia is startling because it is occurring so rapidly after years of
phenomenal growth. And in Asia, the safety nets have big holes or
there are simply no nets at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that losing jobs is keeping people from dining
out. In South Korea, families are being evicted from homes for not
paying rent. In Thailand, workers are flocking back to the rural
areas to forage for food in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you leave Indonesia out, other economies are
bleeding,'' said Nilesh Jasani, regional strategist at
SocGen-Crosby Securities in Singapore. ``In absolute terms, they
are really really suffering very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest disappointments has been Japan, which has the
world's second-largest economy, more than twice the size of the
rest of Asia affected by the crisis. A year ago, Asian leaders
journeyed to Tokyo to try to persuade officials to revive the
Japanese economy so that it could become a locomotive for growth
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened. Japan is now in a recession, the worst
since the end of World War II, and economists project a decline of
more than 1 percent for this year, with little improvement in
sight. Last week, the government said growth declined by an annual
rate of 3.3 percent for the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy contracts, Japan's Parliament is squabbling over
how to save the banking system, and corporate earnings are taking
their deepest plunge in years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Japan's Economic Planning Agency released a report
characterizing the state of the Japanese economy as ``extremely
severe,'' a notch worse than its August assessment of ``very
severe.'' Taichi Sakaiya, head of the agency, added that the global
economy was ``at the threshold of an extremely difficult phase.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that both Japan and the rest of Asia are
suffering from spreading deflation, which is delivering a double
whammy. Prices are tumbling in the everyday world of bread and
butter as well as in the financial world of stocks and bonds. In
this deflationary environment _ one in which revenues, prices and
production are falling in response to a collapse in demand _
Japanese companies are trimming imports and investment. And as they
curb their investments, the effects are felt acutely throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   All this while Japanese banks, unable to clean up their bad
debts, are pulling back on all types of lending and cutting off
access to funds for many companies elsewhere in Asia. Despite the
ostensibly low interest rates in Japan, many companies have little
access to funds and are being forced to look abroad to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is no surprise that Orix Corp., Japan's largest
leasing and diversified financing company, is planning to list
American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange this
week. Orix will become the second Japanese financial corporation to
gain access to the New York market _ the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
is currently listed _ but it is too soon to tell whether this move
will help the company. The results will be closely watched by other
financial institutions that have long desired but never dared to
tap the stock market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of Orix, says the listing will
probably be useful because the Japanese economy has been so weak
for so much of the 1990s that it is hard to predict when it will
finally begin to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy is ``at the edge of a cliff, standing there
already for some years,'' Miyauchi said. ``We're lucky we haven't
fallen yet.''

   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   TV-SHOWS-ADS (Undated) _ Last week, Fox ran an on-air promotion
for a pair of sitcoms, ``Living in Captivity'' and ``Getting
Personal.'' To make the point that the shows were sassy and sexy
compared with tamer Friday night programming on other channels, the
commercial depicted a man being chased as a voice-over announced,
``We ran the censors off, and boy, does it show!'' It's easy to see
the appeal of such a sales pitch to the much-coveted youth
audience, which has long felt a healthy antipathy toward anyone
trying to tone down the latest records, music videos or sitcoms.
But for more mature viewers who've been battered in the last year
by Jerry Springer's catfights, Howard Stern's genitalia gags,
``South Park's'' scatological cartoon children and ``Dawson
Creek's'' libidinous teen-agers, the sight of one more television
guardian who has turned tail and run for cover may not be
particularly comforting. By Warren Berger.
</P>
<P>
   MONET-ART (Boston) _ The progress of Monet's reputation says
something, I suspect, not just about ``Monet in the 20th Century,''
which is the name of the show now at the Museum of Fine Arts, but
also about the public's relationship to 20th-century art generally.
Why is he so popular? Lots of great artists aren't. He didn't cut
off any ears or fail to sell his paintings before he died _ in fact
for much of his life he was immensely rich and successful _ so
there's no obvious biographical angle. Ultimately the answer must
be in the pictures, and I think it involves the essential soft core
of the art: the way works like the Water Lilies become passive
receptacles for nostalgia. Monet's popularity reveals our desire
for art as both refuge and spectacle. By Michael Kimmelman.

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA-FILMS (Tblisi, Georgia) _ This small nation nestled
under the towering Caucasus Mountains, which has a history
stretching back several millennia but which emerged from the debris
of the Soviet Union only seven years ago, has a rich creative
tradition based on the mixture of fantasy and reality. In the 20th
century that tradition has been expressed most vividly in film, and
today a hardy group of more than a dozen filmmakers is struggling
against severe economic constraints, trying to preserve, extend and
deepen it. By Stephen Kinzer. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   PECKER-FILM (Baltimore, Md.) _ ``Pecker,'' is filmed in John
Waters' hometown of Baltimore, where he has made all 13 of his
movies, most famously his 1972 cult classic, ``Pink Flamingos.''
``It's about a photographer called `Pecker,' '' the publicity agent
explained one day on the set in December. The movie which opens on
Friday is a comedy about a young fellow (Edward Furlong) who's a
short-order cook in a sub shop and takes pictures all the time, of
rats caught in flagrante delicto (Waters often employs rats for his
films), a woman shaving her thighs on a bus, his own sweetly
dysfunctional working-class family, that sort of thing. When he is
``discovered'' by a chic Manhattan art dealer (Lili Taylor) and
becomes the sensation of the New York art world, Pecker's everyday
Baltimore life, including the relationship with his girlfriend
(Christina Ricci) who runs _ well, rules _ the local laundromat, is
threatened. By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DYING-GAUL-THEATER (New York) _ The return of ``The Dying Gaul''
to the Vineyard Theater, where it closed in June, conjures up
titles befitting a parody of a bad movie sequel _ ``The Gaul That
Would Not Die,'' perhaps, or ``The Dying Gaul: Resurrection.'' And
on one level, that's fine with the author, Craig Lucas. `` `The
Dying Gaul' is a Hollywood satire,'' said Lucas, who knows that
world well as the adapter of several of his own plays to film _
``Prelude to a Kiss'' and ``Reckless'' _ and the author of the
screenplay for ``Longtime Companion.'' By Steven Drukman.
</P>
<P>
   INFERNO-THEATER (New York) _ The award-winning version of the
``Inferno,'' translated from the Italian by Robert Pinsky, the
United States Poet Laureate, has found its way to the footlights.
Directed by Robert Scanlan and produced by the Unterberg Poetry
Center of the 92d Street Y, the play, following a brief run in
Boston, begins performances in New York on Saturday at Playhouse 91
and runs through Oct. 4. By Celia Wren. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   KEERSMAEKER-DANCE (New York) _ The world of dance did not pause
in its erratic spin when a young Belgian dancer named Anne Teresa
De Keersmaeker presented what amounted to her first choreography in
1981 at a festival in Westchester County, near New York City. A
solo set to Steve Reich's ``Violin Phase,'' the dance was
uncompromisingly formal and repetitious. Though it was recognizably
influenced by the post-modernist dance minimalism of the time,
unexpected undercurrents of emotion set the solo apart. Ms. De
Keersmaeker, then a student at New York University, added a duet to
the solo and two more duets to the piece on her return to Belgium
the next year. The four-part dance, called ``Fase'' and set to four
pieces by Reich, established Ms. De Keersmaeker, who was to become
a major international dance talent over the next four years. She
will return to those roots on Tuesday at the Kitchen in five
performances of ``Fase,'' which will be accompanied by a symposium
and film screenings on Thursday and a video installation. By
Jennifer Dunning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   STAGE-FRIGHT-MUSIC (New York) _ In music, stage fright may take
the form of icy fingers, shaky limbs, a racing heart or a blank
mind, and musicians report all manner of strategies to cope with
it. Teachers and psychologists offer strategies, too. In recent
years, schools have started addressing anxiety in courses dealing
with performance techniques or career preparation. By Eleanor Blau.
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS-4-ALBUM (Undated) _ Anonymous 4 has just released its
eighth recording, and it will not be surprising if this CD, ``A
Lammas Ladymass,'' sails to the top of the classical charts as most
of the group's earlier efforts have. But this new album of chant
and polyphony for the Roman Catholic feast of the Assumption, which
celebrates the Virgin Mary's passage into heaven, is itself a rite
of passage. By Cori Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   LP-IMAGES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Going back to the neighborhood of
one's youth and finding familiar objects smaller than remembered is
an experience shared by most of us. I had the same feeling, not
long ago, picking up a CD of Ravel's piano music and finding on its
cover the shrunken image of an LP record I knew some 45 years ago.
Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series, of which this two-CD
release is a part, represents a foolproof sales strategy, at least
where the middle-aged market is concerned. For this is our past,
perfectly reconstructed _ nostalgia we can touch in miniature By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ANATHEMAS-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Profanity? Check. Blasphemy? Check.
Threats and imprecations? Check. Drug references? Check. Sex talk?
Check. Distorted guitars? Check. Shouts, moans, growls? Check. With
those essentials and a little hysterical publicity, an ambitious
rock band can be on its way to becoming the anointed anathema: the
band that teen-agers flaunt as a symbol of alienation while their
parents worry enough to believe the worst. Just in time for
back-to-school, two leading anathemas have released their latest
albums: Marilyn Manson's ``Mechanical Animals'' and Korn's ``Follow
the Leader.'' By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   MIDLER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bette Midler's up-and-down recording
career has always been about juggling personas to create a portrait
of an entertainer (and woman) of many (often contradictory) parts.
And ``Bathhouse Betty,'' her first album for Warner Brothers after
more than two decades on Atlantic, is arguably her most
multifaceted collection since her 1972 debut recording, ``The
Divine Miss M.'' By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-JOHNSON-MUSIC (Undated) _ Although the great blues singer
and guitarist Robert Johnson died 60 years ago, swallowed up at 27
by the rural Mississippi demiworld of juke joints and barrelhouses
that spawned him, he looms ever larger in Americas imagination.
Johnson had been dead for 23 years when an LP of his songs, ``King
of the Delta Blues Singers'' was released in 1961. It became a
sacred text to 60s folk and blues revivalists as well as to
rock-and-rollers curious about rock's origins. In 1990, after
protracted legal wrangling, came ``Robert Johnson: The Complete
Recordings'': two CDs, 29 songs and 12 outtakes. Improbably, it
became the record-business phenomenon of the winter of 1991,
briefly outselling Madonna, winning a Grammy and going on to sell
more than a million copies worldwide. Fifty-three years after his
death, Robert Johnson was a pop star. By Tony Scherman.

   ART

<P>
   MONUMENTS-VIDEO-ART (Chrlestown, Mass.) _ From Thursday through
Saturday, on three consecutive nights, the stories of bereaved
Charlestown mothers, whose sons were murdered, will be projected in
video onto the Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown's most conspicuous
and famous public structure. Through the wizardry of Krzysztof
Wodiczko, a Polish-born conceptual artist, the 221-foot-tall
Egyptian-style obelisk will be transformed into a nighttime granite
goddess, its massive form first made to seem weightless through
animation, and then weighty with the gravity of these mothers'
tales. By Ken Shulman. (Moved).

   CHINESE-FURNITURE-ANTIQUES (Minnepolis, Minn.) _ The Minneapolis

IRANIAN LEADER TELLS OFFICIALS TO PREPARE FOR ACTION ON
AFGHANISTAN

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's supreme leader told the country's military
and its top civilian officials Tuesday to be ready to carry out
``speedy, timely and forceful implementation'' of coming decisions
in a crisis over Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The directive, by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stopped short of a
full military alert, senior Iranian officials said. But it was
enough to prompt a furious response from the militant Taliban
movement that governs Afghanistan, which vowed to strike back if
Iran makes good on repeated threats to use military force.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed, told the Afghan Islamic Press,
a news agency: ``Iran must know that if the soil of Afghanistan is
attacked, we will target Iranian cities and the entire
responsibility will rest with Iranian authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still seething over the recently confirmed killings of
at least eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban
forces. Seven of the bodies were returned to Tehran early Tuesday
morning and were received in an emotional ceremony at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's call for heightened readiness was clearly intended to
increase the pressure on the Taliban. Iranian officials have also
said the Taliban _ who practice a purist form of Sunni Islam _ must
be held accountable for a campaign of atrocities against Shiite
Muslims, who make up about 15 percent of Afghanistan's population
but 95 percent of Iran's.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials have now validated at least some of
those accusations, initially made by international human rights
groups, and say that Afghan refugees reaching Pakistan have given
credible and chilling accounts of the deliberate killings of large
numbers of Shiite civilians in the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-i-Sharif in August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in
a telephone interview Tuesday that refugees who fled the town after
it was overrun by the Taliban on Aug. 8 have ``very consistently''
provided reports of house-to-house searches that targeted Shiites
for execution.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Rupert Colville, said the refugees have also
reported that bodies were left in the street for several days, and
that some Shiites died of heat or suffocation after being loaded
into containers that were hauled away by truck.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has condemned the killings as genocide and warned that more
killings may be under way in the central Afghan city of Bamiyan,
which the Taliban captured over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban spokesmen have repeatedly denied that their forces
committed ethnic reprisals, and in recent days the Taliban radio
has repeatedly broadcast instructions from commanders that
civilians in Bamiyan should not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has long been at odds with the Taliban, and it has been a
major supplier of logistical and military support to the opposition
forces who have been trying to prevent the Taliban from
consolidating their control.
</P>
<P>
   But with the capture in the last five weeks of Mazar-i-Sharif,
the opposition's northern headquarters, and Bamiyan, its last
remaining stronghold, the Taliban have now also taken control of
the airstrips and land routes that Iran has used to provide its
indirect support.
</P>
<P>
   It is the deaths of the diplomats, though, that has stirred
Iranian passions, creating what Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karabaschi described in an interview Tuesday as ``a very dangerous
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Iranian official, who would speak only on
condition of anonymity, said in a separate conversation, ``The
honor of Iran has been damaged, and the people expect revenge.''

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES DOWN IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sexually transmitted diseases have been declining
dramatically in Massachusetts, with gonorrhea in 1997 at its lowest
reported level since 1959 and syphilis and chlamydia dropping as
well, according to new data released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Department of Public Health reported only
somewhat encouraging news on cancer, showing that from 1990 to 1995
(the most recent year for which cancer data are available), the
incidence of several types of cancer rose _ partly from better,
earlier diagnoses _ and death rates remained stable or dropped
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Better screening, safer sex behavior and use of condoms
apparently have caused the drop in STDs. At the same time, improved
screening and detection are major reasons the apparent incidence of
cancer has risen compared to 1990, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among several findings in two reports presented to the public
health commission Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   _The 2,077 new cases of gonorrhea reported in 1997 represent the
smallest number since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   _Compared to 1990, syphilis has dropped 64 percent, to a rate of
1 case per 9,090 residents, and chlamydia _ which can, when
untreated, make women infertile or cause ectopic pregnancies _ has
fallen 45 percent, to 1 per 819 residents.
</P>
<P>
   _Health officials said they need to further improve education
efforts in minority communities, where gonorrhea and chlamydia are
disproportionately high. Compared to white males, black males have
102 times higher rates of gonorrhea and Latino males 37 times
higher, and compared to white females, chlamydia rates are 14 times
higher among black females and 9 times higher among Latina females.
</P>
<P>
   _The overall incidence of cancer _ how many people have the
disease, not how many are diagnosed during the year _ rose 4.1
percent from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer incidence soared 42.8 percent in men, largely
because of more widespread screening for the disease, while lung,
bladder, and colorectal cancers dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, lung cancer incidence soared 15.6 percent, to a
rate of one in every 2,150 women. Breast, ovarian, and uterine
cancers were all up by smaller percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Public Health Commission members Albert Sherman and Bertram A.
Yaffe expressed irritation over the fact that most Bay State
hospitals are failing to provide data on how many people they
diagnose with different cancers. They urged health commissioner
Howard K. Koh to determine whether he could make reporting
compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make up so many excuses _ they're understaffed,
overworked, underpaid,'' said state Cancer Registry director Susan
T. Gershman.
</P>
<P>
   The registry depends on getting data from 84 acute-care
hospitals to track cancer rates. In the last year, fewer than 1 in
4 fully complied, and 1 in 7 totally ignored requests for data. Koh
called that performance unacceptable, saying ``this information is
too valuable'' for hospitals to fail to report.

BABY ADVICE CAN BE A LOT OF BABBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As I write this, I am looking across a living room
strewn with devices designed to calm a crying baby, or at least
soothe her little nerves a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The battery-powered swing _ no winding necessary! _ is silent.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrating battery-powered chair (``That chair is
quivering!'' a worried friend recently noted) sits still.
</P>
<P>
   The contraption in which you lay the baby on the floor and she
plays with objects hanging from a couple of crossed rods lies
folded and snapped shut on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   And the baby? She is sitting contentedly in her stroller. We
aren't going for a stroll. We haven't returned from one. It's just
the only place she'll sit and not cry.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment. But until the moment passes, that's where she'll
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Still a rookie parent, I'm catching on quickly. Before our
daughter was born, my wife and I read lots of books, all of them
full of good advice and priceless wisdom. We talked to lots of
parents. Lots of friends and relatives offered plenty of
well-meaning advice. We watched other parents in action whenever we
could, usually anonymously in malls and the like.
</P>
<P>
   From all of this, I learned the most important lesson so far:
</P>
<P>
   Don't pay any attention to any of it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
By the book
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A prenatal omen should have told me this. My wife and I were in
one of those gigantic chain bookstores, browsing in the baby- and
child-care section (rivaled only by the self-help section for sheer
number of goofy titles) when we heard a commotion.
</P>
<P>
   Making a high-volume exit from the children's reading room was a
little girl, maybe 3 years old, steaming toward the cash register
and shrieking in no uncertain terms that ``THIS IS MY BOOK! MY
BOOK! MY BOOK!''
</P>
<P>
   I perked up when I saw, following her (but not so close as I
would have liked, which is to say, not within muzzling distance),
the girl's father. Aha. Finally, a good chance to see how a parent
would handle a real-life temper tantrum. As he ambled along, he
spoke in a quiet, polite tone of voice that made him sound as if he
were asking his boss for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret, is this the type of behavior Daddy rewards?''
</P>
<P>
   ``THIS IS MY BOOK! MY BOOK! MY BOOK!''
</P>
<P>
   Who taught this guy to negotiate, Neville Chamberlain?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'll bet he learned his technique from a baby-rearing
book. Although you can glean plenty of good information from any of
them _ I especially like the part where Dr. Spock assures you that
if you forget to support your infant's floppy head for even a
second, her head won't fall off and roll down the stairs _ you can
also drive yourself batty with contradictions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
What would Joe do?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let the baby sleep in your bed, one book says. (begin ital)
Never (end ital) let the baby sleep in your bed, another warns.
Always rush to a crying baby. Let the baby cry it out.
</P>
<P>
   It's like listening to Joe Theismann's color analysis on ESPN's
NFL coverage _ occasionally it's interesting, but when you put it
all together, it doesn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is true of the advice that friends, relatives and
neighbors offer. They mean well, of course, but that doesn't make
your head spin any less when the baby is screaming and you're
remembering how one person told you this means she needs to be fed
and another said it means she's been fed too much and a third said
you better put her down before you spoil her _ she's never going to
get into a good college if you cater to her every whim.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in the recesses of your brain rages the whole
pacifier-vs.-no-pacifier debate.
</P>
<P>
   What? How are you supposed to figure out what to do from all of
this?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is easy: You're not. In almost every case, there's
not a totally right answer or a completely wrong one. It's taken me
only a couple of months to figure out that when it comes to babies,
common sense is your best guide, along with these eight words:
</P>
<P>
   Love them a lot, and do your best.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is just details. &QL;

BOSNIA ELECTION RESULTS HELD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The international body in charge of the Bosnian
elections created chaos Tuesday by canceling its announcement of
preliminary ballot results. This led to speculation that moderate
parties had not done well.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
scheduled, then inexplicably canceled, a news conference at which
the intial election returns, from the weekend, were to have been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   This led to speculation that the parties supported by the West
had fared worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't release the results because they don't like them,''
said Sandra Coliver, the legal counsel to the International Crisis
Group, one of the independent organizations monitoring the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations had billed the general election as an
opportunity for moderates to make major gains against the
nationalist parties that have fostered so much divisiveness in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But Coliver's group, among others, predicted that the elections
were doomed to be nothing more than an ethnic census, because
Bosnian election laws provide no incentive for candidates to appeal
to voters outside of their own ethnic bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said that only a tiny fraction of votes had been counted,
and that no clear pattern had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we don't have any coherent information that
would demonstrate trends to share with people right now, and I
don't know when we will,'' the organization's leader, Robert Barry,
said in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who said it could be another week before final results
are tallied, denied that the decision first to call and then to
cancel the announcement of preliminary results had anything to do
with the claims by Bosnian nationalist parties that they had
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has yet a basis for claiming victory,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Elections were held for the three-member rotating presidency of
Bosnia, composed of Bosnian, Croat and Serb leaders; the 42-member
Bosnian House of Representatives; the presidency of the so-called
Republic of Srpska, the Serb entity that together with the Muslim
Croat Federation makes up Bosnia, and its 83-member National
Assembly; the 140-seat House of Representatives in the Federation;
and 10 regional assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   Coliver said initial returns monitored by her group suggest that
Biljana Plavsic, the president of the Republic of Srpska, and the
favorite of Western nations for her transformation from militant to
moderate, will probably lose her seat to a Serbian hardliner,
Nikola Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   The Croat hardliner, Ante Jelavic, is expected to remove the
more moderate Kresimir Zubak for the Croat presidency in Bosnia.
And the Muslim leader and old-style nationalist, Alija Izetbegovic,
is expected to retain his seat as the Bosnian president.
</P>
<P>
   The only obvious good news for the international community,
Coliver said, was the apparent strong showing of the multiethnic
Social Democratic Party in Sarajevo. The party is projected to
garner about 40 percent of the vote in the Bosnian capital, about
four times the vote it got in 1996.

HOUSE RESOLUTION CONDEMNS STATE EFFORTS TO LEGALIZE POT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is prepared to overwhelmingly approve a
resolution declaring its unequivocal opposition to legalizing
marijuana for medicinal use on grounds that it is dangerous and
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., is a
response to 1996 ballot initiatives approved in Arizona and
California that allow physicians to prescribe marijuana to treat
symptoms of illnesses. California's Proposition 215 also protects
people who use marijuana for medical reasons from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Similar initiatives are expected to be on the November ballot in
Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, and possibly the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee's crime
panel, said Tuesday that state efforts to circumvent federal
anti-drug laws are ``a backdoor way of legalizing marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A tragic drug crisis is enveloping our youth,'' McCollum said,
adding that marijuana use among young people ages 12 to 17 rose 120
percent from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said ``doctors and scientists with the greatest
expertise have determined that marijuana is not a medicine.'' He
said regularly smoking pot can be dangerous for people who are
HIV-positive because it weakens the body's natural immunities and
can accelerate the onset of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians and advocacy groups contend that marijuana, when
smoked, relieves symptoms of glaucoma; helps slow the wasting
condition associated with AIDS; relieves nausea and vomiting of
cancer patients; improves appetites in patients too sick to eat;
and eases neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, however, are divided over the medicinal value of
marijuana and are continuing to study it. The Food and Drug
Administration has rejected marijuana for medicinal use. The
National Academy of Sciences is expected to issue a report this
winter on whether marijuana should be used as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., a cancer survivor, told the
House he supported McCollum's measure. Solomon said ``marijuana is
a dangerous and addictive drug that should not be legalized for
medical use or any other use.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the resolution is nonbinding, it serves only as a
recommendation and does not have the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, urged
support for the resolution in a letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley,
R-Iowa, the Senate sponsor. A vote is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalizing marijuana as medicine sends a confusing message to
America's children,'' McCaffrey wrote. He added that ``designating
medicine through ballot initiatives'' would undermine the federal
process for assessing the safety of medicines before they enter the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the resolution says to
states allowing the medical use of marijuana: ``Naughty, naughty,
how dare you differ with us. ... Let a state diverge and they
deserve to be spanked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said the resolution was a slap
at his state. He said supporters of the measure ``think we should
just say no to sick and dying patients because it looks like we're
getting tough on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said physicians should determine
whether marijuana can relieve a patient's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Should we ``entrust it to the medical community or to turn to
Dr. Newt,'' Doggett said, referring the House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. ``For this Congress to mingle politics into
medicine is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum's bill also calls on the attorney general, 90 days from
enactment of the resolution, to report to Congress the quantity of
marijuana seized in the United States from 1992 to 1997 and the
number of arrests and prosecutions for federal marijuana offenses
during those years.

   Renee Emry of Ann Arbor, Mich., appeared in McCollum's office
Tuesday with members of the Marijuana Policy project, a Washington
advocacy group, to protest the resolution. Emry, 38, has multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three lighted a marijuana cigarette in front of
McCollum's receptionists and held up a sign saying: ``I use
marijuana for multiple sclerosis.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCollum's aides slipped into a back room to call the police,
Emry explained she was willing to be arrested so that other
patients who benefit from medicinal marijuana won't be.
</P>
<P>
   Emry said regular marijuana use has eased her pain and enabled
her to walk with a cane 19 years after her diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else I am supposed to do except take care of
myself,'' Emry said. ``What am I supposed to do, become a
criminal?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, Emry was arrested and taken away in a
wheelchair.

EX-FBI AGENT TO SEEK IMMUNITY IN MOB PROCEEDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After months of testimony that failed to show that
former FBI agent John Connolly had committed any crime within the
statute of limitations, defense lawyers will ask a judge Wednesday
to order federal prosecutors to grant Connolly immunity so he can
testify in ongoing hearings into the FBI's relationship with its
criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when he was called as a witness last spring, was
the longtime handler of gangster/informants Stephen Flemmi and
James ``Whitey'' Bulger, and defense lawyers feel Connolly can shed
crucial light on the FBI's relationship with the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims that he and Bulger were given permission to commit
any crime short of murder in exchange for information they gave the
FBI on the Mafia. Although Connolly has refused to testify without
immunity, he has said in interviews that Bulger and Flemmi were
given permission to continue their gambling and loan-sharking
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Flemmi has implicated Connolly in wrongdoing, such as
tipping him off to an investigation of bookmakers _ which Connolly
has denied, none of the allegations falls within the statute of
limitations, which is five years for most federal crimes. Connolly
retired from the FBI in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The only alleged crime that would have fallen within the statute
of limitations was Flemmi's claim that he and Bulger were tipped
off to their upcoming indictment in January 1995 so they could
flee.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi testified that it was Connolly's former supervisor,
John Morris, who alerted him and Bulger to the indictments. Morris,
who testified under a grant of immunity, denied tipping off Bulger
and Flemmi to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, who face an uphill legal battle trying to
convince US District Judge Mark L. Wolf that he should override
prosecutors and immunize Connolly, are expected to argue that only
Connolly can resolve the discrepancies between Flemmi's and
Morris's testimony and spell out the deal Flemmi and Bulger had
with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth J. Fishman, told Wolf Tuesday that
there is virtually no chance Connolly would waive his Fifth
Amendment rights and agree to voluntarily testify based on numerous
conversations Fishman has had with Connolly's attorney, R. Robert
Popeo.

MOVE MADE TO SHUT DOWN WEAK COLLEGE TEACHING PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Board of Education has taken an
important step toward shutting down college teaching programs where
more than 20 percent of students fail the state's mandatory teacher
certification test for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Board members also approved a motion by board chairman John
Silber to eventually lower the failure threshold to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By unanimous vote, the nine-member board instructed Interim
Education Commissioner David Driscoll to draft a proposal on
decertifying those programs, making them far less attractive to
prospective students intent on becoming teachers. Driscoll expects
to present the proposal at the board's Oct. 13 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The board vote, held in suburban Malden, comes after Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci first suggested that college teaching
programs should have at least an 80 percent pass rate, or go out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously a big step because, if we take the governor's
proposal literally, it means that most of the state's programs
would not meet that level,'' Driscoll said Tuesday after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 54 colleges &UR;  &LR; whose students took the teacher test in both
April and July, only two _ Harvard University and Wellesley College
_ met the 80 percent pass threshold, though only eight Harvard
students and five Wellesley students took the tests. Boston College
had 151 students take the two tests, with 78 percent of them
passing, according to state data. The next teacher test is Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   To help teachers prepare for upcoming exams, Driscoll said he
will convene private meetings next month for deans and other
university officials to review actual exam questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that will go a long way to demystify the tests,''
Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Brabeck, dean of Boston College's School of Education,
said Tuesday that she's unsure whether she will attend the meetings
because the state has yet to independently validate the test as
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want actual analysis of the test, not just the opportunity
to look at the test,'' she said. ``We want evidence that it is a
valid instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal is still subject to discussion and approval
and would not be implemented until 2000, the board vote shows
officials are intent on holding teacher training programs to high
standards following a 59-percent failure rate on the April test.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 47 percent of would-be teachers failed what the state
describes as a basic test of reading, writing, and knowledge of the
subject they plan to teach.
</P>
<P>
   At an education summit in August, deans and others said they
were being unfairly criticized, insisting they alone are not to
blame for the high failure rates. Above all, they complained that
the teacher test had yet to be measured and validated by an
independent analyst to determine whether it is fair.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci and the state's top education policymakers
dismissed their complaints as ``denial,'' and called for more
testing, higher college entrance exam scores for program admission,
and an end to college grade inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Silber has never hidden his eagerness to close programs
that ultimately prove to be failures _ including his own at Boston
University, where he is chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Brabeck said it is too early to talk about closing
schools when so few details are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say 80 percent and two consecutive years, what does
that mean?'' Brabeck said, asking how the state would treat failure
rates when students may pass one section, but fail another.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said his draft proposal will address such questions.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Tuesday's meeting, the board voted on key cutoff scores
for the 210,000 fourth-, eighth-, and 10th-graders who took the
state's first Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System or MCAS
test last May.
</P>
<P>
   The vote allows state education officials to proceed to the next
level of grading. They must now sort 6 million open-ended,
essay-style questions and 20 million multiple-choice questions
according to the four achievement levels _ advanced, proficient,
needs improvement, and failing. Some 1,400 graders in Massachusetts
and New Hampshire scored the questions over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   State testing director Jeff Nellhaus said he expects to have
scores ready by the end of November not only for the 347 school
districts, but also for the state's 1,800 schools, its thousands of
individual classrooms, and each student.
</P>
<P>
   But Silber said he wants Nellhaus and the testing company, New
Hampshire-based Advanced Systems, to ``validate'' their scoring
process and methodology as accurate and fair.
</P>
<P>
   The board emphasized it has yet to determine a passing score and
acceptable proficiency level for 10th graders who, beginning in
2003, must pass the MCAS to graduate from high school.

DUBBERS' STRIKE CRIPPLES ITALIAN FILM, TV INDUSTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ For the first time in Italian history, Reva, the heroine
of ``The Guiding Light,'' beat on the chest of her handsome
shipwreck companion and raged this week in her native English. Tiny
subtitles tried to keep up with the heaving dialogue, but most
loyal television viewers were confused and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast of one of Italy's most beloved soap operas in its
original soundtrack was the most startling sign to date of the
havoc a two-month strike by dubbers has wreaked on the Italian
television and movie industry. The strike also threatens to block
the release of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's latest
hit, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and more than a dozen other long-awaited
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Italians have long grown inured to strikes by train conductors,
teachers and hospital workers, but the revolt of the hidden voices
of cinema has caused a whole new level of panic.
</P>
<P>
   For historic and cultural reasons, dubbing is a deeply
entrenched tradition. Far more than their French or German
counterparts, Italians prefer to watch Jim Carrey or Harrison Ford
speaking Italian. If the strike continues, it will cost movie
studios millions and millions of dollars. Television networks have
even more money at risk.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the strikers appear unwilling to relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective fact is that the work of dubbers has been
horribly exploited,'' said Oreste Lionello, the suitably whiney
Italian voice of Woody Allen. ``They have kidnapped our vocal
cords.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where fewer than 2 percent of movies are
in foreign languages, a dubbers' strike would go unnoticed. In
Italy, where over 75 percent of all new releases are imports, the
sudden silence has all but paralyzed the television and movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is a battle for a national contract, better wages and
a share in royalties. It is also an effort to preserve the dignity
of a profession that many view as a dying art. Even if the strike
is settled, the showdown has unleashed a passionate debate about a
cinema subculture that is not just a huge industry, but a world
unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 80 dubbing companies in Italy, and at
least 1,000 professional dubbers. Italian film awards like the
Davide, the local Oscar, have long had a category for best dubber
of the year. This year dubbers created their own separate awards
competition, the Grand Prize International of Dubbing. (The top
award went to Massimo Popolizo, for his interpretation of Kenneth
Branagh's interpretation of Hamlet.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-known Italian dubbers are celebrities in their
own right who can demand movie-star fees and celebrity
endorsements. Feruccio Amendola, who is the Italian voice of Robert
De Niro, Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman, is also famous for
his fabric-softener commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian public is accustomed to hearing my voice,'' he
said. ``If they heard De Niro speaking, they wouldn't know what to
think. ''
</P>
<P>
   Amendola, who is observing the strike, was supposed to be busy
this month directing the dubbing for a Michael Douglas movie, ``A
Perfect Murder,'' which is one of 15 major films whose release in
Italy is now in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about huge losses,'' said Richard Borg, head of
the Rome office of United International Pictures, which distributes
MGM, Paramount and Universal films and which has postponed the
planned October release of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and three other
films indefinitely. He said his company might try to recruit
nonunion dubbers from northern Italy, but would not release the
movies with subtitles. ``Italians aren't used to seeing movies in
the original version,'' he said. ``They just won't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing in Italy has its own odd history. In the 1930s, the
Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini required foreign films to be
dubbed to drown out the sound of the enemy language. (Even proper
names had to be Italianized. Fred Astaire became Federico Astorio.)
</P>
<P>
   After the war, John Wayne westerns and American comedies flooded
Europe. But particularly in Italy, where the literacy rate was very
low, audiences could not read subtitles. Even the great postwar
Italian directors, Fellini, Visconti and de Sica, preferred to dub
sound in the studio. In her first films, Sophia Loren's lines were
dubbed because producers deemed her Neopolitan accent too plebian.
Italian dubbers consider themselves artists on a par and sometimes
better than many of the movie stars they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers complain that since the advent of private
television networks, the demand for dubbing has increased, and so
have the number of dubbers. Quality lost out to quantity, as
companies scrambled to dub countless soap operas, sitcoms and old
movies, hiring anyone who would work for less than the going rate,
as much as 30 percent below the minimum union wage.
</P>
<P>
   Major movie studios still hire the top professionals to do the
voices of Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson and pay on time. But when it
comes to television and commercials, the strikers complain, smaller
companies are less scrupulous. Most of the production companies say
they are willing to increase fees but so far they have balked at
signing a labor contract and promising royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Time and mass culture may be on the strikers' side. A few
Italian film-makers, including Bernardo Bertolucci, have lobbied in
favor of subtitles, but the public _ and therefore the industry _
has not been persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even young moviegoers drenched in American pop culture are
reluctant to see films with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied English in school but I still don't know it well
enough to watch a movie,'' said Ludovica Gasparini, 19, a
university freshman, as she emerged from seeing Wes Craven's latest
horror movie, ``Scream 2,'' in Italian. The genre is not known for
sophisticated dialogue, but she said she didn't care. ``I would
hate to see it with subtitles and think that I was missing
something beautiful.''

PRIMAKOV PRESSED FOR ECONOMIC BAILOUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ So far, Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov
has displayed a spy's ability to hide his thoughts and a diplomat's
skill at saying the right thing to the right audience.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is mounting on all sides for Primakov, Russia's
former spymaster and foreign minister, to unveil his plans to
rescue an economy paralyzed by a month-long crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble took a new plunge Tuesday, losing 30 percent of its
value, a senior official called for printing new money to pay off
Russia's domestic debts. Tuesday night, representatives of the
International Monetary Fund arrived in Moscow for talks on whether
Russia still qualifies for the next installment of a $22.6 billion
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been trying to reassure the West that a government
forced on President Boris Yeltsin by a Communist-led parliament
does not automatically mean a return to Soviet-style control over
the economy. Yeltsin passed on this message to French President
Jacques Chirac by phone Tuesday, and Primakov did the same with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But after Aug. 17, when the government surprised almost everyone
by devaluing the ruble and defaulting on its obligations to
creditors, forcing banks to shut down and setting off a round of
price rises, Moscow's problem is getting anyone to believe anything
it says.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has promised to make his priority paying off 80 billion
rubles in late wages owed to workers, a smart political stance in a
country on the edge of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But he has offered no clue how to pay for this. A plan proposed
by a group of economists led by Leonid Abalkin, picked as an
informal adviser by Primakov, suggests increasing the money supply
by printing rubles, an idea supported Tuesday by the Russian
Central Bank's new chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mostly positive about it and we can't do without it,''
Gerashchenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has tried to pay off its wage arrears several times in
the past without addressing the ineffeciency, corruption and
mismanagement of funds that helped cause the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to address the rotten roots in the system,''
said Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's
Davis Center for Russian Studies. ``Printing money and introducing
controls is not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also said Tuesday he would avoid solutions that would
lead to hyperinflation. One way to do that would be to enlist the
West's help. John Odling-Smee, the head of the IMF department
dealing with Russia, arrived in Moscow to discuss prospects for the
release of a $4.3 billion installment of a $22.6 billion aid
package agreed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov told Odling-Smee that Russia would meet its debt
obligations and would strive to attract more foreign investment,
the Interfax news agency reported. The trouble: few foreign
business leaders trust the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no credibility left in Russia public authority,'' said
Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Moscow. ``If they say that tomorrow they are going to approve the
entire package of structural reforms we've been pushing, we're
going to say, ``We don't believe it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But few Russian officials are talking about the things Western
businessmen want _ more transparency and accountability in the
economy. Instead, the buzzword in the new government is ``state
control.'' Gerashchenko called Tuesday for a return to the
Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn in their hard
currency earnings to the government, in exchange for rubles at a
state-determined rate.
</P>
<P>
   One official who had inspired some Western confidence in
Russia's policies, the tough-talking chief tax inspector, Boris
Fyodorov, could soon be replaced, Russian media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also marked the end of a week-long recovery by the
ruble, which had fallen from 6 to the dollar to 21 last week, only
to recover early Tuesday to 7.5 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the ruble's rally showed that the
crisis was not that serious. But bankers and currency dealers said
the ruble increase was deliberately orchestrated by the banks to
lower the rate of the Russian currency to the dollar _ in
anticipation of payment of $2 billion worth of ruble-dollar forward
contracts that came due Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the ruble dropped to 12.5 to the dollar.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans, getting a fixed reading on what the folks back home
think about President Clinton's behavior was not too tough a task.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Meagher Northup, R-Ky., attended a parade near Louisville
over the weekend to a chorus of, ``Impeach him. Impeach him.'' It
sounded, she said, like ``Crucify him, crucify him.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the East Coast, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said it took
him 90 minutes to walk five blocks in Manhattan's Upper West Side
because people were so furious about all this impeachment talk. His
answering machine ran out of tape by mid-afternoon. ``What they
were saying was a variation of, `Stop this nonsense. Don't impeach
the president. This is absurd.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the House, members from swing districts or
from places where reactions tend to be more muted and tempered, the
messages from home about the independent counsel's report have been
decidedly more mixed and difficult to sum-up in a simple sound
bite. That makes their jobs considerably more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinion is still very split and very fluid,'' said Rep. Philip
English, R-Pa. ``A fair number of people are uncomfortable with the
situation. They don't like what the president has done, but they're
not sure what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
last Friday, lawmakers say they have heard from constituents in
record numbers, at supermarkets, synagogues and political rallies.
Their offices have been deluged with phone calls, e-mail messages,
and letters from citizens venting their rage and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say they have noted a distinction between people
who are actively calling their offices, most of whom voice
overwhelming support for Clinton's ouster, and voters who engage
members of Congress in conversation at picnics and barbecues and
breakfast meetings.
</P>
<P>
   These voters are furious with Clinton, who they believe has
debased the office of the presidency, and offended by his behavior.
The problem is that they can't figure out what sort of punishment
is appropriate for a president who lied about a sexual romp with a
21-year-old former intern but who many believe has done a
relatively good job.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the opinions of people who represent this broad swath
of the public that will likely determine Clinton's fate in the
Congress. Back in Tennessee, Rep. Bob Clement, a Democrat, said a
whole cross-section of his constituents are torn over whether the
president's actions warrant impeachment, resignation, censure or
anything besides personal and historical humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consensus,'' said Clement. ``Among the general
population it's mixed. But they do want us to move expeditiously.
They don't want it dragged out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said he had received 105 calls,
running two-to-one in favor of impeachment. But of the people back
home who Boehlert spoke to after church or at the corner store,
many seemed to hold less extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of shaking their heads in disbelief,''
Boehlert said. ``Nobody likes the idea of going through
impeachment. The majority of people I represent who have spoken to
me feel that the president has lost his moral compass. More want to
have him removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are a number of people who are genuinely
torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. Northup said that among certain communities in her
district there is a sense of uncertainty. ``More people were
saying, get him out,'' she said, adding that her office received
180 phone calls by Monday with 135 of the callers gunning for
impeachment. ``But not everybody, especially communities with a
deep abiding allegiance to this president. They don't want to
imagine it has to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, the gyrations of the president's lawyers over
his statements and whether they are legally accurate appear to be
counter-productive. ``In Middle America they don't see that as
anything other than telling a lie,'' she said. ``Any other
equivocation makes them mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said he made his rounds at a parade, a
breakfast meeting and a hog roast over the weekend. While many
people, including some Democrats, wanted to order-up instant
impeachment, he was surprised to hear so many constituents express
doubts about what Congress should do by way of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people saying, the guy is sick,'' LaHood said.
``But they are simply not sure. People are confused about whether
these are impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators from across the country echoed the sentiments of many
House members.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said that people are furious at Clinton
but they are also furious at Starr. ``There is still signs among
people of confusion,'' he said. But, he said, many of them ``wish
this wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she is hearing the same kind
of ambiguity from voters in her home state, although she noted she
received 95 phone messages going 6-to-1 in favor of impeachment.
``People did not recommend to me a specific course of action,''
Collins said. ``They didn't, in most cases, call for his
impeachment. I don't think they've decided what ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this lack of consensus, however, House members and
senators said that even among this wishy-washier, broad middle
cross-section of the population, people are disgusted and appalled
about the turn-of-events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Maine are offended by nature of relationship and the
lying,'' said Collins. ``One woman came up to me at a rally and
said, 'If my boss did that, he'd be out of there.'''

PRIMAKOV PRESSED FOR ECONOMIC BAILOUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ So far, Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov
has displayed a spy's ability to hide his thoughts and a diplomat's
skill at saying the right thing to the right audience.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is mounting on all sides for Primakov, Russia's
former spymaster and foreign minister, to unveil his plans to
rescue an economy paralyzed by a month-long crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble took a new plunge Tuesday, losing 30 percent of its
value, a senior official called for printing new money to pay off
Russia's domestic debts. Tuesday night, representatives of the
International Monetary Fund arrived in Moscow for talks on whether
Russia still qualifies for the next installment of a $22.6 billion
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been trying to reassure the West that a government
forced on President Boris Yeltsin by a Communist-led parliament
does not automatically mean a return to Soviet-style control over
the economy. Yeltsin passed on this message to French President
Jacques Chirac by phone Tuesday, and Primakov did the same with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But after Aug. 17, when the government surprised almost everyone
by devaluing the ruble and defaulting on its obligations to
creditors, forcing banks to shut down and setting off a round of
price rises, Moscow's problem is getting anyone to believe anything
it says.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has promised to make his priority paying off 80 billion
rubles in late wages owed to workers, a smart political stance in a
country on the edge of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But he has offered no clue how to pay for this. A plan proposed
by a group of economists led by Leonid Abalkin, picked as an
informal adviser by Primakov, suggests increasing the money supply
by printing rubles, an idea supported Tuesday by the Russian
Central Bank's new chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mostly positive about it and we can't do without it,''
Gerashchenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has tried to pay off its wage arrears several times in
the past without addressing the ineffeciency, corruption and
mismanagement of funds that helped cause the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to address the rotten roots in the system,''
said Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's
Davis Center for Russian Studies. ``Printing money and introducing
controls is not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also said Tuesday he would avoid solutions that would
lead to hyperinflation. One way to do that would be to enlist the
West's help. John Odling-Smee, the head of the IMF department
dealing with Russia, arrived in Moscow to discuss prospects for the
release of a $4.3 billion installment of a $22.6 billion aid
package agreed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov told Odling-Smee that Russia would meet its debt
obligations and would strive to attract more foreign investment,
the Interfax news agency reported. The trouble: few foreign
business leaders trust the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no credibility left in Russia public authority,'' said
Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Moscow. ``If they say that tomorrow they are going to approve the
entire package of structural reforms we've been pushing, we're
going to say, ``We don't believe it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But few Russian officials are talking about the things Western
businessmen want _ more transparency and accountability in the
economy. Instead, the buzzword in the new government is ``state
control.'' Gerashchenko called Tuesday for a return to the
Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn in their hard
currency earnings to the government, in exchange for rubles at a
state-determined rate.
</P>
<P>
   One official who had inspired some Western confidence in
Russia's policies, the tough-talking chief tax inspector, Boris
Fyodorov, could soon be replaced, Russian media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also marked the end of a week-long recovery by the
ruble, which had fallen from 6 to the dollar to 21 last week, only
to recover early Tuesday to 7.5 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the ruble's rally showed that the
crisis was not that serious. But bankers and currency dealers said
the ruble increase was deliberately orchestrated by the banks to
lower the rate of the Russian currency to the dollar _ in
anticipation of payment of $2 billion worth of ruble-dollar forward
contracts that came due Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the ruble dropped to 12.5 to the dollar.

BRAZIL MARKET SOARS ON BAILOUT HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Brazilian stock market Tuesday had its biggest rally in more
than three years as hopes soared that a proposed rescue plan by the
industrialized world would salvage Latin America's most important
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To halt the spread of an Asian and Russian financial crisis to
Latin America, the World Bank promised to back up a pledge last
week by the International Monetary Fund to aid Brazil in paying
debt coming due. The World Bank also confirmed talks with Argentina
to help that country pay debt and finance its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Group of Seven industrialized nations
agreed Monday to support fragile emerging markets battered this
year by investor flight. Rumors about the size of a bailout swirled
all day Tuesday, pushing Brazil's stock market up by an astonishing
18.7 percent, sparking rallies in other markets in the region.
Mexico's stock market rose 12.9 pecent; Argentina's rose 8.9
percent, and Chile's rose 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a shaky financial world, there were no assurances that
the rally would introduce an era of stability in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is reminding me of what happened with the first
rumors of the Russian (bailout) package when everybody got
excited,'' said Jim Sullivan, associate Latin America analyst for
Thomson Global Markets in New York, an economic research firm.
``Everybody got excited and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely good news'' said Esteban Medrano, Latin
economist for Independent Economic Analysis in New York. ``But so
far fundamentals haven't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Latin America's biggest economy, Brazil, is grappling
with a growing budget deficit that is now 7 percent of gross
national product. The cost to the government of paying off $75
billion in short-term debt coming due by year's end also rose last
week when the country's central bank hiked interest rates to stem
investor flight, making the government's bonds more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The country is losing billions a day from investors converting
their holdings from the local currency, the reais, to the US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States' biggest trading partner, Japan, in steep
decline, there is growing concern about Brazil. US exports to
Brazil totaled nearly $8 billion in the first seven months of the
year and direct US investment in the country stands at more than
$37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is seeking
re-election in October, said he would call President Clinton to
discuss the country's economic affairs. But many Brazilian
economists believe that Cardoso must take the initiative and
quickly cut the deficit. Although the government last week said it
would trim spending, analysts said the savings would be wiped out
by higher debt costs following a hike last week in interest rates
to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three weeks left until the elections and Cardoso has
enough momentum and credibility to stand up and say that tougher
cuts have to be made,'' said Denis Parisien, an analyst with
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in emerging economies began more than a year ago in
Thailand. Troubles have spread throughout the world, driving down
currencies and stock and bond markets. In Brazil, shares on Sao
Paulo's exchange, the Bovespa, have lost half their value in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by President Clinton and other G-7 leaders that
help may be on the way to the world's fragile economies reinforced
the positive sentiment building in Latin America. Last week, the
IMF said it was ready to help Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was clearly concerned about the stability of Brazil's
currency, which has a fixed exchange rate. If the government is
forced to devalue, there is a growing fear in international circles
of another downward spiral of currencies in Latin American similar
to the one triggered in 1994 by a plunging Mexican peso.
</P>
<P>
   To calm Latin American markets, a World Bank spokeswoman,
reading from a statement prepared by staff in the Latin America
division, said the bank is ``preparing a package of $4.5 billion
for Argentina in the event that the country is unable to access
international capital markets to have financing available to roll
over its debt and to cover any fiscal deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said Friday it is prepared to lend money to Latin
America if any nations in the region request aid. And the World
Bank said Tuesday that it would participate in any such loan
program.
</P>
<P>
   An IMF spokesman declined further comment.

REPUBLICANS WAIT FOR BEST STRATEGY TO TAKE SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although overt attempts to drive President Clinton
from office could backfire, several Republican operatives said
Tuesday that many campaigns were on the verge of fully exploiting
the president's woes in commercials leading up to the Nov. 3
election. Several are conducting surveys now to determine how
forceful the ads should be.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Capitol Hill was aswirl over whether to make
public the videotape of Clinton's sworn testimony to the grand
jury. Democrats fear that such images are bound to be embarrassing
_ and bound to wind up in Republican campaign commercials. Others
say there is little point in spending precious campaign money
running such footage when the news media will show it for free,
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the public appetite for impeachment is fairly low at the
moment, even among Republicans, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll, released Tuesday. Even if more damaging
information comes out about Clinton, the poll found, Republicans
would rather have Clinton resign or have Congress just drop the
whole thing. In the poll, 41 percent of Republicans said they
wanted Clinton to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultants say that the public cares
deeply that the process of investigating the president unfold
deliberately, without Republicans appearing to gloat over it,
exploit it or push it along unnaturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the public wants is for kind of a due process to take
place,'' said Bob Teeter, who managed George Bush's presidential
campaigns in 1988 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Teeter said the reluctance for impeachment at this point is
based more on a desire to keep the country stable than on
confidence in Clinton. ``It's not an indication of support for him,
it's that it would be bad for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican campaign consultant based in Atlanta,
agreed. ``There's not yet broad public support for removing the
president from office,'' he said. ``We're in a let-the-process-work
stage. The reason isn't that the public doesn't care; the reason is
that voters are wrestling with how to make the punishment fit the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant based in
Virginia, said that voters were feeling some anxiety, but it was
based largely on the volatility of the stock market. ``If this were
about Bill Clinton, the public would fire him,'' Castellanos said.
``But it's about the people. Is it worth the turmoil to put
ourselves and the country through this? The judgment is that Bill
Clinton isn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Clinton by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, has done little to move Republicans toward impeachment.
The Times poll found that a third of Republicans said Starr's
investigation has been a partisan crusade bent on destroying
Clinton rather than uncovering wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   These divisions among Republicans have left party leaders
without a clear-cut strategy for how to approach the fall
elections. Several operatives said that the notion of removing
Clinton from office _ unthinkable even just a few weeks ago _ was
now not unexpected but still a surprise and that any strategy was
developing on an ad hoc basis, day by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will take care of itself _ that's the larger strategy,''
said Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian
Coalition and now a consultant to numerous Republican candidates.
``But Republicans are in a very difficult and delicate position,''
he said. ``If they are going to build on their majority, they have
to show that they are deserving of that majority _ without
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said that the go-slow approach could speed up
after the elections, particularly if Democrats sustain serious
losses in the House and Senate. But it would be Democrats, not
Republicans, feeling more urgency for Clinton to go.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Republican strategist said that candidates simply
needed to be patient and wait for the public to absorb all that has
happened and that then a critical mass of public opinion would
emerge that Clinton is not fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone is digesting the sex _ they are not even
on to perjury and abuse of power,'' this strategist said. ``It's
plausible that Clinton is at his high-water mark today.''

SOSA'S LOVE OF BASEBALL BRINGS US BACK TO THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - The boy, maybe 11, maybe 12 years old , steps to the
plate batting clean-up. He's a gangly kid, legs of a spider, all
elbows and longish neck. He owns the impersonation, though, if not
the physique.
</P>
<P>
   Black bat, wristbands pushed to mid-forearm, black batting
gloves. He taps home with the bat, once, twice, three times. Even
from 100 feet _ and 20 years _ away, I can read his mind.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the dream featured a different outfielder, different
team, different generation. My guy wore 44, Yankees' pinstripes,
and the year I was the kid's age, 1977, he hit three homers on
three swings against the Dodgers in Game Six of the World Series.
All I wanted was to bat lefty, to be like Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, this kid has home run madness like 10
million other kids, a wicked case. You can hear the P.A. announcer
booming in his head.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Now batting for the Cubs, Number 21, Sammy
Sooo-sssaaa.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch comes in eye-high, fastball. The kid steps in
the bucket, takes a looping flail. Strike one.
</P>
<P>
   He steps out of the box, taps his chest with his fist. A row
above me in the metal bleachers, an older kid laughs. To me, that
chuckle belongs on the diamond every bit as much as the whir of a
line drive or some shortstop shouting ``Hum babe.'' Sadly, the
sound has been too long gone from the game. Until Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   It is his lasting contribution to baseball, more so than that
62nd smash out onto Waveland Avenue the other night. Sosa bubbles,
threatens to burst every time he steps between the lines. In this,
America's most churlish moment, a time where people dole out joy
like it comes with a Benz price tag, one Cub waves his black bat
like a wand. He dares to (begin ital) play (end ital) baseball, not
work at it; (begin ital) love, (end ital) not tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa loves the game so much, he brings me back to it, brings me
to a park to witness an anonymous kid love it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The boy fouls the second pitch off, then takes one away and in
the dirt. Another bouncer evens the count, two balls, two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   For me, baseball died on Aug. 12, 1994, the day of the last
strike. The cancellation of the '94 Series, the pathetic '95
season, greedy players, foolish owners, luxury suites, Taj-like
stadiums _ all of it one affront atop the next, a feeling not
unlike coming home to the aftermath of a robbery. All gone,
snatched.
</P>
<P>
   The kid steps out, then back in, taps the plate with his bat.
Again, the pitch is in the dirt. Now the count is full, and you see
it in the way he widens his eyes, licks his lips. Number 21 on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Three and two to Sosa. Sammy steps in, sets
himself.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   To pretend like that was how I made it through childhood, how a
couple of pairs of patched pants and a three-room apartment in
Queens didn't seem so bad. I had a Sportcraft mitt that I broke in
under my parents' mattress on the fold-out couch, a glove with the
name ``Reggie Jackson'' embossed into the leather. Sometimes, at
night, I would trace over the signature with a marker, so it
wouldn't fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game faded away, until Sosa, with his bunny hop out of
the batter's box and the stutter step as he rounds the bases. He
oozes joy, and I would pay good money to see him whiff, or park his
car, or pack a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff pitch is another fastball, belt-high. The kid doesn't
so much swing as twitch, an ungainly lunge at the ball. He gets the
end of the bat on it. A slow roller to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The boy runs hard, but he is out by three steps. He peels off
and jogs back to the bench, takes a seat. After a while the grimace
goes away, and again I can read his mind.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``That ball is out of here. Sammy taps his heart.
Sammy makes a V to the crowd. And they're on their feet at
Wrigley.''
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As I am on my feet in this park. On the next diamond over, the
outfield grass is soft and moths buzz the lights. I take one step,
another, a third, and then I am running as fast as I can, as fast
as I have in 20 years. &QL;

   He steps out of the box, taps his chest with his fist. A row
above me in the metal bleachers, an older kid laughs. To me, that
chuckle belongs on the diamond every bit as much as the whir of a
line drive or some shortstop shouting ``Hum babe.'' Sadly, the
sound has been too long gone from the game. Until Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   It is his lasting contribution to baseball, more so than that
62nd smash out onto Waveland Avenue the other night. Sosa bubbles,
threatens to burst every time he steps between the lines. In this,
America's most churlish moment, a time where people dole out joy
like it comes with a Benz price tag, one Cub waves his black bat
like a wand. He dares to (begin ital) play (end ital) baseball, not
work at it; (begin ital) love, (end ital) not tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa loves the game so much, he brings me back to it, brings me
to a park to witness an anonymous kid love it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The boy fouls the second pitch off, then takes one away and in
the dirt. Another bouncer evens the count, two balls, two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   For me, baseball died on Aug. 12, 1994, the day of the last
strike. The cancellation of the '94 Series, the pathetic '95
season, greedy players, foolish owners, luxury suites, Taj-like
stadiums _ all of it one affront atop the next, a feeling not
unlike coming home to the aftermath of a robbery. All gone,
snatched.
</P>
<P>
   The kid steps out, then back in, taps the plate with his bat.
Again, the pitch is in the dirt. Now the count is full, and you see
it in the way he widens his eyes, licks his lips. Number 21 on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Three and two to Sosa. Sammy steps in, sets
himself.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   To pretend like that was how I made it through childhood, how a
couple of pairs of patched pants and a three-room apartment in
Queens didn't seem so bad. I had a Sportcraft mitt that I broke in
under my parents' mattress on the fold-out couch, a glove with the
name ``Reggie Jackson'' embossed into the leather. Sometimes, at
night, I would trace over the signature with a marker, so it
wouldn't fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game faded away, until Sosa, with his bunny hop out of
the batter's box and the stutter step as he rounds the bases. He
oozes joy, and I would pay good money to see him whiff, or park his
car, or pack a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff pitch is another fastball, belt-high. The kid doesn't
so much swing as twitch, an ungainly lunge at the ball. He gets the
end of the bat on it. A slow roller to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The boy runs hard, but he is out by three steps. He peels off
and jogs back to the bench, takes a seat. After a while the grimace
goes away, and again I can read his mind.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``That ball is out of here. Sammy taps his heart.
Sammy makes a V to the crowd. And they're on their feet at
Wrigley.''
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As I am on my feet in this park. On the next diamond over, the
outfield grass is soft and moths buzz the lights. I take one step,
another, a third, and then I am running as fast as I can, as fast
as I have in 20 years. &QL;

JONES' LAWYERS SEEK RENEWAL OF SUIT AGAINST CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones Tuesday said they are
preparing to file several motions in an effort to reinstate her
sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton, including a
new request that US District Judge Susan Webber Wright find Clinton
in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the appeal has a great deal of chance for success,''
said David Pyke, one of Jones' attorneys. Pyke said Jones feels
``vindication'' from the report by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr that alleges Clinton committed perjury by denying a sexual
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead, the Rutherford Institute lawyer who is a
co-counsel on the Jones case, said Wright ``was in the room'' when
Clinton gave his January deposition in the Jones case and said he
couldn't remember being alone with Lewinsky and denied having an
affair with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to her face,'' Whitehead said. ``He is an officer of
the court. She may hold the president in contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, the Clinton lawyer handling the Jones case, did
not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wright dismissed the Jones lawsuit in April, and the case has
been appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
Jones' lawyers now are hoping that the appellate court will take
the unusual step of summarily deciding that Jones has won the case
based on Clinton's alleged false statements as outlined in the
Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report, in addition to alleging that Clinton committed
perjury in the Jones deposition, also says Clinton discussed his
testimony with his secretary, Betty Currie. Wright had ordered
Clinton not to discuss his testimony with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers, who plan to file their motions over the next two
weeks, want the appeals court to reinstate the lawsuit or instruct
Wright to consider doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has the option of acting on her own to cite Clinton for
contempt, according to Pyke. Wright, in a footnote to her ruling
released Sept. 3, said, ``The court has concerns about the nature
of the president's January 17th, 1998 deposition testimony given
his recent public statements.'' Wright was referring to Clinton's
public admission on Aug. 17 of having had an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton denied having a
``sexual relationship'' with Lewinsky, or an ``affair'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his Aug. 17 speech, said he was ``legally accurate''
in the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova said the Jones case
could reemerge in two ways:
</P>
<P>
   --Wright could issue a ``show cause'' order, which would require
Clinton and his lawyers to appear in court and explain why she
shouldn't hold him in contempt for submitting false testimony.
Significantly, Wright could hold Clinton in contempt for making
false statements even if she does not determine whether he
committed perjury, which is a a tougher legal standard.
</P>
<P>
   --The US Court of Appeals could send the case back to Wright and
instruct her to reopen it based on new information contained in the
Starr report. It also has the option of deciding that Jones has won
the case and sending the case to trial only to determine how much
damages Clinton should pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``No federal judge should permit the kind of activity that has
gone on in that case without taking some steps to rectify it,''
said diGenova.
</P>
<P>
   Jones alleged in her suit that on May 8, 1991, when Clinton was
the governor of Arkansas, he invited her to a hotel room and made
an unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied the allegation and declined an offer to settle
the case out of court. As a result, the Jones case proceeded and
one of her lawyers received an anonymous tip that Clinton may have
had an affair with Lewinsky. Clinton reportedly was surprised when
he learned that Lewinsky was on a list of possible witnesses in the
Jones case. Lewinsky swore in an affidavit for the Jones case that
she did not have a sexual relationship with Clinton, and the
president made a similar statement during his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   All of this helped prompt Starr, who was investigating an array
of other subjects involving Clinton, to look into whether Clinton
did have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and urged her to lie
about it. Wright eventually ruled that the Lewinsky matter was not
relevant to the Jones case, and later dismissed the entire lawsuit.

SURGERY SEEN BEST ROUTE IN MORE-SEVERE PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New data on prostate cancer treatments show that surgery is the
best choice if the tumor is at an intermediate- or high-risk stage
at the time of diagnosis, but the results leave unresolved the
question of how many men with low-risk tumors might benefit from
less drastic treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published Wednesday, offer partial clarification
in the debate over the best way to treat the number two cancer
killer of American men.
</P>
<P>
   The crux is how many men can safely forgo surgery or high-dose
``external beam'' radiation, with their risks of impotence and
urinary incontinence, in favor of radioactive ``seed'' implants
within the cancerous prostate gland, a less traumatic procedure
that is rapidly growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   When seed implants are compared to prostate removal or external
radiation, ``for intermediate- and high-risk patients, there
appears to be a three-fold increase in treatment failure within
five years,'' said Dr. Anthony V. D'Amico of Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, lead author of one new study. ``This apparent
increase in recurrence is frightening, and raises a question as to
whether implants are a feasible alternative for those patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at blood levels of a prostate cancer marker
called prostate-specific antigen over five years among nearly 1,900
men treated with seed implants (with or without hormone
treatments), prostatectomy, or external beam radiation. D'Amico
noted that the study is the first to compare the effectiveness of
all three treatment types among carefully matched sets of patients.
It appears in this week's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A study from Seattle, published earlier this month in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggested that implants
are as effective as surgery for low-risk cases. But experts do not
agree on the size of that group.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion depends on how researchers define low-,
intermediate-, or high-risk cases. Thanks to more effective
screening of men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), about 70
percent of all such tumors are now diagnosed when they are still
confined to the walnut-sized prostate gland. That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   However, the absence of malignancy outside the gland is only one
measure of risk. By another yardstick _ a measure of tumor
aggressiveness called a Gleason score _ about 87 percent of
prostate tumors are considered intermediate- or high-risk at the
time of diagnosis, said Dr. William Catalona of Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, an authority on
prostate cancer staging.
</P>
<P>
   By this index, some surgeons say the study by D'Amico and his
colleagues suggests that most of the 200,000 prostate cancer cases
diagnosed this year would best be treated with surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study is a warning to men that if they have an
intermediate- or high-grade cancer and they opt for seed implants,
they're choosing inferior treatment,'' Catalona said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico agrees in part. But he points out that many men
classified as low-risk in his study actually had Gleason scores
that Catalona would consider intermediate-risk. By this definition,
the proportion of newly diagnosed patients who might safely opt for
seed implants would be larger than the 12 percent or so that the
St. Louis surgeon considers low-risk.

HOUSE RESOLUTION CONDEMNS STATE EFFORTS TO LEGALIZE POT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a
resolution declaring its unequivocal opposition to legalizing
marijuana for medicinal use on grounds that it is dangerous and
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The 310-93 vote for the resolution _ sponsored by Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla. _ is a response to 1996 ballot initiatives
approved in Arizona and California that allow physicians to
prescribe marijuana to treat symptoms of illnesses. California's
Proposition 215 also protects people who use marijuana for medical
reasons from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Similar initiatives are expected to be on the November ballot in
Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, and possibly the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee's crime
panel, said Tuesday that state efforts to circumvent federal
anti-drug laws are ``a backdoor way of legalizing marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A tragic drug crisis is enveloping our youth,'' McCollum said,
adding that marijuana use among young people ages 12 to 17 rose 120
percent from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said ``doctors and scientists with the greatest
expertise have determined that marijuana is not a medicine.'' He
said regularly smoking pot can be dangerous for people who are
HIV-positive because it weakens the body's natural immunities and
can accelerate the onset of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians and advocacy groups contend that marijuana, when
smoked, relieves symptoms of glaucoma; helps slow the wasting
condition associated with AIDS; relieves nausea and vomiting of
cancer patients; improves appetites in patients too sick to eat;
and eases neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, however, are divided over the medicinal value of
marijuana and are continuing to study it. The Food and Drug
Administration has rejected marijuana for medicinal use. The
National Academy of Sciences is expected to issue a report this
winter on whether marijuana should be used as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., a cancer survivor, told the
House he supported McCollum's measure. Solomon said ``marijuana is
a dangerous and addictive drug that should not be legalized for
medical use or any other use.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the resolution is nonbinding, it serves only as a
recommendation and does not have the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, urged
support for the resolution in a letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley,
R-Iowa, the Senate sponsor. A vote is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalizing marijuana as medicine sends a confusing message to
America's children,'' McCaffrey wrote. He added that ``designating
medicine through ballot initiatives'' would undermine the federal
process for assessing the safety of medicines before they enter the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the resolution says to
states allowing the medical use of marijuana: ``Naughty, naughty,
how dare you differ with us. ... Let a state diverge and they
deserve to be spanked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said the resolution was a slap
at his state. He said supporters of the measure ``think we should
just say no to sick and dying patients because it looks like we're
getting tough on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said physicians should determine
whether marijuana can relieve a patient's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Should we ``entrust it to the medical community or to turn to
Dr. Newt,'' Doggett said, referring the House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. ``For this Congress to mingle politics into
medicine is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum's bill also calls on the attorney general, 90 days from
enactment of the resolution, to report to Congress the quantity of
marijuana seized in the United States from 1992 to 1997 and the
number of arrests and prosecutions for federal marijuana offenses
during those years.

</P>
<P>
   Renee Emry of Ann Arbor, Mich., appeared in McCollum's office
Tuesday with members of the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington
advocacy group, to protest the resolution. Emry, 38, has multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three lighted a marijuana cigarette in front of
McCollum's receptionists and held up a sign saying: ``I use
marijuana for multiple sclerosis.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCollum's aides slipped into a back room to call the police,
Emry explained she was willing to be arrested so that other
patients who benefit from medicinal marijuana won't be.
</P>
<P>
   Emry said regular marijuana use has eased her pain and enabled
her to walk with a cane 19 years after her diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else I am supposed to do except take care of
myself,'' Emry said. ``What am I supposed to do, become a
criminal?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, Emry was arrested and taken away in a
wheelchair.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO MEET THE PRESS WEDNESDAY FOR FIRST TIME SINCE STARR
REPORT
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton meets the press on Wednesday for
the first time since the release of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's graphic report on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At his side will be ailing Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel, here for a one day meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are expected to focus their talks on contingency
plans for possible NATO military action in the strife-ridden Serb
province of Kosovo and other Balkan security matters, as well as
Havel's personal contribution to democracy and freedom in the heart
of Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has scheduled the press conference his first since his
summit two weeks ago in Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
at an auditorium in the State Department, where it is likely to be
attended by scores of diplomats and foreign affairs writers, in
addition to the White House press corps.
</P>
<P>
   That lofty environment, however, is no guarantee that Clinton
won't be peppered with questions stemming from the Lewinsky
scandal. The issue has dogged the president in every extended press
encounter he's ventured into since allegations first surfaced in
January that he had an affair with the former White House intern
and then urged her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first denied then later admitted to the affair, although
he still denies having coached her to mislead investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to limit the quantity, if not the scope, of questioning,
presidential spokesman Michael McCurry said that White House
reporters should expect to be able to ask a total of only three or
four questions, with Czech reporters being allotted an equal
number.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who is in declining health, is trying to guide his
country's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or
NATO, along with two other Central European countries, Poland and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also certain to praise Havel's efforts, often
described as heroic, to champion human rights and replace a
generation of authoritarian rule with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been an extraordinary voice for freedom and for the
rights of human beings,'' McCurry said, ``and he obviously remains,
I think, a very influential, important spokesman for political
tolerance, civility, and justice in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met on Tuesday with Defense Secretary William Cohen,
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, and two
dozen other high ranking military and security officials, to talk
about the state of the country's military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Of immediate concern is pending congressional action on a White
House request for emergency supplemental funding of $1.9 billion to
pay for U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia through the end of next year.
The request is pending before an appropriations conference
committee, made up of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the Pentagon is concerned that a combination of
budget cuts and downsizing in an era of growing non-combat demands
upon the military in places like Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Latin
America, may be reducing the country's overall war-fighting
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and the top officers from each of the armed services are
scheduled to testify on the subject Sept. 29 before the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forward-deployed and first-to-fight units are highly
ready, and our overall force is fully capable of carrying out our
national military strategy,'' Clinton said in remarks opening the
meeting. ``But I'm determined that we don't relax our vigilance to
keep our forces ready to protect our security today and well into
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the military remains capable of fighting, and
winning, two regional wars fought ''nearly simultaneously,'' said
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a hollow force, it's a very capable force,'' said
Crowley, but ''the long-term trends are something that we're
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute meeting at the National Defense University at Ft.
McNair in Washington, Clinton listened to his top military chiefs
as they discussed issues ranging from the pace of overseas
deployments to the gap between civilian and military pay levels.
</P>
<P>
   In one potentially disturbing trend, the Air Force and Navy have
become concerned that they are losing highly trained pilots in the
prime of their career to higher-paying positions in the private
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''They continue to leave in significant numbers, so that the
services are forced to replace a 10- or 15-year captain or major
with a brand new first lieutenant,'' said Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Non-combat operations, such as peacekeeping and humanitarian aid
missions, can eat into troops' combat training, said Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have your troops deployed to places like Bosnia,''
Crowley said, ''that does cut back on training time.''

THE OVERZEALOUS MAR IDYLLIC TRIPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was visiting some time ago with a fellow travel journalist
whose main expertise is the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is your favorite island?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica,'' she replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed mild surprise at her answer. ``Don't you find some
people there a tad aggressive toward tourists?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they don't bother me,'' she said. ``I only go to the
all-inclusive resorts and never leave until it's time to fly
home.''
</P>
<P>
   How sad. Nothing against Sandals or Breezes or Couples or
Hedonism II. (Dare I admit that many, many years ago I spent a week
at Hedonism I?) These and other properties offer self-contained
products enjoyed by many Houstonians. But if the sole purpose of
our travels is to be chained figuratively to one resort, with no
desire to explore beyond, why go all the way to Jamaica?
</P>
<P>
   And yet that's the way an increasing number of travelers look at
a country whose beauty and charm, so ripe for exploration, are too
often hidden beneath the misguided actions of a few unruly
residents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AGGRESSIVE VENDORS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaican Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to the island last year said they were harassed during
their stays. Of that number, 60 percent said they had been asked to
buy drugs. Others complained about overtures from prostitutes.
Thirteen percent said the incidents spoiled their trip.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I paused for a few hours at Montego Bay, we were
besieged by dozens of hawkers grabbing our arms, pushing and all
but demanding that we invest our money in trinkets, hair-braiding
or marijuana. And this was within 100 feet of a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Because many other passengers complained about similar
treatment, only one ship is making weekly calls in Montego Bay
during this summer off-season, down from three last year. Overall
tourism isn't approaching the growth rate of most other Caribbean
islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government, keenly aware of the economic impact
created by almost 2 million annual visitors, announced new, stiffer
penalties earlier this year for residents who bother tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Cox News Service reporter Shelly Emling, the
island's Chamber of Commerce is proposing a more controversial
solution: legalized brothels and designated red-light districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' Emling
quotes Chamber president Howard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LASTING FIRST IMPRESSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on my forays into the Caribbean the past few years, I fear
Jamaica may not be the only island that needs to take a long look
at itself. And I say that with great regret, because I have long
been enthralled by the region's beaches, its natural wonders, its
shopping and cuisine, and especially its people.
</P>
<P>
   I looked forward for some time to visiting St. Lucia, an island
highly recommended by friends. And I suspect that if I spent a week
there, I would be impressed. But with scant hours to spare on a
rainy afternoon this summer in Castries, St. Lucia's main cruise
port, I could barely take a step without being accosted. If I
didn't slip my hand into my pocket to procure a coin or two, I was
verbally harassed about my skinflint nature, my ancestry or _ yes,
the truth can hurt _ my weight.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the kind of first impression proud tourism officials
would prefer. And a port city often provides the initial impression
for visitors to any island.
</P>
<P>
   I've had similar experiences recently on St. Thomas in the U.S.
Virgin Islands and in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Let me stress these points:
</P>
<P>
   One: Most Caribbean islands don't tolerate rude heckling and
physical harassment. On Aruba, Anguilla and in the Cayman Islands,
I've found residents almost unfailingly polite. The reality,
though, is that many travelers categorize widely diverse islands _
despite their different languages, heritages and cultures _ into
one huge entity: the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Two: I am not by nature an intolerant person. Nor am I easily
bothered. I understand and appreciate that people on these islands
_ and in much of our world _ are much less fortunate than I am. I
understand the motivation for their actions. I understand that the
money tourists spend for hair-braiding and trinkets and, sadly, for
drugs and sex helps islanders feed their children and put clothes
on their back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware, too, that many travel agents and tour companies and
Caribbean tourism representatives likely will object to my
addressing this subject _ theorizing that my words could cost them
money through lost business.
</P>
<P>
   But my strong feeling is that the islands of the Caribbean are
so beautiful, so special, that those encouraged to clean up their
act will attract more visitors. Bring more money to the tourist
industry. And ultimately feed and clothe more children. Instead of
establishing red-light districts, the real solution _ as in most
walks of life _ is education.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, as reporter Emling quotes Jamaican prime minister
P.J. Patterson: Persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose
that lays the golden egg.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Much of political Washington, especially the elders
who have lived through all this once before, was searching Tuesday
for a way out of the crisis into which President Clinton has
plunged the nation's political system. But everywhere they looked,
they saw a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that a
majority of Americans _ 54 per cent _ think now that the whole
matter should be dropped, few in Washington agree. On this broad
question, there is a gap between the Beltway and the hinterland. A
surpising number of people serving in and strongly sympathetic
towards the Clinton administration agree with a White House aide
who said Tuesday, ``The president won't get out of this without
being punished, and in terms of clearing the political air, I'm not
sure he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Many influential figures inside government, like Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and
former White House Lloyd Cutler, a Democrat, are looking for a
middle way out, possibly through a censure motion. But they and
others are working separately, not in harness, and thus far no
consensus has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, who took part in a strategy session with presidential
aides at the White House on Tuesday, proposed this week that the
president be censured for those things that he has admitted, such
as conducting a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky and trying to
conceal it, in the hope that impeachment proceedings, as he put it,
``would wither away over a period of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a long, drawn-out fight, which he said would
paralyze the government for months, might be avoided by following
the precedent set in the reprimand issued to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich after a 1997 ethics investigation. Cutler said the
parallels between the cases were ``close and recent,'' but others
disagree, and more might do so if perjury is demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has said he opposes a
reprimand or censure, at least for now, and other important members
of Congress, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said they doubted
whether that would be sufficient punishment. No one, in fact, knows
what effect censuring a president would have. The only president
ever censured was Andrew Jackson, in 1834, and that censure was
voided three years later.
</P>
<P>
   A total of nine senators and 22 House members have been
censured. Sen. Joseph McCarthy's career was effectively ended by
his censure in 1954. Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts and Daniel
Crane of Illinois, censured in 1983 in separate cases of sexual
misconduct, met different fates; Crane was defeated in the 1984
election but Studds was re-elected several times.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich appears to have survived his reprimand, a less severe
sanction, in fairly good shape; indeed, he is taken seriously as a
presidential hopeful by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   What about censure plus a financial penalty? A former attorney
general suggested to a group of associates this week that perhaps
Clinton could be forced to pay for the cost of the long inquiry by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as Gingrich was obliged to pay
for the House investigation of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them, elders all, said that would be either
insufficient or inappropriate or both.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the censure formula, it is hard to believe that it
could be sold soon to a Congress already deeply divided along
partisan lines. At a minimum, it appears likely that the House will
insist on authorizing a preliminary inquiry by the Judiciary
Committee into impeachment before Congress takes a break for the
mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   Few House members of either party would be eager, as things now
stand, to go on the record with the election imminent as opposing a
careful examination of Starr's charges and the White House replies.
</P>
<P>
   Once that has begun, many people who lived through Watergate
believe, it will not be easy to stop it unless the president can
demolish Starr's charges _ demolish them in political as well as
legal terms, without relying heavily on what senators of both
parties have denounced as ludicrous, ``hair-splitting''
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing,'' a Cabinet member said recently, ``is to keep
the first gavel from falling. After that happens, you'll never stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it would appear, much will depend on whether the
president committed perjury in his testimony to Starr's grand jury
or not. Starr's report says he did; the president and his defenders
have taken refuge in the spongy recesses of legal language, arguing
that he did not so much lie as mislead or fail to provide a
complete account of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he committed perjury, and Starr demonstrates convincingly
that he did, he will have a hard time surviving,'' a former White
House official said. ``He's not only an officer of the court as a
lawyer, he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer, and you
can't let a man in that position lie with impunity to a grand jury.
If he can do it, why can't the little guy do it?''
</P>
<P>
   On this narrower but potentially decisive issue, the American
people seem much closer to Washington. Notwithstanding their
approval of Clinton's performance as president, notwithstanding
their preference for dropping the whole matter, they take a harsh
view of lying under oath. If the president did so, or encouraged
Ms. Lewinsky to do so, 30 percent of the public said he should
resign and 19 percent said impeachment proceedings should start.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of members of Congress appear unwilling
even to contemplate settling for censure or some other solution
short of impeachment until it is clear whether or not the president
actually perjured himself. But because the president has not been
indicted for perjury, and probably will not be, the only vehicle
that exists for determining whether he committed that felony is the
impeachment process. That is one of the most formidable obstacles
facing the advocates of compromise at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that Congress will return to Washington after
the election, for a lame-duck session that would permit the
Judiciary Committee to make its formal recommendation to the House
as a whole before Christmas. After that has happened, the moment
might be more ripe for negotiations about a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., who played a key role
in the Watergate investigation, said his ``best guess'' was that
the House would vote to recommend impeachment to the Senate, and
that the Senate would then vote to acquit or take no vote.
</P>
<P>
   Through this entire messy process, which might well involve
calling Ms. Lewinsky to testify, the pressure on Clinton to resign
would probably increase. He will resist, and many, like Baker,
think another resignation following Richard M. Nixon's would set a
bad precedent, moving the country away from a system of separation
of powers toward a parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
   But several newspapers have already called on Clinton to step
aside, and the influential Washington Post columnist David Broder
of came close to doing so Tuesday. Such appeals will increase if
the backup material to the Starr report, still unreleased, hardens
the case against the president.

   The house of Usher
</P>
<P>
   By Sonia Murray
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998n Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It's an unlikely setting for the eye of a celebrity
storm: a converted two-car garage in Lilburn. Inside, hundreds of
letters professing passionate love for R&AMP;B vocalist Usher Raymond
are being opened in rather mechanical fashion. After all, at least
300 come every week. This is routine.
</P>
<P>
   Two desks away, another employee is adding another address to
the 16,000-plus already in the database, most of them belonging to
young women who have written. They usually ask the same question:
``Do you have a girlfriend?'' Then again, there is the stripper who
has sent pictures of what others pay to see. And judging from what
she's written, she doesn't seem to care whether the single Raymond,
19, has a significant other.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this serene atmosphere is a rather casual
Jonetta Patton, Usher's mother and manager, surveying the territory
in jeans and tennis shoes _ a look that fits the scene, if not
Usher's ultra-busy show business career.
</P>
<P>
   After a barely noticed solo bow in 1994, Patton's older son
returned last September with an album that has sold more than 4
million copies, ``My Way'' (LaFace Records). His appeal to teenage
girls and his considerable acting ability have landed him recurring
roles on TV's ``Moesha'' and ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' He's
been cast in three upcoming movies _ ``The Faculty,'' ``She's All
That'' and ``Light It Up,'' the last with Babyface. And it's been
reported that he just signed a $1 million publishing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the guy who's finishing his third concert tour in the past
year still receives all his business proposals at this modest,
two-story home nestled in the cul-de-sac of an unassuming Gwinnett
County subdivision. Patton, 41, is determined to keep the business
in her converted garage from interfering with the environment she
wants her two sons to come home to. There's one other reason for
all the low-key placidity: ``God blessed us with a fall at the
start of Usher's career,'' explains Patton, who moved to Atlanta
from Raymond's native Chattanooga nine years ago. ``And we've
handled things differently ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hit the ground running, we might be all frantic, caught
up in the success right now,'' continues the divorced Patton, a
former office manager for Southern Message Center who is also
raising a 14-year-old son, James, as she and Usher develop a label
(Us Records) and a possible dance show for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the ugly side of success first,'' she says. ``We saw
people give up on us because we didn't have a hit in the beginning.
We saw how people who only had one little hit couldn't speak. We
saw how people can get all caught up in this business, the hype. So
there's none of that mess here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why Usher doesn't seem arrogant. Sure, the
singer set to be on Elton John's ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of
Aida'' soundtrack may have bought a Lincoln Navigator on a whim.
Yes, according to the current cover story in Teen People, he's
taken I-85 at 115 mph in his black Porsche Boxster.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he is one of the most mannerable, together `big stars'
I've ever met, of any age,'' says Keith Clinkscales, president of
Vibe magazine, which featured Raymond on the cover of a summer
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see how the women come on to him,'' adds fellow Atlanta teen
star Monica. ``He could be really out there if he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But nawww, you know, I'm just a young man out here trying to
have some fun,'' says Raymond, who discovered a love for singing
when he was 9. ``I've waited a long time for this. So I'm just
trying to take it nice and slow and appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   And such is the pace at his home. Mail is opened. Addresses are
compiled. Autographed pictures are sent to fan club members. And
the personal gifts Raymond receives _ lots of crosses _ are stored
for him to see in those rare moments he actually comes home to his
family, his room and his pit bulls, Star and My King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets kind of exciting around here when Usher's headed
home,'' claims 21-year-old product manager Denita Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we stop for a few minutes ...''

 &HT;    He's a sleuth with a medical satchel
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. -- It's 7:30 p.m. in the city morgue, and James C.
Metts Jr. interrupts a cacophony of graveyard banter to don a
rubber glove and briefly halt the autopsy of Savannah's latest
murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   Metts, 67, pokes his index finger into a small, round wound,
feeling for evidence of singed skin or powder burns that might
offer clues as to whether the young man had been shot from
point-blank range. Then he orders tests on the victim's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else would have thought of that,'' marvels homicide
detective Kenneth Griffin, 36, feverishly taking notes. ``Dr. Metts
knows his stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is ``the last chance he'll get for justice,'' says
Metts, elected Chatham County corner without opposition for the
past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Metts is not only a respected sleuth, but a character _
literally _ straight out of the best seller ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil,'' which put this city of 140,000 on the
map worldwide. He fits the stereotype of a Southern gentleman,
right down to his syrupy drawl and light summer suits. He's known
simply as ``Dr. Jimmy'' to friends and hundreds of patients, many
of whom went to his dad, Dr. James Metts Sr., until his death at
84.
</P>
<P>
   He lives on Forsyth Park, the jewel of the city's squares, in a
six-bedroom mansion that was once a funeral home. Passers-by gawk
at its curving two-story portico supported by eight Corinthian
columns, surrounded by towering oaks draped with Spanish moss. They
don't know that when Metts bought the house, it still had embalming
equipment in the basement and caskets in one of its many parlors.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself a detective, reading scores of EKGs daily,
working 12- to 16-hour days and seeing hundreds of patients,
carefully listening for any clues that might help him figure out
how to make them feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what doctoring is,'' he says, stroking a patient on the
knee and offering a few comforting words. ``It's a detective story,
a mystery. You have to look for clues, and if you miss just one,
you could miss the diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's the same with murders, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   It's this same love of mysteries that's kept him going as county
coroner, a job that paid $9,000 annually until this year, when he
got a raise to $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a civic booster, history buff and old-line Savannahian who's
proud of his roots and city, Metts is excited about solving what he
sees as perhaps the most challenging mystery of his career.
</P>
<P>
   It involves Count Casimir Pulaski, a Revolutionary War hero from
Poland who was mortally wounded in the Battle of Savannah on Oct.
9, 1779. According to history, the count was buried at nearby
Greenwich Plantation, where the British, who'd placed a bounty on
his head, wouldn't be likely to find him. (Another story contends
the count was buried at sea, but that version doesn't float with
many historians.)
</P>
<P>
   The remains were dug up by admirers in 1852 and reinterred in
1854 in a monument in Monterey Square downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Metts got involved, he says, because ``somebody had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is history involved, but money. By 1996, the 55-foot
monument was falling apart, shedding large chunks of granite and
marble. It had to come down, and the city asked Metts to look for
Pulaski's remains and head up an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The remains are now in a locked vault at a Georgia Bureau of
Investigation crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sure this is him,'' Metts says, holding the skull in his
hands. ``But we've got to be even more sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because if the city can prove without a doubt the bones are
Pulaski's, the federal government will kick in funds to help offset
cost overruns involved in putting the monument back up. The
original estimate was $195,400, but that's swollen to $777,000, and
the city doesn't have that kind of money to spend on one monument
when so many need major repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need federal help,'' Metts says, his light blue eyes
sparkling. ``And I think we can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Metts, chairman of the city's Pulaski Committee, leads a
delegation Saturday to Poland to dig up proof. It includes his
sidekick, Charles Powell, who runs a blood pressure clinic;
forensic anthropologist Karen Burns of the University of North
Carolina; genealogist Joan Porter of Florida; and a few
Polish-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Porter and Burns flew to Poland in May for preliminary spadework
and soon found a Pulaski relative, Teressa Witkowska, a
great-grandniece who died in 1861. Burns and Polish authorities,
with Metts in charge, will dig up her grave, take what's left of
the body to a nearby university and extract DNA from teeth or
perhaps bones. If successful, that DNA will be matched with DNA
taken from the Savannah bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just like Jim,'' says Dr. Preston Russell, 57, a
pathologist and amateur historian who's known Metts for 20 years.
``This Pulaski project is right up his alley; he does like to
figure things out. And he's not going to get a dime for it.'' So
what drives him?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life,'' he says. ``I like being busy.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kathy, 47, adds, ``He only knows one speed: full
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's philanthropy, a zeal to help his community, his
city, in part to honor his physician father, who practiced medicine
until he died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine fascinates him, and he's bored when he doesn't have
some mystery to solve,'' Powell says. ``He has a knack for just
zeroing in on things that other physicians miss a lot of the time.
It's a drive to do good, to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   He's paid a price for such zeal.
</P>
<P>
   County Commission Chairman Billy Hair says Metts has lost money
as coroner for 30 years because he's paid for his own secretary and
used his own office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he is performing a public service, and we're sure
glad he does this,'' Hair says. ``He just enjoys getting to the
truth and doing a service for taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Floyd Adams terms Metts ``a great humanitarian. He has a
respect for history. He could have thrown in the towel and sat back
and enjoyed life, but he's continuing to serve a need.''
</P>
<P>
   `I would have shot him'
</P>
<P>
   A ride across town in Metts' white Lincoln Town Car means
constant interruptions from his beeper, which he answers
immediately on a cell phone. At least three calls daily are for
coroner duties, and dozens come from patients he sees at St.
Joseph's/
</P>
<P>
   Candler Hospital; Memorial Medical Center, which his father
founded; a nursing home; and the Community Cardiovascular Council,
which Metts founded 29 years ago to help reduce what then was
Savannah's second-worst-in-the-nation stroke rate. He scurries from
hallway to hallway, hospital to hospital, sitting only to read
stacks of EKG charts, for which he receives $3 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to love it,'' he says. ``There's no other reason to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What else drives him?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a detective at heart, a person who wants to
solve puzzles and mysteries, to get to the bottom of things,''
Metts says. ``An EKG can tell you whether a person can handle
surgery. And you have to listen to what people say very carefully
for any hint of a clue. All the vital signs on charts are clues,
too. There are so many things.''
</P>
<P>
   If Metts has detractors, they are hard to find, and Savannah
tradition prevents any from speaking out. Take Spencer Lawton, 55,
who's been district attorney of Chatham County for 18 years and
clashed with Metts during the four trials of Jim Williams, the
chief character in what's known here as ``the Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton pushed for premeditated murder, while Metts said openly
he felt it was a case of justifiable homicide. So Lawton turns away
questions about Metts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this
matter,'' he says. ``It's outside my purview. And there is a
certain code of civility that attaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 53, director of the Community Cardiovascular Council,
sees Metts as both a father figure and best friend who continually
amazes him. He's amazed ``he's got so much energy,'' even enough to
hunt and scuba dive. Powell says Metts sees dozens of patients for
free and donates much of his salary from the cardiovascular clinic
back to the blood pressure monitoring organization.
</P>
<P>
   Though he seldom gets home before 7 p.m., after rising at 5
a.m., he's often called in the dead of the night, as he was in the
case of Williams, whokilled his lover Danny Hansford, but
eventually went free.
</P>
<P>
   Metts, who ordered that autopsy, too, examined the crime scene
and concluded that Williams ``moved things around'' in a panic, but
that Hansford got what was coming to him after pitching a ``fit''
and putting out a cigarette on a $120,000 desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was justifiable,'' he says. ``I would have shot him, too.''

 &HT;    Wallace had a knack for colorful living
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Alabama Gov. George Wallace wasn't exactly a
stainless knight most of his life. He did some shocking and shabby
things before, disabled and in pain, he took another hold on life.
But I read of his death with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   So much of life in the South has been contending with
demagogues, and, even as you deplored their actions and attitudes,
you valued them for their colorful ways.
</P>
<P>
   When George Wallace could not succeed himself as governor, he
ran in his place his wife, Lurleen, a modest, insecure woman. I
went to Montgomery to cover Lurleen's inauguration, and although
the festivities were geared to make her happy to ascend to the
office, I don't think she was.
</P>
<P>
   George was. He smiled and made jokes and was as set up by the
music and speeches as if he himself were taking office _ and the
word from Montgomery was that he continued to run the state, even
if it was her administration. She died of cancer before finishing
her term.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the inauguration, Wallace got defensive because
one of floats in the inaugural parade carried a sign referring to
an old song, ``I Found a Million Dollar Baby in the Five and Ten
Cent Store.''
</P>
<P>
   What of it? he demanded. Sure, Lurleen worked in a dime store,
but it was respectable and the little pay was needed in her family.
We agreed and tapped our feet in time to the tune.
</P>
<P>
   After Lurleen died, the governor married Cornelia Snively, the
beautiful niece of another colorful governor, ``Kissin' Jim''
Folsom. About that time, Wallace addressed a joint session of the
Georgia General Assembly, delineating some of his plans to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jimmy Carter, who introduced him, made mention of Cornelia,
adding that he himself and Alabama's governor had ``the two
prettiest wives in the Southern Governors' Conference.'' Different
types, but I'm sure it was true.
</P>
<P>
   During his run for president, Wallace was campaigning in Laurel,
Md., when a crazy young man with a gun decided to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bremer simply wanted a victim prominent enough to get him
headlines. He thought of President Nixon; he once had in mind
Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a cleanliness freak, and on both occasions when he
might have shot one of them, he had to go brush his teeth, he told
the jury at his trial. So almost by accident he opened fire on
George Wallace, killing an innocent bystander and also wounding a
state trooper. Cornelia was by Wallace's side, and as he fell, she
flung herself protectively over his body.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were divorced, and the governor married for a third
time, a still younger woman who was a country music singer. He
switched from being a segregationist to declaring segregation wrong
and openly courting black voters. He was doing remarkably well in
his race for president, but ultimately withdrew in favor of Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   I liked this fellow Alabamian, although I didn't approve of him.
But with politicians, you seldom can approve. You have to like
something in the personality of the man, the humor, the
flamboyance, the color and excitement they bring to what would
usually be a routine news assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't another Jim Folsom, who was funny and outrageous but
surprisingly liberal. He wasn't like our own Marvin Griffin, who
enlivened Georgia politics for a couple of decades. But he was a
uniquely interesting man, and his death saddens me.

 &HT;    O'Brien gets a shotmat prime-time viewers
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our fifth anniversary special,'' Conan O'Brien muses early in
tonight's prime-time retrospective (10 o'clock on NBC (62177)).
``Who woulda thunk it?''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago? Nobody. Not even NBC, which hired the
then-nobody to replace CBS-bound David Letterman at 12:35 a.m. When
O'Brien's initial six-month contract expired, NBC signed him up
like a rented band instrument, month by month. Garry Shandling,
Greg Kinnear, Jon Stewart _ if you weren't rumored to be O'Brien's
replacement back then, you were nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is this the fifth anniversary for the show,'' O'Brien
acknowledges tonight. ``It's the fifth anniversary of the `I can't
believe that guy has a show' club.''
</P>
<P>
   Then sometime between years two and three, while almost nobody
was watching (an infomercial out-rated him in Detroit), a funny
thing happened to O'Brien's show: It got funny _ in the sly,
offbeat, uneven way Letterman used to be funny. The best comedy of
the year in 1996, at any hour, was O'Brien's third-anniversary
show.
</P>
<P>
   But even that special aired in the talk show's usual late, late
time slot. Now O'Brien has a five-year contract and a prime-time
venue (the show was taped in the roomier ``Saturday Night Live''
studio) where most viewers can see the funniest man on TV that
they've probably never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decent introduction, though not the breakthrough hour his
earlier anniversary was. You do notice right away that O'Brien is
the only late-night talk show host who looks like he actually likes
what he's doing. There's no manic-depressive desperation
(Letterman), no signs of ``sell out'' tattooed all over him (Jay
Leno).
</P>
<P>
   It's just skinny, carrot-topped Conan, dough-boy sidekick Andy
Richter and bandleader Max Weinberg, all performing their unartful
shticks: Andy playing quarters with Ed McMahon; Conan interviewing
President Clinton ``Clutch Cargo'' style; a herd of goats brought
on stage to imitate the laugh of guest Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   Guest appearances are made tonight by Adam Sandler, Tony Randall
(the show's very first guest) and Tom Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   But too many bits are repeated from the earlier special, and
while you might not have seen them then, the hour still feels more
warmed over than spontaneous. Conan has a hard time being shocking
anymore _ one sign of how far he's come.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   The price tag rises
</P>
<P>
   TBS will ultimately pay about $180 million for the rights to air
``Seinfeld'' starting in fall 2002. Early reports placed the
purchase at more than $100 million or roughly more than $600,000
apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes. And more it is. Indications
are now that TBS will fork over about $1 million per episode. That
would also bump the total ``Seinfeld'' rerun gross to more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sex in the workplace
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Fortune'' (10 o'clock (533142))
places the Clinton controversy in a different light. What if
Clinton were the head of a company rather than the head of the
country? The show will explore the processes corporations use to
reprimand or terminate employees.
</P>
<P>
   Football beats Emmys
</P>
<P>
   How many people watched Sunday's 50th annual Emmy Awards? Well,
not as many as sat in front of ``Monday Night Football.'' About
19.4 million viewers saw the Emmy contest, which finished as the
No. 2 show in the latest Nielsen weekly ratings. About 22.1 million
viewers watched the NFL game between the New England Patriots and
the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' TV-MA-rated airing of ``GoodFellas,'' which ran opposite
NBC's Emmy telecast, finished No. 9 for the week with 12.9 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Half a Top 10 list
</P>
<P>
   Here's a recent David Letterman Top 10 with a few items worth
reading: ``Signs You're About to Be Impeached.'' No. 10 _ When you
call to congratulate Mark McGwire, he lets his machine get it. No.
9 _ Your press secretary keeps introducing you as ``President
William Milhous Clinton.'' No. 7 _ Tipper Gore's in your office
measuring it for drapes. No. 4 _ You walk into the Capitol
commissary and 500 people simultaneously say, ``Shhh! He's here!''
And No. 1 _ Your new Secret Service code name: ``Roadkill.''

COMMENTARY: THE WIZARD OF IS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The quintessential Bill Clinton moment can be found
in footnote 109 of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked before the Starr grand jury about Robert
Bennett's assertion during the deposition for the Paula Jones case
that ``there is absolutely no sex of any kind'' between the
president and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was right, Clinton said, because he was using the
present tense. ``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is'
is,'' the president explained helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   The same footnote offers three other Clintonian gems before the
grand jury: ``I have not had sex with her as I defined it.'' ``It
depends on how you define alone.'' And, ``There were a lot of times
when we were alone, but I never really thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's double-talk had a contagious effect on Betty Currie.
``I don't want the impression of sneaking,'' the secretary said,
about Monica, ``but it's just that I brought her in without anyone
seeing her.'' And, ``The president, for all intents and purposes,
is never alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's greatest sin is not sex or dissembling about sex, as
the heavy-breathing Kenneth Starr believes. His greatest sin is
swindling and perverting the American language. He is like the
cursed girl in the fairy tale: Every time he opens his mouth, a
toad jumps out.
</P>
<P>
   His problems stem from his instinct, when he runs into trouble,
to shroud rather than illuminate.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to make words subjective, insisting they mean only what
he wants them to. Just as he made the Democratic Party about
himself, and the Democratic Conventions about himself, and the
presidency about himself, he tries to make the language about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't. Laws are composed of words. The president is in
charge of our laws. When he drains meaning from words, he
jeopardizes his ability to govern. He has made Washington
Orwellian. His corrupt language corrupts thought.
</P>
<P>
   In order to escape the noose, the president is admitting and
denying at the same time, and forcing his lawyers and aides to go
out and behave like crazy contortionists.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats are ashamed of the chuckle-headed
``hairsplitting,'' as Tom Daschle calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The president admits trying to mislead Paula Jones' lawyers, but
denies lying under oath. He admits Monica had sex with him, but
denies he had sex with Monica. He denies that oral sex (the second
word of which is sex) is sex. The president, David Kendall says,
committed ``interpretations of contorted definitions,'' not
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Once I went to Elizabeth Arden and they tried to sell me some
soap. I told them that soap dried out my skin. ``But,'' said the
saleswoman, ``this is the soap that isn't a soap.'' I bought it. It
dried out my skin.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine once picked up a purse at a counter in Saks and
observed that it felt like plastic. ``No,'' the saleswomen told her
contemptuously, ``it's Plastique.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton world is full of soap that isn't soap and plastic
that isn't plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great enemy of clear language is insincerity,'' George
Orwell wrote in a famous essay on politics and language.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters are upset that he did not give his
groveling prayer breakfast speech 25 days earlier, on the night he
made his defiant television address.
</P>
<P>
   But the petulant and angry TV address was the authentic Clinton
moment. The repentant and lip-biting prayer breakfast speech was
the contrived Clinton moment.
</P>
<P>
   We no longer expect this president to be sincere. We just expect
him to fake better, fake sooner.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the president should be pushed from office. For
his transgressions, he should have to perform 28 months of
community service. He can join his National Service corps. Let him
put aside his risky and challenging sex life and take up a risky
and challenging public life. Let him cash in on his popularity, and
do something wonderful for the country in return for all the slop
he's put us through. As Rhett Butler said, ``If you have enough
courage you don't need a reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he wants to move past ``the adversity of the moment,'' as
he so delicately calls it, Clinton must stop ducking, and find a
way to reconnect words and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't, he'll be in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what you mean by the word ``be.''

AUTHORITIES SAY NO EVIDENCE OF BOMB FOUND IN BLAST THAT KILLED
POLICEMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A month-long investigation of an explosion that
killed Tamaulipas police commander Raul Manuel Ruiz Guerra shows
the blast was caused by a slow gas leak in his Reynosa home, the
Mexican attorney general's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators want to know what happened to the
portable safe Ruiz kept in his home, the attorney general's office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tamaulipas authorities who initially investigated the Aug. 25
explosion removed the safe. Shortly thereafter, state investigators
decided they were not the appropriate agency to continue and turned
everything, including a safe, over to the federal attorney
general's office, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But the safe the attorney general got was not the one removed
from Ruiz's home, the federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safe (found in Ruiz's home) was substituted for another,
which was given to federal authorities,'' the statement said.
``Penal action will be taken against those who are responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and his housekeeper, Valeria Roman Sanchez, died in the
explosion, which leveled the home.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate and widespread speculation in newspapers from Reynosa
to Mexico City suggested Ruiz might have been assassinated over
some kind of underworld dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt Mexican police often provide protection to border drug
smugglers, and a spokeswoman for the attorney general here conceded
that state judicial police frequently are found driving automobiles
stolen in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At least one report published after the explosion revealed that
several automobiles stolen in Texas had been recovered from
Tamaulipas state police in Reynosa and were to be returned. Reynosa
is across the border from McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation of the explosion at Ruiz's home turned up
no traces of explosives or a crater characteristic of a bomb, the
attorney general's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's death was caused by the roof caving in on top of him, and
Roman apparently touched off the accumulated gas while working in
the kitchen, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation continues into whether the gas leak was an
accident, the statement said.

 &HT;    `Date rape' drug made easier to spot
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Roofies, the Mickey Finn of the '90s, are now easier
to spy after they've been slipped into a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturer Hoffmann-La Roche has reformulated the
powerful sedative Rohypnol so it turns clear liquids blue and some
dark liquids cloudy, thereby alerting unsuspecting people.
</P>
<P>
   Roofies is a street name for Rohypnol, or flunitrazepam, which
is legal in Europe and South America but not in the United States.
However, the drug is widely available illegally in the United
States, where it's also known as roachies, circles, Mexican valium,
rib, R-2, roopies or rope.
</P>
<P>
   Rohypnol's ugliest moniker, the ``date rape'' drug, comes from
its highly publicized role in several acquaintance rapes, including
a series of videotaped sexual assaults carried out over several
years by twin brothers in Marina del Rey, Calif. George and Stefan
Spitzer were convicted in June of drugging women with Rohypnol,
which is 10 times as powerful as Valium, and raping them while they
slept.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Hoffmann-La Roche began considering altering
Rohypnol to alert the unwary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company felt horrified that anybody would misuse it, so we
tried to do what we could,'' said spokeswoman Gail Safian.
</P>
<P>
   Arming Rohypnol with a bitter taste proved impractical, as the
enormous amount of flavor additive required would have made the
pills too large to be swallowed easily or would have affected the
drug's pharmaceutical properties. Hoffmann-La Roche had to consider
the more than 1 million people worldwide who legally take Rohypnol,
which belongs to the same family of drugs as Valium, Ativan and
Halcyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult process, because the most important
thing was that we didn't want to affect the therapeutic value of
the product,'' Safian said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Hoffmann-La Roche settled on using a coloring
agent to make Rohypnol visible in liquid. The manufacturer also
added a film coating to the small tablets, which are tough to crush
into a powder, so they now take up 40 minutes to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   The dye isn't completely foolproof, however. An opaque,
milky-colored drink such as a white Russian probably would change
hue, Safian said, but the dye might not show up at all in red wine
and other very dark drinks _ or a cocktail made with blue curacao
liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann-La Roche timed release of the reformulated tablets of
Rohypnol in each of the 80 countries where it is legal to ensure
that supplies of the old version were depleted. The company
believes little, if any, of the old version remains in circulation.
Rohypnol is extremely difficult to manufacture in a home lab, so
the authentic product is preferred among illicit users, according
to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The drug primarily enters
the United States via overnight mail or delivery services from
Mexico and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency isn't satisfied. It wants to
reclassify Rohypnol, intended to treat sleep disorders, as a
Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule I
drugs are considered to have no medical purpose and a high
potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Safian and others are quick to point out that, despite the
enormous negative publicity surrounding Rohypnol, it is by no means
the only drug notorious for its use in sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem is GHB, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, an illegal drug
that causes psychedelic effects when taken recreationally but acts
as a sedative in high doses. Its nicknames say a lot: ``Grievous
Bodily Harm'' and ``Easy Lay.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a sophomore at the State University of West
Georgia unknowingly drank GHB in water and went into a coma. Holly
Harman remains in a nursing home in Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   GHB, an odorless, colorless liquid, continues to show up at
college parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a buzz similar to alcohol, without the calories,''
explains Heather Hepler Surrency, a health educator at Georgia
Tech. ``We've heard that's preferable to some women on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   GHB is arguably a bigger concern than Rohypnol, Surrency said,
because it can be easily synthesized in a home lab with readily
available materials. Recipes for GHB are published on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most pervasive factor in sexual assault is alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol is probably a part of 90 percent of all campus
rapes,'' said Gloria Varley, a health educator at the University of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1996, Hoffman-La Roche has offered free testing of
U.S. rape victims for the presence of Rohypnol in their urine. Of
1,200 tests performed, only six were positive for Rohypnol, Safian
said. But 700 samples turned up other substances, with the most
common being alcohol, the second marijuana and the third
amphetamines and cocaine. Fifty tests were positive for GHB.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is that people are doing recreational drugs
and losing control of the situation,'' Safian said. ``You can
become vulnerable that way _ far more frequently than somebody
dropping something into your drink.

U.S. APPEARS TO BE UNDECIDED ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As evidence mounts of a human catastrophe in
Kosovo, the United States is still far from a decision over whether
to use military force to put an end to the Serbian assault that has
forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, senior
Clinton administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The growing crisis in Kosovo is likely to pose an early test of
President Clinton's resolve and his ability to take decisive action
in foreign policy in the wake of the scandal surrounding his
personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is awful and getting worse,'' said a senior
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If
we don't want thousands of people to starve to death this winter,
the White House will need to make a decision very quickly on
whether to use firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Charity groups say the situation in Kosovo grows more desperate
virtually by the hour, with nearly continuous Serbian shelling of
villages populated by ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90
percent of the population of the southern Serbian province. More
than 900 people have been reported killed in the fighting this
year, most of them ethnic Albanian guerrillas and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee,
described a ``human catastrophe in the making'' after visiting
Kosovo earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them up close and in person: women and children, the
elderly living in fear without adequate food and shelter,'' he
said. ``These hungry masses will within weeks face winter and the
freezing conditions that come with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton administration officials say they are pressing the
White House to make a direct threat to Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic that the United States will use military force against
Serbian targets _ most likely, by air strikes with U.S. cruise
missiles _ if the onslaught is not halted. They said that NATO
contingency planning for the attacks was all but completed.
</P>
<P>
   Similar strikes in 1995 were credited with helping end three
years of war in neighboring Bosnia and bringing the warring parties
to the peace table.
</P>
<P>
   But other aides to the president are more cautious, fearing that
military force by the United States and its reluctant NATO partners
might only embolden Serb forces into a more violent campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday with reporters in Washington, Gen. John
Jumper, the commander of U.S. air forces in Europe, said the
situation in Kosovo was in some ways more complex than the
situation three years ago in Bosnia, and that air strikes is Kosovo
might not have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign can be done,'' he said. ``The air campaign is
just like before. It is one that is easy to put together, and it's
not difficult to execute.'' But he added: ``The solutions that we
saw work before are not necessarily the solutions that the
leadership thinks will work in this case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are also fearful that air
strikes might encourage the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebels who
are seeking independence of Kosovo from Serbia, a goal not shared
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the Kosovars' air force,'' said a senior
U.S. official. ``It's not the same dynamic as in Bosnia, because we
don't recognize Kosovo's independence. We recognize the Kosovo
region as an important part of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States contemplates military action against
Serbia, it continues to press for a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being overseen by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia, who has been shuttling between Belgrade
and Kosovo in hopes of brokering a cease-fire, so far without
success.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been forced to tangle not only with Serbian and Kosovo
leaders, but also with European leaders angered by recent public
comments in which he criticized Europe for doing too little to end
the fighting. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has described
Hill's comments as ``cynical and condescending.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials involved in policy-making in the
Balkans say they are working against a de facto deadline of
mid-October in deciding what to do next in Kosovo, since that is
when winter begins to set in.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs continue their offensive and refugees are kept from
their homes, tens of thousands of them will be at risk of freezing
to death in the forests where they have hidden, the Americans say.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate concern for the United States are reports that
Serbian forces have begun rounding up men and boys from ethnic
Albanian villages and refugee camps in Kosovo, an act that U.S.
officials fear could be the prelude to their execution, as happened
during the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``American and European leaders have pledged not to allow the
crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in
Kosovo,'' Dole said after his visit this month. ``But from what I
have seen, such crimes are already happening.''
</P>
<P>
   John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights, who accompanied Dole in Kosovo, said the U.S. delegation
had found evidence of ``horrendous human rights violations,
violations of humanitarian law and acts of punitive destruction on
a massive scale.''

TALIBAN PRESS U.N. TO EASE TENSIONS WITH IRAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Taliban movement, aware of its isolation in
the face of an Iranian military threat, asked the United Nations
again Tuesday to establish a mediation process for defusing
tensions with Tehran over the recent killings of Iranian diplomats
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's deputy representative in New York, Noorullah
Zadran, said he had presented a fourth request to the United
Nations Tuesday after three previous ones ``fell on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have indicated to the United Nations that we are ready to
sit down with the Iranians and accept the mediation of the United
Nations,'' he said. ``We are asking Kofi Annan to do it for us.''
Annan is the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Zadran said the Taliban, who do not hold Afghanistan's U.N. seat
even though they control almost all of the country, were also
asking the Islamic Conference organization to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranians have chosen the use of force,'' he said in an
interview. ``We would like to pose that question to the conscience
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say that they are willing to discuss sending
relief supplies to people in Afghanistan caught in recent fighting
_ if the safety of aid workers can be guaranteed _ but that they
were a long way from intervening to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro de Soto, assistant secretary-general for political
affairs, said Tuesday, ``There isn't any talk of negotiations, at
least with a role for us, quite yet.''
</P>
<P>
   De Soto said the Taliban could take their own measures to defuse
tensions. ``By investigating properly and dealing with the killings
that apparently have occurred, and making sure that those
unaccounted for are accounted for,'' he said, ``there are a lot of
things that can be done without actual negotiations taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Security Council condemned the killing of the
Iranian diplomats and said that the act had seriously increased
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have damaged their relations with the United Nations
in recent months by refusing to relax restrictions on women and
refusing to cooperate with U.N. representatives and private relief
organizations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said Tuesday that the
secretary-general would like to send a relief mission ``as soon as
possible'' to the Afghan city of Bamiyan, which fell to the Taliban
on Sunday. But U.N. officials say they need guarantees of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Zadran said all of the roads to Bamiyan were now open and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to give us humanitarian aid is welcome,'' he
said. He also said the United Nations, the International Committee
of the Red Cross and journalists are invited to go to recently
captured territory around Mazar-i-Sharif and Bamiyan to investigate
allegations of Taliban atrocities against the Hazara, a
predominantly Shiite Muslim ethnic group, and allegations of
atrocities against Iranians trapped in those regions. Iran had been
giving military assistance to the Hazara.
</P>
<P>
   Zadran repeated denials by the Taliban that their forces may
have killed thousands of Hazara last month in the Mazar-i-Sharif
area, where several thousand Taliban troops were slain last year
and buried in wells and mass graves. The Taliban say Iranians were
involved in those killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now have indicated that there are new mass graves, and we
would like to see them,'' Zadran said.
</P>
<P>
   No independent confirmation of the massacre report has been
possible. There has been no U.N. presence in the area for months
because of looting by the mujahedeen, the fighters who previously
held the town. The Taliban are asking the United Nations to go back
now that Mazar-i-Sharif is under their control.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are clearly unsettled by the scale of the Iranian
military threat since the Taliban's own admission that their forces
killed nine Iranians thought to be diplomats in Mazar-i-Sharif and
reports that it may be holding other Iranians who are not accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are also reported to be having problems with
Pakistan, an ally. The Pakistanis are split over support for them
and cannot always be expected to act in their interest, some
Taliban officials say. Zadran said two Pakistanis had been charged
Tuesday with the slaying of a U.N. military observer in Kabul in
August, a crime for which the Taliban were being held responsible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The public's view of President Clinton's moral character has
sunk to the lowest level of his presidency, but most Americans say
they still believe that he is a vigorous leader who should not be
impeached or forced to resign, the latest New York Times/CBS News
Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but steadily, the public's perception of Clinton's
personal image has slipped since January, when Americans first
learned of his relationship with a former White House intern. But
over time, the cumulative shift has been sharp.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the report released last week by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, seemed to have little additional
impact on these attitudes. Americans said that they dislike Starr
and suspect his motives. While only one in 20 respondents said they
had read the full report and about half had read part of it, most
people said the graphic sexual details were unnecessarily salacious
and intended to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the glare of publicity about his affair, Clinton's
job approval rating stands at 62 percent, which is impressive by
any reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by several measures, the survey showed that most people
now see Clinton as bereft of the code of ethics that they try to
live by. Sixty-six percent of Americans said Clinton did not share
their moral values, while 29 percent said he did.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the public was divided on Clinton's morals, and
after his re-election two years ago, a majority perceived Clinton
as someone who did share their ethical standards. And for the first
time since Democrats lost the House in 1994 _ and only the second
time in Clinton's six years in office _ more Americans viewed the
president unfavorably than favorably.
</P>
<P>
   While people say they want to put the scandal behind them, they
also want Clinton to be reprimanded for his conduct _ but not
impeached or forced from office. Fifty-seven percent of those
polled said Congress should vote to censure Clinton; 33 percent
were opposed to censure.
</P>
<P>
   More than six of 10 Americans said they thought the best thing
for the country was for Clinton to finish his term. In answer to
another question, 58 percent said it was not necessary for Congress
to hold impeachment hearings at all.
</P>
<P>
   The public's personal view of Clinton has diminished roughly
equally among all groups, rich and poor, urban and rural, young and
old, male and female. For example, the perception that Clinton
shares the moral values of most Americans has dropped by 10
percentage points among men and by 14 percentage points among women
_ not much of a gap.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,813 adults nationwide, conducted Saturday through
Monday, also found that the public blamed Clinton and not his
enemies for the crisis, a change from a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent blamed Clinton and 36 percent blamed his
enemies _ figures that have roughly reversed since February. More
and more, people have come to believe that Clinton probably did
encourage Monica Lewinsky to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest survey, 46 percent said he did encourage her to
lie, 18 percent said he did not and 32 percent said they did not
know. When respondents were pressed, the numbers were even more
stark; 61 percent said Clinton encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie. The
poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even against these harsh judgments, Clinton is protected by
an important bulwark that has confounded the pundits _ as well as
the president's Republican detractors _ since the scandal broke:
the measures of Clinton not as a man but as a president continue to
be strikingly strong. He is seen as an effective leader by 66
percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's job approval rating, which White House officials
have clung to as their best evidence that the scandal has not
tarnished his command of the office, stands at 62 percent. Earlier
this month it was 60 percent, and last month, immediately after he
told the nation he had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, it was 65 percent. When the scandal broke in January,
Clinton's job approval rating was 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running the country well,'' said Morley Fogel, 61, a
retired salesman and a Democrat from Tequesta, Fla. ``He's just not
running his life very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogel, a poll respondent who was re-interviewed Tuesday, added,
``He's ruined a legacy that he could have left as a president who
turned around the economy. Instead, he'll be remembered as a
philanderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another respondent, Victoria Livingston, 72, a retired teacher
in Phoenix who is registered to vote as an independent, put it this
way: ``This situation upsets me a lot. But I think he should be
allowed to finish out his term. What he's done is a personal thing.
It doesn't have anything to do with what he's doing for the
country. He's done a very good job for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that people continued to draw a sharp
distinction between the president's personal and public lives.
Fifty-eight percent said they viewed the situation more as a
private matter, while 35 percent said it was more a public matter
having to do with Clinton's job as President.
</P>
<P>
   But presidential approval ratings can plummet sharply. The last
president to serve two terms, Ronald Reagan, also enjoyed high
approval ratings in his second term. But his ratings fell 21 points
from October to November of 1986 _ to 46 percent _ amid public
concern over the Iran-Contra affair. It was the sharpest one-month
drop ever recorded in presidential approval.

 UNDATED: presidential approval. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While people were critical of what Starr included in the report,
they also disapproved of how Congress had handled the matter.
Thirty-seven percent said the House did the right thing in
releasing Starr's report, with all the graphic sexual details,
while 59 percent said the full report should not have been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those concerns about how lawmakers are handling the
crisis, Congress as an institution drew a higher approval rating
for the job it was doing than it had since the Times/CBS poll first
began asking about congressional job ratings, in 1974. Fifty-six
percent of Americans now say they approve of the way Congress is
doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Those ratings are an encouraging sign for incumbents as their
general election campaigns begin in full force. But the survey
offered few clues as to how the scandal might reverberate on
Election Day. Seventy-four percent said the scandal would have no
effect on whom they supported for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter seems to have had little effect on voters'
images of the two parties, according to a CBS News poll taken
before the Starr report was made public. More than half of the
public said they held a favorable view of the Democratic party,
roughly the same number who said they had a positive view of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In that poll, the images of the parties remained similar to what
they were in the last election. Democrats were perceived as the
party that would make better decisions on social issues like
education and health care. Republicans were seen as being tougher
on crime and better at upholding traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties were seen as offering candidates with similar
levels of honesty and integrity. But over all, the Republican Party
was considered to have higher ethical standards than the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appetite for Clinton to be censured, only 32 percent
in the latest Times/CBS News Poll said it would be better for the
country for him to resign. Asked, in another question, if it turned
out that Clinton did in fact obstruct justice, 22 percent said he
should apologize, 30 percent said he should resign, 19 percent said
he should be impeached and 26 percent said the matter should just
be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of what they think should happen, in the end, 18
percent said they expected Clinton to be impeached, 11 percent said
he would resign and 62 percent said neither would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Congress has the stomach for an impeachment
proceeding,'' said George O'Donnell, 44, a poll respondent from
Marion, Iowa. O'Donnell, an independent who is a motor vehicle
inspector, said censure was a fitting punishment. ``A censure, if
you look at it like a plea bargain or reduced charges, says, `You
lied. We know it. But we're going to let you continue your term.'
''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican respondent from Buffalo, N.Y., who identified
herself only as Marie, also distinguished between the president's
private behavior and public performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country seems to be doing very well, and I don't see that
a personal problem has anything to do with running the country,''
said Marie, 66, a retired restaurant owner. ``The stock market is
doing well. There are more jobs for people. Basically, I think the
American people are happier than they've been in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that many people are sympathetic with Clinton's
predicament, 53 percent said it would be understandable that he
would lie under oath or encourage Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath
about their sexual conduct; 41 percent said it would not be
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   As speculation swirls over how Clinton's travails will affect
Vice President Al Gore, the survey found that his favorability
rating has not been noticeably affected. Twenty-four percent have a
favorable view of Gore; 21 percent unfavorable, and most people are
undecided or do not know enough about him.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's support has been buoyed by the
revelations about her husband's infidelity. Fifty-percent of
Americans have a favorable opinion of her, and 25 percent
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   And while Speaker Newt Gingrich has sought to cast himself as a
statesman and above partisanship in dealing with the scandal, he is
still viewed more unfavorably than favorably by the public.
Twenty-four percent give him a favorable rating, 31 percent view
him unfavorably and the remainder are undecided or do not know
enough about the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's negative ratings, while reasonably consistent, are also
high. Forty-three percent of Americans said their view of him is
not favorable, 23 percent said it was favorable and the rest are
undecided or do not know. Fifty-percent said Starr's report was
mostly a one-sided look at some facts, while 35 percent said it was
fair and balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it could be politically motivated,'' said a poll
respondent, Marcelline Farris, 47, a nurse in Lenore, W. Va., who
is a Democrat. ``They've been hounding him since he's been in
office. The country needs to move on. He's human.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Republican lawmakers say it is their expectation
that the polls will shift to the point where Clinton's job approval
ratings will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything this big has got to have some impact on the polls,''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in an interview.
``But it won't be reflected for days or even weeks. The average man
and woman out there didn't spend the weekend reading the Starr
report.''

MILITARY LEADERS TELL CLINTON OF STRAINS ON ARMED FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turning his attention to military issues amid the
furor over his personal conduct, President Clinton met Tuesday with
the nation's senior generals and admirals and received warnings
that the armed forces are being stretched thin by increasing duties
and decreasing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Defense Secretary William Cohen and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton of the Army, the
uniformed chiefs of the armed services and the unified commands
laid out what amounted to a plea for more money to address the
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Those strains have manifested themselves, officials at the
Pentagon say, in everything from cuts in training to shortages of
parts for fighter jets to the gap between military and civilian
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The officers did not make specific requests to increase the
Pentagon's $270 billion budget, which Congress is finalizing for
the fiscal year that begins next month. But in a series of brief,
militarily precise presentations, they made the case that the
budget cuts and personnel reductions since the end of the Cold War
had reached a plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton told Clinton that although the Pentagon could carry out
its mission, the strength and ``readiness'' of some of the nation's
forces were ``nosing down,'' especially those that would be called
upon to reinforce front-line troops in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pull up before it turns into a nose dive,'' Shelton
said, according to a senior defense official familiar with the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting, at the National Defense University at Fort
McNair in southwest Washington, came in the middle of the political
and legal fight over Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The furor added an unusual undercurrent to the visit by Clinton,
whose relations with the military have always been strained.
</P>
<P>
   It has not escaped notice within the Pentagon that the charges
against Clinton _ having a sexual relationship with a subordinate
and lying about it _ would end the career of any officer, including
each of the men who sat around the table with Clinton on Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the president's behavior, however, nor the prospect of
impeachment hearings came up in the meeting, which officials
described as militarily direct and businesslike. The president also
did not apologize to the commanders, as he did to his Cabinet last
week and has, repeatedly, to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cohen did address the issue when asked about it at a news
conference at the Pentagon earlier Tuesday. Cohen, the lone
Republican in Clinton's administration, said that while ``everyone
is disappointed in what has taken place,'' the scandal had not had
any discernible impact on the military or Clinton's ability to
function as commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Clinton's situation differed from that of 1st Lt.
Kelly Flinn, the Air Force bomber pilot discharged after lying
about an affair and disobeying orders to stop it, Cohen replied
that the president was bound not by the Uniform Code of Military
Justice but by the electoral will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will pass their judgment on the president
in due course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton meets once or twice a year with the military commanders
to discuss national security matters around the world, but
Tuesday's meeting, conducted behind closed doors, focused almost
exclusively on readiness, the ability of the armed forces to fight
and win a war.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps have warned that their forces are being strained by
increased deployments overseas and dwindling reserves. Cohen, too,
has highlighted the issue by touring military bases, including Fort
Drum in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Being stretched thin has produced different problems in each
service. The Air Force has faced shortages of pilots and spare
parts. The Army has estimated that it needs $3 billion to $5
billion more each year to pay for things like the Bosnia
peacekeeping mission and modernization of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We borrowed from the modernization budget to pay for
training,'' a senior Army official said. ``Now we're having to
borrow money from training to pay for operating the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   In public at least, no one has questioned the Pentagon's ability
to go to war, if needed. But another senior Army officer said
recently it was not clear that the Pentagon could carry out its
stated mission to win two major regional wars at once. While
winning the first war would not be a problem, the officer said,
fighting the second would pose a ``big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has faced increasing pressure from Republicans in
Congress to increase the military budget, but with the balanced
budget agreement capping the total at $270 billion this year, he
has resisted. In the next budget, however, those caps come off.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said it was premature to
discuss whether Clinton would propose an increase in the next
budget, but at Tuesday's meeting the president told the commanders
that they should make the same point when they go before Congress
later this month for hearings on the issue.

MARKET RALLY CONTINUES FOR THIRD DAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose again Tuesday, the first time
prices have risen for three straight sessions on Wall Street in
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Extending a theme sounded in recent days, traders and analysts
said equity prices are responding to statements from policy-makers
in Washington and elsewhere that a coordinated response from
industrialized nations and lending institutions like the
International Monetary Fund to what has come to be seen as a global
economic crisis is under serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely first step to resolving the crisis, according to
traders and analysts, is a cut in short-term interest rates by the
Federal Reserve Board and other central banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think investors are encouraged that policymakers are
considering this as a global crisis rather than isolated
brushfires,'' said Christine Callies, chief investment strategist
at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since investors are concerned that falling asset prices are a
symptom of global problems, bouncing asset prices might be a sign
some of those problems are being relieved. In short, the markets
believe the monetary authorities are going to blink.''
</P>
<P>
   Although more stocks rose in value than declined, the bulk of
the gains were concentrated among blue-chip stocks that make up the
Dow Jones industrial average and high capitalization issues in the
Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow had gained 79.04 points, to 8,024.39, up
just under 1 percent on the day and the highest level so far this
month. It was the first three-day advance for the Dow since Aug. 5
through Aug. 7, and puts the blue-chip index back above 7,908.25,
where it began the year. Still, the index remains about 1,300
points, or 14 percent, below its July 17 peak of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   The smallish advance was noteworthy for another reason: it is
the first time since Sept. 4, when the Dow fell 41.97 points, that
the closely watched index has not registered a gain or a loss
exceeding 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 Index
rose 7.96 points, to 1,037.68. The Nasdaq composite index gained
12.42 points, to 1,678.11.
</P>
<P>
   Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St.
Louis, said the market ``was dull as dishwater until the last 20 to
30 minutes,'' when he said some computerized ``buy'' programs came
in to the market and traders began buying stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
are scheduled to testify Wednesday in front of the House Banking
Committee on the global economy and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the market is pricing in expectations of a cut in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unlikely Greenspan will provide clear signals
about the Fed's intentions during his testimony. Analysts said it
is just as unlikely that Rubin will use the forum as an opportunity
to jawbone the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials may well use the occasion to urge passage of
the $17.9 billion in additional funding for the IMF requested by
the Clinton administration, financing that would trigger more than
$82 billion in contributions from other member nations.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager, Tuesday urged
legislators to approve the full amount, telling Congress it can no
longer ignore the ``disintegration of the global capitalist
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of interest rate relief and a replenishment of the
IMF's financial resources helped to send equity markets in Mexico
and Brazil soaring Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian stocks, battered since mid-August when Russia
defaulted on international debts, soared more than 18 percent.
Mexican shares rose by nearly 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets were also strong, but with the exception of
London, most other European exchanges posted declines.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of a cut in interest rates and help for troubled
developing country economies helped to strengthen stocks of banks
and other financial services that have been battered by rolling
crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest gainers were Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which
climbed 3 3/16, to 56 5/16. American Express rose another 3 3/16,
to 84~. J.P. Morgan was up 2 7/16, to 94 7/16. Providian Financial
Corp. shares soared 11{, to 72 15/16 after the credit card
company's chairman said it could increase earnings by as much as 50
percent this year and next, exceeding analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers, led by Merck &AMP; Co., also posted strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, which gained more than 3 on Monday, rose another 3{
Tuesday, to 135{. Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. rose 1[, to 77 5/16. And Bristol
Myers Squibb was up 1[, to 106.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors continued to punish companies with
deteriorating growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co., which relies on foreign sales for about 75
percent of its profits, fell 2[ Tuesday to 61 3/16 after Lehman
Brothers analyst Michael Branca cut his 1999 earnings estimate
because of slowing sales in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Branca also cut his 1999 earnings forecast for Pepsico Inc.
Pepsi lost 1 5/16, to 30.

MEXICAN POLICE AGENTS SAID TO HAVE TIES TO DRUG DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the top investigators of an elite Mexican
police unit that was trained by Americans may have ties to drug
traffickers, U.S. officials say. The disclosure threatens to
undermine an ambitious effort to overhaul the deeply corrupt
law-enforcement system of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government experts traveled to Mexico late last month to
administer routine lie-detector tests to dozens of police agents.
Now officials say some investigators who failed had been chosen for
their posts after elaborate U.S.-designed screening.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they were just beginning to assess the
damage that corrupt investigators might have wrought, a task that
could take months. Most senior officials in the unit were
implicated by the lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say even now that much of the sensitive information
that U.S. law-enforcement agents shared with Mexican counterparts
over the last year may have been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that everything we've been giving them has
ended up in the hands of the traffickers,'' said a senior U.S.
law-enforcement official who, as did others, insisted on anonymity.
``It's a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are expected to undertake their own inquiry
into the case, which involves a force called the Organized Crime
Unit that was set up 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican officials have challenged the lie-detector tests,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The penetration of the unit, apparently by powerful drug gangs,
is the latest in a series of such calamities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Washington Post reported that Mexican officials
planned to press drug-corruption charges against a handful of army
soldiers who had been stationed at the Mexico City airport as part
of the armed forces' growing role in the antinarcotics fight.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, as successive administrations in Washington have
sought to work more closely with the Mexican authorities, both to
fight the flow of illegal drugs to the United States and to
strengthen the rule of law in a strategically vital neighbor, U.S.
officials have publicly embraced senior Mexican prosecutors, police
commanders and other officials who have later been revealed, one
after another, to have taken bribes from major drug smugglers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the most serious case the Mexican government announced early
last year that its drug-enforcement chief was in fact working
secretly with the man then considered the biggest cocaine
trafficker in the country, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Days earlier the
official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, had been basking in the
praise of the Clinton administration's drug-policy director, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and other administration officials vowed that such a
debacle would not occur again. They pressed for a sweeping
reorganization of how the United States gathers and disseminates
intelligence about trafficking. The reorganization plans have run
into wide opposition among Mexican law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for Mexico, U.S. law-enforcement officials
also provided extensive help in writing a new law against organized
crime, in setting up an investigative unit to enforce the law and
in screening hundreds of other police agents assigned to drug
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective members of the Organized Crime Unit were submitted
to extensive background and financial checks, lie-detector tests
and psychological evaluations. Nearly all those chosen also
received training from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration
or both.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year and a half, during which the team of 70
investigators, prosecutors and intelligence analysts has been
responsible for investigating many of the most important
drug-trafficking and kidnapping cases, its record is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. officials praise the unit for what they say was
its leading role in the arrests of a handful of important smugglers
and the dismantling of a kidnapping ring that terrorized central
Mexico while receiving protection from state officials.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Dr. Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz, 38, a former university
professor who heads the unit, has won wide respect from U.S.
officials for what they say is honesty and courage. Gonzalez Ruiz
was one of three top unit officials who were said to have passed
the lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, U.S. officials have grown critical of the
unit for the same basic failing of the special forces that came
before it. It has been unable to capture leaders of the biggest
trafficking gangs, despite having access to some of the most
sensitive intelligence that Washington has ever given the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new law on organized crime the unit has pioneered
the use of protected witnesses and plea bargaining in criminal
cases. Among other actions Gonzalez Ruiz arranged this year for
testimony before a federal grand jury in Houston by a former
Mexican federal police chief who agreed to cooperate with
authorities in return for a reduced prison sentence on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit's handling of its witnesses has sometimes left a
lot to be desired. A highly valued informer who implicated senior
military officials in drug corruption, Tomas Colsa McGregor, was
murdered last year after having left the custody of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Another informer, Oliverio Chavez, was killed last week in
Ciudad Juarez while working with the unit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials said they had received reports
from several informers in recent months indicating that there were
corruption problems in the Organized Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although one official said the recent lie-detector tests
appeared to have been a response to those informers, other
officials said the tests were routine checks of the sort that the
United States conducts for elite police and intelligence units in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials, the testing, supervised by the
Justice Department, focused in part on whether senior investigators
had passed information to drug traffickers. Five of the eight
senior officials of the unit, including its chief investigator,
appeared to respond untruthfully to such questions.

US SEEKS SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While Americans have been preoccupied with President
Clinton's political troubles, the global financial crisis that
started a year ago in Asia has finally reached the nation's
doorstep. Now everybody from the president on down is scrambling
for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With billionaire money manager George Soros warning Tuesday of a
``disintegration of the global capitalist system'' and
international economists like David Hale predicting 60 percent of
the planet's population is headed for recession, US policymakers
face an abrupt end to an easy era in which nearly every nation
embraced free markets and everybody wanted US products and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is changing the global financial landscape,'' said Hale,
the widely respected chief economist of Zurich Kemper Investments
Inc. in Chicago. ``What's really troubling,' he added, ``is that
events of the last few weeks have brought memories of the last
time'' the United States faced the double trouble of economic
upheaval around the world and disarray at home _ during the
political demise of Richard Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what worries many analysts is that, now as then,
investigations and impeachment threats will so hobble the president
that he won't be able to use his already limited powers to
influence world economic events. ``I don't think this president is
in any position to deliver on a major global rescue package,'' said
David M. Jones, vice chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are some things that the United States can do
about the problems abroad, and they will be on prominent display
later Wednesday when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan are scheduled to testify at a
congressional hearing on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has already hinted that the Fed may reduce interest
rates this year, a move that would offer at least some relief to
teetering economies in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere by
boosting US growth and therefore US imports from those countries.
Rubin aides have suggested that something even grander may be in
the works, perhaps a coordinated rate cut by all of the so-called
Group of Seven nations that comprise the world's economic
powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president and a variety of business leaders,
including Soros, are renewing the pressure on Congress to approve
$17.9 billion for the financially depleted International Monetary
Fund, the multilateral organization that is widely seen as having
mishandled the early stages of the crisis in Asia and Russia, but
is the closest thing the world has to global economic manager.
</P>
<P>
   Merely the hint of help has set off a wild frenzy in financial
markets hard-hit by the crisis. In Brazil, the stock market, which
had lost almost two-thirds of its value in the last month, has
reversed course and soared.
</P>
<P>
   But as events in recent days demonstrated, talking about helping
and delivering help are two, quite different, things. For example,
while US and British officials hinted Monday and again Tuesday that
a coordinated interest rate cut was in the offing, German central
bank president Hans Tietmeyer flatly ruled out such a move.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton, in a Monday speech in New York, called for
the United States and its allies to ``adapt the international
financial architecture to the 21st century,'' most analysts
dismissed the call as little more than rhetoric, saying the
president has been too weakened by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation and the threat of impeachment to push through
such changes.
</P>
<P>
   ```Reforming the financial architecture is one of those buzz
phrases you use when you can't do much,'' said Ralph C. Bryant, a
former senior Fed staffer who is now at the Brookings Institution
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last year, the principal threat the global
crisis posed for the United States was that of damaging countries
that purchased American goods or produced overseas profits for
US-based companies. Analysts said that much of the sudden slowdown
in corporate profits that has sent US stock prices tumbling in
recent months is traceable to disappointing overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   But as the crisis has spread around the world it has taken on
several frightening new dimensions, according to analysts. It has
begun striking indiscriminately, bringing down both economies with
deep-seated problems like Russia's and those that are widely
believed to be healthy, like Brazil's. And it has struck with
lightning speed, draining away the currency reserves of nations
that would otherwise be capable of paying their bills, much like a
bank run.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in many countries is not a sober response to
changing market conditions, but a financial panic that producing
unnecessary upheaval,'' said Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In calmer times, the IMF could have stepped in to act a lender
of last resort and provide the funds that reassure depositors and
investors they could witdraw their money if they wanted. But with
so many crises around the world and with the United States refusing
to make additional contributions, the IMF's capital is now largely
depleted. ``It's hard to have a lender of last resort when the
lender is out of money,'' said former Deputy Treasury Secretary
Robert Glauber.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's failure to stem the crisis is spawning a laundry list
of proposals for revamping the global financial system, including
one advanced Tuesday by financier Soros for a sort of international
deposit insurance. But to sell any of the ideas to Congress and a
balky international community would require strong presidential
leadership, something that most analysts said Clinton has little
ability to provide in the wake of the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that in choosing to focus on the global crisis
Clinton is making a smart political move. Much as he did during his
1992 campaign, when he used former President Bush's conviction the
US economy was on the rebound to make him appear out of touch, the
president is drawing attention to the refusal by House Republicans
to approve additional IMF funding to make them appear isolationist
and extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But substantively, analysts said there is little that Clinton
can do to repair the global mess. ``He has no levers to pull at
this point,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, a former deputy assistant
Treasury secretary in the administration.

GERMAN SOCIALISTS TURN FROM SLOGANS TO JINGLES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Until recently, Detmar Karpinski's biggest
accomplishment was advertising Lucky Strike cigarettes. Today, he
is producing one of the slickest and most American-style political
advertising campaigns that Germany has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Hired by the Social Democratic Party and its candidate for
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, Karpinski as created a media
campaign that is an artful dance between cozy images of a happy
Germany and edgy criticism of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial playing in movie theaters shows four astronauts in
a Star Trek setting about to be ``beamed'' to another planet. When
the beaming is over, one astronaut is left behind and he turns out
to be a corpulent and befuddled Kohl. The message: the 68-year-old
chancellor is ``not ready for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a blitz on television, on billboards and in glossy magazines,
Social Democratic ads combine images of gauzy warmth with a sneaky
punchline. Billboard posters, aimed a provoking fears about cuts in
health care, show a blond boy whose smile reveals a missing tooth.
``We don't want to tell the difference between rich and poor just
through a smile,'' reads the biting caption. A magazine ad centers
on an aging, framed photograph of beautiful children and the
slogan: ``You should have more in your retirement than memories.''
</P>
<P>
   These and a barrage of other ads mark a major departure from the
dull and didactic fare that have usually graced German political
campaigns. They are also a far cry from the old-school ads for
Kohl, whose most ubiquitous campaign poster features his picture
and the slogan ``World Class for Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and his campaign managers have adopted techniques used
by Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. They have focused
relentlessly on feelings rather than facts. They have carefully
honed their themes based on market research. And they began mapping
their strategy more than 18 months ago, before Schroeder even
became the party's official candidate in the election, which is set
for Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SPD had an image that was somewhat old-fashioned and
needed to be modernized,'' said Karpinski, creative director for
the Hamburg-based advertising agency KNSK-BBDO, referring to the
Social Democrats. ``One had the impression that they didn't really
want to win an election, that they just wanted to be in the
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising plays a much smaller role in Germany than in the
United States. The Social Democrats say they are spending about 40
million marks ($23.5 million) on paid advertising, though Kohl's
party, the Christian Democrats, insist the spending is much
greater. Their own spending, they say, is about $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Social Democrats say they have systematically used
advertising, sometimes to illustrate a new stylishness. Inasmuch a
the advertising is clever and fast-paced, it appeals to younger and
more video-savvy voters who have grown up watching MTV. Indeed,
party officials used the first wave of campaign posters for the
sole purpose of showing them to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Negative political advertising, prominent in American campaigns,
has been almost non-existent here. Though Germany's high
unemployment rate under Kohl is the Social Democrats' most
important theme, party officials say that attack ads would have
alarmed voters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Karpinski has produced a campaign loaded with happy
images and with a critical message at the end. One television ad
describes the things people strive for and shows families and
children, hikers and bicyclists, playgrounds and modern factories.
The screen then abruptly goes black, and a message reads: ``But 4
million unemployed Germans can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative advertising can work, but it would be wrong in this
country,'' said Karpinski. ``We didn't want to frighten people with
attack ads. We wanted to make them comfortable with the party, so
the images you see are always positive an optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kohl and the Christian Democrats briefly tried negative
advertising but quickly retreated. Known as the ``red-handed''
campaign, Christian Democratic billboards warned darkly that the
Social Democrats might join forces with the successor to East
Germany's old Communist Party, the Party of Democratic Socialism.
Billboards showed two red hands shaking, with the slogan ``Watch
out, Germany!''
</P>
<P>
   But Christian Democrat supporters say the ads repelled many
people because they seemed overly alarmist. Though Kohl continues
to warn about alliances with the Communists, the red-handed posters
have all but disappeared.

   WASHINGTON _ Radon in drinking water poses few human health
risks by itself, but it increases people's overall risk from the
toxic gas when it escapes into the air and is inhaled, a National
Research Council committee said in a report released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee of experts, charged with evaluating the health
consequences of waterborne radon and assessing the Environmental
Protection Agency's methods of analyzing these risks in response to
the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996, said consuming water
containing radon is much less a health risk than inhaling the
radioactive gas.
</P>
<P>
   Radon, an odorless byproduct of the uranium and radium that are
present in most soils, disperses quickly in open air. But it can
dissolve into water and seep into basements, accumulating in high
concentrations in unventilated areas. The panel convened by the
National Research Council, the research branch of the National
Academy of Sciences, said small amounts of radon in water could
escape to the air whenever water was used, such as in showering or
washing dishes. But radon going into the air of a house from water
use usually makes up only a small fraction of the overall gas
concentration indoors, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, more radon enters households through the soil
beneath the home than through water supplies,'' said Dr. John Doull
of the University of Kansas Medical Center, chairman of the panel.
``Radon in water does increase people's overall exposure to the
gas, but radon in indoor air is the biggest public health threat,''
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely health threat from consuming radon in water is
stomach cancer, the committee said. In all, the panel estimated,
only about 20 of the 13,000 stomach cancer deaths each year in the
nation result from consuming radon-contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   Radon plays a bigger detrimental health role in lung cancer, it
said. About 160,000 people, mostly tobacco smokers, die from lung
cancer each year in the United States and some 19,000 of these
deaths are attributable to a combination of smoking and breathing
indoor radon. Of this last group, the committee estimated that
about 160 deaths result from inhaling radon that escaped from
contaminated household water.
</P>
<P>
   As radon decays, it produces damaging particles that stick to
dust and smoke inhaled into the lungs, causing cell damage that
leads to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ground water moves through rock containing uranium, which
releases radon into the water. Radon is found in ground water
tapped by wells, which supply half of the drinking water in the
country, the report said. Well water usually has higher
concentrations of radon than surface water such as lakes and
streams.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new study by the 12-member panel of experts generally agreed
with the EPA's earlier risk projections, but there were some
differences. The committee estimated that radon consumed in water
causes 20 stomach cancer deaths a year, compared with an EPA
estimate of 100 stomach, colon and liver cancer deaths. The
committee said that when radon passed into the bloodstream from the
stomach, it typically was eliminated from the body before it harmed
other organs.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's estimate of risks from inhaling radon
released from water were higher than those of the environmental
agency. Using new models and updated biological data, the study
estimated that inhaling radon from water caused 160 cancer deaths a
year, compared to 86 such deaths estimated by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Borak of Colorado State University at Fort Collins, a
member of the panel, said in an interview that it would be unusual
for a water source alone to be the main health threat from radon.
``Inhalation is the main problem,'' he said, ``Most water supplies
you see simply don't have enough radon in them to contribute much
to inhalation risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the EPA proposed a standard for radon in water,
suggesting 300 picocuries per liter as the maximum contamination
level. A picocurie is a unit by which radiation is measured. The
agency said most household water in the nation was below this
level, with only one in 14 Americans routinely consuming water with
higher concentrations of radon. Of more than 60,000 water systems
in the nation serving more than 25 consumers, 27,000 were estimated
to be above the proposed standards.
</P>
<P>
   William Diamond, director of standards and risk management in
the EPA's Office of Water, said the new report is the most
comprehensive ever on radon in water and most of its risk estimates
were very close to ones produced by the agency in a 1994
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has set up a schedule for the agency to enact
radon-water regulations, Diamond said. The agency is to complete a
new risk analysis by next February, publish a formal rule proposal
in August 1999 and implement a final regulation by the year 2000,
he said. States and water utilities would have three years or more
from then before the rules take affect.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, states with water supplies
contaminated with radon above certain levels are to be given
options for mitigating health risks, using a combination of
strategies that could allow lowering radon in water, lowering
levels of the gas in the air or combinations of both to reduce
overall dangers from the gas, experts said.

TIGER MANAGEMENT, BANKAMERICA CITE BIG LOSSES FROM EMERGING
MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Tiger Management LLC, a well-known hedge fund, and BankAmerica,
one of the United States' largest banks, reported huge losses
Tuesday in emerging-market investments, evidence that the economic
havoc in Asia, Russia and Latin America is continuing to roil U.S.
financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time BankAmerica reported an emerging-market
loss in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Management, run by Julian Robertson with $22 billion in
assets, said it had lost $600 million from Russian
ruble-denominated debt in August. Officials for Tiger Management,
which is based in New York, declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, on average, the value of hedge funds investing
in emerging markets has declined 35 percent, according to an index
of 20 funds compiled by the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, a
New York firm that advises hedge fund investors. Hedge funds are
lightly regulated pools of capital that seek high rates of return
in relatively risky investments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hedge-fund declines, about 23.4 percent, came in
August and were largely due to losses in Russia, said Hennessee
chief investment strategist Charles Gradante.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things can get a little bit worse before they get
better,'' Gradante said, regarding his outlook for emerging market
hedge fund performance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fundamentals of the economies in Asia, Russia and
Latin America begin to mend, further losses are possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiger Management's losses were focused on Russia, problems
in other emerging markets may start to take their toll on financial
service companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, BankAmerica said it expected to lose at least $330
million in nontrading income in the third quarter. That number
includes $220 million of trading losses the bank announced last
month. Most of BankAmerica's earlier losses were attributed to
Russia, where the bank had reduced its exposure from $412 million
to about $100 million. But this time around, some analysts said,
the bank's report is more comprehensive and likely includes loan
losses in Latin America, where it has more than $33 billion in
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the declines, BankAmerica said it expected to earn
about $500 million in after-tax profit in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica declined to give specific details about the losses,
``but if you look at where the volatility has been, (Latin America)
would be the logical conclusion,'' said Joel Silverstein, senior
banking analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   After the bank's earlier announcement, Silverstein lowered his
third-quarter earnings estimates to 80 cents a share, from $1.20.
He and other analysts are now scrambling to revise the numbers,
expecting to lower forecasts even more.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, concern about emerging markets has turned to Brazil,
which is plagued with a large budget deficit, interest rates
approaching 50 percent and expectations that a currency devaluation
may come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Before it began a rally last Thursday, the benchmark Brazilian
stock index had fallen 56 percent since Aug. 1. Since Thursday, it
has surged 45 percent. Tuesday, Brazilian stocks rose 18.7 percent,
posting their biggest one-day gain in more than three years amid
expectations that foreign governments would come to its aid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Brazilian market's recent gains, analysts still see
Latin America as a trouble spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a likelihood that other banks with exposure to Latin
America could be taking losses as well,'' Joe Morford, an analyst
at Van Kasper &AMP; Co. in San Francisco, said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen received pledges
from China's senior military leader Tuesday that China would move
ahead with modest joint military exercises and exchanges with the
United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on agreements made by Presidents Clinton and Jiang
Zemin at their summit meeting in Beijing in June, Cohen and Gen.
Zhang Wannian also signed a pact at the Pentagon to share
information on tackling environmental problems caused by the forces
of each country. These include cleaning up pollution and dealing
with waste produced by the armies of the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced that Chinese officers would take part in
exercises in 1999 simulating military responses to natural
disasters or humanitarian crises and would send a naval ship to
visit the United States. The two men also agreed to a series of
exchanges of military students and officers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, senior vice chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, met at the White House Tuesday with the president's
national security adviser, Samuel Berger. Clinton met briefly with
the general at that meeting, which focused on a broader range of
issues, including North Korea and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the Clinton administration have been eager to increase
contacts with China's military as a way to reduce tensions.

BUSH REFUSES TO OFFER VIEW OF CLINTON TROUBLES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Bush, while acknowledging
``concern,'' refused Tuesday to offer his view of President
Clinton's troubles brought on by an affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to stay out of it,'' Bush said at his vacation home
in Kennebunkport, Maine. ``I've said that I feel awkward in
commenting on anything that's going on in Washington now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a second reason,'' Bush said. ``It relates to the
governor of Texas and to our son in Florida.'' He referred to Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who is campaigning for re-election in
November, and Jeb Bush, who is the Republican gubernatorial nominee
in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is rated a prohibitive favorite against Democrat
Garry Mauro, and Jeb Bush is given an edge over Florida Lt. Gov.
Buddy McKay. Like their father, both Bush sons are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to inadvertently complicate their lives by
having people rush down and say, ``Your dad says x, y and z, what
do you think?' and put them kind of on the spot,'' the elder Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried for six years not to criticize my successor, and I
think that's been a wise policy,'' said Bush, who was defeated by
Clinton for re-election in 1992. ``I have huge differences and
certainly, as you can imagine, I have concern on what's going
on.'' &QL;

<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Saturday through Monday with 1,813 adults
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was organized as a tracking poll, with independent
daily samples, designed to capture daily shifts in public opinion,
if they occurred, as Americans heard or read about the report to
Congress by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples (combining all three days of interviewing) will differ by
no more than two percentage points in either direction from what
would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for any one day's results, it is plus or minus four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order
of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

BUSH SAYS SUPPORT OF ISRAEL MAKES U.S. LOSE CREDIBILITY IN MIDDLE
EAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is seen by Arab states
as so ``totally one-sided'' in its support of Israel that U.S.
credibility is ``sinking'' in the Middle East, former President
George Bush said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said lack of Arab trust would make it virtually impossible
to reassemble the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq from Kuwait in
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under existing circumstances I don't think we could get it
back together the way it was,'' said Bush, who rallied a number of
Arab nations against Iraqi strong man Saddam Hussein. ``I don't
know what would trigger the need'' to reassemble the coalition,
``but I would be very concerned that we could not patch it back
together under existing views of the United States in that part of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is awaiting publication on Sept. 28 of the book,
``A World Transformed,'' that he has written with his former
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. The book is a
commentary about the tumultuous world events that marked Bush's
four years in the White House, including the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the war against Iraq's invasion of its oil-rich neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft participated with Bush in the telephone interview from
the former president's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was willing to criticize the Clinton
administration's Middle East policy, he refused substantive comment
on his successor's troubles stemming from an affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War coalition issue arose from Scowcroft's answer to a
question about why Saudi Arabia seems to be refusing to cooperate
in the investigation of a 1996 terrorist bomb attack on a U.S.
military base near Dhahran in which 19 Americans were killed. Saudi
Arabia was the chief staging area for the war, and a major
rationale for the conflict was to protect the vast Saudi oil
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the Saudis' behavior is understandable from
their perspective,'' Scowcroft, a retired Air Force general, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it disappointing to us? Yes it is,'' he said. ``But I think
the Saudis look at the situation out in the Middle East and the
Gulf and see what they call a double standard: that we urge them to
support us in beating up on Saddam when he steps out of line, and
yet they look across to the (Arab-Israeli) peace process and see
the Israelis trashing the Oslo accord, not filling it out and we do
nothing but say tut-tut.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it is that double standard which gives them a lot
of problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders have criticized the Clinton administration for
refusing to secure scheduled Israeli pullbacks from occupied
territory, including the West Bank, as well not implementing
power-sharing deadlines with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up voluntarily on his former adviser's theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are seen, fairly or not ... as totally
one-sided in the Middle East ... is hurting us in our ability to
get things done with those countries,'' Bush said. ``They just
honestly believe that the (Clinton) administration is unwilling to
press for ... (Israeli adherence to) agreements that already have
been made ... and I'm afraid our credibility is sinking in that
important part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft said that reassembling the coalition would be
``inordinately difficult'' but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam ``has not become a darling of the Arab world,'' Scowcroft
said. ``They still dislike him. They still would like to get rid of
him. It is this double standard that gives them the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the book-writing process, Bush said: ``I couldn't
remember. I had a bad memory, and it's not anecdotal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Scowcroft had ``much better command of the facts and
history than I did'' but ``even he was found wanting from time to
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both praised their research assistant, James McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you see some documents then the whole story starts to
come back,'' Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his overall world view is ``optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``some huge problems,'' Bush said: ``I see that there's
no longer a gigantic, almost monolithic superpower enemy. That's
resulted in the fact that there are more market economies, more
democracies, more freedom around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft described himself a ``a contingent optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world is potentially a better place, but there are
number of little problems, and I fear that we are not taking full
advantage of this respite, if you will, in world conflict to build
the kind of world that we would like to leave to our
grandchildren,'' Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   During their tenure, Scowcroft said, ``there were enormous
forces of history working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the end of one of the most intense periods in world
history, and its unwinding was inordinately complicated. And as I
look back on it (I am) amazed that it came out almost literally
without a shot being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft cited the end of the Cold War, with the dissolution of
the Soviet Union, as the historic touchstone of the era, and Bush
added the reunification of Germany
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled having to ``bring the British and French along''
on backing reunification. It was one of the few major points on
which he had a major policy disagreement with Margaret Thatcher,
then prime minister of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was wary for historical, understandable reasons,''
Bush said. ``We understood that. But I felt that (Germany) had
earned their place in the world and that they would do what
(Chancellor Helmut) Kohl indicated to us that they'd do, and that's
be unified, be free, allied to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft, playing the bad cop, recalled that French President
Francois Mitterrand went a bit farther with his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even worked a bit, tested out (Russian leader Mikhail)
Gorbachev to see if there was something that maybe couldn't be done
to slow down or to stop German unification,'' Scowcroft said. ``But
in the end, Mitterrand was a realist. He said if Germany's
determined to unify, there isn't anything we can do about it. After
all, we're not going to war with Germany.'' &QL;

GIVING AN OLD COLLEGE TRY THE STAR TREATMENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world of dance did not pause in its erratic spin
when a young Belgian dancer named Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker
presented what amounted to her first choreography in 1981 at a
festival in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   A solo set to Steve Reich's ``Violin Phase,'' the dance was
uncompromisingly formal and repetitious. Though it was recognizably
influenced by the post-modernist dance minimalism of the time,
unexpected undercurrents of emotion set the solo apart.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. De Keersmaeker, then a student at New York University, added
a duet to the solo and two more duets to the piece on her return to
Belgium the next year. The four-part dance, called ``Fase'' and set
to four pieces by Reich, established Ms. De Keersmaeker; she was to
become a major international dance talent over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   She will return to those roots on Tuesday at the Kitchen in five
performances of ``Fase,'' which will be accompanied by a symposium
and film screenings on Thursday and a video installation.
</P>
<P>
   Who was that university student, already so remarkably set on
her life course? A confirmed East Village avant-gardist? A grind? A
sponge soaking up the extraordinary variety of dance experiences
available to a newcomer in the early 1980's? The question was put
to Ms. De Keersmaeker in a telephone interview from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' Ms. De Keersmaeker, a famously reticent interviewee,
responded in her murmuring but deliberate way. ``Well, I was 20
years old,'' she said after a long silence. ``It was the first time
I was out of Europe. I was a student at NYU, spending most of my
time in the evenings working in the studios. But I saw a lot of
theater and dance performances. A lot of Broadway things, too. A
little bit of everything. I had some good friends who took me
everywhere. It was a year of explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   One of five children, Ms. De Keersmaeker grew up in Mechelen,
near Antwerp. Her earliest training in the arts was in music,
specifically the flute. It was only in her last year in high school
that she began to study dance, music and theater intensively, she
said, choosing to concentrate on dance only after she was accepted
into Maurice Bejart's Mudra school in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   There, she came into contact with the major influence of her
career, a percussion and rhythm teacher named Fernand Schirren.
``He connected everything,'' she said of Schirren, who still
teaches at Mudra.
``SenegalCubaHondurasIrelandRonnieRonnieElsaNelson,'' she reeled
off helpfully. ``He made links between the dancing and the music
and the theater and ... life, so to say. I have no masters besides
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during her two years at Mudra that Ms. De Keersmaeker
made her first project, ``Asch,'' a multimedia, site-specific piece
created for an old factory, with a solo for herself that ``was
maybe the seed for the solo of `Violin Phase.'''
</P>
<P>
   That solo and the duet that followed came out of her desire, in
her first American project, to ``focus on pure dance and my
movement.'' Already, however, she was well on her way in the pieces
to the meticulous, hypnotic mix of minimalism and expressionism for
which she soon became recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing principles of Reich's music helped her to develop
the solo. Reich's musicians suggested the two pieces of music for
the last parts of ``Fase'' that she created, the opening and
closing dances.
</P>
<P>
   They completed the full-evening piece that Ms. De Keersmaeker
knew she would need for the company she intended to form. The
costumes were simply what she and her partner in the piece, Michele
Anne De Mey, were wearing during rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kitchen performances of ``Fase'' will be danced with Ms. De
Mey, a choreographer and former company member who was Ms. De
Keersmaeker's original partner in the two duets created in Belgium.
These will be the last performances of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to close the circle somehow,'' she said. ```Fase' was
really like the very first piece I really considered I'd made.
Michele Anne doesn't want to dance it anymore. And I sort of want
to finish it in the city where it started. That one year in New
York was a very intense period.''

CONGRESS HAS FULL PLATE AS IT RUSHES TO ADJOURN OCT. 9 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress rushes to adjourn for the year on Oct.
9, lawmakers are having to make a lot of tough decisions, including
how to keep the government running, as it wrestles with a scandal
that could force President Clinton from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are, Clinton still will be behind his desk at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue when Congress finally sends him the remaining
1999 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, those bills probably won't cross his desk until
after the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, and Clinton may
not be inclined to sign them if they include reductions in
education and other programs he favors and tax cuts that are paid
for with projected surpluses. He has said those must be used to
shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid a veto or standoff that could lead to a
government shutdown, Republicans on Capitol Hill are increasingly
talking about a continuing resolution that would keep affected
federal agencies and departments open and operating at present
funding levels.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, acknowledged Tuesday
that a temporary funding measure likely will be passed on Sept. 30
to give Congress and the White House more time to negotiate their
differences over issues such as funding for the United Nations and
the International Monetary Fund, not to mention an $80 million tax
cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that the funding measure would run at least through
Oct. 9, the day Congress is to adjourn for the year, and would be a
``plain vanilla'' spending item that would keep the government
operating at ``existing funding levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Oct. 9th, he said ``we'll have everything pretty cleaned
up'' in terms of ironing out differences over spending legislation
with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaning up, however, will depend on whether Clinton is
inclined to go along with Republican demands rather than fight
them.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are banking on the Monica Lewinsky scandal and
the threat of impeachment to keep him in line. But Democrats are
putting pressure on Clinton not to give in on such issues as
education funding and his opposition to tax cuts from the surplus.
They believe those issues could help them in the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said recently that
Clinton had assured him that he will not sign a tax cut measure
``that's paid for by the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have the votes to sustain a veto, if it comes to
that,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also said Congress won't be able to complete all its
work over the next three weeks, making it inevitable that a
continuing resolution of some sort will have to be passed to keep
some government agencies and programs running until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress still has a lot on its plate over the next three weeks,
including bankruptcy legislation, HMO reforms, fast-track
negotiating authorities, and various appropriations measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest issue emerging in these last days is the $80
billion tax cut proposal being floated by House Ways Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's five-year plan would be financed by part of the $1.6
trillion surplus projected over the next decade. The congressman
insists, however, that most of the surplus would be set aside to
ensure that Social Security doesn't go broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we make it very clear that we are committed to
saving Social Security, the American people think there should be
some of the surplus given back to them,'' Archer said Tuesday. ``We
need to be sure we infuse more money back into the pockets of
taxpayers.'' &QL;

LINCOLN CENTER GETS GIFT OF $25 MILLION

(JT) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A record $25 million has been given to Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts by a new board member, Julian H. Robertson
Jr., the hedge fund investor. Announcing the gift Tuesday, Lincoln
Center officials said the fountain plaza was being renamed in honor
of Robertson's wife, Josie.
</P>
<P>
   They called it the largest single gift to the center by an
individual and said the money would be divided among Lincoln
Center's own artistic programs and its 12 constituent members, with
the largest share going to members through outright grants.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the gift even more unusual is that it was given in a
lump sum instead of being spread out over several years, as large
contributions often are. Among other things, the money will help
underwrite new series, like one on American popular standards that
is to start in February, said Nathan Leventhal, Lincoln Center's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 66, chairman and chief executive officer of Tiger
Management, the multibillion dollar investment fund he and a
partner started with $8 million in 1980, said he intended the gift
as a surprise for his wife, who was not to learn of it until a
ceremony Tuesday night on the south portico of Avery Fisher Hall
overlooking the new Josie Robertson Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Revson Fountain will retain its name in honor of a 1962 gift
by the Revlon Foundation in honor of the cosmetics executive
Charles Revson.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the gift grew out of discussions with Beverly
Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, before he joined the
Lincoln Center board this summer. ``I asked Beverly if something
there was appropriate,'' and she suggested the form of the gift.
``It was just perfect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the money with the artistic constituents seemed
particularly adroit politically in view of Lincoln Center's history
of rivalries over programming and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sills praised the gift, saying, ``I don't expect to have
another $25 million in my hand anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now the largest gift to Lincoln Center was $15 million,
given nearly 10 years ago by Fred Rose of Rose Associates, the real
estate developers, to build the Rose building, which houses offices
for Lincoln Center and its film society, dormitories for the
Juilliard School and performance space for the Lincoln Center
Institute, which offers teacher training in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $25 million from Robertson, Lincoln Center said that $10
million would go to create the Josie Robertson Fund for Lincoln
Center in support of artistic programs presented by the center
itself, including Mostly Mozart, the Lincoln Center Festival,
Midsummer Night Swing and Lincoln Center Out of Doors and the
``Live From Lincoln Center'' and ``Great Performances'' television
series.
</P>
<P>
   Producing these programs costs Lincoln Center $18 million a
year, subsidized in part by an existing $6 million artistic
endowment. With the new gift, this portion of the endowment would
grow to $16 million, officials said. In addition, Lincoln Center
has $109 million in other endowment funds, a spokeswoman, Janice
Price, said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $15 million of Robertson's gift is to be divided
among the 12 constituents, including Lincoln Center itself, by an
existing grant- and cost-sharing formula related to size.
</P>
<P>
   The largest constituent, the Metropolitan Opera, would receive
about $4 million, and the others would get diminishing amounts down
to $250,000 each for a number of the small constituents, including
the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the New York Philharmonic, the Chamber Music
Society, the New York City Opera, the New York City Ballet, Lincoln
Center Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center and the School of American
Ballet, along with the film society and Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money can be used for anything,'' Ms. Sills said. ``That's
what makes it so unusual.''

SENATOR PROPOSES $4.4 MILLION COST OF PROBE AS FINE FOR CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wages of sin may not be death, resignation,
censure or impeachment for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sen. Frank Murkowski has his way, it may be a $4.4
million fine.
</P>
<P>
   That is independent counsel Kenneth Starr's estimate of how much
his office spent in its nearly eight-month investigation of
Clinton's effort to cover up an extramarital relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, an Alaskan Republican, suggested Tuesday that the
Senate pass a resolution stating that Clinton should pick up the
tab for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said the president alone is responsible for the large
expense due to what the senator called Clinton's orchestrated
effort to prevent the truth of his relationship with Lewinsky from
becoming public.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said the president has
no intention of paying for Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, in introducing his symbolic resolution, derided
Clinton's ``plan of public deception and delay'' that needlessly
prolonged Starr's probe. ``Equity demands that the costs of the
delays should be borne by the president and not the taxpayers,''
Murkowski said _ an argument McCurry rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) has pursued perfectly legitimately the legal
processes that he had recourse to,'' McCurry said. ``And, you know,
we didn't instruct Mr. Starr on how to conduct his investigation.
We would have been happy for him not to spend any of that $4.4
million, so, you know, let's be real.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not scheduled a vote on the proposed resolution,
said Murkowski's spokesman Chuck Kleeschulte.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's proposal follows the suggestion of Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that Congress
could forgo impeachment proceedings and opt instead to censure
Clinton for his affair with Lewinsky and his subsequent efforts to
prevent public disclosure of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Such a censure could include a presidential fine in addition to
a congressional statement of disapproval. However, House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, said censure would trivialize the
seriousness of Clinton's alleged offenses, which include perjury,
obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's proposed fine has precedent, of sorts. Last year,
the House fined Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., $300,000 for
providing false information to the House ethics committee regarding
a financial link between a college course he taught and a political
action committee he led.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress has never fined a president to recoup taxpayer
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's $4,393,923 estimate covers expenses that began Jan. 15,
when a special three-judge panel accepted Attorney General Janet
Reno's request that he be authorized to investigate Clinton's
alleged efforts to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The
cost estimate ends Aug. 31, 10 days before Starr delivered to
Congress a 445-page report alleging impeachable offenses and
containing salacious details about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's cost estimate might quell Democratic criticism of his
wideranging investigation of the president. In addition to the
Lewinsky matter, Starr has investigated allegations of impropriety
in Clinton's failed Whitewater land deal before he became
president, the firing of staff in the White House travel office and
the acquisition of classified FBI files on Republicans from the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's failure to issue a report on those non-Lewinsky probes
has not been lost on several Clinton supporters, including McCurry,
who have attacked the independent counsel's investigation with the
alliterative mantra that it was a four-year, $40 million
investigation that merely uncovered an adulterous affair. But
Starr's cost estimate indicates that only 10 percent of the $40
million went to investigating the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's expense account, $1,861,456 million went to
pay for the services of attorneys and investigators in the Office
of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Travel expenses for office staff and grand-jury witnesses
reached $949,895. Starr also spent $884,110 on consultants and
other contractors, $356,494 on rent, communications and utilities,
$186,021 on capital equipment, $82,653 on supplies and services,
and $73,294 on administrative services.
</P>
<P>
   However, Starr's costs do not include the taxpayer money Clinton
has spent protecting what he regards as a president's prerogative
to keep some conversations confidential. For example, Clinton has
waged unsuccessful legal battles to prevent Secret Service agents,
government lawyers and advisers from having to disclose what they
have seen, heard or been told by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr's estimate does not account for money that
taxpayers might need to spend on the legal bills of people
subjected to the investigation but not indicted. The independent
counsel law provides for such compensation. For example, former
President George Bush received $272,000 to help cover his bills
related to the Iran-Contra investigation in the 1980s. &QL;

 &HT;    Church's Chickens sets up camp at Phillips 66
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Church's Chicken's latest development deal will allow
Phillips 66 customers to fill up in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based fast-food chain has signed an agreement for
Phillips Petroleum Co. to put full-service Churchs Chicken
restaurants, complete with drive-thrus, in 25 of its company-owned
gas and convenience store locations.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will help Churchs spread its wings, because most
of its 1,350 restaurants are in the Southeast and the majority of
the Phillips 66 locations are in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the largest such deal that Churchs has signed
for ``alternative venue'' locations, which, though they bring in
lower annual sales, are less expensive to develop and run than
traditional stand-alone locations.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the 140 franchised restaurants Churchs is
opening this year are in alternative venues, such as grocery or
convenience stores or under the same roof as another fast-food
chain. Currently, the chain has 147 non-traditional locations,
including 74 Churchs that share space with White Castle hamburger
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very simple concept to operate, it's a simple menu and
we've got a small footprint,'' said Hannibal Myers, Churchs' vice
president of new business development. ``That translates very
easily into an alternative venue, where space is at a premium and
there's a need to provide a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain's growth strategy includes continuing the trend of
partnering with other retailers, said Myers, who added that 40
percent to 45 percent of Churchs' new locations will likely be in
alternative venues over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with a traditional stand-alone Churchs, an alternative
venue location gives a better return on investment.
</P>
<P>
   A stand-alone location, which averages $605,000 in annual sales,
costs about $700,000 to $750,000 to develop and can take anywhere
from nine months to a year to get up and running, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   A store inside a convenience store, which averages $440,000 in
annual sales, can carry development costs of as little as $100,000
and be open in 60 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Churchs locations at Phillips 66 stations will
open later this year. The deal could eventually include more than
25 locations.

 &HT;    Cox Radio pumps up the volume in Fla.
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Cox Radio has struck a deal to expand its already
large presence in the Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., area, company
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based radio holding company has reached an agreement
with Concord Media Corp. Inc. to operate Concord's station,
WLVU-FM. The deal includes an option to eventually buy WLVU-FM. Cox
Radio did not disclose the financial terms of the deal but it
includes both cash and trading ownership of Tampa-St. Petersburg
based WSUN-AM to Concord Media.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of WLVU-FM, Cox Radio will control three FM
and one AM station in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, the 21st
largest radio market. Cox's stations represent about 14 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   WLVU-FM is a new adult contemporary station and does not yet
have much market share. But Cox Radio plans to improve and expand
its reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of WLVU-FM is consistent with our opportunistic
strategy to fill in or improve our station clusters,'' said Robert
F. Neil, Cox Radio's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, controlled by Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.,
has been on a buying spree in the past two years. It is not trying
to be the largest radio operator, but instead to dominate fast
growing markets in the West and South. Cox Radio is one of the
country's 10 largest radio holding companies, owning or operating
59 stations in 13 markets. Those markets include Atlanta, with WSB,
as well as Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Antonio and Birmingham.
Cox Enterprises also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Led by blue chips, stocks rise for third straight session
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The stock market posted its first three-day rally in
more than a month as major indexes showed across-the-board gains on
Tuesday. Blue chips led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the rally to a combination of optimism that
the Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates, bargain
hunting in the wake of recent market losses and relief that Kenneth
Starr's report revealed no new surprises about President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average, which dropped below
its Dec. 31, 1997, closing price on Aug. 31, traded above that
level for the second straight session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the year-to-date rise of 1.5 percent was still well below
the Dow's 18.1 percent year-to-date gain on July 17, when the index
closed at an all-time high of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   The market's comeback from its Aug. 31 sell-off was sparked by a
Sept. 4 speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, which was widely
interpreted as a signal the Fed might be ready to cut short-term
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have another long-shot chance to get a clue to the
direction of interest rates today when Greenspan testifies before
the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note Greenspan usually is noncommital about rate
changes, and is not expected to give any information away before
the Fed's next policy meeting Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   In separate remarks, President Robert Parry of the San Francisco
Federal Reserve Bank said Tuesday that the financial situation in
South America is of growing concern, although the Fed's chief focus
internationally is Japan and its effort to implement fiscal and
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's trading, bank, airline and drug stocks rose again,
along with shares of paper and forest products companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even some cyclical stocks such as Aluminum Company of America
and Caterpillar posted gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index made a solid gain on buying in the
technology sector, but smaller-capitalized stocks underperformed
the rest of the market with only a fractional increase.
</P>
<P>
   Investors showed little reaction to a report showing retail
sales rose a mild 0.2 percent in August after dropping by 0.6
percent during July, when the General Motors strike was cutting
into auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the market continued to suffer from
``pre-announcements'' of disappointing third-quarter earnings news.
</P>
<P>
   The latest came from Suiza Food Corp., one of the nation's
largest dairy companies, which warned that sharply higher costs
will cut into its profits for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said all along that the underlying cause of the
current bear market is the sharp decline in profit growth, caused
in part by repercussions from Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are more earnings disappointments expected, Friday is
the next ``triple witching'' session, when stock options, index
options and index futures expire, usually adding to the market's
volatility.

 &HT;    Atlanta Gas rivals to get list of users
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Public Service Commission is making it easier for
rivals of Atlanta Gas Light Co. to compete for its 1.4 million
users by granting the marketers automatic access to the company's
customer profile data.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-0 vote Tuesday, the commission ordered Atlanta Gas Light
to give marketing companies access to such information as names,
addresses, account numbers and gas usage during the preceding 12
months. Credit information and phone numbers are not included.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers, who will compete once the state deregulates the
natural gas industry Nov. 1, will receive the information on CD-ROM
within 15 days of being certified by the PSC to sell gas.
</P>
<P>
   They applauded the ruling. Twenty-two companies are now seeking
PSC certification; six recently withdrew from competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This order will reduce the cost, allow marketers to enter the
area with a lot less confusion, without having to call the customer
two or three times to get the information,'' said Bill Randolph,
Southeast manager for Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams Co.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mark D. Caudill, vice president/rates and regulatory
affairs at AGL Resources Inc., Atlanta Gas Light's parent, said the
ruling ``may not bring benefits to all customers'' if marketing
companies use the information to bypass consumers who use small
amounts of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for haves and have-nots,'' Caudill said.
He added that AGL reserves the right to seek reconsideration of the
PSC order.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Wise, the PSC member who sponsored Tuesday's order, said
such ``cherry-picking'' of the most desirable customers would have
happened with or without the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new state law, Atlanta Gas Light will no longer sell gas
to consumers but will act as delivery agent for marketing companies
that will sell the commodity at decontrolled prices. AGL also will
have a marketing company that will sell gas, Georgia Natural Gas
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The 330,000 customers now served by municipal utilities and
Columbus-based United Cities, a gas utility, are not affected by
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Under a previous PSC order, marketers could not obtain any
information about consumers without their permission. Wise said he
sought a change so marketers could approach potential customers
with more information to help them make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing a customer will want to know is, 'How much can
you offer this service for?''' Wise said. ``It's one thing to
cold-call a customer and another to be able to quote a price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact will be tremendous for consumers who now won't have
telemarketers calling them when they're not on the AGL system,''
said Deborah Latham, president of Roswell-based Optimum Energy
Sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to save us a lot of time and money,'' added
Livia Whisenhunt, president of PS Energy Group, an Atlanta-based
marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we can tailor individual deals for individual
customers,'' said Warren Darby, senior vice president of South
Carolina-based SCANA Energy, which has already begun radio
advertising in Georgia.

THE ANTISOCIAL CLUB (NO PARENTS ALLOWED)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Profanity? Check. Blasphemy? Check. Threats and imprecations?
Check. Drug references? Check. Sex talk? Check. Distorted guitars?
Check. Shouts, moans, growls? Check.
</P>
<P>
   With those essentials and a little hysterical publicity, an
ambitious rock band can be on its way to becoming the anointed
anathema: the band that teen-agers flaunt as a symbol of alienation
while their parents worry enough to believe the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for back-to-school, two leading anathemas have
released their latest albums: Marilyn Manson's ``Mechanical
Animals'' and Korn's ``Follow the Leader.'' And all interested
parties _ fans, adversaries, merchants, school officials, the news
media _ assume their appointed roles.
</P>
<P>
   Fans hunker down with the albums, learning lyrics so they can
shout along when the band arrives on tour. (Korn's ``Family Values
Tour,'' a rap-metal package show that also includes the band Limp
Bizkit and the rapper Ice Cube, is due at the Continental Airlines
Arena on Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   Groups dedicated to alarmism over youth culture trumpet the
latest threat; some try to pressure local governments and promoters
not to allow the bands to perform. This, in turn, helps the bands
to position themselves as the bearers of harsh truths that the
vested interests don't want the kids to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the parents hating me,'' Jonathan Davis sings in Korn's
``Children of the Korn,'' before going on to declare, ``All I want
to do is live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perversely symbiotic relationship, the stronger the adult
opposition grows, the more the band becomes a so-called
``life-style marketing'' choice for rebellious teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Spin magazine reported that some school districts have tried to
ban Marilyn Manson and Korn T-shirts, and it's hard to imagine a
better way to confer antifashion cachet. The T-shirt becomes more
than a declaration of fandom: It's an announcement that the wearer
has joined the antisocial club.
</P>
<P>
   The roundelay of product-censoriousness-excitement-sales seems
to keep all the parties perpetually satisfied. And by the time one
crop of shocking bands is outgrown or burns out, a new one will
have learned what buttons to push. ``Hey, we love the abuse,''
Manson sings on the new album. ``Because it makes us feel like we
are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to stay scandalous. When they finished
their albums, neither Marilyn Manson nor Korn could have predicted
that they would be on the market at a time when an independent
counsel's investigation of the president would emerge in the form
of Internet porn, available directly from the House of
Representatives website or reprinted in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's been a long time since mere sexuality stirred
up a rock controversy. The key to a full-fledged ruckus, as
performers from Madonna to Manson have discovered, is baiting the
religious right, which is both well organized and willing to
believe the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, of course, took full advantage with his ``Antichrist
Superstar'' album in 1996; although the album sent out a tangle of
messages about demagoguery, marketing, celebrity, belief, desperate
ambition and general misanthropy, the band proudly capitalized on
the reaction from people who assumed it was a straightforward
recruitment campaign for Satan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical Animals'' takes a different turn. The music is a
homage to mid-1970s David Bowie, though with advanced distortion
devices to make the instruments bite harder; in well-made songs,
the band also lifts ideas from Iggy Pop, the Knack and Paul
McCartney's ``Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey.''
</P>
<P>
   In some songs, Manson's lyrics also revive Bowie's old imagery
of outer space as the refuge of the alienated. Knowing that he'll
get noticed, Manson also comes up with titles like ``The Dope
Show'' and ``I Don't Like the Drugs (but the Drugs Like Me).''
</P>
<P>
   But he sings that the drugs are numbing and dehumanizing, one
more consumer product to distract him and dull the only feeling he
knows is real: pain. This time around, Manson is Holden Caulfield
with face paint and lipstick, bitterly denouncing the phoniness
that he feels himself being pulled into: ``Sell us ersatz, dressed
up and real fake/Anything to belong.''

 UNDATED: to belong.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anathema bands depend on teen-age frustration and rage; it's
their artistic inspiration as well as their livelihood. But while
the feeling is perennial, its musical outlet has gone through a
sea-change.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, antisocial club T-shirts touted thrash-metal bands
like Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. Faced with what they saw as
deadly, soul-crushing forces _ state and parental authority, random
violence, conformity _ thrash bands wrote songs from the
perspective of those malevolent forces; their narrators were Death
or nuclear annihilation or totalitarianism itself, so the songs
transmuted fear into power.
</P>
<P>
   The newer bands aren't so invincible. Consciously or not, they
have taken their strategy from Bill Clinton: They feel your pain,
or a least a lot of their own. They are abject figures, more
victims than brutes, which makes them feel entitled to lash out
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For all their free-floating hostility, they are disgusted as
much with themselves as with the world; they are freaks and
misfits, not all-conquering demons. For his new album cover, Manson
has been photographed as a neutered androgynous nude, with false
nipple-less breasts, a nondescript genital bulge and six fingers on
each hand.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is just disheveled; Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, as a guest
rapper on Korn's ``All in the Family,'' mocks Davis for ``doing all
you can to look like Raggedy Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   While learning self-deprecation from alternative rock and
grunge, these bands have absorbed hip-hop's willingness to blurt
everything out. Add power chords, and the result is music that
blasts its confusion to the cheapest arena seats.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude, impact and irritation-value matter as much as music,
which is why Korn has gotten away with rewriting a handful of tunes
again and again. Korn has a choppy, clanky funk mode, a power-chord
mode and a dissonant-riff mode; Davis tends to start out with a
choked-up, haggard voice and build up to thrash-metal growls. The
character he has built up through Korn's three albums is a mess,
seething with old injuries and unstable enough to cause new ones.
</P>
<P>
   He's wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental
expectations and a confused sexual identity that has him lurching
between homophobia and gay fantasies; one unlovely song, ``My Gift
to You,'' has him strangling his girlfriend during sex. He isn't
boasting about his troubles, though; his tone is desperate and
sometimes pathetic, more like a therapy case than a cult leader.
</P>
<P>
   Such nuances won't matter to outsiders. Manson sings about drugs
and tosses off lines like ``as hollow as the O in God''; Korn's
songs veer from insubordination to insecurity to murderous
fantasies, all in the name of what the historian Ann Douglas calls
``terrible honesty,'' the determination to tell the whole truth no
matter how brutal. Shock value makes these bands commercial and
tabloid-ready. But for fans, the pain and insecurity make the music
seem real.

KEY ECONOMIC REFORMER REPORTED TO HAVE LEFT PRIMAKOV GOVERNMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An outspoken economic reformer has reportedly left the
Russian government, removing one of the last strong voices for
free-market reform in the team being put together by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the official, Boris Fyodorov, a former finance
minister who returned to the government in the spring to spearhead
an aggressive tax collection drive, has been closely watched here
and abroad as a sign of whether the Primakov government will
represent a range of economic viewpoints or will tilt heavily
toward policies favored by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's departure was announced by Aleksandr Shokhin, a
centrist who Tuesday accepted a job as deputy prime minister in
charge of finances. In a televised interview Tuesday night Shokhin
said he would stay on only if he could influence government policy,
especially to modify policies that in his view would lead to
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's office would not confirm his resignation, but he was
not present at a meeting Wednesday between Primakov and
representatives of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, while Russia was caught in political
paralysis, Fyodorov, as acting deputy prime minister and a figure
well known to Russia's Western partners, stepped forward with a
program designed to ease the country gently toward strict currency
controls. That program has since been dismissed as foolish by
Russia's new Central Bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, who
regularly battled with Fyodorov over monetary policy four years
ago, during Gerashchenko's earlier spell as Central Bank chairman
and when Fyodorov was Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Gerashchenko reopened the dispute, saying he was in
favor of printing more money to pay off months of unpaid wages.
``We can't do without that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, accompanied by Shokhin, told representatives of the
IMF that his government would not halt Russia's reform process but
would adopt policies to protect social welfare and spur industrial
production. He also assured John Odling-Smee, the IMF official
leading the talks with Russia, that the nation still intended to
meet its domestic and foreign debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that Russia will abandon its reforms and revert to
inflationary policies have raised doubts about whether the IMF will
deliver its next installment of $4.3 billion in credits to Russia
this fall, part of a package approved last July during the early
stage of Russia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's request, a team of veteran Russian
economists _ former advisers to Mikhail Gorbachev during the waning
years of Communism _ has presented its economic plan, which one
Russian newspaper summarized Tuesday as ``emissions, emissions and
more emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview on television Tuesday night, Shokhin, a former
economy minister and head of the Our Home Is Russia party in the
Parliament, said that a mass printing of rubles would be
disastrous, leading to hyperinflation in two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin said he had taken the job as deputy prime minister on
condition he would have a say in setting the new government's
course. But he said he had yet to meet with First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist and former head of the Soviet
state planning agency, to discuss his responsibilities and to reach
a compromise on their conflicting views.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who met with President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday, has said
he will have a government team and a program ready to be announced
by Thursday. But with each passing day, Russia's economic situation
worsens, as the ruble continues its wild gyrations and shops empty
out their existing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the edge of a financial collapse,'' said Shokhin,
noting that Russia's banking system is at a halt, with payments,
salaries and tax collections frozen.

 &HT;    NEW TELECOM MEGA-MERGERS MAY FACE FEDERAL ROADBLOCKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress may have to move soon to foster
competition in the nation's telephone markets, two key senators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said after a hearing on a spate of new
major telecommunications deals that he would urge federal
regulators to put the brakes on further consolidations unless the
government can first ``guarantee that any mergers that are allowed
will have some clear pro-competitive benefits to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee chaired by
DeWine, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, said a joint letter calling
for an early policy review will go later this week to Justice
Department antitrust chief Joel Klein and Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see more tangible evidence that consumers have real
choices, the pressure will continue building to reopen the (1996
Telecommunications) Act and break the stalemate,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   As deep divisions on how best to proceed emerge among the
remaining industry giants, there are signs that regulators are
listening to the go-slow message from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kennard questioned whether there should be any more
big mergers in the long distance arena following the pending $37
billion union between MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will once again
be poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard
said. Future mergers ``of this or similar magnitude ... in the near
future should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday focused on the newly proposed link between
Bell Atlantic and GTE, which, if approved, would control about a
third of U.S. phone circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who favor these mergers claim that they will provide
companies with the financial and technical ability to compete in
the emerging domestic and world markets for bundled information
services,'' DeWine said. ``Those who oppose them say these deals
are more of the same _ big companies getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses then promptly proceeded to voice both points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s chief executive officer,
said industry trends point ``toward the formation of a half-dozen
or so nationwide and worldwide organizations that can give
customers what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to retain what Seidenberg called ``artificial geographic
boundaries'' fail, he said, ``to take into account the needs of the
information-age consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint Corp., said two planned telecom mega-mergers _ the Bell
Atlantic-GTE deal and one between SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. _ ``are over the line and must be blocked'' because
they would in sum control two-thirds of U.S. local telephone access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Said Esrey, who heads the nation's third-ranked long-distance
carrier: ``Federal policy makers must step in and stop the local
telephone industry from transforming itself into, basically, a
Bell-West and a Bell-East monopoly.

   WASHINGTON _ Although overt attempts to drive President Clinton
from office could backfire, several Republican operatives said
Tuesday that many campaigns were on the verge of fully exploiting
the president's woes in commercials leading up to the Nov. 3
election. Several are conducting surveys now to determine how
forceful the ads should be.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Capitol Hill was aswirl over whether to make
public the videotape of Clinton's sworn testimony to the grand
jury. Democrats fear that such images are bound to be embarrassing
_ and bound to wind up in Republican campaign commercials. Others
say there is little point in spending precious campaign money
running such footage when the news media will show it for free,
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the public appetite for impeachment is fairly low at the
moment, even among Republicans, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll, released Tuesday. Even if more damaging
information comes out about Clinton, the poll found, Republicans
would rather have Clinton resign or have Congress just drop the
whole thing. In the poll, 41 percent of Republicans said they
wanted Clinton to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment among voters for going slow and letting the process
unfold is at sharp odds with the frenzy on Capitol Hill, where
members of the House and Senate have been engulfed in discussions
of the president's fate. This uncommon difference in pace between
the public and the politicians _ usually the politicians wait for
public opinion to guide them _ makes a tricky task of formulating
campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is leading the opinion on this,'' said Whit Ayres,
a Republican campaign consultant based in Atlanta. ``Whether the
country will follow becomes very important.'' He said he expected
many campaigns to take advantage of what he described as the
``opportunity'' that Clinton was presenting. ``There will be some
response to this,'' he said. ``Saying values are important is a
pretty obvious strategy''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Bob Teeter, who ran George Bush's presidential
campaigns in 1988 and 1992, say it is so obvious it is not
necessary. ``When you hit a sweep against a party in trouble for
some reason, you don't do anything,'' he said. ``You don't have to.
The Democrats in '74 didn't have to run against Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultants say that the public cares
deeply that the process of investigating the president unfold
deliberately, without Republicans appearing to gloat over it,
exploit it or push it along unnaturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the public wants is for kind of a due process to take
place,'' said Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   Teeter said the reluctance for impeachment at this point is
based more on a desire to keep the country stable than on
confidence in Clinton. ``It's not an indication of support for him,
it's that it would be bad for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres agreed. ``There's not yet broad public support for
removing the president from office,'' he said. ``We're in a
let-the-process-work stage. The reason isn't that the public
doesn't care; the reason is that voters are wrestling with how to
make the punishment fit the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant based in
Virginia, said that voters were feeling some anxiety, but it was
based largely on the volatility of the stock market. ``If this were
about Bill Clinton, the public would fire him,'' Castellanos said.
``But it's about the people. Is it worth the turmoil to put
ourselves and the country through this? The judgment is that Bill
Clinton isn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Clinton by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, has done little to move Republicans toward impeachment.
The Times poll found that a third of Republicans said Starr's
investigation has been a partisan crusade bent on destroying
Clinton rather than uncovering wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   These divisions among Republicans have left party leaders
without a clear-cut strategy for how to approach the fall
elections. Several operatives said that the notion of removing
Clinton from office _ unthinkable even just a few weeks ago _ was
now not unexpected but still a surprise and that any strategy was
developing on an ad hoc basis, day by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will take care of itself _ that's the larger strategy,''
said Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian
Coalition and now a consultant to numerous Republican candidates.
``But Republicans are in a very difficult and delicate position,''
he said. ``If they are going to build on their majority, they have
to show that they are deserving of that majority _ without
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said that the go-slow approach could speed up
after the elections, particularly if Democrats sustain serious
losses in the House and Senate. But it would be Democrats, not
Republicans, feeling more urgency for Clinton to go.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Republican strategist said that candidates simply
needed to be patient and wait for the public to absorb all that has
happened and that then a critical mass of public opinion would
emerge that Clinton is not fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone is digesting the sex _ they are not even
on to perjury and abuse of power,'' this strategist said. ``It's
plausible that Clinton is at his high-water mark today.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW TELECOM MEGA-MERGERS MAY FACE FEDERAL ROADBLOCKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress may have to move soon to foster
competition in the nation's telephone markets, two key senators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said after a hearing on a spate of new
major telecommunications deals that he would urge federal
regulators to put the brakes on further consolidations unless the
government can first ``guarantee that any mergers that are allowed
will have some clear pro-competitive benefits to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee chaired by
DeWine, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, said a joint letter calling
for an early policy review will go later this week to Justice
Department antitrust chief Joel Klein and Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see more tangible evidence that consumers have real
choices, the pressure will continue building to reopen the (1996
Telecommunications) Act and break the stalemate,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   As deep divisions on how best to proceed emerge among the
remaining industry giants, there are signs that regulators are
listening to the go-slow message from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kennard questioned whether there should be any more
big mergers in the long distance arena following the pending $37
billion union between MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will once again
be poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard
said. Future mergers ``of this or similar magnitude ... in the near
future should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday focused on the newly proposed link between
Bell Atlantic and GTE, which, if approved, would control about a
third of U.S. phone circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who favor these mergers claim that they will provide
companies with the financial and technical ability to compete in
the emerging domestic and world markets for bundled information
services,'' DeWine said. ``Those who oppose them say these deals
are more of the same _ big companies getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses then promptly proceeded to voice both points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s chief executive officer,
said industry trends point ``toward the formation of a half-dozen
or so nationwide and worldwide organizations that can give
customers what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to retain what Seidenberg called ``artificial geographic
boundaries'' fail, he said, ``to take into account the needs of the
information-age consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint Corp., said two planned telecom mega-mergers _ the Bell
Atlantic-GTE deal and one between SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. _ ``are over the line and must be blocked'' because
they would in sum control two-thirds of U.S. local telephone access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Said Esrey, who heads the nation's third-ranked long-distance
carrier: ``Federal policy makers must step in and stop the local
telephone industry from transforming itself into, basically, a
Bell-West and a Bell-East monopoly.

ARGENTINA NEGOTIATING LOAN PACKAGE TO PROTECT AGAINST SLOWDOWN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ In an attempt to ease any future
economic tremors from neighboring Brazil, Argentina is negotiating
loan packages totaling more than $8 billion with various
international lenders to insure government financing in case of a
severe economic slowdown next year.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, government officials are still painting a rosy picture
of the economy, making every effort to differentiate Argentina from
other emerging market countries. The proposed 1999 budget sent to
Congress this week projects a 2 percent increase in spending based
on increased tax receipts generated by a 4.8 percent annual growth
rate, more than double what most Wall Street economists expect.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, economy ministry officials are expressing concern
that Argentina is vulnerable to any crisis in Brazil over the next
several months, since 30 percent of Argentina's exports are
purchased by Brazilians. While they express hope that Brazil can
avoid a devaluation, government economists say they expect the
Brazilian economy to slow further in the coming months, with
officials in Brasilia, the capital, keeping interest rates high,
raising taxes and lowering expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not expecting a devaluation in Brazil,'' said Deputy
Economy Minister Pablo Guidotti. But he added: ``We continue
analyzing, and if necessary, we can revise our projections.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to anticipate any severe recession in Brazil, Guidotti
and other officials are putting the final touches on loan packages
with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and Eximbank of Japan that could total
as much as $8.5 billion. These lines of credit are expected to be
signed in the next two weeks, government officials said, noting
that they would complement commercial borrowing and were intended
to reassure foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Local economists noted that the government has not drawn from a
$2.8 billion IMF credit line, nor issued bonds at high interest
rates to cover expenses. Neither action is necessary, they said,
because the government's current deficit is a modest 1 percent of
the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   David Malpass, chief international economist for Bear Stearns,
noted that Argentina already had contingency lines of credit with
several international investment banks in case of a future
emergency. But he said officials were seeking the added loan
packages because ``they didn't want to be perceived as inactive
while Brazil was being attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the policy of pegging the Argentine peso to the
dollar at a 1-to-1 rate, Malpass added: ``Argentina has been
holding a pretty strong hand provided by convertibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Redrado, a former senior aide to President Carlos Saul
Menem, said the government was negotiating the loan packages ``to
insure that whatever happens to Brazil, Argentina will have the
muscle and the money to weather the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent statements by President Clinton and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin stressing the importance of Brazil and promising to
stand by the economies of the region have bolstered confidence in
Argentina, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices on the Buenos Aires stock exchange, which had
dropped by 50 percent this year as of last week, rallied 8.90
percent on Tuesday. The benchmark Merval index has gone up better
than 20 percent over the last three trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the Bovespa stock index soared 18.68 percent Tuesday,
reflecting easing concerns on Wall Street that Brazil would soon
devalue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Rubin rally because he expressed U.S. interest in
Brazil's financial stability,'' Malpass of Bear Stearns said. ``The
immediate threat of a Brazilian devaluation has been lifted.''

&HT;        SEN. JOHN KERRY SAYS CONGRESS SHOULD PUNISH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 -- President Clinton needs to be punished
for his transgressions, but Congress needs to forgo a prolonged
partisan investigation and determine his fate by the end of year,
Sen. John Kerry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question Congress needs to be heard,'' said Kerry,
a Massachusetts Democrat. ``I think the American people have been
very clear of the fact that they don't think this thing can just be
shoved in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just pretend it didn't happen or walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Kerry has publicly commented on the 445
page report released Friday by Congress that provides 11 reasons by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The report details a lurid extra-marital affair between Clinton
and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent
attempts to cover it up from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he hasn't spoken with Clinton about the report yet,
but the Massachusetts Democrat did say he was ``upset'' with the
president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here ... he didn't tell the full truth back in
January,'' Kerry said. ``He did have the affair he said he didn't
have. We are left dealing with the consequences of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said it was ``inappropriate'' for him to comment on
possible punishment for the president, but he added the evidence
might not be enough to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the president mislead us all, yes he did,'' Kerry said.
``But that does not necessarily constitute perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he doesn't think Americans want to see the president
removed from office now, but this could change if more damaging
evidence arises about his conduct. Kerry said he received hundreds
of calls from constituents Monday demanding the president be
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I think the country ... wants to appropriately,
adequately and significantly hold the president accountable -- in
my judgement at this point -- withoutimpeaching him, without a
major upheaval in the process,'' Kerry said. ``Now that can
change.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is able to maintain the presidency, he will face an
uphill battle to implement his political agenda during the last two
years of his term, Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be significantly diminished in his ability to marshall
the forces up here (Capitol Hill), set the agenda and make
voluntary/discretionary things happen,'' he said. ``I think he
clearly will have a more difficult road.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said one of the first things Clinton needs to do is regain
the trust of his Democratic colleagues, especially those on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust is certainly an issue on the table here with all of my
colleagues,'' Kerry said, adding Clinton will have to earn his
trust.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also took time to chastise Starr for being excessive with
details in the report including references to first lady Hillary
Clinton's whereabouts during the affair. He described parts of the
report as a ``brazen expose of non-essential details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my judgement this report was excessive
in detail,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the country wants this issue to be resolved in a
fair, bipartisan, and speedy manner, even if that means recalling
Congress back into session after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   He also said if Republicans try to gain politically from the
president's misfortunes then it will hurt the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any effort to drag it out into next year is in fact a partisan
strategy, a political strategy calculated to do injury to the
president,'' Kerry said. ``The consequences of which would in fact
be very damaging to the country.''

MAN ACCUSED OF USING TRUCK IN HATE CRIME
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. -- A 21-year-old Palmdale man was in custody
after four young men said he called them skinheads, tried to run
them over and knocked one to the ground with his truck, sheriff's
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Maceo Houge, an African-American, was arrested Tuesday on
suspicion of committing a hate crime and assault with a deadly
weapon -- the truck -- while the four white men, three of them 18
and one 19, walked across a shopping center parking lot Sunday,
sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maceo had tried to run over them,'' said Deputy Dave Miklos.
``The group said they did nothing to provoke the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Kender, 18, suffered bruises to one leg and was treated
at Antelope Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Miklos said the four friends told deputies that Houge cursed
them and called them skinheads after he drove into the parking lot
of the shopping center. Houge, accompanied by an African-American
female, allegedly drove toward the four, stopped short, drove
toward them again and hit Kender with his truck, Miklos said.
</P>
<P>
   Houge was being held at the sheriff's station in nearby
Lancaster in lieu of $60,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale is about 50 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

TAKING ARMS AGAINST STAGE FRIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Ohio)   (af)  
 By ELEANOR BLAU   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picture audience members in their underwear. That's
an old trick. Makes them less intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Fall down as you come on stage. That's an odd trick. Not
recommended. But it saved the pianist Vladimir Feltsman, when he
was a teen-ager back in Moscow. The veteran cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich tripped him purposely to cure him of preperformance
panic, Feltsman said. ``All my fright was gone. You already fell.
What else could happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians report all manner of strategies against stage fright
and its curses: icy fingers, shaky limbs, racing heart, blank mind.
Teachers and psychologists offer strategies, too.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, schools have started addressing anxiety in
courses dealing with performance techniques or career preparation.
The Juilliard School offers a class in stage fright. Medical
circles are also interested.
</P>
<P>
   The attention began in the early 1980s, as people began talking
more openly about health problems. In 1983, Dr. Alice G.
Brandfonbrener organized what became an annual symposium in Aspen,
Colo., on the medical problems of musicians, and she edits a
journal on the subject. Since physical and emotional difficulties
are so often linked, Dr. Brandfonbrener said, anxiety drew
increasing notice.
</P>
<P>
   One cause of the attention, and the anxiety, is a tight job
market. So the field of performance psychology is burgeoning, and
sports psychology is attracting musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Don Greene, a psychologist who used to work with Olympic divers,
has been working exclusively with musicians for the last five
years, and has been asked to create a graduate course in
``performance enhancement'' next year at Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   With government financing of the arts limited in the United
States, not only are orchestra positions scarce, but even jazz
players can't find work, said Louise Montello, a jazz pianist and
psychotherapist who gives seminars in New York and abroad on coping
with performance stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like they have to be the absolute best in order to
get a job, and if they make one mistake in an audition, they feel
they've completely failed,'' Ms. Montello said. ``It's so
debilitating for a lot of musicians that they really give it up. Or
they get into compulsive behaviors. A lot of them are taking drugs,
and there's a lot of alcoholism.''
</P>
<P>
   The prescription drugs of choice are beta blockers like Inderal;
they reduce the fight-or-flight effects of adrenaline. Dr.
Brandfonbrener said she had often prescribed small doses to
musicians, with great success. Unlike valium, alcohol or marijuana,
she said, beta blockers do not destroy judgment. Still, they are
not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not the violinist Elmar Oliveira. Untroubled by stage
fright, Oliveira took Inderal once on the advice of a cardiologist,
to counter a rapid heartbeat. Although his performance of the
Beethoven Violin Concerto went well, he said, ``I felt like I was
completely detached from the fiddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and therapists offer wide-ranging advice, from basics
like learning pieces inside out to mental disciplines: visualizing
a performance, for instance, and taking steps to relax. Don't deny
that you're jittery, they urge; some excitement is natural, even
necessary for dynamic playing. And play publicly often, for the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Nichols, a psychotherapist who calms a stage-fright class
in Juilliard's evening division, suggests steps for the moments
before performance, if circumstances allow: ``Take two deep
abdominal breaths, open up your shoulders, then smile,'' she said.
``And not one of these `please don't kill me' smiles. Then choose
three friendly faces in the audience, people you would communicate
with and make music to, and make eye contact with them.'' She wants
to counter notions of the audience as judge.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the sports psychologist, teaches a ``centering''
strategy that combines Eastern ideas of focusing and breathing with
Western ideas of psychology. He finds his switch to music natural,
he said, since athletes and musicians both perform ``complex,
difficult, challenging skills under extreme pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Landsman, a principal horn player in the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra who teaches at Juilliard, likens auditions to
Olympic trials. ``For those 10 minutes that you are given, you need
to show your stuff,'' she said. ``You have to be hot from the
minute you walk in the door, and keep their attention. That's a
very specific skill that I, as a student at Juilliard from 1971 to
1975, was never taught. It took me 20 auditions before I figured
out on my own what I had done wrong in the previous 19, so that I
could win the 20th. I wasn't a better player by that time. But I
learned to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they share, though, athletes and musicians differ in a
key goal. ``If you tell yourself you're a winner, a great
champion,'' the cellist Lynn Harrell said, ``you're going to close
yourself off to some aspect of the vulnerable, soft-belly side of
what music is about. There's a need to feel a great deal of
confidence, but you have to be very sensitive to the inward,
frightened, timid side of human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell suffered extreme stage fright some 30 years ago in the
Cleveland Orchestra, where, with George Szell as music director, he
became the principal cellist. ``Szell had a way of making people
very nervous,'' he said. ``He wanted to control them, and he knew
so much more than any musician I'd ever known, he was rather
intimidating. In very subtle ways he helped you to develop, but at
the expense of feeling this natural self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I got so nervous I was sure the audience
could see my chest responding to the throbbing. It was just total
panic. I came to a point where I thought, `If I have to go through
this to play music, I think I'm going to look for another job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Recovery, he said, involved developing humility _ recognizing
that whatever his talent, he was fallible, and that a marred
concert was not a disaster. He also worked on focus. ``When you see
a film of Heifetz playing,'' he said, ``you see a concentration and
ferocity of intense living-in-the- present.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Extreme demands by mentors or parents are often at the root of
stage fright, says Dorothy DeLay, Juilliard's best-kwown violin
teacher. She tells young teachers under her wing to pace demands so
that students can always achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only young artists who suffer, of course. Vladimir
Horowitz's nerves were legendary. ``The great tenor Franco Corelli,
they had to push him on stage,'' the soprano Renata Scotto
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, success can make things worse. ``In the beginning of
your career, when you're scared to death, nobody knows who you are,
and they don't have any expectations,'' the soprano June Anderson
said. ``There's less to lose. Later on, when you're known, people
are coming to see you, and they have certain expectations. You have
a lot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never stop being nervous until I've sung my last note,''
said Ms. Anderson, who considers herself a circus performer doing
``my tightrope act without the net.'' Breathing exercises help, she
finds. ``Years ago, my nerves would force my breath to go high, and
I'd be breathing in a shallow way,'' she said. ``Now, even when I'm
petrified, I can keep my breath down, and hopefully my lunch,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Louis Lortie can't predict stage fright, he said.
``It could happen in the middle of a phrase. You have a silly
thought, or you feel the instrument is not responding exactly as
you'd like.'' Memory slips may result. In a Mozart concerto
recently, Lortie got lost momentarily, lapsing into a theme from
another concerto in the same key. ``It lasted a few seconds and I
was back on track,'' he said, ``but it seemed it lasted hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety is heightened, Lortie said, by unrealistic expectations
in the age of the CD. Before the development of splicing
techniques, recordings often contained wrong notes, and it was
standard for live performers to hit them, too. Not now. ``We were
brought up with the idea that there shouldn't be mistakes,'' said
Lortie, who is 38. ``Technical obsession was a part of the
upbringing of my whole generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Touring pianists often play in a hall with unfamiliar acoustics
and an unfamiliar keyboard. ``I try to remember from the rehearsal
how the piano reacts, imagine as accurately as possible a
performance of that piece and the conditions where you're going to
perform,'' Lortie said. ``You feel less estranged. You're trying to
put yourself in a kind of womb up there on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano Barbara Bonney eases anxiety with self-suggestion
techniques she learned years ago. ``For instance,'' she said, ``you
say that your heart is calm and beating regularly and your breath
is relaxed and deep, and that your solar plexus is relaxed and warm
and your arms are warm, and you breathe gently, sort of a yoga
breath. And between each of these suggestions you just say, `I'm
calm, and I feel loved and secure.' I must say I use that an awful
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bonney said she is shy, troubled by the thought of ``people
looking at me.'' Yet she likes lieder recitals, partly because she
can see the audience and communicate with it. In opera, ``there's a
void out there,'' she said. And in lieder she is in control. ``It's
when you have to be what other people expect you to be _ they
create this character they want you to be _ that's when I get into
most trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivica Genaux, a mezzo-soprano who made a calm debut in ``Il
Barbiere di Siviglia'' at the Metropolitan Opera last December on
short notice, gets rehearsal fright, not stage fright, she said.
``I get really tense and stressed out in rehearsals. When everybody
else is freaking out, then I'm OK, because I've been through it so
many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano Harolyn Blackwell takes fright in the wings. She's
OK once she makes her entrance, thanks, perhaps, to a little owl.
It resides in her purse backstage, providing protection, along with
a card representing St. Anthony, whom she described as ``the patron
saint for losing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will prevent her from losing the owl as well as her
clothes, which, she said, tend to fall off on stage. She dropped
her hat, then her sash (twice) as Oscar in the Met's ``Ballo in
Maschera'' a few years ago. And her fan flew into the orchestra pit
recently as she sang ``Glitter and Be Gay'' in ``Candide.''(The
conductor fanned himself with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Knock wood, it's not only owls that keep things under control.
Renata Scotto, who won't go on stage under a ladder, wear purple or
say certain words, does ``many, many, many other stupid things,''
like every other performer, she said. ``I don't believe a person
who says, `I'm not superstitious.'''

INVESTORS NOT TOLD OF NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY ISSUES, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ky.)  (bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has kept quiet
about its safety concerns over two uranium fuel processing plants
in order to avoid embarrassment on the day after the plants were
sold to the public, a nuclear watchdog group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by the group, the Union of Concerned
Scientists, show that the NRC, which oversees civilian nuclear
operations and some Energy Department plants, had many safety
concerns, including how well one plant would withstand an
earthquake and whether operators took adequate precautions to
prevent the storage of too much uranium in one place, which could
cause an unintended nuclear chain reaction _ essentially a small
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The plants, in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky., which were
built by the federal government to process uranium for weapons,
naval propulsion reactors and civilian power plants, were sold in
an initial public offering this summer, when the Energy Department
spun them off as the U.S. Enrichment Corp. The management team that
ran the two plants before the spinoff now run the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC held one of its twice-a-year public sessions to discuss
troubled nuclear plants the day after the sale was completed, but
did not discuss the two plants. The UCS said in statements released
Tuesday that the information should have been made public by the
NRC at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are supposed to make their own decisions, what risk
they're comfortable with,'' said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer
with the UCS. ``But they can only do that when they have a clear
idea of the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   NRC spokesman William Beecher said the commissioners were
familiar with the plants' problems from previous reports.
</P>
<P>
   Both plants handle uranium hexafluoride, which is radioactive
and a chemical toxin. The NRC staff found that in an earthquake,
the Paducah plant might release more of the material than
previously calculated and ``the on-site and off-site consequences
would exceed any analyzed accident and be unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A July 2 memorandum from the NRC staff, obtained by the UCS,
said that at the Portsmouth plant, overall performance in the
previous eight months was ``weak in some areas'' and that ``the
effectiveness of the corrective action system remained weak, due to
a narrow focus and incomplete implementation of corrective actions,
resulting in the recurrence of some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems included an unplanned release of uranium
hexafluoride. Half of any group of people who inhale or ingest 230
milligrams of the substance would die, according to an NRC document
obtained by the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reduced capability of safety system components resulted
from poor maintenance or surveillance practices,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Concerned Scientists, along with the Critical Mass
Energy Project and its founder, Ralph Nader, asked Tuesday for an
investigation of possible stock fraud by Attorney General Janet
Reno and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Yulish, a spokesman for the corporation who helped
arrange its initial public offering, said that the charge that
safety issues were hushed up was ``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All material matters pertaining to safe operation of plants
were released,'' he said, in the corporation's prospectus. He added
that the largest of the earthquake issues would be resolved by work
that is expected to be completed by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   The first shares in the corporation were sold July 23 and the
sale was completed on July 28; the commission met the next day.
Lochbaum, of the Union of Concerned Scientists said, ``If I'm an
investor, and I buy something, and I see the next day the regulator
come down hard, it might make me uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the NRC had altered its normal procedure to avoid
discussion of the plants was ``circumstantial,'' said Lochbaum, but
only the Justice Department or the SEC can properly investigate. He
said that none of the problems cited was ``a showstopper,'' but
that they would take time and money to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Beecher, of the NRC, said the plants had been the subject of
numerous reports, press releases and public meetings in the months
before the sale.

MARKET PLACE: NEW DRUGS OFFSET SOME WOES AT AMERICAN HOME
PRODUCTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could it be that American Home Products Corp. has
finally begun to change its luck?
</P>
<P>
   The company, with a stock price up 46 percent this year, is
expected to get the green light Wednesday from a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee for Enbrel, its new injectable
drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Some analysts project that
worldwide sales of Enbrel could eventually top $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That is welcome news for a company that has been prone to
product recalls, liability lawsuits and a weak drug pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, American Home Products had to recall Duract,
a pain killer, because of liver toxicity. Before Duract, there was
controversy over the Norplant contraceptive, leading to lawsuits
from 50,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   And American Home Products still faces lawsuits over its half of
the diet drug cocktail known as fen-phen, which was taken off the
market a year ago. All told, the liabilities could easily run into
billions of dollars, stock analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   All is not bright now, either. The company seems headed for a
showdown of a different sort with federal regulators _ over its
pending acquisition of the Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
   What has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission,
according to stock analysts, is the stranglehold Monsanto and
American Home Products would have over the sedative market.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto makes Ambien, the leading nonbarbituate sedative, with
85 percent of the United States market. American Home Products will
soon introduce Sonata, a short-duration sleeping pill expected to
be popular with travelers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the FTC confirmed on Monday that an inquiry
into the merger was under way but refused to comment on its scope.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission is unlikely to derail the acquisition, it
could force American Home Products to drop Sonata or delay its
release. Permanently shelving Sonata would mean eating an estimated
$500 million in research and development costs and would hinder the
company's growth in the sedative market.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the regulatory scrutiny could delay the
takeover until next year, increasing legal fees and postponing cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Essner, the executive vice president of American Home
Products, declined to comment Tuesday on the FTC investigation or
on the acquisition of Monsanto, which will cost $34.4 billion in
stock. Patrick Gage, the president of Wyeth-Ayerst Research, a
division of American Home, said that he expected Sonata to be
released later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonata and Ambien do somewhat different things,'' Essner said.
``Sonata has a shorter duration. You can take it, fall asleep and
there's no residual after-effects of the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many within the industry had expected Ambien and Sonata
to be rivals. Sonata's Phase 3 trial results, released in June at
the annual meeting, in New Orleans, of the Association of
Professional Sleep Societies, showed better results than Ambien had
shown in similar tests with placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Owning Sonata and Ambien would be a powerful combination. Ambien
generated $418 million in sales in the United States in the year
through July, according to IMS Health, a health care consultant,
dwarfing the $17 million in sales of Restoril, the No. 2
nonbarbituate sedative.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst case, if American Home Products was forced to
jettison Sonata, it would still pick up Ambien though its
acquisition of Monsanto. That has convinced many on Wall Street
that American Home's luck has finally changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really hold American Home Products responsible for
the recall of fen-phen,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst
with Southeast Research Partners. ``It could happen to the best of
companies. But with American Home's merger with Monsanto, the
company is a pharmaceutical and agricultural giant. It looks the
most like Novartis of any of the U.S. companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, investors have snapped up shares of
the stock, cheap by drug industry standards. With pharmaceutical
stocks selling at 40 times earnings, shares of American Home remain
one of the best buys even after the recent run-up. The company's
stock trades at 29 times earnings, a bit higher than the average
for the S&AMP;P 500, but considerably lower than Pfizer's multiple of
52 or Warner-Lambert's 57. Even the drug industry's laggards are
expensive. Shares of Eli Lilly, among the weaker drug issues this
year, are trading at 44 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts also see signs of encouragement in American
Home's bounty of new drugs. In August, the company received FDA
approval for Rota Shield, a vaccine against rotavirus, the most
common cause of severe diarrhea in children.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to receive full approval within several
weeks to market Enbrel, which was developed with Immunex, a
biopharmaceutical company in Seattle. Enbrel will be available only
as an injection, making it difficult for some arthritis sufferers
to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants an easy-to-take pill because it goes down
easier,'' said David Saks, managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``But
injections are the fastest way to get medicine into the
bloodstream, and arthritis is a devastating disease where there is
room for improved therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other new drugs are expected to be big sellers. Next
year, American Home Products plans to introduce Protonix, a
gastrointestinal drug available in oral and intravenous forms, and
Rapamune, an immuno-suppressive therapy for organ transplants.
Analysts expect sales of each drug to top $1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to new products, we feel really hot right now,''
Essner said. ``We have one of the best product pipelines that we've
ever had, and certainly we have one of the best in the
pharmaceutical industry. We couldn't have said that a few years
ago.''

 LPs TO CDs: HIGH FIDELITY MADELEINES  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going back to the neighborhood of one's youth and finding
familiar objects smaller than remembered is an experience shared by
most of us. I had the same feeling, not long ago, picking up a CD
of Ravel's piano music and finding on its cover the shrunken image
of an LP record I knew some 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series, of which this
two-CD release is a part, represents a foolproof sales strategy, at
least where the middle-aged market is concerned. For this is our
past, perfectly reconstructed _ nostalgia we can touch in
miniature. If Proust's ode to memory celebrates the power of smell
and taste, those of us who grew up in the postwar hinterlands,
where music inspired not just neglect but also suspicion, well
remember the look and touch of those old cardboard LP covers.
</P>
<P>
   They and their contents emerged month by month from labels like
Columbia, RCA Victor, London, Decca, Mercury and Westminster. We
wore them on our shelves as fragile icons. Roughly 12 inches square
and already prone to disintegration, they were medals earned, or at
least diplomas of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   This particular series _ four LPs now reduced to two CDs _
offered Robert Casadesus, the French pianist with strong American
ties, playing Ravel's piano music almost complete. (The G major
Concerto is the principal omission.) Helping out are his wife,
Gaby, also a pianist; the violinist Zino Francescatti, and the
Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was wondering how the spirit of the early-music
movement could be transposed to the record industry, look no
further. For here is Columbia's original cover design (ugly, as
most covers were in those days), complete with ``LP'' printed at
bottom right. Early-music's blend of archaeological rectitude and
modern compromise are perfectly mirrored here. Original notes are
retained though now translated for an international buying
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Salvaged even are the inner sleeves. ``A high fidelity recording
designed and engineered at Columbia Sound Laboratories,'' we read
on one. ``Variable groove'' techniques of manufacture are discussed
along with the relative merits of the diamond, sapphire and osmium
needle. On another sleeve is Columbia's ``current'' roster of
artists, from Dimitri Mitropoulos and Pierre Bernac to Bernard
Baruch and Gertrude Berg. Picture period-instrument Mozart in
Vienna's Redoutensaal: authentic materials authentically packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scratches of those old surfaces have been taken away;
the monophonic sound quality is materially improved. (If Sony had
wanted REAL authenticity, it would be handing out Variable
Reluctance cartridges and Garrard turntables to play these items
on.) Also updated is the listener's sensibility. What sounded like
``right in our living rooms'' a generation ago is now a bit hollow
and distant, but the ear adjusts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the imagination still remains uppermost in every
high-fidelity adventure, for I doubt that the most splendid
digitalized and stereophonic sound today has any more auditory
impact than what Columbia gave us in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are pretty much as I remember them: dignified,
careful, deeply caring, sometimes upright to a fault. Small errors
indicate an absence of splicing. Quick pieces like the Sonatine and
``Jeux d'Eau'' are still too fast, a tribute to Casadesus'
extraordinary prowess, but an example, perhaps, of how technique
can acquire an unwanted life of its own. There are in fact moments
between phrases when the music longs to draw a breath and luxuriate
in its activities, but the pianist presses on. If the four-hand
version of ``Ma Mere l'Oye'' seems brisk, at least Casadesus and
his wife have rescued it from the composer's cloying reinvention of
this piece for orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, I am most impressed by the simpler music: the
extraordinary leading of inner voices in the familiar ``Pavane Pour
une Infante Defunte,'' and the subtle goads these strands provide
to the overall movement. Casadesus thought through every subtlety
of the ``Valses Nobles et Sentimentales,'' arguably the best music
Ravel ever wrote. Perhaps the true evidence of the pianist's
rectitude lies in the faithfulness of his tempos, which no heat of
the moment is able to disturb.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other inauthentic component in Sony's new
transaction: the listener himself. The 1952 version of these
particular ears was eager and acute; its counterpart 46 years later
is battered around the nerve endings but more reflective because of
it. The blind, white-hot reactions of the young are gone; the
middle-aged receptacle is less capable of the old thrills yet at
the same time less susceptible to being fooled. The trade-off is
wrenching but unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 listener-model also has a hard time mentioning Ravel
and Debussy in the same breath, where once it was an easy
assertion. Ravel's several and sometimes contradictory spirits are
all here in Sony's project: the elegant attachment to the Baroque
(``Le Tombeau de Couperin''), the passionate sensuality (the
Sonatine), the affectionate mockery (``Valses Nobles et
Sentimentales''), the fascination with how instruments sound
(``Ondine'').
</P>
<P>
   The classicist and the exotic mix freely, and the composer's
calculating eye is always on himself. Debussy, one better
understands with age, dreamed as Wagner did, of mysterious and
potent worlds far beyond Ravel's earthbound though wonderful art.
Stravinsky called Ravel ``the Swiss watchmaker.'' Debussy with
every passing year seems to rise ever higher above both men.

 &HT;    Clinton scandal is academic
 &HT;    By Ben Smith III
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- During an esoteric discussion of what Aristophanes,
Shakespeare or Machiavelli would say about the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal, Steven Bloodworth cut to the chase:
</P>
<P>
   ``She don't look that bad. She don't look that bad,'' the
Oglethorpe University freshman said. ``Compare her to Hillary and
then try to see it through the eyes of a 52-year-old male. She
don't look that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She, of course, is Monica Lewinsky, and the forum was just one
of millions of discussions on the same subject taking place Tuesday
around soda machines, construction sites and in elevators. But
unlike the rest of the nation's idle gossip, this one inside a
classroom comes with a college credit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the title, ''Love, Sex and Politics: From Aristophanes to
President Clinton,'' 14 Oglethorpe freshmen, five upperclassmen
mentors and political science professor Joseph Knippenberg are
opting for the classics instead of Kenneth Starr's 445-page
non-fiction impeachment report to shed light on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The class is part of the university's Fresh Focus program, a
half-semester course in which freshmen tackle nontraditional topics
for a single credit.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Knippenberg and his students will compare
the affair between the President and his favorite intern, and
William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, whose affair also shook
an empire.
</P>
<P>
   The students will consider also how Clinton and Lewinsky would
be judged by ''The Ecclesiazusae,'' Aristophanes's comic Assembly
of Women who, disguised as men, invade and take over the government
of Athens, outlaw prostitution and gambling, and give the city's
most ugly and aged women first dibs on the virtue of its young men.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with the possible exception of Bloodworth, class members
are agreed that Lewinsky is no Cleopatra and not worth risking an
empire for. But they're split on what judgment should await
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I don't care what he did with the cigar,'' said
freshman Scott Harris. ''But he lied and he needs to be punished
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   To which classmate Melanie Wong, paraphrasing the philosopher
John Locke, asked, ''Do you punish him because he deserves it, or
do you punish him as a deterrent?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the class' 11 women who seemed more willing to cut the
President some slack.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, said freshman Colsana Freeman, ''is not only crazy,
she's completely freaky. You have to question if she had it out for
him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the student's comments, Knippenberg takes a Socratic
approach with questions such as: ''Say he resigns, should he still
be tried?'' or ''Not all lies are crimes, are all crimes equivalent
to high crimes and misdemeanors?''
</P>
<P>
   Several students seemed more puzzled why Clinton would risk his
presidency over a chunky intern, instead of a movie star or
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodworth bluntly replied that the middle-aged President isn't
likely to spark that kind of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''A model wouldn't get with Bill Clinton,'' he said.

 &HT;    Norwood joins calls for resignation
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Saying that impeachment proceedings have already
``frozen'' Congress, Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) on Tuesday became
the first member of Congress from Georgia to call on President
Clinton to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president should do a noble thing for this country and
resign,'' Norwood said. ``I don't think he has committed treason. I
don't think he has been bribed in any way. I don't know what high
crimes means. But I know what misdemeanors means, and he has most
surely committed misdemeanors, less than felonies, but misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traumatic as it is for someone to resign, the country would be
better off for it,'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood joined a handful of Republican members of the House and
Senate who have called on Clinton step down over his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. But so far, the
Augusta dentist is the only Georgian who has urged the president to
take such a dramatic step.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who has been Clinton's most
persistent critic, was prepared Tuesday to urge Clinton to resign.
Barr, one of the three dozen House Judiciary Committee members
allowed to review the evidence against Clinton, said he was
withholding judgment until he has made his way through more of the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not vote to impeach based on the evidence at this
time,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republicans were united, however, in saying that they
believe independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton
contained enough convincing information to open a formal
impeachment inquiry, the next step in the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to move forward with the impeachment hearings and
let the system work,'' said Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Georgia's House delegation said they had read
all or at least parts of Starr's report over the weekend.
Republican members said their offices were overwhelmed with calls
from constituents. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) said both his
Washington and Savannah office answering machines were filled to
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who only read bits and pieces of it, or rushed out to
the Internet, are saying impeach him,'' Kingston said. ``It's
pretty rare for people to be calling their congressman on a
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) said he requested his staff to
divide up the calls to determine if his constituents were angry
over Clinton's sexual behavior, or because he did not own up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling among the people in my district is very strong
that the country should not tolerate this kind of behavior from its
president,'' Chambliss said. ``Most of them just want him gone.
They don't say we want him impeached or we want you to make him
resign, they just want him gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss said he believed the president perjured himself when
he told the grand jury on Aug. 17 that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. But Chambliss, a lawyer, said obstruction
of justice charges will ``take more substantiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most members are paying particularly close attention to calls
from their constituents in gauging how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (people) expresses their revulsion and the Democrats
respond, he'll be impeached,'' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.). ``But
if the public supports him, I think the Democrats will continue to
support him, and then there's not enough votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, said they were far less
persuaded by Starr's report. Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) said there
was a ``strong likelihood that (Clinton's) statements were at
variance with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now whether that constitutes perjury, that's a legal
conclusion that has to embody a whole lot of case law and legal
interpretation,'' said Bishop, an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop acknowledged that the Clinton scandal could have an
impact on his second District re-election bid this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly not beat my chest and say there is nothing
to worry about,'' Bishop said. ``I try to change the things I can
... that's something I have no control over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's spokesman, Selby McCash, said calls to the
congressman's office were running two to one in favor of taking
some action against Clinton, with the majority saying the president
should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) was one of two dozen female
members of Congress who met with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
in the residential quarters of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inspired by her strength and courage,'' McKinney said
of the meeting. ``Ironically, given all that she must be going
through, the first lady offered us words of inspiration and
motivation. She will represent both our national courage and our
national strength in the days ahead and as we gear up for our
various races this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the president, McKinney referred reporters to a statement
issued Friday in which she said his ``reckless behavior'' had
brought the country to ``the brink of a constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who has stood by the president, said a
careful reading of Starr's 445-page report did nothing to change
his view that it was ``one-sided'' and well short of the standards
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not trying to circumvent our system of government,''
Lewis said. ``He was trying to cover up a personal love affair, a
sexual affair that had taken place over a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) declined to comment on the Starr
report, saying he might eventually be required to judge the
president's actions in a Senate impeachment hearing. Cleland said
that in Georgia over the weekend he heard from a number of
constituents, with the majority critical of the president's conduct
but opposed to the idea of impeaching him.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland declined to ally himself with the comments of Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who said Clinton's lawyers
should abandon their legal ``hair-splitting'' about whether the
president had sex with Lewinsky and ``accept that continued legal
jousting serves no constructive purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, who has sponsored major legislation to regulate health
maintenance organizations, said he became convinced Clinton should
resign because of the enormous distraction the impeachment question
already is posing for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got business to attend to,'' he said. ``Where is my
health care bill?... I'm not even talking about foreign policy.
We've got problems around the world, and we need a leader who can
stand up, and we need a credible leader. I want people to see the
president of the United States and continue to think he is the
leader of the free world.''

U.N. RIGHTS OFFICIAL, BACK FROM CHINA, SEES BETTER ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ At the end of what she called ``a successful but not
always easy first visit to China,'' U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson said Tuesday that despite continuing
human rights abuses, she had sensed among Chinese leaders a new
willingness to discuss the country's rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said she had been told by Chinese officials that
they were prepared to sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights next month. She said the Chinese government had
also signed a letter of understanding with the Human Rights
Commission requesting technical assistance in resolving human
rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has human rights problems, major problems,'' Mrs.
Robinson said at a news conference Tuesday in Beijing. But, she
added: ``I was interested in the awareness of and willingness to
admit human rights problems among China's leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson praised China's willingness to allow the rights
commission to work in the country, since China has previously
rejected what it regarded as outside interference in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be apparent what a ground-breaking visit this is,''
she said. ``Human rights is not talked about here.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups reacted with only cautious optimism,
noting that the ultimate success of the commissioner's visit hinges
on whether China's avowed commitment to human rights leads to
concrete changes in a country where people are imprisoned without
trial and cannot speak out against the Government.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch
Asia, said the commitments are ``a step forward, but what remains
to be seen is whether China takes specific actions as a result of
the trip.'' He and others expressed disappointment that Mrs.
Robinson had not met with dissidents or their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mrs. Robinson's 10 day trip was punctuated by poignant
reminders of the dizzying contradictions in China's human rights
policies, where scattered signs of liberalization are often offset
by harsh repression.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, dissidents from two provinces said they had
gotten somewhat encouraging signals when they applied for
permission to organize an opposition party, an act that had landed
dissidents in jail just three month ago. And, at a seminar, Mrs.
Robinson heard Chinese lawyers openly criticize the lack of
protection defendants have under Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   But that same week, officers of Beijing's Public Security Bureau
arrested and allegedly beat an imprisoned dissident's wife, Chu
Hailan, as she tried to deliver a letter to Mrs. Robinson in her
hotel lobby. And a liberal journalist and editor, Shi Binhai, was
taken from his home and 10 days later was still being held without
explanation or charges.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradiction were not lost on Mrs. Robinson, who said that
she had called the Foreign Ministry to demand Ms. Chu's release
after she heard about the arrest. Ms. Chu was released that same
evening. Shi's status is still unclear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said that during her visit she had received a
number of faxes, letters and oral messages delivered to her hotel
regarding individual cases. ``I have become aware of a number of
cases that I will bring up with authorities back in Geneva,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson said that in Monday meetings with President Jiang
Zemin and Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen she had inquired about
the whereabouts of the Panchen Lama, the second-ranking spiritual
leader of Tibetan Buddhists, urged Jiang to meet with the Dalai
Lama and asked the government to review the sentences of those
arrested in connection with the 1989 pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson traveled to Beijing and Shanghai, discussing a
broad range of human rights issues, from dissidents to China's
justice system to discrimination against women. She also made a
brief visit to Tibet, which she characterized as ``very restrictive
and very difficult, as many opportunities in the country are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she defended her work there _ which included
passing out copies of the U.N. Universal Declaration on Human
Rights in Tibetan at a local school _ as a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson repeatedly said that the main goal of her trip was
merely to ``start a process of cooperation'' and did not say if she
had gotten any concrete commitments for change during her lengthy
meetings with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many human rights experts say they are anxious for details.
While they say they are happy that China has now given a timetable
for signing the covenents and has committed to further cooperation
with the United Nations, they note that Beijing has not always
lived up to such promises.
</P>
<P>
   The International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, which
China plans to sign next month, along with the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ that China
signed last year, are comprehensive documents protecting rights
from freedom of speech to freedom to form trade unions. But China's
governing bodies still have to ratify both documents and might try
to attach caveats that would blunt their impact, Jendrzejczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Some dissidents said that Mrs. Robinson's visit as well as a
slight loosening of official policy had already helped their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is beginning to acknowledge the existence of human
rights through this visit and through these covenants,'' said Wang
Youcai, a dissident from Hangzhou who was arrested in July for
trying to form a political party. ``I think the likelihood I'll be
re-arrested now is small.'' &QL;

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ This small nation nestled under the towering
Caucasus Mountains, which has a history stretching back several
millennia but which emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union
only seven years ago, has a rich creative tradition based on the
mixture of fantasy and reality.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century that tradition has been expressed most
vividly in film, and today a hardy group of more than a dozen
filmmakers is struggling against severe economic constraints,
trying to preserve, extend and deepen it.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian cinema _ like, some would say, the Georgian soul itself
_ is built largely on surrealism and poetic intensity. So it is
entirely appropriate that Nana Djordjadze is one of the country's
leading filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me why I make films, I ask you why you breathe,''
Ms. Djordjadze (pronounced jor-JAD-zeh) said recently at the
cavernous sound stage that she and three other directors bought in
1993. ``I cannot imagine my life without film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze has six feature films behind her, including ``A
Chef in Love,'' which was nominated for an Oscar as best foreign
film of 1996. It features a chef with a nose so sensitive that he
can instantly identify wine vintages and the ingredients of
elaborate dishes; the kidnapping of a pig; and a communist
commissar who orders the closing of the best restaurant in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Djordjadze bridled at the suggestion that it is anything
other than realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no more unreal than my own life and imagination,'' she
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   That life and imagination, however, are extraordinary even by
Georgian standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze was born aboard an airplane over the Caucasus,
and as a child aspired to be a pilot because to her that job
epitomized freedom. As a child in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
she lived above a fire station and was adopted by the fire brigade
as a sort of mascot, often dressing in a firefighter's hat and
rubber coat. She spent many afternoons walking through the old
city, not on the streets but on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   ``My childhood was full of secrets and surprises,'' she said,
jumping up from her seat every few minutes to illustrate her
memories. ``My family was full of crazy people. When the Red Army
arrived here in 1921, my grandmother told her servants: `Close the
window. They must go away.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather came back from the gulag after 25 years. He
confused everything, and since I was the only nongrownup in the
house, I was the only one he could communicate with. Once he
suddenly insisted that we go to visit the place where he grew up.
He pointed to a spot and we began to dig. After a few minutes we
felt some cloth, and there was a package that turned out to contain
three volumes of Byron and one of Shakespeare. He had buried them
there before he was arrested. I still have those books. They're
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every moment of my life is full of these romantic things. In
my family, tragic stories were always told with humor. I also have
this style. Today we have problems, but tomorrow will be much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze discovered movies at so-called ``cinema clubs,''
where officially banned foreign films were shown late at night with
a wink from the authorities, who were never as dogmatic as their
bosses in faraway Moscow. Transfixed by Jean Renoir, Robert
Flaherty, John Ford, Luis Bunuel, Federico Fellini and others, she
resolved to follow in their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, at the age of 16, she traveled to Prague to attend that
city's Academy of Art. She was caught up in the excitement of the
``Prague spring,'' but when Soviet troops invaded in August of that
year she was arrested and sent home. She began experimenting with
film, and in the 1980's two of her films won prizes at the
festivals in Berlin and Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   Together with her husband, Irakli Kvirikadze, who has written
the scripts for most of her films, Ms. Djordzadje is among the most
active Georgian filmmakers. Today she is involved in several
projects, the details of which she declined to discuss. What makes
her remarkable is not simply her body of work, which includes ``A
Journey to Sopot'' (1980) and ``Robinozaida'' (1987), later
released in English as ``My English Grandfather,'' but the fact
that she and her contemporaries represent one of the world's most
interesting cinematic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's film industry emerged soon after the first moving
pictures were shown in Paris and Berlin. Shorts were first made
here in 1908, with the first full-length documentary following in
1912 and the first full-length feature in 1916. During the Soviet
period, Georgian films won prizes around the world. Officials in
Moscow often claimed them as examples of the brilliance of Soviet
art, but strictly limited their distribution within the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their ambivalence was, not surprisingly,
political. Many early Georgian films were obliquely critical of
Soviet rule. During the years of Stalinist power, filmmakers here
had no chance to make anything other than films extolling the
wonders of collective farming and industrialization. Later,
however, they adopted the indirect language of parable and metaphor
to convey iconoclastic messages.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgian films of the 1960s and '70s won awards at Moscow
festivals, among them Sergo Parajanov's widely praised ``Shadows of
Forgotten Ancestors'' and Eldar Shengelaya's ``Samanashvili's
Stepmother'' and ``Blue Mountains.'' Others, however, were all but
completely repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable of these were three silent shorts by
Michael Kobakhidze, all made in the 1960s: ``Wedding,''
``Umbrella'' and ``Musicians.'' Shot in black and white, they have
no direct political content but are utterly anti-Soviet in their
lightness, sly humor and tragicomic refusal to accept the
conventions of heroism or social obligation. Today they are shown
regularly on Georgian television.
</P>
<P>
   Kobakhidze, along with several other Georgian directors, has
emigrated and now lives in Paris. He has told recent visitors that
he is working on another film, his first in many years, but will
say no more.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgian film towers above all others as a political
landmark. ``Repentance,'' directed by Tengiz Abuladze, who died in
1994, was released in 1986 as the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev were
beginning to take hold. It is a deeply penetrating critique of
Stalinism, though on the surface it is only about a benevolent
small-town mayor who, desperate to hold onto his post, slowly
becomes cruel and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is antityranny, antipower, in other words, against
barbarism,'' Abuladze said after ``Repentance'' won the special
grand jury prize in 1987 at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repentance'' could not have been made without the connivance
of Eduard Shevardnadze, who then headed the Georgian Communist
Party and is now the nation's president. After reading the script,
Shevardnadze frankly told the filmmakers that Moscow would never
approve it. He suggested that they write another, very bland script
with the same title and send it to Moscow. After it was approved,
he told them, they should go ahead and make the film they
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse worked, and by the time the film was completed the
Soviet political climate had loosened so much that it became a huge
hit throughout the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Abuladze's influence is still being felt. Directors like Ms.
Djordjadze absorbed his techniques and philosophy of life as his
students at the Tbilisi film academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong cultural tradition and a devotion to the
concept of individual creativity,'' said Irina Gogoberidze, a film
historian and critic in Tbilisi. ``Neo-realism, symbolism and other
forms of intellectual filmmaking are deeply rooted here. Directors
look in that direction rather than toward pleasing the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, our best films have been very light and open,''
Ms. Gogoberidze said. ``Unfortunately our economic troubles, not to
mention the political difficulties, have turned some of our
filmmakers toward nihilism. But I believe that someday we will
produce a great Georgian blockbuster. We have all the
ingredients.''

SQUABBLING ERUPTS OVER REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO RELEASE CLINTON
TESTIMONY VIDEO 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Partisan squabbling erupted in the House Tuesday
over Republican efforts to release a videotape of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House votes on proceeding with an impeachment probe,
they must decide what evidence to release in addition to the
summary that was made public last week after independent counsel
Kenneth Starr delivered his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report contended there is credible evidence the president
committed a number of impeachable offenses from perjury to
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pressing to release a video of the president's
August testimony in which Starr and his prosecutors aggressively
questioned Clinton on his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials fear the release of the video will be used
by Republicans in campaign commercials. Many Democrats believe it
is wrong to make public piecemeal parts of the supporting evidence
submitted by Starr. They say the original agreement called for the
committee to review all of the material and then selectively make
public pertinent information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we proceed in leaking and releasing documentation we will
not have the dignified process this nation deserves,'' said Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee,
which would hold any impeachment hearings. She also warned ``that
we are about to begin a Salem witch hunt. I will not participate in
a witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members have now had an opportunity to review the tape
of the president's testimony. Some said Tuesday that it would
likely prove a further embarrassment to the president because it
shows him ``squirming'' and ``responding angrily'' to graphic
questions put to him about his sexual trysts with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that Clinton and his
advisers have been bracing for the tape to be released in some
form, either through leaks or a decision by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope that it's not misused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, grand jury testimony would be kept secret. But now
that Starr has sent his report to Congress, lawmakers can do
whatever they want to with the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said that the public has a right to see
the Clinton testimony, even if it includes sexually graphic
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have a problem with graphic testimony, they ought
to complain to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee may meet as soon as Thursday to discuss
the release of additional material, according to a committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to media reports that White House officials were
trying to collect and spread damaging information on House
Judiciary members, Chairman Henry Hyde issued a memo to the
committee saying such attempts would be viewed as a violation of
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also indicated that it is readying for the fight
over impeachment by appointing Greg Craig as a special counsel to
coordinate response to the Starr report. Craig is a senior State
Department official who once worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will join a White House legal and public relations team
that has been trying to convince Democrats on Capitol Hill to
continue their support for the president. Top administration
officials, including chief of staff Erskine Bowles and political
aide John Podesta, spoke to Democratic senators at a closed door
luncheon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the reportedly tense meeting, the senators said the aides
largely reiterated the president's defense strategy, which twins a
personal acknowledgment that he has sinned with a vigorous defense
that he committed no impeachable acts. Lawmakers refused to comment
specifically on their exchanges with the White House team.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, a number of Democratic women lawmakers met with
Hillary Rodham Clinton and urged the first lady to maintain a
visible role in the coming months, particularly in terms of pushing
the party's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want her voice to be silenced. We want to hear
her,'' said Jackson Lee, who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also confirmed that the president has asked two
ministers for guidance regarding his problems. The clergymen are
Tony Campolo, a liberal Baptist from Pennsylvania and Rev. Gordon
MacDonald, a senior pastor of a non-denominational church in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital has been in an uproar since the release of
the Starr report last week, with lawmakers daily calling for the
president's resignation. But that sentiment is not shared by most
of the public, who by a 2-1 margin in most polls, do not view the
president's behavior as serious enough to warrant his ouster from
office.
</P>
<P>
   One of Texas' two Republican senators, Phil Gramm, said he was
not going to be influenced by the views of his constituents on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore an oath to the Constitution and not to public
opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., suggested that Americans ought to
``think this thing through a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the chief law enforcement officer in this country, and he
lied,'' Sessions said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, have
floated the idea of censuring Clinton, a solution that has the
support of a majority of Americans in some polls. Democrats would
likely go along with a move to publicly reprimand Clinton without
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Tuesday that
a growing number of his GOP colleagues believe that censure would
``trivialize'' Starr's conclusion that Clinton committed perjury
and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, echoed the disdain for
censure as way out of the current controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who considers censure and makes decisions based on
polls, believes the rule of man is above the rule of law,'' he
said. &QL;

INTEL AGREEMENT INDICATES RIFT WITH MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an agreement to be announced Wednesday, Intel
Corp. will license its advanced video compression software to Real
Networks Inc., a Seattle-based developer of programs that deliver
audio and video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the expectation that Intel's technology will improve the
performance of Real Network's software, the deal is seen as further
evidence of growing cracks in the so-called Wintel duopoly, the
cooperative relationship under which Intel's microprocessors and
Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems have long dictated the
direction of the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Real Networks deal, Intel is sharing its technology with
a Microsoft competitor in an area that is thought to be crucial to
the future commercialization of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks says that about 30 million people now use its
software. That is believed to give it a substantial lead over
Microsoft, which developed a competing technology, known as
Netshow, then later hedged its bets by paying tens of millions of
dollars for an equity stake in Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Intel-Real Networks deal does not include an Intel
investment, both companies are calling it ``strategic.'' Intel will
license its compression technology for use in the newest version of
Real Networks' multimedia software, Realvideo GE, which is now in
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' ``streaming'' software delivers audio or video in
a stream of bits as it is being heard or watched. That makes it
more like television or radio than were early multimedia
technologies that required a user to download an entire file from
an Internet site before it could be played.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's compression software squeezes a lot of data into a tiny
file so that it can be sent more quickly over the Internet,
resulting in fewer dropped sounds and smoother videos.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving the quality of videos, Intel's
compression technology will reduce the computing power required to
translate video images into a digital format.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives said that while in the past multiple computers
had been needed to encode live video, the new technology would
create video files on a computer running Intel's top-of-the-line
450-megahertz Pentium II microprocessor. The videos can be played
back on standard personal computers at rates ranging from 5,000 to
a million bits a second, depending on the speed of the user's
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use this technology to scale up to full-screen
video,'' said Pat Gelsinger, Intel's vice president and general
manager of desktop products.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger also insisted that the agreement with a Microsoft
competitor was not a break with Intel's earlier strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is business as usual for us,'' he said. ``We've been
developing technology for years, and we've worked with industry
leaders. Our strategy is no way affected by these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The video compression technology was developed at Intel
Architecture Laboratories, the Oregon development site of several
earlier programs and other technologies that touched off quarrels
between Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Intel has attempted to put forward a variety of
hardware and software technologies intended to add new features to
personal computer design. The company's strategy has been to create
market demand for more powerful computer hardware by persuading
computer users to adopt new functions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft has frequently opposed Intel initiatives that
it believe threatens its control over software design through the
Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Glaser, Real Networks' chairman and founder and a former
Microsoft employee, said of Microsoft and Intel, ``The two
companies are becoming more independent as we move more toward a
consumer electronics world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intel technology is referred to as a codec, a shortening of
the term compressor-decompressor. Such programs, which can be
created as either hardware circuits or software routines, compress
and then decompress digitized audio, video or images. &QL;

GOP LAWMAKERS SAY REPRIMAND NOT SEVERE ENOUGH FOR CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans served notice Tuesday
that President Clinton cannot escape impeachment proceedings by
accepting a formal rebuke for his affair with former intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals floating on Capitol Hill include the suggestion that
Clinton could avoid impeachment by accepting censure and
reimbursing the federal government $4.4 million, the estimated cost
of the Lewinsky investigation. House Majority Leader Dick Armey
dismissed such talk as ``blathering'' by Clinton's ``spin team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican said cutting a deal for a reprimand is
``not an option that holds a lot of attraction'' for Republicans.
Rep. Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, the Republican whip, also denounced
censure proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for that is well past,'' DeLay said. ``For now, the
House has no choice but to proceed with an impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry ridiculed the idea that
Clinton should reimburse the federal government. He joked that
Clinton might consider the proposal if independent counsel Kenneth
Starr picks up the tab for the rest of the four-year, $40 million
examination of Clinton's actions as president and as governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment hearings looking increasingly likely, members
of the House Judiciary Committee debated privately whether to
release copies of Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony as
early as Friday. Starr contends that the president committed
perjury on Aug. 17 by lying about his sexual affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, the White House confirmed that Clinton is
receiving weekly spiritual counseling; the president beefed up his
scandal-response team; and a group of about two dozen Democratic
lawmakers, all women, offered emotional support to first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said the women agreed to work
together in trying to shift public attention from the sex scandal
to problems confronting the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sisterhood in that meeting, and the sisterhood
said that women know what's right,'' said Jackson Lee, one of
Clinton's chief allies on the Judiciary Committee. ``We're
nurturers. We're wives, we're mothers, we know what the deal is. We
know what fairness is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But those words of comfort for the Clintons were overshadowed by
blistering critiques of the president's behavior by two House
Democrats. In remarks that underscored Clinton's political
problems, Rep. James Traficant Jr. of Ohio accused Clinton of
trying to place himself above the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Joe Q. Citizen lied to a grand jury, he'd go to jail,''
Traficant said on the House floor. ``Let's tell it like it is. Joe
Q. Citizen can't apologize. Joe Q. Citizen isn't censured. Joe Q.
Citizen is prosecuted. An America with two legal standards is an
America with no legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee, normally a Clinton ally, urged
the president to ``come clean'' about his misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for those of us in this party and this House
to continue to give the president the benefit of the doubt,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, Republican leaders cautioned the Memphis
Democrat that his pointed remarks violated House rules against
direct personal criticism of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said calls to his office are running overwhelmingly
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of anger coming over the phone lines,''
the GOP leader said. ``We've had a flood of phone calls. They've
been pretty reflective of the anger and disappointment the American
people feel, the sense of betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls indicate that the angry calls may not reflect majority
opinion. Three separate polls for television networks in recent
days found that about two-thirds of voters think Clinton should
complete his term. If the findings are accurate, the mood in the
country bears little relationship to the mood in Congress, where
impeachment hearings are considered all but certain by many
lawmakers in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's immediate problem is how to deal with the expected
release of his videotaped testimony, which could come later this
week. The president's allies fear that the video will be used,
possibly in campaign ads, to embarrass Clinton and his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The tape reportedly shows Clinton losing his temper as
investigators ask him about his relationship with Lewinsky. The
president admitted an inappropriate affair, but declined to provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, in this case, the president was choosing his words
very carefully,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who watched the
video in his role as a Judiciary Committee member.
</P>
<P>
   Although testimony to a federal grand jury is supposed to remain
secret, the independent counsel law requires Starr to report any
evidence of impeachable offenses to Congress. Starr also cleared
the delivery with a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   In sending the material to Congress, Starr told lawmakers that
it ``may not be publicly disclosed unless and until authorized by
the House of Representatives.'' The House voted last week to
release Starr's 445-page report summarizing his findings and
directed the Judiciary Committee to decide how much additional
material should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the remaining evidence _ 17 boxes of testimony,
transcripts, audio tapes and other materials _ could be released
with the Clinton video tape this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyers met with Judiciary Committee members Tuesday,
urging them to delete some of the more graphic portions of her
testimony before releasing it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things in Starr's report is a statement that Clinton
may have violated a judicial gag order in discussing his testimony
in the Paula Jones deposition with his secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition, U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright issued a protective order ``that prevented the
parties from discussing their testimony with anyone else,'' Starr's
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright even went further, specifically addressing the admonition
to the president just before he finished.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Clinton's determination to fight, the president
recruited Gregory Craig, a top State Department official, to direct
the White House response to Starr's report. Steve Ricchetti and
Susan Brophy, Democratic operatives with experience on Capitol
Hill, also joined the White House response team.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is using a mix of public and private money to defend
himself. The White House lawyers are supposed to focus on defending
the president in his official capacity. David Kendall, the
president's private attorney, handles personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that Clinton is also receiving weekly
spiritual counseling for what the president has called his ``broken
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual advisers include the Rev. Tony Campolo, an
American Baptist pastor in St. Davids, Pa., and the Rev. Gordon
MacDonald of Grace Chapel Protestant church in Lexington, Mass.
MacDonald is the author of ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,'' which
recounts the religious leader's efforts to put his own extramarital
affair behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to understand what went wrong with him personally
that led to the tragic sins that have so marred his presidency,''
Campolo said. ``We want to provide all the help that we can to
spiritually strengthen him against yielding to the temptations that
have conquered him in the past.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTOWN, Mass. _ Terry Titcomb's son Al was murdered on Nov.
22, 1994. Sandy King lost two of her sons to murder, in 1986 and
1991. Both women are natives of Charlestown, a one-square-mile
district on the north edge of Boston that has the highest rate of
unsolved murders in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Both are members of Charlestown After Murder, a group of mothers
who try to make sense of their collective losses. ``It's not
something we're going to get over, or we're going to get through,''
Ms. King said. ``Our lives stopped on the days our kids were
murdered. I don't think I've looked forward once in the 12 years
since my son was murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   From Thursday through Saturday, on three consecutive nights, the
stories of Ms. Titcomb, Ms. King and other bereaved Charlestown
mothers will be projected in video onto the Bunker Hill Monument,
Charlestown's most conspicuous and famous public structure.
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Wodiczko, a Polish-born conceptual artist, will
transform the 221-foot Egyptian-style obelisk into a nighttime
granite goddess, its massive form first made to seem weightless
through animation, and then weighty with the gravity of these
mothers' tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility of enormous communication when you
project contemporary images onto historic monuments,'' said
Wodiczko, who was recently awarded the Hiroshima Art Prize for his
achievement in contemporary art and his contribution to world
peace. ``We should be able to call those monuments into question,
to ask them what they think about what is happening today, and ask
ourselves if we still believe in the ideals of those monuments. We
should even be able to make those monuments shocked and
astonished.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in Warsaw during the ghetto uprising in 1943, Wodiczko
graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1968. In 1977
he immigrated to Canada, and he now lives in New York City and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, he has been on the faculty of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Wodiczko is best known for his socially
and politically charged public projections. In 1985, he projected
the image of the swastika onto the pediment of the South Africa
House in Trafalgar Square in London. The act drew an official
letter of protest from the South African government.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, he projected four alternating images of a
human eye onto the pediment of the Bundeshaus (Capitol) in Bern,
Switzerland. The eye appeared to move, nervously surveying the
nearby Bern City Bank, the Canton Bank, the National Bank of Bern
and then the Swiss gold reserve stored in a vault beneath the
pavement of the Bundesplatz.
</P>
<P>
   Wodiczko has used the Soldiers and Sailors Civil War Memorial in
Boston as a screen for images of Boston's homeless people, and the
facade of the Martin Luther Church in Kassel, Germany, as a
backdrop for a figure wearing a gas mask and a protective suit with
his hands folded in prayer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Charlestown projection was born as part of ``Let Freedom
Ring,'' a series of four temporary art installations set along
Boston's historic Freedom Trail this month. ``Let Freedom Ring'' is
the brainchild of Jill Medvedow, the director of Boston's Institute
of Contemporary Art and the founder of Vita Brevis, which promotes
contemporary public art in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Wodiczko, the project features Jim Hodges, a New York
City artist who has hung a series of wind chimes in Boston's Old
North Church; Mildred Howard, a San Francisco artist who has
installed a pair of railroad tracks in the city's Old South Meeting
House, and Barbara Steinman, an artist from Montreal who has
decorated the Parkman Bandstand on the Boston Common with large
cloth banners bearing the images of sites and monuments on the
Common. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use the history and the landscape of Boston as a
meditation on the themes of freedom and tyranny,'' Ms. Medvedow
said. ``I thought this would give them room for work that could
range from the poetic to the polemic. As this was our first
project, I also wanted to have a ringer. And Krzysztof is
definitely my ringer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Wodiczko, the choice of the Bunker Hill Monument was almost
academic. ``It was clear that this structure is one that asks for
this type of intervention,'' he said. ``There was no other
structure of similar symbolic power, nothing that was carved into
the collective memory of the city as much as this one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Wodiczko's Boston projection took a little longer
to evolve. Initially, he planned to focus on the problems of
immigrants and homeless people in neighborhoods across the city.
Then he discovered Charlestown's high murder rate _ the district of
15,000 people had at least three murders a year from 1975 through
1996 _ and the rigid code of silence that left 74 percent of those
murders unsolved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a good thing for the members of this community to
be afraid to report on these murders to the police,'' Wodiczko
said. ``Silence and invisibility are the biggest enemies of
democracy. If people don't open up, if they don't provide an
unsolicited act of free speech on behalf of the general well being,
then democracy cannot be practiced. If you have a self-imposed
silence, then you cannot exercise your First Amendment right. And
if you cannot speak, none of your other constitutional rights can
be exercised.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mothers of Charlestown After Murder were initially skeptical
of Wodiczko and his proposal. ``Here was this guy from another
country, whom we didn't know,'' Ms. King said. ``How could he
possibly understand Charlestown, our community, our feelings of
loss?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wodiczko did his homework. He walked the streets of
Charlestown. He visited housing projects at night and spoke with
residents. He shared elements of his own personal tragedy,
including the murder of his mother in the Warsaw Ghetto one week
after he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, he invited the Charlestown After Murder
group to view a video that he had projected onto the tower of the
14th-century City Hall in Cracow, Poland, in 1996. The video
featured several women from Cracow who had suffered domestic abuse,
and who told their stories. Only their hands were visible. One
woman held a candle. Another peeled a potato with the same knife
with which her alcoholic husband had threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of these Cracow residents _ residents, in Wodiczko's
words, ``not of the city of culture, but of the city of pain'' _
made the tower animate. And they deeply impressed the Charlestown
community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just amazing to hear these women talk about their
experiences,'' Ms. Titcomb said. ``To see their hands telling the
story. And I thought, wow, he wants to do something like that here
on the Bunker Hill Monument.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a teeming confluence of past and present in Wodiczko's
Bunker Hill Monument projection. Built in 1825, the monument
commemorates the Revolutionary War battle of nearby Breed's Hill, a
battle the colonists lost, but one that changed the course of the
war because of the high number of British casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a glorious loss,'' Wodiczko said. ``And those who
fought it are the heroes of the revolution. In the same way, these
Charlestown mothers have lost their battle. Their lives are in a
sense ruined. But because they are organized, because they have the
courage to come forward and speak, the meaning of their lives is
saved. These women are the heroines of the democratic process. And
democracy is our most difficult project, one that will never be
done.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans, getting a fixed reading on what the folks back home
think about President Clinton's behavior was not too tough a task.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Meagher Northup, R-Ky., attended a parade near Louisville
over the weekend to a chorus of, ``Impeach him. Impeach him.'' It
sounded, she said, like ``Crucify him, crucify him.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the East Coast, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said it took
him 90 minutes to walk five blocks in Manhattan's Upper West Side
because people were so furious about all this impeachment talk. His
answering machine ran out of tape by mid-afternoon. ``What they
were saying was a variation of, `Stop this nonsense. Don't impeach
the president. This is absurd.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the House, members from swing districts or
from places where reactions tend to be more muted and tempered, the
messages from home about the independent counsel's report have been
decidedly more mixed and difficult to sum-up in a simple sound
bite. That makes their jobs considerably more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinion is still very split and very fluid,'' said Rep. Philip
English, R-Pa. ``A fair number of people are uncomfortable with the
situation. They don't like what the president has done, but they're
not sure what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
last Friday, lawmakers say they have heard from constituents in
record numbers, at supermarkets, synagogues and political rallies.
Their offices have been deluged with phone calls, e-mail messages,
and letters from citizens venting their rage and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say they have noted a distinction between people
who are actively calling their offices, most of whom voice
overwhelming support for Clinton's ouster, and voters who engage
members of Congress in conversation at picnics and barbecues and
breakfast meetings.
</P>
<P>
   These voters are furious with Clinton, who they believe has
debased the office of the presidency, and offended by his behavior.
The problem is that they can't figure out what sort of punishment
is appropriate for a president who lied about a sexual romp with a
21-year-old former intern but who many believe has done a
relatively good job.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the opinions of people who represent this broad swath
of the public that will likely determine Clinton's fate in the
Congress. Back in Tennessee, Rep. Bob Clement, a Democrat, said a
whole cross-section of his constituents are torn over whether the
president's actions warrant impeachment, resignation, censure or
anything besides personal and historical humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consensus,'' said Clement. ``Among the general
population it's mixed. But they do want us to move expeditiously.
They don't want it dragged out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said he had received 105 calls,
running two-to-one in favor of impeachment. But of the people back
home who Boehlert spoke to after church or at the corner store,
many seemed to hold less extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of shaking their heads in disbelief,''
Boehlert said. ``Nobody likes the idea of going through
impeachment. The majority of people I represent who have spoken to
me feel that the president has lost his moral compass. More want to
have him removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are a number of people who are genuinely
torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. Northup said that among certain communities in her
district there is a sense of uncertainty. ``More people were
saying, get him out,'' she said, adding that her office received
180 phone calls by Monday with 135 of the callers gunning for
impeachment. ``But not everybody, especially communities with a
deep abiding allegiance to this president. They don't want to
imagine it has to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, the gyrations of the president's lawyers over
his statements and whether they are legally accurate appear to be
counter-productive. ``In Middle America they don't see that as
anything other than telling a lie,'' she said. ``Any other
equivocation makes them mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said he made his rounds at a parade, a
breakfast meeting and a hog roast over the weekend. While many
people, including some Democrats, wanted to order-up instant
impeachment, he was surprised to hear so many constituents express
doubts about what Congress should do by way of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people saying, the guy is sick,'' LaHood said.
``But they are simply not sure. People are confused about whether
these are impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators from across the country echoed the sentiments of many
House members.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said that people are furious at Clinton
but they are also furious at Starr. ``There is still signs among
people of confusion,'' he said. But, he said, many of them ``wish
this wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she is hearing the same kind
of ambiguity from voters in her home state, although she noted she
received 95 phone messages going 6-to-1 in favor of impeachment.
``People did not recommend to me a specific course of action,''
Collins said. ``They didn't, in most cases, call for his
impeachment. I don't think they've decided what ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this lack of consensus, however, House members and
senators said that even among this wishy-washier, broad middle
cross-section of the population, people are disgusted and appalled
about the turn-of-events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Maine are offended by nature of relationship and the
lying,'' said Collins. ``One woman came up to me at a rally and
said, 'If my boss did that, he'd be out of there.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton hired a raft of fresh advisers
and dispatched his top aides to placate congressional Democrats on
Tuesday, as members of the House Judiciary Committee bickered over
whether to release a videotape of his grand jury testimony about
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats accused Republicans of needlessly rushing to
release embarrassing television images of the president, but the
Republicans, who have the votes in the Judiciary Committee to force
the disclosure, argued that the testimony would help the public
judge whether the president had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   That question _ whether the president lied and whether he is now
trying to dodge behind a wall of legalistic language _ continued to
bedevil him, as several House and Senate Democrats angrily
criticized the White House in private meetings on Tuesday. Erskine
Bowles, the chief of staff, and other top aides tried to reassure
the congressional Democrats that Clinton was not resorting to
thinly sliced legal distinctions in rebuffing accusations of
perjury by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should be worried that renegade Democrats might
call for Clinton to resign, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said: ``They
should worry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of television appearances on Sunday, Clinton's
lawyers insisted that the president had not lied under oath in
denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but many Democrats
as well as Republicans dismissed their remarks as finely nuanced
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said that Bowles repeated the White House message of
recent days _ that the president had made a terrible mistake and
was sorry. But Kerrey continued to express concern that the White
House was relying on distinctions that would be lost on most
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a necessity to make a legal case,'' he said,
``but his most difficult case is the political case.'' That was a
reference to the possibility of impeachment proceedings in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the private meetings, the White House took other
steps on Thursday to try to put its relationship with Capitol Hill
on a firmer footing. It announced that Clinton had hired Gregory
Craig, director of policy planning at the State Department, to
serve as special counsel coordinating the reponse to Congress over
the Lewinsky matter. Clinton also brought back two former
legislative aides, Steve Ricchetti and Susan Brophy, as senior
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers expressed concern about the release of his
videotaped testimony. The Judiciary Committee may meet on Thursday,
and if it decides to release the tape, it could do so as early as
Friday. Last Friday, the House released Starr's report. On Tuesday,
Congress was told the Lewinsky matter cost $4.5 million to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not reviewed the videotape, because Clinton
and his lawyers do not have a copy, White House officials said. But
one aide said that a tape of any person's hours-long grand jury
testimony would produce unflattering moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the way TV will play it, they'll pick a piece
of it and play it over and over and over again,'' the aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said. ``It's not a pleasant
thing to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one camera filmed the testimony, so the prosecutor are not
shown. Clinton's advisers have said that he became quite angry and
even erupted at a couple of points during the questioning, which
was often confrontational. Clinton's allies in the White House and
on Capitol Hill are concerned that television news programs will
show the displays of anger without first showing the many minutes
of questioning that preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape will also show Clinton repeatedly refusing to
answer some questions and offering carefully calibrated answers to
others, according to descriptions of his testimony in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday morning, Clinton's senior aides
received some reassuring news in a meeting with pollsters and other
outside advisers. Three Democratic pollsters _ Mark Mellman, Geoff
Garin and Mark Penn _ told the group that there was no evidence
that Clinton's troubles would suppress Democratic turnout this
fall, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said that some elements of the Democrats' loyal
base, including black voters, may be more likely to go to the polls
because of a perception that Clinton was unfairly under attack.
They also noted that Clinton's job approval ratings remained
strong, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included Loyd Cutler, the longtime Washington
lawyer, and Peter Kadzick, another Washington lawyer who is playing
an informal advisory role at the White House. One participant said
the group discussed how the White House should mount a defense as
the case moves to Congress. ``The consensus is that public opinion
is really going to drive this process now,'' he said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This city is throwing a party for more than 30 oil
ministers and 8,000 other officials and executives from at least 82
countries this week. To make sure everyone attending the World
Energy Council Congress feels sufficiently welcome, the city
greeted them Saturday night with a light show featuring 2 million
watts of spotlights, 14 powerful lasers and 12 tons of explosives,
enough to make car alarms wail all over downtown. Coming Thursday
is what is being billed as the state's largest sit-down dinner
ever, requiring a banquet hall also known as the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the local brand of relentless hospitality can make
up for oil prices that nobody here wants to celebrate. So this
week's gathering of the most powerful figures in world energy has
become only a brief break from a new and unexpected round of
cutbacks and even, in some cases, layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, executives griped about the bonuses they had to
pay to hire and keep geophysicists. Now they wonder how to keep
those geophysicists busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you found anybody who is not cutting back?'' asked former
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. He recounted how the Houston
company that bears his name had delayed planned drilling in
Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and several foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Compared, of course, with the industry's roller coaster ride
through the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s might seem more like swan
boats. Still, companies that boasted last year of having the
slimmed-down staffs and the new oil-finding technologies to weather
low oil prices are now saying that by ``low'' they never meant the
current $14 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is suffering from reverse sticker shock,'' said
Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates and one of the meeting's featured speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Natural Resources chief executive Scott Sheffield, for
example, gathered his employees Tuesday afternoon to urge them to
cut every expense.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer completed about $5 billion in acquisitions last year,
becoming one of the nation's largest independent oil companies. It
also contracted for drilling services at top dollar. This year, to
help pay down $2 billion in assumed debt, Pioneer has had to
dispose of about 10 percent of its properties. Exploration and
production outlays have been cut to $450 million from $600 million
this year and will drop to $300 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flying high until oil prices cratered,'' said Pioneer
public relations chief Marsha Sheffield before leaving to help her
husband prepare his cost-cutting appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The major oil companies _ with interests in refineries, gas
stations and petrochemical plants _ are more diversified and
financially stronger, but not immune. Texaco has trimmed its $4.6
billion exploration and production budget by about 10 percent.
Texaco chief executive Peter Bijur and his hovering publicists
stressed in interviews here that the operative word was
``deferred,'' not canceled or cut.
</P>
<P>
   The oil field services companies, however, are past the point of
maintaining the appearance of normalcy. Nabors Industries, the
world's largest land driller, has cut nearly 3,000 workers across
the oil patch from a peak of 13,000 last fall. A year ago, Nabors
had to ask customers wanting rigs and crews how long they could
wait. Now the only question is, ``How soon can we start?''
</P>
<P>
   Among other oil field service companies, EVI Weatherford laid
off 1,300 of its more than 11,000 employees this year, and
Schlumberger laid off 700 of its 9,200 domestic oil field service
employees through July.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, and Texas more generally, where technology has passed
energy as the state's largest employer, are unlikely to feel nearly
the pain of the 1980's. Then, entire Houston office towers and
subdivisions were left vacant as developers and homeowners walked
away from their properties and their payments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, through July, oil and gas production gave the Houston
region 3,800 new jobs. Through July this year, the industry lost
100 jobs. Over all, the continuing expansion in retailing and
construction had allowed the area to keep adding jobs at a strong
pace. But Robert Gilmer, a Federal Reserve economist based in
Houston, said those sectors were coasting on the energy industry's
past strength; he predicted a slowdown for the rest of the year.
Without a stronger energy business, he said, ``We can't survive for
long by taking in each other's laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's bane is the nation's boon, however, as low energy
prices help sustain strong economic growth with scant inflation.
But oil exporting nations like Russia and Mexico are being pinched.
</P>
<P>
   The World Energy Council, representing the interests of energy
producers across several industries, gathers in a different spot
every three years. This year's formal sessions are concentrating on
technology _ both to improve efficiency, and reduce pollution.
Breakfasts, lunches, receptions and dinners, meanwhile, often
combine deal-making and international diplomacy, all the more so
now that British Petroleum had agreed to buy Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   At a Monday breakfast, drilling company executives vied for the
attention of the guest of honor, Luis Giusti, chief executive of
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the Venezuelan national oil company.
Even Venezuela, having displaced Saudi Arabia as the United States'
largest foreign source of oil, has cut its capital budget, mostly
for exploration and production, to $4 billion from $6 billion. ``I
think the $18 to $20 oil era is going to be replaced by the $14 to
$16 era,'' Giusti said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The experts attribute low oil prices to feuds among exporters
and the near-evaporation of Asian demand. U.S. energy companies at
least have the consolation of steady natural gas prices. But with
huge volumes in storage, these companies are praying as fervently
as ski resort operators for a frigid winter. Outside investors like
Thomas Hicks and Richard Rainwater are raising their stakes, with
Rainwater even buying oil futures.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Houston's oilmen _ and, in the 1990s, oilwomen _ have
remained optimistic enough to avoid serious cutbacks on life's
necessities. But, chastened perhaps by past reversals, they have
far fewer necessities than in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, recalled Stephen Zimmerman, owner of La Colombe d'Or,
a restaurant and hotel installed in an oil baron's mansion, oilmen
would begin with Dom Perignon, move on to choice burgundies and
first-growth bordeaux _ ``whatever they could pronounce'' _ and
finish with $100 shots of century-old armagnac.
</P>
<P>
   And that was for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1980s crash. Zimmerman had a friend deliver an oil
barrel, planted it in his entrance hall and pegged the price of
lunch to the price of crude.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the best of recent times, his biggest seller had
been the house wine, and then only at dinner. ``The newer guys
never learned to entertain,'' he sniffed. ``A lot of them think a
Caesar salad and grilled chicken breast is a gourmet meal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman, for one, has made provisions in case a still
lower oil price compels an even more modest style. Back in the
garage sits the oil barrel, ready for its return.

FCC RESPONDS TO ITS DIGITAL TV CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission lashed back Tuesday at critics in the telecommunications
industry who have blamed his agency for problems plaguing the
introduction of digital-television services, scheduled to begin in
just six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the television programming and manufacturing
industries have faulted the commission for not setting clear rules
and standards for digital broadcasts and related equipment. In many
cases, the commission chose instead to let industry set the
standards itself. That has led to interindustry disagreements and
crippling incompatibilities in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the first high-definition sets now on sale cannot
receive HDTV programming from cable systems because the standards
for the cable that connects the set to the cable box have not been
completed _ an unresolved interindustry detail for which some set
makers blame the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to a group of broadcasters Tuesday, William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, called the criticisms self-serving
efforts to ``goad the government by playing the blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses ask his agency for help, Kennard said, ``only if
they think government will give them a regulatory advantage.'' If
not, he added, ``They'll try to keep government out.''
</P>
<P>
   The government should get involved, Kennard added, only ``when
arguments are distorted by the prism of self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Sony Corp. plans to announce Wednesday that unlike
other television manufacturers it will sell a high-definition
television set that is a conventional-style table-top model with a
picture tube, beginning in November. Every other manufacturer plans
to sell large rear-projection sets, some as big as a compact
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the TV's sold today are conventional
models with a picture tube, known as ``direct view'' sets. That
leaves many industry analysts asking how the transition to digital
television can succeed, as long as manufacturers offer digital sets
in a style that is not popular with most buyers.
</P>
<P>
   James Palumbo, a Sony vice president, said his company chose
direct-view because such sets offered the highest picture quality,
and that he believed Sony would gain a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the market will initially have a bigger audience for
direct-view sets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers are not producing direct-view sets now
because they are more complicated to manufacture and still cannot
display an HDTV image at its highest level of resolution. Sony
executives acknowledged that without saying what level of
resolution their HDTV would offer. ``It's misleading to do that,''
said James Bonan, another Sony vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But in one respect, Sony's strategy is similar to that of the
other companies. They are all entering the high-definition
television market with high-end products loaded with options and
added features _ and extraordinarily high price tags. With rare
exceptions, the first high-definition television sets will sell for
at least $8,000. Sony's 34-inch direct-view set will be priced at
$9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, in his speech to the International Television and Radio
Society in New York on Tuesday, said no one should be concerned
with the high initial prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you control for inflation,'' he said, ``the first color
sets in 1955 cost about $4,500.'' (Actually, RCA put the first
color television on the market in 1953, and it cost $1,000 _ just
over $6,000 in today's dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennard added, ``The entire history of the introduction and
pricing of consumer-electronics equipment tells us that soon
enough, digital-television receivers will be increasingly
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's not kid ourselves,'' he continued. ``The
digital-television rollout will be complicated.'' He urged
patience, ``for the transition to digital TV is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Palumbo said Sony management held a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' he said, ``trial and error.'' &QL;

`THE ROSEANNE SHOW': LESS GUM, MORE BRAINS

<P>
   For some of us, daytime talk shows, with their celebrity puffery
and soap-sister schmaltz, are as enticing as poison ivy. And the
prospect of a talk show starring Roseanne seemed as unnatural as
poison ivy with sound effects, notably a loud cackle. Never
predict, because the show on Monday was surprisingly smart and
winning, a mix of sharp topical conversation, occasional comedy
sketches and social work without sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roseanne Show'' (syndicated nationally and seen in New
York City weekdays at 3 on Channel 4) reveals the intelligence that
has so often been hidden behind the crude, gum-snapping Roseanne of
the hit blue-collar sitcom and the cosmetic surgery that
transformed her face. This calmer Roseanne makes jokes and has
pointed opinions, but she also listens to her guests. After her
many publicity-seeking metamorphoses, she may have found her best
and truest role yet.
</P>
<P>
   Her entrance on the first show on Monday led to the worst
expectations, as she played the cackling diva. She appeared from
above riding in a cherry picker, wearing a boa, strewing rose
petals over the audience and snapping her own photograph with a
Polaroid. But that self-absorption quickly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   With her first guest, Whoopi Goldberg, she discussed the Clinton
affair (``There isn't one person in the country who can live up to
the standards we set,'' said Ms. Goldberg), marriage (``You've been
married four times and I've only been married three,'' said
Roseanne) and motherhood. Unlike most talk-show interviews, this
was truly a two-way conversation as they sat on a stage designed to
look like a comfy, spacious living room, with leopard-print chairs
and a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation grew more serious when Ms. Goldberg recalled
getting a phone call some years ago, when her daughter was only 14,
saying she was pregnant and wanted to have the baby. Ms. Goldberg
supported her. ``I would kick my kid's butt,'' said Roseanne,
voicing a more typical reaction without pressing the point.
</P>
<P>
   There was a point to this conversation. Later, she and Ms.
Goldberg sat on the edge of the stage, eye to eye with three
teen-age mothers in the audience. ``In the '70s, we were both
welfare mothers,'' Roseanne said, as she and Ms. Goldberg exploded
stereotypes and pointed out how lives can change. Sympathetic and
questioning, they asked the teen-agers to become each other's
support group and to come back in a month. Such dry-eyed social
awareness may turn out to be one of the show's most significant
features.
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Goldberg was plugging her own show, a new version of the
old ``Hollywood Squares'' game, syndicated by the same company as
``Roseanne.'' This strained new version may feature hip guests like
Andy Dick, but it is more painful than funny. It also began Monday,
and is seen in New York weeknights at 7:30 on Channel 2.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, comedy on ``The Roseanne Show'' has included a mock
interview, with Nora Dunn playing a familiar character with a blond
wig, brown pant suit and sneering mouth. The intentionally
misspelled identification on screen called her, ``Linder Tripp, Big
Fat Snitch.'' The writing was not as sharp as it could have been,
but the fact that a political sketch existed was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling whether ``The Roseanne Show'' will live up to
its best potential or stumble fast. Tuesday's show was far less
impressive, devoted almost entirely to an interview with Jerry
Springer and a parody of his hair-pulling interviews. Even while
she was throwing bouquets at Springer, though, Roseanne managed to
pose a question that was both jokey and supremely trenchant. ``Why
do we all love your show so much?'' she asked. ``What's wrong with
us?''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne obviously does not mean her show to become a model of
decorum. And she does not mean it to be like anything else on the
air. It promises to be as shrewdly conceived as the many earlier
stages of her career, and a lot more intriguing.

HOPE FLOATS FOR BOAT IN RETURN TO TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Good things happen to Billy Boat when he
comes to Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Pep Boys Indy Racing League driver twice has raced at the
track in far north Fort Worth and twice has taken the checkered
flag.
</P>
<P>
   OK, his victory in the 1997 True Value 500K was taken away when
a postrace scoring audit revealed Arie Luyendyk was the real
winner. Boat still finished second, his career-best finish at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   And that was his second-best finish until he won the IRL night
race at TMS in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back to Texas looking for a little vindication and
were able to get the victory for good,'' said Boat, who drives the
No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora for A.J. Foyt Racing. ``I've always
enjoyed coming to the racetrack. I'm definitely looking forward to
coming back and getting back in Victory Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat is looking for more good things as the IRL returns for the
running of the Lone Star 500K on Sunday, because nothing much has
gone right for him since he left TMS.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the True Value 500K, Boat's hopes came crashing
down when he wrecked at the next race, the New England 200. He
sustained a broken leg and fractured pelvis and missed the next two
races.
</P>
<P>
   He was second in the standings, three points out of first, after
winning at TMS. He has since fallen to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little bit frustrating since Texas,'' he said.
``We left there on such a high.''
</P>
<P>
   After his two-race absence, Boat returned to win the pole at
Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colo., setting a
track record, and was running second late in the race. But his car
ran of gas two laps from the end, and Boat finished ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was disappointing because we had a top-five, top-three
race car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He won the pole again and set another track record at the next
race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. It was his fourth pole of the
season, tying reigning IRL champion Tony Stewart for the series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   A mistake on a pit stop put him a lap down, but he got the lap
back and thought he could win the race. Instead, a wreck ended his
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good race car at the end,'' he said. ``I felt
we could just drive through the field and go for the win. Then I
got tangled with a lapped car on a restart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fast, we just haven't been able to put it all
together. It's frustrating when you feel you have a shot to win and
you have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat has had enough problems. He returns to TMS trying to
salvage what once was a promising season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to win the pole and win the race,'' he said. ``We
haven't finished enough races this year. We need to come into the
last two races and get some good finishes, and try to get into the
top five in the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat said he is healthy enough to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as day-to-day, normal things you do I'm still
recovering,'' he said. ``But as far as driving the race car, I'm
100 percent. It's probably going to be another couple of months
before I'm back to where I can play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's definitely in the right place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a race driver, you always have places you go to
that seem to treat you better than other places,'' he said of the
1.5-mile trioval. ``Texas Motor Speedway has been one of those
tracks for me that I like to go to. It's a very fun race for the
whole team because it's in A.J.'s home state, we have a lot of
support there and I really love the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any place you win on you like to come back to.''

`LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN': 5 YEARS OF AMIABLE WIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes at end of reviews. Time, channel are for New
York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conan O'Brien's funny, inventive ``Late Night'' arrives in prime
time with a special of highlights from the first five years. An
opening routine perfectly captures the show's self-mocking tone, as
O'Brien presents a montage of his changing hairstyles, a standard
anniversary-show gimmick that here takes a swift, silly turn into
parody. O'Brien often makes fun of his pasty white skin and
shocking red hair, but he has never looked goofier than he does
with flowing, corn-rowed red locks.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien took over ``Late Night'' after David Letterman
moved to CBS, he inherited more than the title. Letterman, from a
generation raised on television, is still the master of the style
that satirizes the old talk-show format. (Chronologically, Jay Leno
belongs to the Letterman boomer generation, but psychologically
he's a throwback to the Carson days, and his straightforward
approach seems increasingly stale.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien shares the ironic Letterman approach of goofy taped
routines and mock guests. But he has developed his own style as an
amiable, quick-witted interviewer. He is a Letterman without the
dark side, a Leno not afraid to show some smarts.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary show includes the signature ``Late Night''
routine in which fake talking lips are superimposed on still
photographs, putting unlikely words in famous mouths. O'Brien
interviews the fake Bill Clinton (a hog-hollerin' good old boy),
Vernon Jordan and Bob Dole. There are also clips of video parodies
featuring O'Brien and his sidekick, Andy Richter, whose
straight-faced sincerity provides a mordant foil to O'Brien's
high-pitched energy.
</P>
<P>
   What matters about a talk show, of course, is how well it wears
night after night; a clip-filled special cannot capture that. And
this anniversary show seriously underplays the importance of the
``Late Night'' band, the Max Weinberg 7, which leaves television
viewers wishing they were in the studio to hear more. But the
special includes enough comic highlights to explain why ``Late
Night With Conan O'Brien,'' famously on life support in its early
days, has become addictively entertaining.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A record $25 million has been given to Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts by a new board member, Julian H. Robertson
Jr., the hedge fund investor. Announcing the gift Tuesday, Lincoln
Center officials said the fountain plaza was being renamed in honor
of Robertson's wife, Josie.
</P>
<P>
   They called it the largest single gift to the center by an
individual and said the money would be divided among Lincoln
Center's own artistic programs and its 12 constituent members, with
the largest share going to members through outright grants.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the gift even more unusual is that it was given in a
lump sum instead of being spread out over several years, as large
contributions often are. Among other things, the money will help
underwrite new series, like one on American popular standards that
is to start in February, said Nathan Leventhal, Lincoln Center's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 66, chairman and chief executive officer of Tiger
Management, the multibillion dollar investment fund he and a
partner started with $8 million in 1980, said he intended the gift
as a surprise for his wife, who was not to learn of it until a
ceremony Tuesday night on the south portico of Avery Fisher Hall
overlooking the new Josie Robertson Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Revson Fountain will retain its name in honor of a 1962 gift
by the Revlon Foundation in honor of the cosmetics executive
Charles Revson.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the gift grew out of discussions with Beverly
Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, before he joined the
Lincoln Center board this summer. ``I asked Beverly if something
there was appropriate,'' and she suggested the form of the gift.
``It was just perfect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the money with the artistic constituents seemed
particularly adroit politically in view of Lincoln Center's history
of rivalries over programming and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sills praised the gift, saying, ``I don't expect to have
another $25 million in my hand anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now the largest gift to Lincoln Center was $15 million,
given nearly 10 years ago by Fred Rose of Rose Associates, the real
estate developers, to build the Rose building, which houses offices
for Lincoln Center and its film society, dormitories for the
Juilliard School and performance space for the Lincoln Center
Institute, which offers teacher training in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $25 million from Robertson, Lincoln Center said that $10
million would go to create the Josie Robertson Fund for Lincoln
Center in support of artistic programs presented by the center
itself, including Mostly Mozart, the Lincoln Center Festival,
Midsummer Night Swing and Lincoln Center Out of Doors and the
``Live From Lincoln Center'' and ``Great Performances'' television
series.
</P>
<P>
   Producing these programs costs Lincoln Center $18 million a
year, subsidized in part by an existing $6 million artistic
endowment. With the new gift, this portion of the endowment would
grow to $16 million, officials said. In addition, Lincoln Center
has $109 million in other endowment funds, a spokeswoman, Janice
Price, said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $15 million of Robertson's gift is to be divided
among the 12 constituents, including Lincoln Center itself, by an
existing grant- and cost-sharing formula related to size.
</P>
<P>
   The largest constituent, the Metropolitan Opera, would receive
about $4 million, and the others would get diminishing amounts down
to $250,000 each for a number of the small constituents, including
the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the New York Philharmonic, the Chamber Music
Society, the New York City Opera, the New York City Ballet, Lincoln
Center Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center and the School of American
Ballet, along with the film society and Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money can be used for anything,'' Ms. Sills said. ``That's
what makes it so unusual.''

CHIPPING AWAY AT THE MYTHS THAT ENCRUST A BLUES LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ohio)   (Tony Scherman is the author of the forthcoming ``Backbeat: Earl
Palmer's Story.'')  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By TONY SCHERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the great blues singer and guitarist Robert Johnson
died 60 years ago, swallowed up at 27 by the rural Mississippi
demiworld of juke joints and barrelhouses that spawned him, he
looms ever larger in America's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had been dead for 23 years when an LP of his songs,
``King of the Delta Blues Singers,'' was released in 1961. It
became a sacred text to '60s folk and blues revivalists as well as
to rock-and-rollers curious about rock's origins. ``There has not
been a better album in the history of the recording industry,''
wrote the critic Greil Marcus in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after protracted legal wrangling, came ``Robert
Johnson: The Complete Recordings'': two CDs, 29 songs and 12
outtakes. Improbably, it became the record-business phenomenon of
the winter of 1990-91, briefly outselling Madonna, winning a Grammy
and going on to sell more than a million copies worldwide.
Fifty-three years after his death, Robert Johnson was a pop star.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards of culture and entertainment are eager to tap his
new audience. ``King of the Delta Blues Singers'' was reissued
earlier this month, featuring a newly discovered outtake of one of
Johnson's best songs, ``Traveling Riverside Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame kicks off a weeklong
Johnson celebration in and around its Cleveland headquarters:
concerts, a conference of scholars and writers (including this one)
and a pre-release showing of ``Can't You Hear the Wind Howl,'' a
documentary about Johnson narrated by Danny Glover.
</P>
<P>
   The better known Johnson's music becomes, the more there is at
stake in scraping away the myths and distortions that encrust it,
distractions from the only question about Johnson that really
matters: What makes his music great? His apocryphal pact with the
Devil, easily the best-known aspect of his legend, has little
relevance to his music. Although it's hip, especially since his
rise to pop iconhood, to call him ``the original rock-and-roller,''
the notion is unilluminating at best.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated, but in the end just as specious, is the
argument of revisionist blues scholars that Johnson is merely a
link in the chain of Delta bluesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The only antidote to these misconceptions is to listen to Robert
Johnson's music with as fresh an ear as possible. The more I listen
to Johnson, and I've listened for 30 years now, the surer I am that
he is a crucial 20th-century artist, whose work stops just short of
comparison with America's greatest novelists, poets, visual artists
and composers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who rediscovered Johnson in the early '60s tended to see
him as sui generis, an isolated visionary. Since then,
musicologists have acquired a nuanced understanding of the blues
style that flowered in northwest Mississippi and eastern Arkansas
in the '20s and '30s. Far from developing in isolation, say the
revisionists, Johnson was very much part of a tradition: the
Mississippi Delta blues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the extent to which Johnson absorbed the styles of
earlier bluesmen is only now being appreciated. But to listen to
Johnson's precursors _ Charley Patton, Son House and others _ and
then to Johnson is to become aware of an unbridgeable gulf, the
distance between mastery and genius. Patton and House were OF the
Delta blues tradition; Johnson rose above it. The music of Patton,
House or Skip James seems to issue from a distant time and place.
Johnson sounds utterly contemporary _ rather, timeless. For what
you hear in Johnson's music is the same naked confrontation with
the cosmos, with the awful, elemental facts of love, betrayal,
isolation and death, that you find in all great art. Creators like
Johnson may build on tradition, but at transcendent moments they
kick it away; it becomes irrelevant, and their pure, urgent message
burns through.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the first stanza of ``Crossroads Blues.'' Johnson
walks down to a country crossroads, looking to hitch a ride. Does
he stick out his thumb? No, he flings himself on his knees, ``asked
the Lord above, `Have mercy/ Save poor Bob if you please.''' It's
an image of the most desperate supplication, which could easily
turn into fist-shaking rage: at God, the universe, fate. The
lyrics, moreover, do only half the job; Johnson's knifelike
bottleneck-guitar lines screw the intensity level a notch higher.
</P>
<P>
   Against powerful evidence like ``Crossroads Blues,'' a few
recent writers have tried to reduce Johnson entirely to his
influences. The work of blues historian Stephen Calt typifies this
crude reductionism. In Calt's liner notes to an otherwise useful
album, ``The Roots of Robert Johnson,'' almost every Johnson song
is seen as an appropriation (and as often as not, an inferior one)
of an earlier tune. ``If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day'' is
nothing but a ``rendition'' of the old dance tune ``Rollin' and
Tumblin''' and ``Hellhound on My Trail'' a mere ``version'' of Skip
James' ``Devil Got My Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   All Delta bluesmen, Johnson included, shared a floating stock of
lyrics, melodies and rhythmic figures. The magnificent (and
magnificently titled) ``If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day''
indeed takes its skeletal form, and even some of its lyrics, from
``Rollin' and Tumblin' ,'' but the result, in its apocalyptic fury,
is irreducibly Johnson's. ``Hellhound on My Trail'' may or may not
be based on ``Devil Got My Woman''; regardless, it travels its own
chilling path. What Calt misses entirely, in other words, is the
inner fire that lights Johnson's music (a failure that is cause for
concern, since Calt is writing a full-length Johnson biography;
when it appears, it will be the first).
</P>
<P>
   Woody Guthrie built his songs on earlier ones too, but nobody
would call ``This Land Is Your Land'' a rendition of ``You Are My
Sunshine.'' The interesting question is not what makes Robert
Johnson's music the same as his forebears', but what makes it
different.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fame has always rested largely on extramusical
grounds: his short life, its lurid end (he was reputedly poisoned
by a jealous husband) and, above all, the legend that he bargained
with Satan for his talent.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Johnson's deal with the Devil may deliver a frisson
to the casually curious, but it tells us next to nothing about his
music. To rural Mississippians in the '30s, musicians who plied
their trade outside the church were in league with Satan. Johnson
may well have advertised an intimacy with Satan as a way of
impressing superstitious locals _ plenty of bluesmen did.
</P>
<P>
   Of much greater interest is how his few recourses to
supernatural imagery work as metaphor, as instances of the artful
way Johnson packed his songs with layers of meaning. It doesn't
even matter whether Johnson himself believed in the Devil; a lyric
like ``Me and the Devil/Was walking side by side'' endures as a
beautifully terse image for the divided soul, unable to choose
between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as ritually repeated as the notion of Johnson as a
latter-day Faust is the idea that he was somehow the first
rock-and-roller. Rock critics' efforts to see Johnson as a sort of
proto-James Dean, an outcast rebel with a guitar, have little
substance. The rock-and-roll rebel is an icon born of postwar,
urban affluence. The personal and cultural rebellion that the
figure embodied was impossible, even in embryonic form, to an
African-American of Johnson's time and place. He moved through a
world of plantations and sharecroppers, where flaunting the social
order was not an option; the only choice was between total
conformity and swift punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the itinerant bluesman, thumbing his nose at
respectability, was a sort of rebel within the black community. But
Johnson certainly wasn't unique in this sense. One might as well
call Charley Patton or Blind Lemon Jefferson the first
rock-and-roller.
</P>
<P>
   Musicologically, claims of Johnson's impact on rock make a bit
more sense. He was, if not the first, one of the first blues
guitarists to use a technique adapted from boogie-woogie piano: the
so-called boogie bass, with which he propels tunes like ``Ramblin'
on My Mind'' and ``I Believe I'll Dust My Broom.'' In the hands of
guitarists like Elmore James, Johnson's boogie shuffle became a
staple of '50s Chicago blues. Appropriated by white blues
enthusiasts of the '60s, the technique found its way into
blues-based rock bands like Canned Heat and ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
   But take the boogie bass out of Johnson, and you're still left
with his greatest songs: ``If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day,''
``Crossroads Blues,'' ``Terraplane Blues'' and a half-dozen others.
Johnson's best-known boogie tunes are fine, jaunty blues, but they
lack the hair-raising intensity, the reverberating layers of
meaning, of his finest work. To focus on Johnson's impact on rock
is to miss what makes his art compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating Johnson's art is easy (once you've seen through the
myths and fallacies); understanding its genesis is not. The latter
effort will always involve a paradox: perceiving the boundaries _
the crossroads, if you will _ that our understanding can't
penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   What we're left with is a mystery: How did a child of peonage,
an ignorant hobo, create music of such nuance and power? How can a
few scratchy old records, the singer's Mississippi drawl so thick,
so full of forgotten idioms and local references that it's
impossible to understand him half the time _ how can these records,
cut for an audience that no longer exists, vault so far beyond
their original nexus and appeal to the ages?
</P>
<P>
   Call it the riddle of genius. To rephrase the point: folk music
is not necessarily primitive. Underestimating its complexity is a
mistake that Bob Dylan, for one, never made. ``Folk music,'' Dylan
once said, ``is the only music where it isn't simple.'' And he
certainly knows his Robert Johnson. There, tucked away in the
jacket photo of the great Dylan album ``Bringing It All Back
Home,'' is a copy of Johnson's even greater ``King of the Delta

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Record gains by Brazilian stocks
accelerated Tuesday, the third consecutive day of a rally that has
driven up the market 45 percent. The strong gains were fueled by a
growing sense among investors that developed nations would protect
Latin American economies from the devastation that has crippled
Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a financial crisis rooted in fear, and feeding on panic, the
reality that any international bailout remained somewhat amorphous
seemed almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's speech Monday calling on advanced countries
to support Latin economies, and suggestions in London by officials
of the Group of Seven industrial nations of a new economic approach
to promote growth in emerging markets, were enough for stocks to
rally.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index closed up 18.68
percent, with most other Latin markets rising along with it. In
Argentina, the key index closed up 8.9 percent, while Mexican blue
chips gained 12.92 percent. Improvements in Chile and Venezuela
were more modest, at 3.71 percent and 3.75 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But investment analysts continued to insist that the upturn,
just four trading days after Brazilian stocks plunged 15.82
percent, was a sign of volatility more than health. Some $900
million left the country on Monday, cutting dollar reserves to less
than $50 billion. As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, $350 million more had left
central bank coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These currency outflows will come down once it's sure that the
Brazilian foreign reserves will be backed by some kind of overdraft
protection from the IMF,'' said Florencio Deteresa of Global
Emerging Markets North America. ``All these markets have been hit
by very high volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also rose on word that President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso would telephone Clinton late Tuesday night, which some
interpreted as a sign of growing coordination at the highest levels
of government to steer Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy,
through its turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are looking for a signal that there's going to be
decisive coordinated international action to prevent the crisis
from forcing Brazil into devaluation,'' said Francisco Larios, a
senior emerging markets economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, ``and
these rumors feed the hope that such action is being worked on.
That's fine, however, we have to see much more in terms of
preventive action before confidence is restored on a more permanent
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when you're going to have rumors left and
right,'' Larios added. Last week, Standard &AMP; Poor's downgraded
Brazilian debt to a negative rating.
</P>
<P>
   After the markets closed Tuesday, the president's spokesman,
Sergio Amaral, said Cardoso would thank Clinton for his speech
Monday, which he said contained variations on ideas that Cardoso
had broached in his first meeting with Clinton in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has said it is not seeking help from the International
Monetary Fund, but Cardoso has spoken out for a cut in U.S.
interest rates to ease pressure on emerging economies. Cardoso, who
is closely associated with the currency and fiscal plan that
crushed Brazil's chronic hyperinflation, has insisted that the
problems roiling the nation stem from international uncertainties,
rather than weaknesses in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before he seeks re-election on Oct. 4, Cardoso would
be loath to accept strict conditions that would likely be part of a
conventional IMF bailout package, political analysts here say. But
there was talk among analysts of possible overdraft protection from
the IMF that would carry softer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, however, George Soros, the
international financier, warned that the IMF lacked sufficient
funds to ward off the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any bailout is possible,'' Soros said at a
congressional hearing. ``Clearly there would be a great need for
IMF assistance and the IMF needs greater capacity than it has to
meet those needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rothkopf, president of Newmarket Co. of Washington,
agreed, saying that with the uncertainty he did not expect the
Brazilian stock rally to sustain itself. The recent buying, he
said, showed some bottom-fishing. Now, he said, ``I think things
will be bad but not disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothkopf said world leaders and economists seemed overwhelmed by
``the first protracted international crisis of the global era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the institutions are in place to deal with such
a thing, and the leadership that's in power now doesn't have the
experience to deal with it, and they don't have the tools they
need.'' &QL;

 &HT;      DEWINE COULD BE ON IMPEACHMENT TASK FORCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 -- If, and that is a big IF, the U.S.
Senate holds the first impeachment trial of a sitting U.S.
president in 130 years, Ohio Republican Mike Dewine is likely to be
on a task force researching protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is mulling over the
possibility of a task force to study Senate procedures in a
presidential impeachment trial, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A top Senate Republican told the newspaper that a task force
would likely be heavy with ``legal beagles'' like DeWine, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. All three of
those senators are former prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, served as
Greene County's prosecuting attorney from 1977 until 1981. He was a
member of the House Judiciary Committee while serving in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1983-90.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine also has experience with impeachment matters that few
members of Congress can claim: he was instrumental in the 1986
impeachment of a federal judge who refused to resign from the bench
despite being convicted of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada was the
first sitting federal judge to be convicted of a felony. Claiborne
drew the attention of Congress because he continued to accept his
$78,700 annual salary while being held in a federal prison. Because
federal judges are appointed for life, Claiborne could only be
removed via impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Procedure for any federal impeachment -- of a judge or of a
president -- is the same. First, the House Judiciary Committee must
weigh the case and vote to have the entire House pass judgement.
The impeachment vote in the House is similar to the indictment of a
defendant by a grand jury. If the House votes to indict, then the
U.S. Senate ultimately acts as a jury and makes a final decision on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After the House voted 406-0 to impeach Claiborne, DeWine helped
prepare the case before the Senate and served as one of the
presenters to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott stressed that it is premature to begin
talking about the Senate's role in any impeachment trial of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not close to that point. The majority leader will wait
to see what will happen when, and if, the House acts,'' said John
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott. ``It is not like a task force is
inevitable ... We are not acting as if we are expecting anything
(from the House). We don't want to prejudice the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott will be talking to Democratic and Republican colleagues
to find a constitutional role for the Senate, Czwartacki added.
</P>
<P>
   And DeWine wants to be prepared. DeWine's spokesman said the
senator has been reading books about preparations for the
impeachment trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Richard
Nixon in 1974 -- just in case.

PANEL SUGGESTS BANK CHANGES FOR CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KALYANI VITTALA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A national task force has endorsed mergers of large
Canadian banks and has recommended easing rules for foreign banks
to operate here as long as the public interest is protected.
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services
Sector issued 124 recommendations Tuesday for overhauling the
banking industry. The report comes amid debate over two recently
announced mega-mergers _ the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of
Montreal, and Toronto Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce, four of Canada's top five banks. The four banks
contend that merging is the only way to remain competitive in the
global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's fourth-largest bank, Scotiabank, and consumer groups
insist ownership concentration will become dangerously high,
competition will be squeezed out and too many jobs and local
branches will be lost in the merger process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no absolute ban on mergers among large banks,
insurance companies or other financial institutions,'' the report
said. ``However, no such merger should take place if it is not
consistent with the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that each merger should be subjected to a public
interest review, that recommendations could be made based on the
review and that banks that act against those recommendations be
subject to some kind of penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not put up a red stoplight, nor have we issued a green
light,'' said Harold MacKay, the chairman of the task force. ``What
we have done is put up a flashing yellow light.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the national competition bureau and the Office of
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will present their
recommendations to Paul Martin, the finance minister, on whether
the two mergers should proceed.
</P>

   The task force also seeks to simplify legislation for foreign
banks operating in Canada, allowing branches here through the
parent company rather than a unit. And the task force suggests a
framework be established so that foreign companies can lend to
Canadians without first having a presence in the country.

   In addition, the task force recommends allowing banks to merge
with insurance companies, mutual fund companies and investment
dealers. It wants to allow bank branches to offer insurance and

 &HT;    Rookies in on fight for best record
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the lineup was posted Tuesday afternoon, the
only thing missing was what time the bus left for Kissimmee. A day
after clinching the NL East, Bobby Cox predictably emptied the
bench, giving rookies third baseman Wes Helms and outfielder George
Lombard their first major league starts, as well has starting Marty
Malloy at second base for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to the pitchers today and tomorrow about what they
want to do,'' Cox said of balancing the work load. ``We'll plan
that out and then try to get everybody enough at-bats to keep them
sharp and keep winning. I mean, we still have to keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That becomes the club's next concern _ rest the starters, play
the kids but also keep apace of division champions Houston and San
Diego for the best record and home-field advantage through the
playoffs. Kevin Millwood drops out of the rotation after Tuesday
night to move to the bullpen, John Smoltz may skip a start and
rookie Bruce Chen fills in. But at the same time, the Braves are
not excited about handing away a chance for the best record in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, you want to be ready for the playoffs, no matter who
you're playing,'' Cox said. ``But we want to have the best record.
We'll try to do both. It's kind of a difficult task to do it this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Local lad makes good
</P>
<P>
   Lombard made his first start one day after his 23rd birthday and
five years after being drafted in the second round out of the
Lovett School. He does not view this as an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year is the year I'd like to come up and hopefully get up
here for good,'' said Lombard, who hit .310 with Class AA
Greenville with 22 homers, 65 RBIs and 34 steals in 39 attempts.
``I definitely think I can play at this level but I know I have a
lot of learning to do. That's one advantage of being here now, to
learn from some guys who have been here five or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a coincidence Lombard started in right field,
despite playing left and center field in the minors. With
left-handed hitting left fielder Ryan Klesko under contract for the
next three seasons, Lombard's best chances to make the team is in
right, where Michael Tucker is hitting a career-low .248 and will
be eligible for salary arbitration for the first time next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, I just need to learn all the
positions,'' Lombard said. ``I haven't play too much right field.
In fact, I haven't played any right field, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready Rudy?
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez, sidelined since Sept. 5 with a micro-muscle tear in
his right forearm, will throw from a mound for the first time
today, after which the club will have a better read on when he can
return to the bullpen. Seanez, who has 44 strikeouts in 31 innings,
threw fastballs and breaking pitches off flat ground Monday at
better than 60 percent and reported no soreness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good possibility I could throw (in a game) over the
weekend,`` Seanez said. ``I'd like to get back in the swing of
things.``
</P>
<P>
   Singing for Lou Gehrig
</P>
<P>
   Fans at Turner Field received a treat Tuesday night when Seattle
resident Mark Reiman sang the national anthem. Reiman is afflicted
with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), previously known as Lou
Gehrig's disease. Reiman is scheduled to sing at all 30 parks and
Turner Field is 28th as he makes his way around the country as part
of a awareness campaign for the fatal disease that attacks
specialized nerves which control the muscles.

 &HT;    On deck: Philadelphia Phillies
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (15-3, 3.10; 10-7,
3.74 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP Carlton Loewer (6-7, 6.06; 0-1,
63.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Loewer came flying out of the Phillies system to win in
his first major-league start June 14, collect a 4-1 record in his
first six appearances and stroked the club's strong feelings for
his immediate future. Not so fast. Since July 17, Loewer, the
Phils' first pick in the 1994 out of Mississippi State, has won
just twice in 12 starts and is 1-4 since July. His run support has
been spotty. Six times in those 12 starts, the Phillies have scored
two runs or fewer. But Loewer also has been hit hard. He has
yielded 133 hits, including 16 homers, in his first 104 innings and
has walked 32 batters. He has faced Atlanta once, and it was his
worst night of the year; the Braves bashed him for seven hits and
eight runs in Philadelphia July 22, when he was lifted after facing
just 13 men. Andres Galarraga finished his night with a three-run
homer. Smoltz has not faced the Phillies this year. He is trying to
reach 16 wins for just the second time in his career, after winning
five of his last six starts and going 10-1 since the All-Star
break. He has allowed just six runs in his last 31 innings and his
9.2 strikeouts per nine innings is fourth-highest in the league.

 &HT;    The Real Deal's real hometown
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. -- When Evander Holyfield announced that he was
bringing the next heavyweight championship fight to his hometown,
he could have caused a panic down here.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly where did he think he'd plop down his boxing ring? The
gym at Escambia County High seats only 3,000. The YMCA is busy with
football. The Strand Theater is booked with ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield had Atlanta in mind all along. He's always considered
Atlanta his hometown, though his birth certificate says Atmore,
Ala. ``That's because all the opportunities came from (Atlanta),''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atmore, however, is the answer to a trivia question in the
Holyfield scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   It's the town where he was born 35 years ago. Where his father,
from whom Evander has been estranged for most of his life, still
lives in a trailer. The champ lived here only his first three
years; they called him Chubby then. But what he has done in his
boxing career earned him the key to the city and a place in its
collective heart.
</P>
<P>
   He's been back a couple of times as an adult, trying to piece
together moments of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, you're in the house, on the porch and in
the front yard,'' he said. ``That's as far as you went, then back
into the house. We never did go nowhere, just right there on that
porch. We had to sit there on that porch with my grandmama until my
mama come home from work.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most vivid memories is of the bug truck that rumbled
through the neighborhood producing clouds of insecticide. ``It
always scared me,'' Holyfield said. ``It would come down the street
spraying, and you couldn't see your whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the house where he and his brother saw a strange man
standing in their kitchen several mornings in a row, a figure that
seemed to vanish in thin air. His mother, the late Annie Holyfield,
saw the man, too, and passed out. ``My grandmama said it was
probably our guardian angel,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Atmore's population has doubled to 8,000 since then _ minus
Annie Holyfield and her eight children, who moved to Atlanta _ but
the place looks the same. It's a blue-collar, sawmill town with a
dress code. ``Your pants must be pulled up to your waist or you can
stay out!'' says the sign in the window of Spudd's BP.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established in 1866, Atmore has accumulated several
claims to fame.
</P>
<P>
   According to a resolution by the state House of Representatives,
it's the purple martin capital of Alabama, annually welcoming
thousands of the ``highly desirable birds, due to their graceful
flight pattern, their pleasant songs and the fact that a purple
martin eats 2,000 mosquitoes per day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's home to the Yellow Mama, the still-working electric chair
at Holman Prison, south of town, where hardened inmates pick cotton
in fields patrolled by shotgun-armed guards on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   One of Atmore's factories makes lingerie for Victoria's Secret.
The Creek Indians run a bingo parlor three nights a week. And then
there's Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   He is often in the conversation of the Atmore citizenry, even if
no one's thought to put up a sign in tribute to its native son.
``Old Friends and New Beginnings'' reads the sign at the city
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a good place to put `The Birthplace of Evander
Holyfield,''' Mayor Rodney Owens said. ``There's nothing planned,
but maybe we should take the initiative and ask him to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be just fine with Bryant Smith, the football coach at
Escambia County High. He mentions Holyfield in his pep talks. ``Oh,
at least once a week,'' Smith said. ``We talk to the kids about
what's right and wrong. They know what's right, but sometimes they
forget what's wrong. Evander is a true-blue, great American.''
</P>
<P>
   He wishes Holyfield could find his way to the school. ``I've got
64 kids on the team, and about 74 percent come from broken homes,''
Smith said. ``Evander is a great example of succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Atmore celebrated Evander Holyfield Day in 1984 after he
competed in the Olympics. When he won the heavyweight championship
in 1990, they gave him a parade and named him the city's athlete of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in one of those big, long, fancy cars they have at the
funeral home,'' Lexana Locke recalled. She and his mama once cooked
together at the City Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Now 78, Locke remembers little Chubby going around with his
fists up, pretending to be a fighter, when he was 3. ``He was a
little boy about that high. And when he would play, he'd do
something like this,'' she said, striking a fighter's pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to tell Annie Laura that Holyfield is going to be a
boxer. She didn't pay me no attention; she'd just laugh. When I
first heard he was boxing, I said, well, that little boy always did
be jumping, holding his fists out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the paved road, Union Street looks pretty much the
way Holyfield left it 30-something years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Forney still lives across from 111 Union, where
Holyfield spent most of his three years here. The house in which
the champ was born, on King Street, no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to put a rocking chair in a wagon, and I'd put Chubby
in the chair and pull him down the dirt road,'' Forney said. ``His
brother Lightning (Bernard) was a friend of my nephew, Tony. He had
a very religious grandmother. All the kids stayed together in this
neighborhood. If she could get to 'em on Sunday, she'd take 'em to
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from a good family. He was raised up in a way that you're
supposed to be, to have respect for your mama.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a story going around about Atmore, first told in
Holyfield's biography by Bernard, with which Forney takes
exception. They claimed that a drunk wandered in their yard, was
bitten by their dog, Lassie, and returned with a sheriff, who shot
the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was no drunk,'' Forney said. ``That was David McKenzie,
an old man who used to cut my hair. He was walking by on his way to
town and the dog ran out and bit him on the butt. They mostly kept
the dog chained up. But he would bite everybody. He even bit me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, the Holyfields were good people. And now Chubby's the
best in the world. It will take a hell of a man to beat him.''

 &HT;    Georgia boxing commission selects Tampa referee
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In the first major test for the recently restructured
Georgia State Boxing Commission, executive director Thomas Mishou
wanted to avoid the appearance that Evander Holyfield has a
home-ring advantage. Hence, the referee for Saturday's fight with
Vaughn Bean will not hail from Fayetteville, Dawsonville or Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Garry, a 16-year referee from Tampa, Fla., will work his
first heavyweight title bout at the Georgia Dome. The state
commission was allowed to pick two of the officials for the
Holyfield-Bean fight and selected Garry and Al Devito, who will
serve as a judge. The other two judges were assigned by sanctioning
bodies IBF (Leroy Brown) and WBA (Duane Ford).
</P>
<P>
   ``I purposely wanted to avoid local officials in Georgia,''
Mishou said. ``It would hurt our chances of ever getting another
world championship bout if we had to worry about (charges of
impropriety).''
</P>
<P>
   Garry, who will make about $2,200, has worked 34 title bouts but
never a heavyweight championship. Some of his profile bouts include
heavyweights Riddick Bowe vs. Oliver McCall and Roy Jones vs. Mike
McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest, high-profile fight (in my career), and
it's a real honor,'' said Garry, who also was a ringside official
during the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia commission also has absolved itself of any
responsibility for the ``Thai'' boxing event on the card between
Jerome LeBanner and Espedito Da Silva. The commission, which now
operates under the Georgia secretary of state's office, no longer
oversees ``non-generic'' boxing events, such as kick boxing and
Toughman Contests. All officials, therefore, will be assigned by
promoter Don King. Thai boxing is similar to kick boxing, except
that it allows kicks below the waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not responsible, and we're not informed,'' Mishou said.
``If it's not boxing, it might as well be arm-wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lights, camera...
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield held his second and final lunch-time workout at CNN
Center Tuesday, drawing about 1,000 people. He sparred with Gary
Bell for three rounds. Holyfield will take today off, then have
light workouts Thursday and Friday, 10:30 a.m. both days, at the
Holyfield Arena, 1000 Beecher St. in West End.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   More than 23,000 tickets had been sold for the fight as of
Tuesday afternoon, and promoters said they think that sales could
push the crowd well over 30,000. ``I feel very good right now about
what we're doing,'' Georgia Dome general manager Kaiil Johnsonsaid.
``The workout at CNN Center (last week) really helped, and I think
the one (Tuesday) will help, too. People are getting excited.''
Capacity is just under 42,000. . . . Saturday's card has swelled
to14 fights, with the addition of two bouts involving women's
champion Christy Martin and unbeaten Atlanta middleweight Lawrence
Chapman. . . . The fight is three days away, hasn't begun, but the
post-bout partying already has started. The Holyfield Foundation is
planning a ``Homecoming Celebration'' immediately after the fight
at the Georgia World Congress Center. Holyfield and other notables
are expected to attend. Tickets are $25 and $50 and can be
purchased at the door or by calling 800-777-4681, extension
317-3519.

   CHECK-CASHERS _ WASHINGTON _ Check-cashing stores, once thought
of as part of the fringe banking community, are taking a step
towards the economic mainstream as an unintended consequence of a
federal program to pay benfits through electronic transfers rather
than by paper checks. U.S. Treasury officials estimate that as much
as $16 billion worth of government checks every year are sent to
citizens who do not have a bank. In an effort to grab a piece of
that business, the check-cashing industry and major banks have
formed an economic alliance that allows check-cashing stores to
begin handing out ATM cards to the ``unbanked'' starting next
month. This is yet another step in creating dual banking systems:
one for the affluent and a separate more expensive alternative for
low-income families. (Shepard and Jaspin, Cox News Service).

   SCOTLAND-SCOTCH _ GLEN LIVET, Scotland _ Robbie Hughes casts a
stainless steel cannister into the small natural pool, breaking the
glassy surface. He reels in the metal container and pours some of
the cold, crystaline water into glasses. ``Take a taste,'' he tells
his visitors. When the water is consumed, he opens the doors behind
a cabinet built by the water and pulls out a half full bottle of
pale, golden Tormore single malt Scotch. ``Now,'' he says,'' Take a
taste of this.'' For 60 years the rainwater has been filtered and
amended by the hills before bubbling up in the cold springs of Burn
Auchmochsen. As it passes through the rocky layers, gaining
minerals and peat, the water emerges just a little bit shy of being
this drink. ``Best bar in the world, isn't it,'' Hughes says
without expecting or getting any argument. It is also just about
the only place to get a taste of Tormore. Despite a growing
American demand for the special, distinct flavors found only in
single malt Scotches, modern economics are leading to the
extinction of single malt brands by the dozens. (Roughton, Cox News

 &HT;    Cameron leads by example
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Delaunta Cameron is no stranger to responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's outside linebacker is the first member of his
family to attend college, has spent his entire life as the man of
the house in a single-parent home in Arlington, Va., and is
surrogate big brother to 16 first cousins, including the children
of his two aunts who died of AIDS in the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   As Tech's only returning linebacker, a senior and elder
statesman at age 23, Cameron was a natural to take over defensive
leadership responsibilities from departed linebackers Keith
Brooking and Ron Rogers. But what Cameron already knew in his
personal life, he had to learn in football on Sept. 5: Leadership
doesn't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 41-31 loss to Boston College, Cameron had a disappointing
game, as did the rest of Tech's defense. But it didn't take him
long to learn from his mistakes. Cameron was the difference on
defense in Tech's 42-7 win over New Mexico State on Saturday night,
scooping up a fumble and returning it 25 yards for a touchdown. He
followed that up with the first interception of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership comes by performance,'' Cameron said. ``You've got
to show up to lead the pack, which Keith and Ron did. I didn't know
it was going to be that (tough).''
</P>
<P>
   To make it more difficult, Cameron separated his shoulder
lifting weights during the summer and missed the first two weeks of
contact in fall practice. Halfway through those two weeks, on the
day of the final preseason scrimmage, Cameron was back in Virginia
dealing with a different kind of pain, comforting his mother,
grandmother and his cousins at his Aunt Martha Cameron's funeral,
after she lost her fight with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually seen up close what it does to people,'' Cameron
said. ``It's pretty scary. ... Stuff like that happens in life. I
just try to take it in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like it bothers him too much, but I know it
does,'' said Elizabeth Cameron, Delaunta's grandmother, who said
Delaunta was closest to his Aunt Mary, who died 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was recruited out of high school by Maryland, Virginia
Tech and Kentucky and signed with Wake Forest. But he failed to
make the necessary SAT score and had to spend a year at prep school
at Hargrave Military Academy. After his year there, he decided to
go for a fresh start at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real disappointment in my life,'' Cameron said.
``But everything worked out for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in his first full year as a starter, Cameron made
his mark in the first defensive play of the first game of the
season, busting into the backfield and tackling a Notre Dame
running back for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cameron now, the New Mexico State game is the highlight
of his career. Even if his cousins couldn't see the game _ it
wasn't televised _ and it wasn't in the limelight of Notre Dame
Stadium, it came when big things were expected of him. Usually he
takes his young cousins Georgia Tech T-shirts. This time, ``Tay''
as they call him, is sending a videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights are from about a 30-second span in the second
quarter. First Cameron came on a blitz from the left side as Jesse
Tarplin came from the right and sacked Ty Houghtaling, forcing the
fumble that Cameron ran in for a touchdown. Then, three plays
later, Cameron caught a pass intended for and tipped by New Mexico
State tight end Dustin Guinn and returned it seven yards to the
Aggie 28, setting up a Tech touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron single-handedly helped Tech stretch a 14-0 lead to 28-0
and put the game away. He says it was a matter of being in the
right place at the right time. But as his family knows, Cameron was
the one who put himself in the position to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a millionaire and don't have a dime,'' Elizabeth
Cameron said. ``I'm so proud of him.''

 &HT;    Jamal Lewis won't skip Florida this year
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Jamal Lewis remembers watching the
Tennessee-Florida game last season like a caged tiger _ full of
energy just waiting to be sprung loose. He was a freshman and just
dying to show what he could do on the big stage. And there are few
stages anywhere bigger than the Volunteers' annual war with the
Gators.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. Lewis would play a very small role in the
game _ five carries, 11 yards _ and the reasoning was pretty sound.
The Tennessee coaches had determined that Lewis, for all his
obvious ability to run the football, had not yet mastered the
complicated reads necessary to block Florida's vast array of
blitzes. One rookie mistake in that area and the franchise _
quarterback Peyton Manning _ could have been leveled by a Gator
avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against that particular team, with the way they pressure the
quarterback, we didn't think it was worth the risk,'' coach Phillip
Fulmer said. ``It wouldn't have been fair to Jamal. He had only
played in two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said, ``I knew going in that I wasn't going to play much
because I didn't know my pass protection stuff that well. But it
was still hard to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis didn't know it at the time, but the game would be the
turning point of his career. After the Volunteers lost 33-20 and
gained only 45 yards rushing, Fulmer met with his staff Sunday
morning and made a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided we were relying on one guy (Manning) too much. We'd
become too predictable,'' Fulmer said. ``It was time to get Jamal
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, of course, is Volunteer history. After an open date,
Lewis carried 22 times for 155 yards in his first start against
Mississippi. Then on Oct. 11, the whole country learned about Jamal
Lewis when he ran for 232 yards on 22 carries in a nationally
televised 38-13 win over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Lewis was the nation's leading freshman rusher
with 1,364 yards. Tennessee went on to win the SEC championship,
and Lewis was named a freshman All-American. Lewis no longer was a
rookie when he returned for the 1998 season. He added considerable
muscle to his 6-0, 220-pound frame and is poised for what many
believe could be an All-America season.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't disappoint in the opener against Syracuse. In what
turned out to be a dogfight in the Carrier Dome, Lewis ran for 64
of his 140 yards in the fourth period and set up the last-second
field goal in the 34-33 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal is one of those guys who makes the difference with the
game on the line,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will get a golden opportunity Saturday when No. 6
Tennessee hosts No. 2 Florida in a prime-time game (8 p.m., CBS) at
Neyland Stadium. The Vols have lost five in a row to the Gators and
have been outrushed in four of those losses. The hope at Tennessee
is that if Lewis can present a serious running threat, it might
slow down the Gators' fierce pass rush, which will be directed
toward quarterback Tee Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they want to put a lot of pressure on Tee because he's
new,'' said Lewis, who has four career games of more than 150
yards. ``My job is to give them something else to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis makes no secret of his desire to play in the NFL later. He
spent the summer working out in Atlanta with current and former pro
players, learning what it takes to play at the next level. To his
way of thinking, people like backs who come up big in big games.
And this, for Tennessee, is the biggest game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of games where you really get a chance to
prove yourself,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer says that, as good as Lewis has been since becoming a
starter, his best games are still ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen his best,'' Fulmer said. ``He's just
beginning to scratch the surface of his ability.''

PRISON DOCTOR IN McDOUGAL CASE COULD LOSE HIS JOB 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS Jr. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A prison doctor could lose his job at the
prison if he does not adequately explain why he did not check on
the medical welfare of Whitewater witness James McDougal only hours
before McDougal died, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal of the doctor's contract with the Federal Medical Center
prison in Fort Worth hinges on his written report to supervisors
about what happened during the last hours of McDougal's life, said
Tom Gore, associate vice president of the University of North Texas
Health Science Center. The center provides doctors to work under
contract for the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's name was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   An internal report prepared by the federal Bureau of Prisons
indicates that the doctor did not respond when McDougal, 57,
complained of being dizzy on March 7, the evening before he died.
Two physician assistants were also notified, but neither checked on
McDougal, saying they were ``treating other inmates and were
scheduled to get off duty,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, McDougal, a former friend of President
Clinton's and a key witness for Whitewater prosecutors, was serving
a three-year federal prison sentence for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Craig, spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons in Washington,
said Tuesday that the two physician assistants are still working at
the prison. The doctor's future there, however, is less certain,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor gave a satisfactory oral explanation of why he did
not see McDougal when the prisoner complained of being dizzy, Gore
said, but then turned in a written report that was ``legalistic,''
``defensive'' and hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Marlo, a spokeswoman for the federal prison system in Fort
Worth, said she could not comment on whether policies have changed
as a result of the internal review of McDougal's treatment at the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials considered giving McDougal, who had a bad
heart, his prescribed medication on the night of March 7, but a
nursing supervisor decided to wait until the next morning, the
report says. It also notes that McDougal did not appear to be
following doctor's orders on when to take his medicine, even when
it was easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m. on March 8, about two hours before he collapsed,
McDougal said he ``was in need of his scheduled medication,'' the
report says. Asked what types of medicine McDougal had asked for,
Craig said: ``I'm not going to comment on that.'' The report says
McDougal was given three 20 milligram pills of the antidepressant
drug Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   His other medication remained in a different part of the prison,
including tablets of nitroglycerin that he was to take ``as
needed'' when he experienced chest pains, the report said. At 10:55
a.m., McDougal was found unresponsive and on the floor of an
isolation cell, where he had been taken after he could not provide
urine for a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal died of a heart attack, authorities ruled.

 WASHINGTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig's appointment as special counsel is likely to result in a
lower-profile role for David Kendall, the president's private
lawyer, whose tight control of information has often angered the
president's other advisers. Several aides blamed Kendall's
appearance on an ABC news program Sunday for angering congressional
Democrats about legal dodges.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will report directly to the president, relieving John
Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, of day-to-day responsibility
for fending off impeachment hearings in the House, and, should the
hearings begin, impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said that it was
appropriate bring a new defense team onto the White House payroll.
``This is a constitutional process in which the House is
considering some serious issues,'' he said, ``and the office of the
presidency has an obligation to work closely with the House as they
move through this process and to defend the prerogatives of the
office of the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's aides continued the politically delicate task of
describing the president's mistakes in lacerating terms while
defending him from congressional criticism. Mike McCurry, the White
House press secretary, insisted that Clinton was not resorting to a
legalistic defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that is more profound than the
president admitting a mortal sin, asking for forgiveness, saying
how he has wronged people,'' he said. ``If anything, he has
confessed to far worse than the narrow legal question his lawyers
were being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings with Democrats on Capitol Hill, White House
aides got an earful about the legal tactics employed so far. After
meeting over a caucus lunch with senators, they gathered for an
hour in a basement meeting room with two dozen centrist Democrats,
and then with a group of House leaders in Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt's office. ``The leadership was a little tougher,'' said
one official who attended both meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said that one message the
congressmen delivered on Thursday was that, ``In terms of the
public discussion, the average American does not understand the
legalisms and doesn't view them as being forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the members also urged the White House not to
cave in to the Republicans over health care, education, and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid reporters, most Democratic senators slipped out a side
door from their meeting. Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New York said
that the overall message was ``let's stand up and get through this.
There was no suggestion that we were not in any difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the meetings with White House officials, members of
Congress sparred on Tuesday over whether to release Clinton's
videotaped testimony. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who is the
ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, said that if
the Republicans were to force the disclosure they would
``jeopardize the process and demean our activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said that members who are not on the committee ``are
telling me strenuously that it would be a violation of the
bipartisan spirit if we were to let the video tape be released.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that the public ought to be able to judge
for itself whether Clinton was misleading. Rep. Edward Pease,
R-Ind., said, ``What I saw of the video deposition, I did not see
anything that we should withhold.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Tuesday that the House would not
formally adjourn this year, which would allow the Judiciary
Committee to keep working after the election.

reading disorder was entitled to extra time and other reasonable
accommodations on the New York state bar examination _ even though
an outside expert hired by the bar examiners said she had no
disability.
</P>

   The graduate, Marilyn Bartlett, received her degree from Vermont
Law School and worked in New York City as a medical malpractice
lawyer for almost two years but had to leave the firm after failing
the state bar exam repeatedly.

   Advocates for those with disabilities hailed the ruling Monday
by the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals as an important victory.
But those in charge of professional licensing organizations
expressed fear that it would hinder their efforts to maintain
professional standards and weed out those who seek to use
disability claims as a cover for academic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been only a handful of lower-court rulings on
when, and whether, the federal disabilities law requires
professional licensing organizations to give accommodations on
tests to those with learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first large wave of students diagnosed with learning
disabilities moved beyond college and into the professions, those
who administer the law, medical and accounting examinations have
become mired in the same murky legal questions that high schools
and colleges grapple with when faced with claims of learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia last year, three medical students with
attention deficit disorder lost their lawsuit seeking
accommodations. And in California, those with learning disabilities
have a pending class action against the state bar examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, thousands of students with attention deficit
disorder, dyslexia or other learning disabilities receive extra
time on their school exams, and standardized exams like the
Scholastic Assessment Test or Graduate Record Examination. While
extra time is the most commonly granted accommodation, school and
professional examining boards often grant other modifications like
testing in a separate quiet room, oral examinations or use of a
computer.

<P>
   In the case before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, Dr.
Bartlett, who has a doctorate in educational administration and is
now teaching at Dowling College on Long Island, had asked for
extended time on the bar exam, permission to tape record her essays
and the opportunity to circle multiple-choice answers in the test
booklet rather than use the computerized answer sheet.
</P>
<P>
   At Vermont Law School, she received several accommodations
during exams, including extra time, a quiet room and the use of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such requests has mushroomed in recent years.
Among the 8,791 applicants who took the New York bar exam in July
1998, 402 had requested accommodations, and 332 had received them.
Five years ago, when Dr. Bartlett last took the examination, there
were 181 such requests, of which 155 were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Bartlett, the chairman of the New York State Board of
Law Examiners, said it was too soon to say whether the case would
be appealed or whether the bar examiners would change their
evaluation procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The New York bar examiners refused Dr. Bartlett's request for
accommodations based on the opinion of their outside expert, who
said her test results did not indicate any reading disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The board's outside expert, Dr. Frank Vellutino, said Dr.
Bartlett's scores on two parts of a reading test commonly used to
assess learning disabilities were above the 30th percentile _ too
high, he said, for her to have a genuine reading disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the lengthy trial record, however, the federal appeals
court said the cutoff was arbitrary, and the test results on the
two untimed subtests did not remove her from coverage under the
federal disability law, which took effect in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision says that just because someone finds a way to
compensate for their learning disability doesn't take away the
disability, any more than someone's taking medication, or wearing
glasses, to function well doesn't mean they are not disabled,''
said Ruth Lowenkron, one of Dr. Bartlett's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was written by Judge Thomas Meskill and joined by
Judge Jose Cabranes and Judge Eugene Nickerson, upholding last
year's trial decision by U.S. District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett, who has fought an uphill battle with a reading
disorder throughout her education,'' the ruling released Monday by
the Court of Appeals said, ``is among those for whom Congress
provided protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act and
the Rehabilitation Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett's cognitive impairment _ her difficulties in
automatically decoding and processing the printed word _ limits her
major life activities of learning and reading to a substantial
degree. Reasonable accommodation of this disability will enable her
to compete fairly with others in taking the examination, so that it
will be her mastery of the legal skills and knowledge that the exam
is designed to test _ and not her disability _ that determines
whether or not she achieves a passing score.''
</P>
<P>
   The court offered no guidance on when professional examining
board may rely on outside experts, or whether they should simply
accept the applicant's own expert documentation _ a scenario some
professional boards find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves bar examiners in a very vulnerable position,''
said Erica Moeser, president of the National Conference of Bar
Examiners. ``The earlier cases suggested that boards should get
outside experts to evaluate claims of disability, that they
shouldn't try to make these decisions themselves because it's not
their expertise. They were damned if they don't, and now they're
damned if they do.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett of the New York State Board of Law Examiners, who is no
relation to the plaintiff, also stressed that granting
accommodations for learning disabilities is an inexact science.
``It's much more difficult to evaluate than a physical disability,
and still more difficult to know whether the right accommodations
is double time, one half extra time, or one-third extra time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who represent students with disabilities said the case can
be read to warn professional boards not to question diagnoses of
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant thing about the case, in terms of
practical impact, is the finding that these professional bodies
should not be second guessing the determinations of learning
disabilities made by the applicant's own clinicians,'' said Sid
Wolinsky, a lawyer with Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland,
Calif., who represents the learning-disabled students in the
California case. ``This is a very important victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bartlett, 50, said she brought the lawsuit because she felt
that her situation presented a good test case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that at my age, with my history of career success, I
could show that learning disabled people are not the same as
low-functioning people, which is how a lot of learning-disabled
people are made to feel,'' said Dr. Bartlett, who worked as a
medical malpractice lawyer at Bower &AMP; Gardner, a New York City law
firm that has since disbanded, for nearly two years after
graduating from law school.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is policy at most law firms, she was fired after failing
the bar exam three times.
</P>
<P>
   When she first joined the firm, she said, she compensated for
her slowness in reading by coming in early, staying late, and
billing only for an 8-hour day. After a partner questioned that
practice, she disclosed her disability and was told that she should
report her real hours, and the firm's business manager would decide
what was reasonable to bill.
</P>
<P>
   When law seemed out of reach, Dr. Bartlett returned to
educational administration, the field she had been in before
attending law school and in which she holds a Ph.D. from New York
University. When she attended NYU, there was no federal
disabilities act and no formal program for accommodating learning
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But she did not give up her hope of becoming a lawyer. And in
July 1993, after the board of law examiners denied her most recent
application for accommodations, she sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want some 24- or 25-year-old who had always set their
sights on the law to get out of law school and find they were kept
out of the bar because of their learning disabilities,'' she said
in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After her lawsuit was filed, the parties agreed that Dr.
Bartlett could take the July 1993 bar examination _ her fifth
attempt _ with the accommodations she requested _ but that if she
passed the exam, the resulted would not be certified unless she
prevailed in her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the accommodations, Dr. Bartlett failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she expects to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want that piece of paper,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Luggage carousels and ticket counters have been sold to
Peru and shipped to airports in the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecking crews have begun the months-long job of taking down the
main terminal, with its sign that greeted generations of American
skiers: ``Welcome to Denver, Colorado. One Mile High.'' And runways
have been painted with large yellow crosses to ward off pilots who
may not have heard that Stapleton International Airport closed in
February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But three and one half years after Denver's $5 billion new
airport drew the nation's attention, the old airport is grabbing
back the spotlight. A development project one third the size of
Manhattan is taking shape there, only 10 minutes east of downtown
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every significant home builder in the state of Colorado has
approached us about doing something at Stapleton,'' said Dick
Anderson, president of the Stapleton Development Corp., the
nonprofit company chartered by the city of Denver to develop the
old airport site.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to projects that recycle large swaths of industrial
areas in cities, he said: ``These `in fills' are a better way to go
than urban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest in seven square miles of dirt newly opened to
development reflects Denver's continuing economic boom and mounting
concern over the metropolitan area's sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Sierra Club issued a report on urban sprawl that
ranked the growth of metropolitan Denver second only to
metropolitan Kansas City in cities with populations over one
million. From 1990 to 1996, the Denver metropolitan area increased
by two thirds, ballooning towards its current size of 535 square
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Excess growth routinely top lists of concerns in public opinion
polls here. Last year, the Denver Regional Council of governments
approved a blueprint to confine growth to 730 square miles by 2020.
But the Sierra Club noted that this boundary was largely voluntary
and it forecast that by 2020 the Denver metropolitan area could
expand to 1,150 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of growth has been felt in recent months _ in rolling
electricity brownouts during a heat wave, wells running dry in some
suburbs, 10-digit local telephone numbers, classrooms improvised
from trailers, and, as highway traffic speeds slow, renewed debate
over building a passenger rail system through the city and into the
Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the growth has occurred in three southern suburban
counties _ Douglas, Elbert and Park _ that have ranked among the
top five fastest growing counties in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sprawl are hailing both the Stapleton project,
which will bring 10,000 new homes to the area, and a 3,200-home
project at the former Lowry Air Force Base because they are close
to the city center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put people much more closer in, where there already are
people, utilities and infrastructure,'' said Kirk Cunningham, a
Colorado Sierra Club member who worked on the sprawl report.
</P>
<P>
   According to blueprints, Stapleton will provide homes for 25,000
people, becoming the region's second largest development, after
Highlands Ranch, a southern suburb. Construction on the first
houses is to begin next spring, four years after the last jet took
off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Denverites criticize the pace of conversion as slow. But
Development Corp. officials say that the Federal Aviation
Administration and Denver had little experience in dismantling and
redeveloping a big city airport.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Denver sought buyers, or at least tenants, for the
terminal and concourses. One, Concourse E, was built at a cost of
$58 million, but was used for only eight years. Planners soon
discovered that there are few alternative uses for airport
terminals. The decision to tear down the concourses came after a
July 1997 hail storm drilled about 4,000 holes in the roofs of the
old terminal and concourses, causing severe water damage.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-story control tower will be retained as a monument to the
site's history, probably with an observation deck for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the average price of a home in the Denver area has
jumped by about 50 percent, to $200,000 today. Denver's Mayor,
Wellington E. Webb, has vowed that Stapleton, which is city
property, will include low- and moderate-income housing, but that
collides with a mandate by the Federal Aviation Administration,
which was a source of many grants for improvements at Stapleton, to
sell airport land at fair market value. Dollars earned from
Stapleton land sales defray the construction cost of its successor,
Denver International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope to be able to offer town houses here for as little
as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   With Interstate 70 and a rail line cutting through the old
airport property, Stapleton also is to become a commercial and
industrial center, providing 30,000 jobs. Already, United Airlines
has invested $140 million in an expanded pilot training center on
400 acres, and the Catellus Development Corp., a commercial real
estate company, is building the Stapleton Business Center, 3.6
million square feet of offices and industrial space. Under a new
master plan, 17 million square feet of commercial space are to be
created around the old airport.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's convention and tourism business is so strong that the
wall of hotels facing the old airport terminal survived its
closing. Companies moving to the site are served by the second
largest concentration of hotel rooms outside of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one third of the old airport area, 1,700 acres, is
being preserved as open space _ a nature area, an 18-hole golf
course, and a bicycle path along the course of Sand Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The northern corner of this open area will link with the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, a vast preserve 20 times
the size of New York's Central Park that is being created on the
site of a former chemical munitions factory.
</P>
<P>
   In a north-south arc, the wildlife refuge, Stapleton and Lowry
seem to channel Denver's future growth to the east. As the Rockies
wall off growth to the West, the city is spreading east, drawn in
part by the new airport. Denver International Airport, once
lampooned as a white elephant, now has attracted eight major office
and industrial projects and 19 hotel projects. This summer,
officials inaugurated major eastern links on a beltway that
eventually is to ring metropolitan Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some predict that the development of Stapleton and Lowry
will barely slow Denver's eastern sprawl, as tract home
subdivisions continue to march through wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl is an upper-class, elitist word that closes out the
aspirations of lower-income and minority Americans for a safer and
more spacious place to live and raise their kids,'' said John
Andrews, board chairman of the Independence Institute, a
libertarian think tank here. ``People say, `Don't Los Angelize
Denver.' They are howling at the moon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans, getting a fixed reading on what the folks back home
think about President Clinton's behavior was not too tough a task.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Meagher Northup, R-Ky., attended a parade near Louisville
over the weekend to a chorus of, ``Impeach him. Impeach him.'' It
sounded, she said, like ``Crucify him, crucify him.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the East Coast, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said it took
him 90 minutes to walk five blocks in Manhattan's Upper West Side
because people were so furious about all this impeachment talk. His
answering machine ran out of tape by mid-afternoon. ``What they
were saying was a variation of, `Stop this nonsense. Don't impeach
the president. This is absurd.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the House, members from swing districts or
from places where reactions tend to be more muted and tempered, the
messages from home about the independent counsel's report have been
decidedly more mixed and difficult to sum-up in a simple sound
bite. That makes their jobs considerably more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinion is still very split and very fluid,'' said Rep. Philip
English, R-Pa. ``A fair number of people are uncomfortable with the
situation. They don't like what the president has done, but they're
not sure what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
last Friday, lawmakers say they have heard from constituents in
record numbers, at supermarkets, synagogues and political rallies.
Their offices have been deluged with phone calls, e-mail messages,
and letters from citizens venting their rage and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say they have noted a distinction between people
who are actively calling their offices, most of whom voice
overwhelming support for Clinton's ouster, and voters who engage
members of Congress in conversation at picnics and barbecues and
breakfast meetings.
</P>
<P>
   These voters are furious with Clinton, who they believe has
debased the office of the presidency, and offended by his behavior.
The problem is that they can't figure out what sort of punishment
is appropriate for a president who lied about a sexual romp with a
22-year-old former intern but who many believe has done a
relatively good job.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the opinions of people who represent this broad swath
of the public that will likely determine Clinton's fate in the
Congress. Back in Tennessee, Rep. Bob Clement, a Democrat, said a
whole cross-section of his constituents are torn over whether the
president's actions warrant impeachment, resignation, censure or
anything besides personal and historical humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consensus,'' said Clement. ``Among the general
population it's mixed. But they do want us to move expeditiously.
They don't want it dragged out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said he had received 105 calls,
running two-to-one in favor of impeachment. But of the people back
home who Boehlert spoke to after church or at the corner store,
many seemed to hold less extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of shaking their heads in disbelief,''
Boehlert said. ``Nobody likes the idea of going through
impeachment. The majority of people I represent who have spoken to
me feel that the president has lost his moral compass. More want to
have him removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are a number of people who are genuinely
torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. Northup said that among certain communities in her
district there is a sense of uncertainty. ``More people were
saying, get him out,'' she said, adding that her office received
180 phone calls by Monday with 135 of the callers gunning for
impeachment. ``But not everybody, especially communities with a
deep abiding allegiance to this president. They don't want to
imagine it has to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, the gyrations of the president's lawyers over
his statements and whether they are legally accurate appear to be
counter-productive. ``In Middle America they don't see that as
anything other than telling a lie,'' she said. ``Any other
equivocation makes them mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said he made his rounds at a parade, a
breakfast meeting and a hog roast over the weekend. While many
people, including some Democrats, wanted to order-up instant
impeachment, he was surprised to hear so many constituents express
doubts about what Congress should do by way of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people saying, the guy is sick,'' LaHood said.
``But they are simply not sure. People are confused about whether
these are impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators from across the country echoed the sentiments of many
House members.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said that people are furious at Clinton
but they are also furious at Starr. ``There is still signs among
people of confusion,'' he said. But, he said, many of them ``wish
this wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she is hearing the same kind
of ambiguity from voters in her home state, although she noted she
received 95 phone messages going 6-to-1 in favor of impeachment.
``People did not recommend to me a specific course of action,''
Collins said. ``They didn't, in most cases, call for his
impeachment. I don't think they've decided what ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this lack of consensus, however, House members and
senators said that even among this wishy-washier, broad middle
cross-section of the population, people are disgusted and appalled
about the turn-of-events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Maine are offended by nature of relationship and the
lying,'' said Collins. ``One woman came up to me at a rally and
said, 'If my boss did that, he'd be out of there.'''

ADVERTISING: FORMER TV EXECUTIVE TO PROVIDE WEB CONTENT FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a bow to advertisers marketing products to women,
America Online said Tuesday that it had agreed to sell three of its
women-oriented services to a new venture formed by Geraldine
Laybourne, the former head of cable television operations for Walt
Disney Co. and ABC Inc., who will develop them for the online
service's new Women's Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne, long considered one of the most successful women
in the television industry, left Disney/ABC in May to form Oxygen
Media, a company devoted to creating programs for women and
children, both on the Internet and on television. Before joining
Disney/ABC, she built up Nickelodeon, the children's cable network.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal were not disclosed. But a person close to
both companies said that America Online would retain an equity
stake of about 10 percent in Oxygen and would receive millions of
dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Oxygen will get three content services: Electra, a
service aimed at women; Moms Online, which is for parents; and
Thrive, a service devoted to health issues. Under terms of the
deal, these sites will be displayed prominently on America Online's
new Women's Channel and other places on its service and on its
World Wide Web site, AOL.com.
</P>
<P>
   Thrive was part owned by Time Warner Inc., but America Online
bought out that stake before selling the service to Oxygen.
Similarly, Moms Online had several other investors, which Oxygen
bought out.
</P>
<P>
   The deal attests to the growing importance of women to online
marketers. According to America Online, about 51 percent of its 13
million users are women, up from only 16 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional media have missed the boat with modern
women,'' Ms. Laybourne said. ``There is nothing that serves women
the way ESPN serves men or Nickelodeon serves kids. We want to
create a brand on both television and the Internet that brings
humor and playfulness and a voice that makes a women say, `You
really understand me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen and the other women's services hope they can sell ads to
makers of the sort of package goods that have typically been
promoted on soap operas and other women-oriented television
programming.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for example, has an extensive deal to develop
new forms of advertising for Unilever, the maker of Wisk detergent
and Lipton tea. Some of the Unilever ads are expected to be placed
on the services being sold to Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty five percent of purchases are made by women,'' Ms.
Laybourne said. ``We can be a real facilitator of commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The move also represents yet another flip-flop for America
Online on the question of whether it wants to create its own
programming or rely on outside companies for what the Internet
industry calls ``content.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, America Online was dependent on outside publishers
for content. Then it began taking partial stakes in content
companies, including iVillage Inc., another service aimed at women.
About a year ago, it began to bring some content more directly
under its control. It created Electra as its own women's area,
competing directly with iVillage.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the latest about-face is a longstanding
professional relationship between Robert Pittman, the president of
America Online, and Ms. Laybourne. Having hired Ms. Laybourne 20
years ago when he was an executive of MTV Networks, which started
Nickelodeon, Pittman called her the day her resignation from
Disney/ABC was announced to explore potential deals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, America Online has now decided it wants to pull back
from operating its own content areas, in part because it has
discovered that it can exact multimillion-dollar payments from
content companies to display their services prominently to its
members. As a result, the service would rather offer a menu of a
handful of featured content areas in each topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience tells us they want us to do the hard work of
finding the best content online and putting a context around it,''
said Barry Schuler, president of America Online's interactive
services unit. ``We need to own the top level, but when it comes
down to the hard-core editorial stuff, we think that's a game of
consolidation and critical mass, and we don't need to own all of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   While America Online now calls Oxygen the ``centerpiece'' of its
Women's Channel, the company also has relationships with most of
the other players in programming for women. It is the largest
shareholder of iVillage, with a stake of just under 20 percent. And
its service also has links to Women.com Networks, Hearst Corp.'s
Homearts service and the online complements of the Oprah and Rosie
O'Donnell talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is healthy for the marketplace,'' Schuler said.
``Our audience wins when there is more than one strong player out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Candice Carpenter, the chief executive of iVillage, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to think that what may be the biggest category
online will only have one player,'' she said of women's
programming. ``I'd rather have a few good competitors who will
develop the space intelligently and aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter denied industry reports that the relationship
between iVillage and America Online had become strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has been fabulous,'' she said. ``They called me the day
that this deal was discussed the first time. And I've signed a lot
of big deals with AOL's competitors, and they have given me no flak
for it.'' Moreover, she added, ``We were offered Electra and Moms
Online, and we turned them down.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, it is hard to discern much difference between the
strategies of the two companies. Ms. Carpenter said that iVillage
was designed to have more places for advertising than the existing
Electra and Moms Online services. And iVillage is less interested
than Oxygen in pursuing television programming, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne said the deal with America Online would be the
first of many partnerships Oxygen would forge with big media and
online companies. In the coming months, she said, she will decide
whether to create television programs for an existing network or
make the high-stakes bet on forming a new cable network. Oxygen is
also already selling sponsorships to companies that seek to sell
goods to women. &QL;

RANGERS' TOP DRAFT CHOICE IMPRESSES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ The defenseman skated the puck to his blue
line, where Manny Malhotra was waiting. Malhotra anticipated the
pass, intercepted it with his shin pad, scooped up the puck on his
stick and dashed in alone to score on a backhander to give his team
a 1-0 lead during a scrimmage Tuesday at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra, the Rangers' 18-year-old first-round draft choice,
went on to assist on three more goals to lead his side to a 4-1
victory. When the game was over, he remained on the ice to practice
face-offs and work on his lateral stops and starts. He was the last
to leave, walking to the bench carrying a big bucket of pucks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not yet driven the Zamboni to resurface the ice,
Malhotra has done just about everything else well in his first
professional training camp. Everyone is closely watching this
6-foot-2-inch, 210-pound prospect. On draft day last June, General
Manager Neil Smith predicted Malhotra could make the team and play
regularly as a third-line center.
</P>
<P>
   Although few rookies play well at that age in the National
Hockey League, some do, including Boston's Sergei Samsonov, last
season's rookie of the year. The question, according to Coach John
Muckler, is how well Malhotra can handle the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is peer pressure, fan pressure, media pressure, pressure
from the coach, pressure from management,'' Muckler said Tuesday.
``Sometimes, we're hesitant to play 18-year-olds. I don't happen to
be one of those people. He's a very conscientious person. He's very
intelligent. He's not afraid to ask questions. Mentally, is he
strong enough? We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra grew up in a suburb of Toronto. His mother is from
French Canada, his father from India. Both parents have doctoral
degrees in chemistry. Scouts who watched Malhotra at his junior
team in Guelph of the Ontario League praised his poise and his
leadership qualities. He speaks with quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of pressure, obviously,'' Malhotra said.
``But that's part of the game. I've come into camp knowing that it
doesn't matter where I was drafted or what's been said. What
matters is how I perform on the ice and who I'm beating out for a
position.''
</P>
<P>
   One player he won't have to beat out is Wayne Gretzky, the
first-line center. Behind Gretzky, the pivot position on every line
is open as the Rangers try to rebuild after missing the playoffs
for the first time since 1993. Malhotra said his jaw dropped when
he met Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to look at him in awe,'' Malhotra said of
Gretzky. ``But it's really hard not to stare sometimes. I find
myself getting caught up in watching him. I had the opportunity to
speak with him for a few brief moments. It was kind of weird. You
don't know what to think or what to say. You're looking at a living
legend. I was just kind of standing there wide-eyed and my jaw on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   He got to move his jaw more a couple days later when Gretzky
invited him to dinner. More than some veterans, Gretzky eschews the
hazing rituals for rookies that are a dwindling part of the hockey
culture. Through word and deed, Gretzky has indicated Malhotra will
be treated with professional respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have taken him in not as a rookie but as part of
the team, a guy on our squad,'' Gretzky said. ``He looks really
solid, excited, a heads-up player, a big boy. He's the kind of guy
in six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years, you can build a hockey team
around him. He'll be the focal point on the Rangers. He carries
himself with a lot of class. We expect him to get a shot. He's
going to be here.''

CITY REACHES AGREEMENT WITH METS TO MOVE CLASS A TEAM TO BROOKLYN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By ANDY NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to bring professional
baseball back to Brooklyn moved forward Tuesday with the
announcement that the city had reached an agreement in principle
with the New York Mets to move their Pittsfield, Mass., minor
league team to a new ball park in Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million stadium, to be built on the site of the
abandoned Steeplechase Park amusement area, would be paid for by
the city, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is money in the city budget to build the stadium,
the deal requires the approval of the New York Yankees, which, like
all major league teams, can veto any attempt to move a minor league
team into their territory. Tuesday, a Yankees official said that
talks to get around that potential roadblock had recently broken
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here willy-nilly saying no to the mayor, no to the
city and no to the Mets,'' said Lonn Trost, the Yankees' executive
vice president. ``There was an attempt to negotiate agreement with
the city, which has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trost refused to say why negotiations had broken down.
Nevertheless, Giuliani said in his comments Tuesday that the
Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, had in fact pledged
not to stand in the way of a Mets minor league team moving to
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told by both owners, directly, that they would not
stand in the way of the other team coming,'' Giuliani said,
referring to Steinbrenner and Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he hoped that plans to build a stadium for a
Yankees franchise on Staten Island would remove any obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Plans date back to at least 1986 for building the Coney Island
stadium, which under this proposal would hold 6,500 people, in the
city's long-decaying resort capital, whose amusement area has
shrunk to 3 blocks from 20 blocks over the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 12-acre stadium site is an overgrown vacant lot. The
only structure still standing on it, just past where the
right-field foul pole would be, is the Parachute Jump, a tall,
spidery skeleton with cables drooping from it that has not seen a
jumper since Steeplechase Park closed, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Tuesday, the Mets would oversee
the construction of the stadium and would then rent it from the
city for a sum not yet agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that if the stadium got the go-ahead, it could be
built in as little as two years. In addition to getting the
Yankees' approval, the project must still go through the local
land-use review process and be approved by the city's Franchise and
Concession Review Committee, Major League Baseball and the New
York-Penn League, in which the Pittsfield Mets play.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-Penn League is a short-season Class A league, which
is one level above the rookie league and just below full-fledged
Class A. Its teams play 76 games a year. This year, the Pittsfield
Mets finished six games under .500 and were third in their
division.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsfield, a city of 46,000 in western Massachusetts that
has seen a succession of farm teams come and go over the years _
the Mets moved in 10 years ago _ Mayor Gerald Doyle was
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``if the Mets do leave,'' Doyle said, ``it's obvious that it
will be a major blow to our tourism numbers.'' But he said the city
had been remodeling its 80-year-old stadium and hoped to attract
another team.

PRINCETON TO DEDICATE NEW STADIUM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM N. WALLACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ Tearing down venerable Palmer Stadium, where
Princeton teams had performed since 1914, was an easy task. Steve
Tosches, the football coach, was there watching the Mercer Wrecking
Co.'s giant claws rip apart the grandstand and Tuesday he recalled
those moments from December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down it came,'' he said. ``The concrete was like sand. The
wreckers said it was one of the easiest jobs they'd ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment also justified the decision by university officials
to abandon expensive preservation of Palmer and build a new
facility, a decision mourned, if not questioned, by many
sentimental alumni.
</P>
<P>
   That this was the right decision will be affirmed and celebrated
on Saturday, when the new Princeton Stadium is dedicated and the
first game, the Tigers against Cornell, is played.
</P>
<P>
   For $45 million, a small sum relative to that of stadiums being
built for National Football League teams costing at least four
times as much, Princeton gets a lot in a facility that is clearly
different.
</P>
<P>
   The standout feature is a tall colonnade curving above and
around most of the four-sided grandstand, and the stadium's beige
precast concrete matches the nearby university buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The playing field is grass. The stands have a sharp incline that
offers excellent sight lines from backless metal benches. There are
no sky boxes, and Princeton never found a $25 million donor who
could have named the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in every way a stadium of many uses and purposes,''
said Gary Walters, the director of athletics and a Princeton
alumnus. ``It's here not only for football, but for the university
as a whole, and the entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters had championship lacrosse and soccer games in mind,
perhaps even commencement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The seating capacity is 27,500, which makes it the
fourth-largest stadium in the Ivy League. Palmer Stadium had space
for 45,750 but had not been filled in 30 years. In recent seasons,
Princeton has been fortunate to average 11,000 spectators for five
or six home games.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pull people into what Walters calls ``a
back-to-the-future stadium,'' he and Richard Spies, vice president
for finance, set a price of only $5 for all tickets, or $20 for a
season ticket. That is about a third of the customary Ivy League
price. Season-ticket sales have jumped six times, Walters said, to
6,600.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers for the home team in this more intimate stadium will
benefit the players, Tosches said. Jim Salters, a senior
linebacker, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always like to hear the crowd behind you,'' said Salters,
who remembers how quiet Palmer Stadium could be on game days during
his freshman and sophomore seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton played all 10 games on the road last season, winning
half of them, while the new stadium was being built on the site of
the old one. In Palmer Stadium, the Tiger teams in orange and black
won 283 games, lost 161 and tied 17 over 83 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Stadium architect was the renowned Rafael Vinoly
of New York, who used input from various committees that included
such football luminaries as Dick Kazmaier, the 1951 Heisman Trophy
winner, and his teammate John Emery of the development office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this stadium will help Princeton, and the Ivy League in
general, to regain more of their audience remains to be seen. Last
season, the Ivies had an attendance decline of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other Ivy schools _ all but Columbia playing in stadiums at
least 73 years old _ may be envious of Princeton.

21ST CENTURY WILL BRING JOB BOOM TO CALIFORNIA, UCLA STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Led by a surging service sector, California
employment will mushroom by about 50 percent during the first two
decades of the next century, but the economy is showing signs of
slowing in the short &UR;  &LR; term, according to a widely &UR;  &LR; watched forecast
about to be released.
</P>
<P>
   This broad job category, which includes services provided by
banking and insurance companies, wholesale and retail trade and
government, will increase its share of nonfarm employment from 81.5
percent in 2000 to 87 percent in 2020, according to the quarterly
economic forecast by The Anderson School at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   California's overall job growth will parallel gains in
population, but Los Angeles County will experience a smaller growth
rate of new residents during the next 10 years than areas like the
Inland Empire and Orange and San Diego counties, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is a long-range snapshot of a new state economy
that evolved as California recovered from its most severe slump
since the Great Depression. Typically, the forecast looks out over
the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new economy in the sense that we won't have the kind of
reliance that we did in the past on defense spending,'' said Tom
Lieser, the forecasting project's executive director and author of
the California report. ``We will remain reliant on international
trade, which is a long-run plus and a short-term minus.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-term negative is because of the economic turmoil in
Asia and Russia. But the report's forecasters and other think tanks
predict its short-term impact will be less painful than the end of
Cold War hostilities at the beginning of the decade that plunged
the state into a deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   While the state's economy will expand at what economists say is
a moderate rate over the next 20-plus years, it likely won't match
an earlier performance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, personal income grew by 4.3 percent annually
between 1960 and 1990. But it is expected to average 2.8 percent
annually from 2000 to 2020, the report indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The key to meeting the report's growth predictions is building
enough new homes and apartments for the influx of job seekers.
Residential building permits are expected to average about 270,000
units annually by 2005, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, an economist at the California Department of
Finance, said the forecast is a reasonable estimate.
</P>
<P>
   He noted there is still room for new housing developments in
sections of Southern California like the Inland Empire and northern
Los Angeles County, while the situation is tighter in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, short-term evidence of some economic cooling already
is showing up. For example, during the first seven months of this
year, Los Angeles County's economy slowed to a 1.6 percent growth
rate vs. 2.8 percent in the comparable period during 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, it is important to stay focused on what's
around the bend as well as over the horizon, said Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned because you've got so many balls up in
the air,'' he said, referring to the world economic situation,
potential problems associated with computers not being able to
communicate with each other after 2000 and growing concern that a
dockworkers strike along the West Coast could paralyze commerce
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing probability we will have some type of
slowdown, and I will use the R-word,'' Kyser said. ``There is a 40
percent possibility we could go into a recession in 2000.''

LAWMAKERS WRANGLE OVER CLINTON GRAND JURY VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tensions roiled Capitol Hill Tuesday as House
Republicans rebuffed attacks on their plan to make public President
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony and Senate Democrats
privately blasted White House officials over Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   With a showdown looming as early as Thursday over the videotape,
the preliminary skirmishes erupted despite warnings from party
leaders for lawmakers to avoid rancor that would diminish the
public's faith in the House to conduct a fair review of 11
impeachment allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the struggle over the videotape, which showed the
president angered by the questioning and is described by a source
close to the House Judiciary Committee as being peppered with
``X-rated'' material, is the likelihood that its release would
unleash another wave of revulsion over Clinton's affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to meet behind closed doors
Thursday or Friday to approve releasing the tape, according to
several panel members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are clearly drooling at the prospect of using the
tapes in campaign ads,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is a chance of this process breaking down in
terms of bipartisanship'' if the tape is released, said Meehan, who
faces no opposition in November.
</P>
<P>
   As House Democrats fought to keep the tape sealed until the
impeachment inquiry is completed, their Senate counterparts vented
anger over the scandal in a private lunch meeting with a delegation
of White House aides led by Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff.
About 40 Democratic senators attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very angry people, some very disappointed
people, and it's hard to sort it out,'' said Senator John F. Kerry,
in his first public comments since Congress received the report
last week from the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. ``People
are still sorting it out. They are upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Senate Democrats went to unusual lengths to keep the
encounter private, including expelling their staff from the meeting
and leaving through a back door to avoid the news media, sources
said several members were blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment allegations aside, times are perilous for
congressional Democrats, who are trying to wrest back control of
the House and prevent Republicans from gaining a filibuster-proof
majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the angriest senators appeared to be those who are
up for reelection this year, especially women such as Senator
Barbara Boxer of California, who are being repeatedly questioned
and criticized at home for their allegiance to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There also was concern about potential harm to the Democratic
Party's bid to retain the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political fallout is obvious,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who is chairman of the Senate Democratic election effort
and a possible presidential contender in 2000. ``It's either going
to hurt us or help us, and it's not likely to be the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators who attended the meeting said their colleagues
did not raise the possibility of Clinton negotiating a less
damaging punishment from Congress than impeachment, such as
censure. Instead, they focused on Clinton's actions, particularly
lying about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust is certainly an issue that is on the table with all of
my colleagues,'' Kerry said. ``He would have to earn my trust
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said that Clinton ``absolutely'' should be punished for
his behavior in some way, but he said any talk of impeachment or
censure was premature. ``You cannot just pretend this did not
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also said he thought Clinton would be ``significantly
diminished'' as president if he stays in office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats also received a private briefing on the House
inquiry from Abbe Lowell, the chief minority counsel on the
Judiciary Committee. Lowell told them the immediate battle centers
on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee defended releasing the tape, noting
the House voted, 363-63, last week to empower the panel to decide
by Sept. 28 how much of the sealed information in 17 boxes of
materials from Starr's investigation to release. Democrats do not
have enough votes on the committee to block the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's information the public has a right to know,'' said
Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who serves on the
committee and was one of the first House members to call for
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have a problem with the graphic testimony,'' Barr
said, ``they should complain to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat and member
of the Judicicary Committee, said the apparent GOP rush to release
the videotape is a sign ``that we are about to begin a Salem witch
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican on the committee, Representative George W.
Gekas of Pennsylvania, expressed concern about tensions surrounding
the tape. ``We do want the process to have the print of
bipartisanship,'' Gekas said. ``If we split on a lot of things, we
are straying from the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with Clinton's testimony said Clinton appeared
volatile in the videotaped session, repeatedly becoming enraged as
he was asked to address specific details of his sexual exploits
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when prosecutors asked Clinton about a specific
episode with Lewinsky, Clinton became so angry that the proceeding
was halted for more than an hour as the president left the room and
met privately with his lawyers, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The session began with Clinton reading a brief statement to the
grand jurors acknowledging an inappropriate and intimate
relationship with Lewinsky. From there, prosecutors pressed
repeatedly for more details, confronting him time and again with
Lewinsky's recollections of their 10 sexual encounters near the
Oval Office as well as their numerous telephone calls that included
sexually charged conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of Clinton's secret testimony being served to the
public is one that some within the White House still find galling.
But those same aides believe there is little they can do to stop
the release, and little political benefit in even making an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fully expected that the president's deposition before
the grand jury would be released in some fashion _ certainly the
transcript,'' said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press
secretary. ``The House is going to have to employ the video however
they see fit. We just hope that it's not misused.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the White House feared that snippets of Clinton's
testimony might find their way into political advertisements
against supportive Democratic lawmakers this fall, McCurry said,
``One could imagine that might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the public's reaction, McCurry said, ``I think that
they've seen just about all there is to see on this, so I don't
think it'll be of any greater shock or surprise than what they've
already seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also began assembling a new team of
congressional lobbyists to try to stem any impeachment proceedings
before the process gets too far along. The team will include
Gregory Craig, a State Department aide, former foreign policy
adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and a former law partner of
Clinton's personal lawyer David Kendall. Craig currently serves as
the director of policy and planning at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   It will also include former White House congressional liaison
Susan Brophy of Quincy, Mass., who plans to return to Washington
temporarily from her new home in Portugal, where she lives with her
husband, the US ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying effort, White House officials said, is expected to
begin almost immediately, starting with Bowles and his deputy, John
Podesta, attending Tuesday's meeting with Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senator Frank Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called
on Clinton to pay for Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky matter,
which Clinton appeared to prolong by refusing to acknowledge his
relationship with the former intern. Murkowski estimated the cost
at $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, asked if Clinton owes taxpayers the funds, replied,
``No, the president does not owe the taxpayers that money.''

 Intel chief executive tells the industry to simplify   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Palm Springs 
 
The computer was small, triangular and blue, but it wasn't an iMac.
Intel Corp. chief executive Craig Barrett displayed the computer at
an Intel conference here yesterday in an attempt to inspire
computer-makers to produce distinctive  and easy-to-use machines.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If we're going to get to 1 billion connected PCs, there's
clearly a lot the industry has to do,'' Barrett said, invoking a
long-standing goal of his predecessor Andrew Grove. ``We need to
make these easier to use.''
</P>
<P>
   The colorful post-modern machine ran a video conferencing
demonstration using a graphics chip, code-named Katmai, that Intel
plans to release next year. The box itself, which looked more like
a lamp one might find in a trendy South of Market furniture shop,
won't ever make it to the marketplace, but Intel has high hopes for
the Katmai chips supplanting the company's popular MMX multimedia
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even Steve Jobs might start to get jealous with this
type of design,'' Barrett told his audience of more than 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' Apple Computer may have pioneered the notion of a computer
that's easy to use, but its Macintosh machines don't run on Intel
chips _ even though more than 85 percent of the PCs sold today do.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when Barrett calls for simple machines, designers
listen. ``We all want it to happen, to sell lots of computers,''
said Kameron Ayati, a designer for Compaq Computer's workstation
group. Asked if Intel is doing a good job leading the industry,
Ayati said with a laugh, ``Who's the alternative?''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett delivered the keynote at the Intel Developer Forum, a
twice-a-year event for the company's customers that even Intel
officials describe as a ``geekfest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said people should be able to turn their computers on
instantly, to plug objects in with ease, to feel comfortable with
Internet security, and to have a fast connection to the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mike Feibus with Mercury Research said Barrett was
merely reiterating what the industry has known, and been trying to
implement, for several years. But, Feibus said, it's a message
computer-makers still needs to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this industry is going to tap the next layer of the
iceberg, it's going to have to do things differently,'' Feibus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has already developed features like the Universal Serial
Bus, or USB, which enables people to easily plug printers, scanners
and other devices into computers. Even the iMac uses USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Intel develops such technology and licenses it broadly to help
grow the entire market. The more people who use computers, then the
more chips Intel is likely to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, based in Santa Clara, is the world's largest chip
company, with profits of $6.9 billion on sales of $25 billion last
year. Yet a chip industry slump has slowed the firm's sales this
year, and the company also faces increased competition and a
federal antitrust prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who assumed the reins of Intel in May, said the
industry must reach out to new markets to continue its phenomenal
growth. ``The main reason people my age don't want to use a
computer is they're afraid they'll break them,'' said Barrett, who
turned 59 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Barrett highlighted some of the increasing
complexity of personal computers at the same time he called for
their simplicity. The complexity, however, is in the increasing
options available to consumers, who can now choose among machines
that sell for $800 or much more expensive models that can display
complicated videos and flashy graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to hide the complexity,'' Barrett said in an
interview after his speech. ``We have to hide the complexity to
make the system easier to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Nathan Brookwood of Dataquest said the growing
popularity of the Internet may help grow the market as well.
``What's important for growing the industry is making PCs more
relevant for people that don't already have one. It's not just,
`Can I plug in a scanner?' but `Is the Internet so compelling that
if I don't have access, I'll be really out in left field?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Brookwood said, he had friends who
``resisted having a television. They said, `The stuff on TV is
junk, who needs it?' Following the Kennedy assassination, the last
holdouts realized they'd better have a TV. I suspect that last
week's episode with the Starr report may persuade a few people the
Internet is no longer a thing for geeks and technophiles.''

 What Craig Barrett Had to Say   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a speech and interviews this week, Intel chief executive Craig
Barrett shared his thoughts on some key issues:
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; On rumors Intel will acquire 3Com for $9 billion: &LR;  ``We never
comment on speculation about speculation. ... We're very interested
in networking. One billion connected PCs means 1 billion processors
all connected. ... We have a lot of cash. Our credit line is
reasonably good. I could borrow $9 billion without hurting the
company, speaking hypothetically.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust prosecution of &LR; 
 &UR; Intel: &LR;  ``If we were the monopolists that we're claimed to be,
after seven quarters of declining revenues and flat earnings, we're
pretty crummy monopolists. We can't even capitalize on our
monopoly. ... We both are in agreement over what happened
factually. The basic disagreement is on the legality of our
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On the need for the industry to change its mind-set: &LR;  ``You
can't be an egghead engineer and expect the common person to
follow. One of the great challenges of the world is to give the
consumer what the consumer wants, as opposed to selling technology
for technology's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On Asia: &LR;  ``All the growth will be in emerging economies. China
and India today are growing like wildfire. ... It's very important
for Intel to be out there, establish a presence, establish `Intel
inside.' ''

 BofA Loss In Trading Soars 50%   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
BankAmerica raised its estimates yesterday of trading losses from
Russia and other emerging markets by 50 percent to about $330
million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three weeks ago, BofA announced that it would write
off $220 million this quarter, primarily to cover securities and
currency trading losses in Russia. BofA's stock slipped yesterday
$1 to close at $63.81.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts, though, weren't bothered by the sudden revision
of estimated losses, and both BofA and NationsBank reaffirmed their
merger plans. ``It's not a total surprise,'' said Van Kasper
analyst Jeff Runnfeldt. ``With the shareholder vote on the merger
coming up (September 24), they want to have full disclosure. Other
banks are likely to wait until the end of the quarter to provide
new loss numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA said its consumer business remains ``solid'' and it still
expects after-tax profit, excluding merger-related charges, to top
$500 million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings per share could be only half of early estimates.
``We were looking for about $1.20 and are now expecting 60 cents a
share,'' said Raphael Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the current quarter's results will be a $480 million
pretax gain from the sale of the bank's BA Housing Services unit
that will be offset in part by a $200 million write-down of the
bank's investment in South Korea's KorAm Bank and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   To put BofA's $330 million in third quarter trading losses in
perspective, it earned $223 million in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Soifer said the additional losses since BofA's August 28
announcement probably reflect problems in Latin America and Asia
rather than additional exposure in Russia. The bank declined to
provide more specifics on trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   However it did say that noninterest income from equity
investments is also down. In the past two months, investment income
was $30 million compared to $125 million in the entire second
quarter. The bank also lost $12 million in interest income from
buying and holding securities in July and August, compared to $53
million in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's trading losses since Russia's financial meltdown are the
largest recorded by a U.S. bank so far. Soifer suggests total U.S.
bank losses are well above $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. bank exposure to Russia is ``not humongous,'' he says.
It's only about $7.7 billion, or less than half the loans to
Brazil. Total U.S. bank loans to foreign borrowers are well above
$300 billion.

BLACK VOTERS STILL LOYAL TO CLINTON, POLLS FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Love is not a word that comes easily to James
Nyanfore, of Washington's Mt. Pleasant neighborhood. But when he
saw the president go to Africa and speak of the havoc wreaked by
slavery, Nyanfore knew in his heart that ``I will always love Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's summer of betrayal, one bond remains unbroken; one
relationship untrammeled. Clinton long ago won the loyalty of much
of the black community. Polls indicate blacks remain solidly behind
the man whom many portray as a brother of the rural South and a
president who put racial healing near the top of his political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Congressional Black Caucus discusses whether to
issue a sweeping statement backing the president, black support
could be crucial to Clinton's political survival. With even such
conservatives as Patrick J. Buchanan demanding that any impeachment
effort be bipartisan, Clinton's fate will depend in part on the
loyalty of Democrats in Congress; and any Democrats who waver may
risk the wrath of black voters, a core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black voters feel deeply that President Clinton has been there
for them. People see that he's in need. He stood up for us, and now
we'll stand up for him,'' said Representative John R. Lewis,
Democrat of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that whether or not the black caucus issues a formal
endorsement of Clinton, ``the caucus will be unified in its support
of the president. And we're only reflecting the views of the black
community. When I was home this weekend, black women and black men
came up to me saying `Is the president going to be all right?' A
little old lady said, `Is my man going to be all right?'''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where blacks make up nearly two-thirds of the
population, voters went to the polls to nominate a new mayor. Those
who campaigned outside Abraham Lincoln Junior High, the most
politically active residents of the Mt. Pleasant/Columbia Heights
area, backed different mayoral contenders, but only one president.
Many said that Kenneth W. Starr's investigation actually
intensified their loyalty to Clinton, for reasons that don't
necessarily resonate with the white community.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they did not want to risk losing a president who has
presided over an economy that has benefited blacks as well as
whites. Others see a rarity in a public figure who counts blacks
among his closest friends and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to look any further than Vernon Jordan as his
golfing partner and Betty Currie as his secretary,'' said Valerie
Mitchell-Sigwalt, noting how many black people were in Clinton's
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   For Soncarae Thornton, the moral issues surrounding the Clinton
scandal that so vex much of the country seem rather simple _ and
mundane _ to her, only emphasizing the distance between black
America and Washington's largely-white power structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here feel like, `If a man cheats, he's going
to lie about it,''' Thornton said. ``That's common knowledge here
on the streets. I don't know about higher up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's another reason, alluded to by Thornton's 12-year-old
son, Tariq Abdul Latif, who complained, ``They're always going
after Clinton for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Whitehead, a University of Massachusetts professor, said,
``A lot of African-Americans, for perfectly legitimate reasons,
don't like prosecutors. To the degree that this is a battle between
Bill Clinton and Ken Starr, the choice for black America is awfully
easy to make.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a point also made, with trademark sarcasm, by black
comedian Chris Rock. Wildly popular in Washington, Rock has made
the bond between Clinton and many blacks a part of his standup
routine. He has said Clinton is ``the first black president of the
United States. They don't give him any slack, you know. Clinton
will spend a $100 bill, and they'll put it up to the light.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between Clinton's background and that of many
blacks from the South was not lost on voters.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Palmer, of Mt. Pleasant, explained, ``Even though he's
white, his background is no different than ours. He grew up in the
rural South. He was in poverty in many ways. He rose above that.
And those are things that are greatly respected in the black
community. Even though he's white, he's a person that a lot of us
identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's familiarity with black culture has two roots _ the
experience of living shoulder to shoulder with blacks in Hope,
Ark., despite segregated institutions; and his position at the
vanguard of a generation that broke the chains of the Jim Crow era.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his young adulthood, Clinton had many black friends,
including a black roommate for a time. A black friend showed him
around Moscow during a visit to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton's gestures reflect his knowledge and
affection for black culture. His speeches often echo the cadences
of the black church. He sometimes seems more comfortable before
black audiences than white. His first elaborated apology for the
Lewinsky scandal was in Oak Bluffs, Mass., a vacation home to many
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of white liberals know the words, but they don't seem to
feel the music,'' said Whitehead. ``Clinton does.''
</P>
<P>
   William T. Coleman Jr., a black friend of Clinton's from Yale,
told Maraniss that he had a theory about black and white
southerners who have transcended segregation: ``They feel some part
of the soul that touches each other. There is something about the
rhythm that creates a compatability. Bill had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyanfore, the Washington voter who loved Clinton for going to
Africa, actually sensed a gleam of recognition in Clinton's eye
when the president visited his church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I got to see the president and shake his
hand like another human being,'' he said. ``We're all human beings.
He has said he was wrong. He asked God for forgiveness. He asked
the whole country to forgive him. And it's time the country forgave
each other and went on to do the work God wants us to do.''

   BOSTON _ President Clinton and Massachusetts Democrats will
gather Thursday night at the Park Plaza Hotel to raise money for
candidates running for the US House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among those invited are three House Judiciary Committee members,
who are expected to sit in judgment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
plans to attend unless major votes in the House get in the way.
Frank said he sees no conflict in appearing with the president,
since every member of the House will ultimately vote on his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat,
will not fly to Boston Thursday night, an aide said, because the
House will be in session.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Martin T. Meehan said he would like to attend
the unity dinner if he is able to coordinate it with votes in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of my being a member of Congress, you have
interaction with the president, but that is not going to cloud my
judgment,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials are considering chartering a plane
from Washington for the event. Besides Clinton, Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle and House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt
are expected to attend.

FAR FROM CHINA BUT COMPLETELY AT HOME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>

 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Bruce B. Dayton, a longtime trustee at the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts, is a nudger and risk taker. In
running the Dayton-Hudson Corp., the retailing giant that his
grandfather founded in 1902, he was known as a man who said little,
relying on firm but gentle prodding to get people to do what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dayton nudged Robert D. Jacobsen, the museum's
curator of Asian art. The two men were looking over the 75 pieces
of Ming and Ching furniture that Dayton and his wife, Ruth, had
bought and given to the museum since 1991. Construction of its
expanded galleries was beginning, and Dayton and Jacobsen were
discussing ways that the furniture could be exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce always thinks about how things will look in the
museum,'' Jacobsen said. ``So he asked me about how the furniture
would be shown, saying, `Can't there be some context?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result will be seen in two period rooms that are the
centerpiece of the Asian art complex, part of the museum's expanded
galleries, which will have their grand opening next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the men talked about making a replica of a period
room. Then Jacobsen proposed an alternative. ``It's a long shot,
but let me go to China and find an authentic period room, an
all-purpose space like a reception hall,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural elements from Chinese buildings were showing up at
that time in antiques galleries from Hong Kong to New York and
London. But no one had brought a room or house out of China in more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Dayton, who said such a trip might be risky and costly
but was worth the gamble, Jacobsen flew to Shanghai and traveled
west to Suzhou near Lake Tai. It was in that area that the literati
style of furnishings flourished among the elite in the late Ming
period, when men preferred to write music and poetry rather than go
to war.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting seven structures in five villages, Jacobsen
flew back to report his findings to Dayton. He and Jacobsen decided
which structures would be most appropriate for the museum, and
Dayton bought two: a 17th-century house with a soaring reception
hall, graced by a glorious carved ceiling, and an 18th-century
lattice-framed scholar's studio with an adjoining garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we'd find a room you could prove was a library
or scholar's studio,'' Jacobsen said. ``The one we bought was
storing iron pipes and beehives, but it had its own plaque, dated
1797, and an inscription on a beam that described the room as `the
studio of gratifying discourse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a crew of 13 Chinese artisans spent five weeks
dismantling the two structures. Last winter, after the parts were
cleaned and repaired, they were shipped here. And in April, four of
the workmen who had disassembled the structures were flown in from
China and to reassemble them at the museum, a three-month task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our timing in pursuing rooms was sheer luck,'' Jacobsen said.
Until the 1990s, when the shift to private ownership began in
China, the Communist government had forbidden the export of houses
and rooms. Other American buyers have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Edward C. Johnson III, chairman of Fidelity
Investments, the mutual fund giant, bought a 16-room 18th-century
merchant's house and donated it to the Peabody Essex Museum in
Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who is 80, has been a trustee and generous donor to the
Minneapolis Institute for more than 50 years. Until 1991, his gifts
to the museum were mostly European art _ Mondrians, Manets, Monets,
Matisses, Maillots, Renoirs and Rodins. Then the Francophile
collector became a Sinophile.
</P>
<P>
   He said the change occurred around the time he and Ruth Stricker
were married. Mrs. Dayton, who is 63, is the founder and the
executive director of the Marsh, a health care and meditation
center, with a staff of 175, where yoga and tai chi are taught. She
also collects Chinese bamboo furniture. ``It's strong and flexible,
so I admire it as the Chinese do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton had never bought antique furniture until he gave the
museum his first Chinese pieces _ a scholar's cabinet and a pair of
chairs, all Ming. Chinese furniture had struck a chord with him:
the plain surfaces and stark silhouettes, the high backs on chairs,
the legginess of lean, long tables, and the practicality of folding
chairs. They seemed akin to Bauhaus designs and the Mondrian
paintings he collected.
</P>
<P>
   His love of landscapes, well known from the French paintings he
has donated to the museum, is also seen in a Ming marble screen,
the stone striated with an image resembling mountains. (He bought
it at Christie's in New York in 1996 for $1.1 million, a record for
Chinese furniture.)
</P>
<P>
   Dayton paid all of the costs to buy the structures, dismantle,
ship and reassemble them _ a total of $1 million. The 75 pieces of
Ming and Ching furniture cost 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   The Daytons' generosity, Jacobsen said, cut through a lot of red
tape. ``If we would have gone through an accessions committee,
piece by piece, these Chinese galleries never would have
happened,'' he said. ``We were able to act quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jacobsen, the settings offer museumgoers the serenity that
many people are seeking today. For Mrs. Dayton, they reflect
Chinese ideals: ``Oneness with nature and our surroundings. And
tranquillity: life is a dance, not an argument.''

 &HT;    Dayton congregation helps Vietnamese's family to come America
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- As he speaks, Diep Hoang Le's eyes narrow with
an intensity that his limited English can't fully express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can work anything,'' the Vietnamese immigrant and former
political prisoner said. ``If I have enough money to feed my family
_ any job.''
</P>
<P>
   Le, 52, his wife, Hong Thi, and his 18-year-old daughter arrived
in Dayton a week ago with little more than the clothes on their
backs and the two precious items they had kept hidden for years
from the communists _ a tattered paperback edition of the Oxford
Dictionary and a small Vietnamese-English translation book.
</P>
<P>
   For Le, a former South Vietnamese army officer, defying the
communist ban on English texts was worth the risk. The books had
become symbols of the new life he planned someday for his family in
America _ a dream for which he slaved and schemed some 22 years.
Five of those years were spent doing hard labor in a communist
re-education camp.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Le considers himself and his family lucky. Thousands of
other former political prisoners still languish in Vietnam, waiting
for American sponsors to help bring them over and for a grudging
and corrupt Vietnamese government to approve their passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay over 1 million Vietnamese money (about $72) for
passport, but still I must wait four years'' before receiving the
document, Le said.
</P>
<P>
   That $72 bribe paid to passport officials took Le years to
accumulate from his meager earnings, first as a bicycle taxi driver
and later as a waiter in a Chinese soup kitchen. The average pay in
Vietnam is $4 a day.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the College Hill Community Church in Dayton,
Le's dream of reaching this country at last came true. The
congregation has provided his family with sparsely furnished but
tidy two-bedroom apartment. The church will continue to assist the
family with food, clothing and transportation until they can
support themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ba Nguyen, president of the Vietnamese Veterans Association of
the Dayton Area, said sponsors for refugee families are needed. The
15 members of his local chapter have assisted so many families
they've depleted their funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time we use money out of our own pockets to do
this work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 churches in Ohio are sponsoring refugees for
resettlement in the state, according to the Interfaith Refugee
Services of Ohio, a Columbus-based group that coordinates the
placement of refugees. Last year, it found sponsors in Ohio for 350
people from 14 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Ward, who heads the refugee committee for College Hill
Community Church, knows why so few churches are involved. ``It
takes a lot of work _ a lot of planning, a lot of networking, a lot
of time _ to really get (the refugees) where they need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, refugee families need three months to six months
of assistance before they can find jobs and become self-sufficient.
But money isn't always the biggest problem, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Often with only a few days' notice from authorities, sponsors
must find a suitable apartment, a landlord willing to forgo a
credit check and donations of furniture, bedding and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I end up doing a lot of begging and harassing of my friends,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 South Vietnamese have settled in the Dayton area
since the end of the war in 1974, but only about 50 of those are
families of former political prisoners such as Le. The latter
didn't start coming to this country in large numbers until 1991,
well after the United States and the Vietnamese government reached
an agreement in 1980 to permit their emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the pact, the prisoners must have spent a minimum
of three years in a communist re-education camp and have an
American sponsor willing to help them relocate in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Le says the Vietnamese didn't begin living up to the agreement
until after the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991 and the
Vietnamese government lost its Soviet economic aid and turned to
America for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Soviet Union isn't broken down, they would never follow
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Vietnamese families who come to the Dayton area are
independent within six months, Nguyen said. ``They have a very
strong work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lewis, production manager of the Morning Pride sewing
factory in Dayton, concurs. Her company has hired 70 Vietnamese
refugees since 1985 ``and we have had 99 percent success with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many arrive with the sewing skills needed by her company, where
employees are paid by the piece to make protective clothing for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work very fast, so they make good money,'' she said.
``And they are very loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, 49, said he was fortunate to have been a pilot in the
South Vietnam air force. During the final hours before the
communist takeover, he escaped by flying his plane, an A-1
Skyraider, to a U.S. base in Thailand and soon after emigrated to
America. He has worked as a researcher at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Besides facing language and cultural barriers, the former
political prisoners _ many now in their 50s and 60s _ have other
challenges as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not old enough to retire but not young enough to find
a job,'' Nguyen said. ``The (U.S.) government has done a lot for
these POWs, bringing them into this country. But they need to do
more, because jobs are very difficult for them to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Le faces that struggle now.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, he was a young businessman with a promising
career as an interpreter for one of the largest American companies
in South Vietnam. Then, in 1968, he joined the South Vietnam army
to fight the communists. He served as a platoon leader and as an
intelligence liaison to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But when the GIs pulled out and the communists took control,
Le's life plummeted into slavery and deprivation. For five years,
he was held prisoner in what the communists called ``a training
camp.'' He was assigned hard labor _ clearing trees and building
roads with the crudest of tools from dusk to dawn _ and fed less
than three bowls of rice per day. He never spoke English again.
</P>
<P>
   Families were permitted to visit the prisoners _ and, more
important, bring them supplemental food _ once every three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were not for my family, I must die,'' Le said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, holding his worn Oxford Dictionary almost reverentially in
the palms of both hands, he said he wants to create a new life for
his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If after I learn English well, I can do any job _ anything,''
he said.

CLINTON ADDS NEW ADVISER TO WHITE HOUSE STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-REPUBS, CLINTON-CONGRESS,
CLINTON-ASSESS, CLINTON-DAY) 
(th) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago at Yale Law School, Gregory Craig was
struck by a rare burst of pessimism from a fellow student, Bill
Clinton, who argued in a seminar one day that corporate America had
too much power and money to ever be tamed, even by the democratic
institutions that the young man from Arkansas believed in and
wanted to help lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had dreams, that was a terrible time,'' Craig recalled
of that era of Vietnam-induced despair in David Maraniss' biography
of Clinton, ``First in His Class.'' ``If it was a tough time for
him, an angry, hostile period of his life, it was consistent with
what a lot of us felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Craig has worked as a public defender, a Senate
staff member, helped win an insanity defense for John W. Hinckley
Jr. in his assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan,
advised Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in the investigation growing out of
the William Kennedy Smith rape trial and served as a senior aide to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at another tough and angry time in Bill Clinton's life, the
president has tapped his old friend to join the White House staff
as quarterback of its efforts to deal with _ and, he hopes, avert _
an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides say it will be Craig's task to cut through the
legalisms about sex and lies that have beleaguered the president's
lawyers and argue Clinton's case with the constituency that counts
now: Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very low key, very steady, very cool, very smart,'' said
Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant in Los Angeles who
worked with Craig in the mid-1980s when Craig was Kennedy's foreign
policy expert. ``He has a good mix of political judgment and savvy
and legal ability. He's going to know what will pass the smell test
on the Hill and what won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 53, who since last year has been director of the Policy
and Planning Staff at the State Department, comes to the job with
an established pedigree as a Friend of Bill.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, he surrendered his $75-a-month apartment in New Haven,
Conn., to Clinton and his girlfriend, Hillary Rodham, who were a
class behind him, and he remains especially close to Mrs. Clinton,
friends say. Since Yale days, he has also been a friend of the
president's private lawyer, David Kendall, whose recent approach to
Clinton's troubles has rankled White House political advisers as
overly narrow and legalistic.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the new job, Craig was said to have wanted a clear
definition of his role, and clear responsibility for dealing with
Congress, not just the largely public relations duties of the White
House's former point man on scandals, Lanny Davis, but a negotiator
who could cut a deal. Associates said they expected him to play
just such a clear role.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kendall, Craig cut his teeth at the Washington law firm of
Williams &AMP; Connolly, where he was a particular protege of the
powerhouse name partner, Edward Bennett Williams. With Vincent
Fuller, he helped win a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity
for Hinckley in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will take up duties in a White House where the press
secretary, Mike McCurry, has recently been forced to publicly deny
queries on whether the president has been receiving psychiatric
care.
</P>
<P>
   Craig did not return telephone messages seeking comment for this
article. But in a discussion of the Hinckley defense on ``Rivera
Live,'' on CNBC in 1996, Craig noted that the insanity plea has a
``very, very good pedigree,'' and ``represents the belief, I think,
that society will not hold someone responsible for his acts or her
acts if he doesn't have the capacity to make a decision,'' or
``cannot distinguish between right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Bestor Craig was born in Norfolk, Va., and graduated
magna cum laude from Harvard University, where he was a leader in
student antiwar movements and made a Class Day speech that drew
national attention. He also holds a degree from Cambridge
University in England.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Craig kept up an interest in politics,
and has said he could not think of a political event that excited
him more than Clinton's first inaugural as governor of Arkansas. On
Kennedy's staff, Craig coordinated policy on Latin America and
South Africa, and organized the senator's trip to South Africa at
the height of world concern over apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Craig is no stranger to controversy. Besides defending Hinckley
and advising his old boss, Kennedy, in the aftermath of a bout of
partying in Palm Beach, Fla., that led to his nephew's encounter
with Patricia Bowman _ and ultimate acquittal on rape charges _
Craig represented the Mevs family of Haiti in their efforts to
persuade the Bush and Clinton administrations to protect their
business interests in the face of political turmoil on the island
in the wake of the overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented the government of Panama that succeeded Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega in a federal civil racketeering suit
contending that the ousted leader betrayed his country through
fraud, murder and theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an excellent strategist, a skilled politician and a man
who understands the various crosshairs of Washington,'' said his
longtime partner Robert Barnett, who himself has been the
president's private lawyer in the past. ``He understands how to
deal with the press, Congress and legal issues.'' &QL;

   BOSTON _ President Clinton and Massachusetts Democrats will
gather Thursday night at the Park Plaza Hotel to raise money for
candidates running for the US House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among those invited are three House Judiciary Committee members,
who are expected to sit in judgment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
plans to attend unless major votes in the House get in the way.
Frank said he sees no conflict in appearing with the president,
since every member of the House will ultimately vote on his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat,
will not fly to Boston Thursday night, an aide said, because the
House will be in session.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Martin T. Meehan said he would like to attend
the unity dinner if he is able to coordinate it with votes in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of my being a member of Congress, you have
interaction with the president, but that is not going to cloud my
judgment,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials are considering chartering a plane
from Washington for the event. Besides Clinton, Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle and House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt
are expected to attend.

A HOLLYWOOD SATIRE THAT REFUSES TO STAY DOWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The return of ``The Dying Gaul'' to the Vineyard
Theater, where it closed in June, conjures up titles befitting a
parody of a bad movie sequel _ ``The Gaul That Would Not Die,''
perhaps, or ``The Dying Gaul: Resurrection.'' And on one level,
that's fine with the author, Craig Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Dying Gaul'  &UR; is &LR;  a Hollywood satire,'' said Lucas, who
knows that world well as the adapter of several of his own plays to
film _ ``Prelude to a Kiss'' and ``Reckless'' _ and the author of
the screenplay for ``Longtime Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``Hollywood is not the real subject matter
here. My play uses that world of high-rolling big money _ that
crazy-making business _ to examine a whole range of subjects.''
These include Buddhism, psychoanalysis and, in particular, the
Internet. Much of the action occurs while actors type on invisible
keyboards and communicate as if in a computer chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the ancient sculpture of a slain soldier
that the author Craig Lucas saw in a Rome museum. In the play,
``The Dying Gaul'' is also the title of a film script that Robert
(played by Tim Hopper) has written about the death of his lover,
who had AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Robert sells the script for a million dollars to a jaded
producer, Jeffrey (Cotter Smith), who wants to change it radically.
With his integrity unraveling as fast as his script's original
intent, Robert soon becomes the third point of a nasty love
triangle between the bisexual Jeffrey and his wife, Elaine (Linda
Emond). What begins, then, as parody ends as a disturbing tale
that, the author said, ``is so full of rage it is difficult for
some audiences to take.''
</P>
<P>
   For those involved in the production, the play's first
performance, on May 8, was itself difficult to take. Earlier in the
day Smith suffered a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were literally calling critics at 4 o'clock, saying: `Uh,
there's a problem. Don't come to the theater tonight,' '' said
Douglas Aibel, the artistic director of the Vineyard. Smith was
quickly replaced by Tony Goldwyn, rehearsals were extended and the
play opened on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the lost time at the beginning, and because this is
the most important play Craig has ever written, I was determined to
bring it back,'' said Aibel, who views the play as ``new terrain
for Craig.'' ``Luckily, Cotter recuperated over the summer, and the
cast and director, Mark Brokaw, were determined to return.'' The
play, which reopened on Friday, is scheduled to run through Oct.
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dying Gaul'' received reviews as mixed in tenor as the
play itself. The Wall Street Journal called it ``the best American
play of the year.'' The New Yorker complained, ``You can't figure
out what it is.'' The New York Times was split: Peter Marks called
the play ``a minor tantrum''; Vincent Canby found it
``fascinating'' and the production ``flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   For Aibel, ``The Dying Gaul'' functions on many levels. ``It's a
thriller, a morality play,'' he said. ``It's a crackling yarn, but
it's challenging, too. Audiences aren't used to the Internet as
both a setting for the play's action and as a dramatic tool. I
think we'll see more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may indeed see more of it. In Patrick Marber's new
British play ``Closer,'' which is expected to come to New York
later this season, two characters communicate using keyboards,
typing words that the audience sees on a large rear screen.
</P>
<P>
   To Aibel, the computer as dramatic device is simply a matter of
theater keeping up with the times. ``What was, in past plays, a
knock on the door or a cocktail party is now an e-mail or a chat
room,'' he said.

GARRETT TO START IN PLACE OF AIKMAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Troy Aikman went down with a fractured left clavicle
against Denver on Sunday, it looked as if the Dallas Cowboys'
playoff hopes went with him. Aikman's scramble for extra yards
knocked him out for at least four weeks and possibly as many as
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Aikman out, the Cowboys have entrusted their new offense to
Jason Garrett, who has been a backup in Dallas for all of his six
National Football League seasons. And though Garrett lacks Aikman's
arm strength and experience, his teammates are rallying around him
as the team prepares to face the Giants at the Meadowlands on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's new to the players,'' Emmitt Smith, the
Dallas running back, said of Garrett. ``He's just new to the
system. But Jason is an intelligent individual. Everybody feels
confident that he can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, said he would not try to bring
in an experienced quarterback to replace Aikman. Jones said he
would go with Garrett as the starter and Mike Quinn as the backup
until Aikman returned.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who still looks like the undergraduate history major he
was at Princeton, has a tough assignment. The Giants and the
Cowboys are heated rivals in the National Football Conference East.
The game will be broadcast for a national audience. Both teams are
1-1, after losses and want to avert early-season slides that could
hurt their playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping in for Aikman is not completely new to Garrett, who is
2-0 as a starter. When Aikman injured his left hamstring against
the Giants in November 1993, Garrett came in and guided two scoring
drives, completing 4 of 5 passes for 34 yards in the Cowboys' 31-9
victory. The next week he got his first start against Arizona and
helped lead the Cowboys to a 20-15 victory. When Aikman and his
backup, Rodney Peete, were injured in a game against the Redskins
in 1994, Garrett finished up in the Cowboys' 31-7 victory. The next
week he started against Green Bay on Thanksgiving Day and led one
of the greatest comebacks in Cowboys history. Garrett guided the
Cowboys to six straight second-half scoring drives, including five
consecutive touchdowns, in a 42-31 victory over Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're a backup quarterback, you have to put yourself
in the position mentally that you have to come in at any moment
during the game,'' Garrett said. ``That's the mind-set that I have
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett is not awed by stepping into the starter's role. He was
raised in a football environment. His father, Jim, who is now a
scout with the Cowboys, had coaching stops in New Jersey, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Dallas, Houston, Cleveland and New Orleans while
Garrett was growing up; Garrett transferred from Princeton to
Columbia in his sophomore year when his father was briefly the
Lions' coach, then transferred back. Two of Garrett's brothers are
assistant coaches in the NFL, Judd in New Orleans and John in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his tenure with the Cowboys, Garrett
entered training camp this season as the No. 2 quarterback. Not
having to worry about competing for a job allowed Garrett to
concentrate on learning the offensive system installed by Coach
Chan Gailey. But because Aikman was also learning a new system,
Garrett's practice snaps with the first team were limited. In
preparation for the Giants this week, he will get the majority of
them. Aikman said he will try to help Garrett as much as possible,
but neither of them is completely comfortable with the offense yet.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett believes his ability to run the offense against Denver
in the second half last Sunday will give his teammates confidence
that he can handle the starting role. Garrett did move the offense
down the field against the Broncos, but the Cowboys were not able
to score any touchdowns. Garrett led them to three field goals.
Smith said he and the other veteran players from past Super Bowl
teams, like receiver Michael Irvin, guard Nate Newton and tackle
Erik Williams, will have to pick up the slack in Aikman's absence.
``If I have learned anything from my career in Dallas, it is that
these guys will go on,'' Aikman said. ``Jason will do fine. And I'm
not out for the season. I'll be back after a few games.'' &QL;

TEAMS IN THE NEWS: SYRACUSE, FLORIDA, PENN STATE, RUTGERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RON DICKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Eight-man fronts intended to contain
quarterback Donovan McNabb were also stopping fullback Rob Konrad,
so Syracuse expanded Konrad's role as a receiver this season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The results have been promising. Konrad caught two touchdown
passes in the Orangemen's 38-28 victory over Michigan last week,
and he has 10 receptions for 122 yards in 2 games. He is drawing
comparisons to the former Syracuse fullback Daryl Johnston of the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's rather natural to me,'' Konrad said
Tuesday. ``I was a tailback in high school and I'm used to handling
the ball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Konrad's other duty is to plow defenders out of the way for the
running backs and to pick up blitzing linebackers who are aiming
for McNabb, a contender for the Heisman Trophy. Pass blocking is
easier because McNabb can elude defenders who make it into the
backfield, Konrad said.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutal two weeks, the No. 13 Orangemen (1-1) get an
apparent Big East breather this weekend against Rutgers (1-1).
Konrad, perhaps in an effort to avoid an appearance on Rutgers'
bulletin board, said: ``What people don't understand about
Rutgers-Syracuse is that there's a rivalry there. The fact is,
Rutgers always plays Syracuse tough. At the same time, they're not
going to be a Tennessee or Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA _ Tamaurice (Tee) Martin has succeeded Peyton Manning at
quarterback for Tennessee, but Tim Beauchamp's mission remains the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rush hard, every play,'' Beauchamp, a Gators
defensive end, said Tuesday in preparation for No. 2 Florida's
Southeastern Conference clash at No. 6 Tennessee (1-0) on Saturday.
The loser can probably say goodbye to its national championship
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ran for 80 yards in a 34-33 victory over Syracuse two
weeks ago. Beauchamp said he would still charge at the quarterback,
and react if Martin moved out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators (2-0) have won five straight games in the series, and
Beauchamp was a key contributor in the last two. Last year, he
forced a fumble and sacked Manning in the Gators' 33-20 victory in
Gainesville, Fla. However, the Volunteers went on to win the
Eastern Division of the SEC and beat Auburn in the conference
championship. Beauchamp said a victory in Saturday's game is
imperative because the Gators believe they must win all 13 games to
capture the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday could be the most difficult step. Florida, which has
beaten up on the Citadel and Northeast Louisiana, faces a quick
team before more than 100,000 fans in unfriendly territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of young guys who have not played in an
environment like that,'' Beauchamp said. ``We'll try to get them
out of the game early, but if that's not happening, we'll have to
be mentally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   PENN STATE _ Running back Cordell Mitchell is not playing
favorites when it comes to the Nittany Lions' platooning
quarterbacks, Kevin Thompson and Rashard Casey. ``Honestly, I
really don't care,'' he said Tuesday. ``We don't get the ball
thrown to us that often. A handoff is a handoff.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is making the most of his handoffs after two years of
being Curtis Enis' backup. He has rushed 22 times for 203 yards and
a touchdown. That one of those runs was for 77 yards should come as
no surprise. The 6-foot, 199-pound Mitchell was a track standout at
Corcoran High School in Syracuse, and it was his speed that kept
the interest of Coach Joe Paterno through a difficult recruiting
battle against Syracuse Coach Paul Pasqualoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's slowly getting better and better,'' Paterno said of
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell admitted that before the season he was not fully
confident that he could fill the role of primary ball carrier. He
said he learned a strong work ethic from Enis, now a Chicago Bear,
but he does not imitate Enis' punishing style. Mitchell thinks more
about following his blockers to the opening and exploding for a big
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look for the home run every play,'' he said. ``If it
comes my way, I'll try to take it all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's maturation comes at a crucial time for the No. 8
Nittany Lions (2-0). After Saturday's game at Pittsburgh (1-0) and
an open week, Penn State travels to No. 1 Ohio State for its first
Big Ten game.
</P>
<P>
   As for his two quarterbacks, Paterno said: ``They've been
careful with the football and I think they've been efficient. Where
I think we need to do a better job is quicker reads. We've had five
sacks in two games; part of that is the quarterbacks' fault.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the first two games, Thompson (18 of 28 for 273 yards and
a touchdown) will get the starting assignment over Casey (7 of 10
for 67 yards).
</P>
<P>
   RUTGERS _ Michael Barr, a freshman punter, expected to spend his
first year learning from the starter, Charlie Titus. In fact, Barr
was not with the team for Rutgers' loss at Boston College last
weekend, when Titus broke his jaw after being blocked in the face
on a punt return. Now Barr will get on-the-job training as the
starting punter against No. 13 Syracuse this Saturday at the
Carrier Dome. What a way to break in.

REMEMBERING A MENTOR WHO SOUGHT PERFECTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio)   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no one quite like James Truitte. Lean and
craggy faced, intense yet calm, Truitte brought a quietly dramatic,
powerful presence and maturity to bear on Alvin Ailey's earliest
dances.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to Ailey after dancing with Joseph Rickard's
Hollywood Negro Ballet and with Lester Horton, the West Coast
modern-dance pioneer, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After retirement from the stage, Truitte became an active and
passionate disseminator of the little-known Horton technique and
repertory in dance companies and schools across the nation. An
old-school gentleman, Truitte looked back with remarkable
detachment _ and wry wit _ on a creative life circumscribed by
racial bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural history is filled, of course, with gifted individuals
whose stories and contributions have become lost in time. But Kevin
Ward, the resident choreographer of the Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company, has not forgotten Truitte, an early and beloved mentor,
who died in 1995 at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's new ``Offering,'' an homage to Truitte, will be performed
by the Dayton troupe starting Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, in a
one-week season that also includes revivals of dances by Asadata
Dafora and Talley Beatty and works by Donald Byrd and Sharon Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   Truitte's life and career will also be touched on in ``For
Jimmy,'' a photographic exhibition at the New School through Sept.
28, and in a panel discussion on Sept. 26, also at the New School.
</P>
<P>
   Ward first came into contact with Truitte in the early 1970s as
a dance and music student at the University of Cincinnati College
Conservatory of Music, where Truitte was teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just scared to death of this man,'' Ward said in a
recent interview. ``He was going on and on about this Horton
technique. What was he going to do next? He was imposing. This
tall, regal man with this mane of hair like a lion.'' Nonetheless,
he was drawn to Truitte's teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't exactly strict. You could (italics)live(end italics)
in his classes. But he was very particular about the technique that
he was teaching. You didn't do it wrong in his class; he made sure
you didn't do it wrong. You went back and back and you kept doing
it until you got it right. He was very methodical. I hadn't run
into a teacher so thorough and committed, at that point.'' Truitte
quickly became a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction was the living dance history that Truitte
offered through his stories and comments in class and rehearsal.
Ward was an apprentice with the Cincinnati Ballet at a time when
Truitte was reviving Horton dances for the company. ``Truitte would
go on and on about what Lester Horton was doing over on the West
Coast, to give the dancers a better idea of the technique and what
was involved in performing the pieces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he got older he told more and more stories. I hooked up
again with Truitte in Dayton, at DCDC. He had been with the company
for a number of years as an artistic adviser and mentor. DCDC was
reviving a lot of classic African-American choreography and he had
been on the scene with a lot of those events. He'd danced a lot of
those works. He was able to tell us not only the technique but the
nuances, the wherefore and whys of what was being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he also gave us all this backstage gossip. He talked about
his own problems with performances and with working with Alvin.
Lots of great stuff about being on the road, and dancing with all
these people. It was all useful. And he talked about the black
vaudeville acts, the black ballet companies of the 30s, the black
shows of the '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Truitte's death was sudden and unexpected. ``I wanted to give
him something posthumously,'' Ward said of ``Offering.'' ``I guess
that happens a lot when you lose people you have grown to love,
when you didn't get a chance to say goodbye. I didn't get a chance
to say how much he meant to my life. All the encouragement, the
information, the affection that he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who is also a composer, set ``Offering'' to music from
Glazounov's ``Seasons'' and Delius' ``Songs of Farewell.'' ``I
wanted to say something about the seasons of a dancer's life. I
always liked the Delius. And it's a send-off. To say I hope you
have the best trip you can have in eternity.''

U.S. APPEARS TO BE UNDECIDED ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (changes Milosevic's title from Serbian president to Yugoslav
president, in 7th graf)  (bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As evidence mounts of a human catastrophe in
Kosovo, the United States is still far from a decision over whether
to use military force to put an end to the Serbian assault that has
forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, senior
Clinton administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The growing crisis in Kosovo is likely to pose an early test of
President Clinton's resolve and his ability to take decisive action
in foreign policy in the wake of the scandal surrounding his
personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is awful and getting worse,'' said a senior
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If
we don't want thousands of people to starve to death this winter,
the White House will need to make a decision very quickly on
whether to use firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Charity groups say the situation in Kosovo grows more desperate
virtually by the hour, with nearly continuous Serbian shelling of
villages populated by ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90
percent of the population of the southern Serbian province. More
than 900 people have been reported killed in the fighting this
year, most of them ethnic Albanian guerrillas and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee,
described a ``human catastrophe in the making'' after visiting
Kosovo earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them up close and in person: women and children, the
elderly living in fear without adequate food and shelter,'' he
said. ``These hungry masses will within weeks face winter and the
freezing conditions that come with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton administration officials say they are pressing the
White House to make a direct threat to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that the United States will use military force against
Serbian targets _ most likely, by air strikes with U.S. cruise
missiles _ if the onslaught is not halted. They said that NATO
contingency planning for the attacks was all but completed.
</P>
<P>
   Similar strikes in 1995 were credited with helping end three
years of war in neighboring Bosnia and bringing the warring parties
to the peace table.
</P>
<P>
   But other aides to the president are more cautious, fearing that
military force by the United States and its reluctant NATO partners
might only embolden Serb forces into a more violent campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday with reporters in Washington, Gen. John
Jumper, the commander of U.S. air forces in Europe, said the
situation in Kosovo was in some ways more complex than the
situation three years ago in Bosnia, and that air strikes is Kosovo
might not have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign can be done,'' he said. ``The air campaign is
just like before. It is one that is easy to put together, and it's
not difficult to execute.'' But he added: ``The solutions that we
saw work before are not necessarily the solutions that the
leadership thinks will work in this case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are also fearful that air
strikes might encourage the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebels who
are seeking independence of Kosovo from Serbia, a goal not shared
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the Kosovars' air force,'' said a senior
U.S. official. ``It's not the same dynamic as in Bosnia, because we
don't recognize Kosovo's independence. We recognize the Kosovo
region as an important part of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States contemplates military action against
Serbia, it continues to press for a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being overseen by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia, who has been shuttling between Belgrade
and Kosovo in hopes of brokering a cease-fire, so far without
success.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been forced to tangle not only with Serbian and Kosovo
leaders, but also with European leaders angered by recent public
comments in which he criticized Europe for doing too little to end
the fighting. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has described
Hill's comments as ``cynical and condescending.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials involved in policy-making in the
Balkans say they are working against a de facto deadline of
mid-October in deciding what to do next in Kosovo, since that is
when winter begins to set in.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs continue their offensive and refugees are kept from
their homes, tens of thousands of them will be at risk of freezing
to death in the forests where they have hidden, the Americans say.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate concern for the United States are reports that
Serbian forces have begun rounding up men and boys from ethnic
Albanian villages and refugee camps in Kosovo, an act that U.S.
officials fear could be the prelude to their execution, as happened
during the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``American and European leaders have pledged not to allow the
crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in
Kosovo,'' Dole said after his visit this month. ``But from what I
have seen, such crimes are already happening.''
</P>
<P>
   John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights, who accompanied Dole in Kosovo, said the U.S. delegation
had found evidence of ``horrendous human rights violations,
violations of humanitarian law and acts of punitive destruction on
a massive scale.''

 By JAMES BENNET and ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton hired a raft of fresh advisers
and dispatched his top aides to placate congressional Democrats on
Tuesday, as members of the House Judiciary Committee bickered over
whether to release a videotape of his grand jury testimony about
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats accused Republicans of needlessly rushing to
release embarrassing television images of the president, but the
Republicans, who have the votes in the Judiciary Committee to force
the disclosure, argued that the testimony would help the public
judge whether the president had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   That question _ whether the president lied and whether he is now
trying to dodge behind a wall of legalistic language _ continued to
bedevil him, as several House and Senate Democrats angrily
criticized the White House in private meetings on Tuesday. Erskine
Bowles, the chief of staff, and other top aides tried to reassure
the congressional Democrats that Clinton was not resorting to
thinly sliced legal distinctions in rebuffing accusations of
perjury by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should be worried that renegade Democrats might
call for Clinton to resign, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said: ``They
should worry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of television appearances on Sunday, Clinton's
lawyers insisted that the president had not lied under oath in
denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but many Democrats
as well as Republicans dismissed their remarks as finely nuanced
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said that Bowles repeated the White House message of
recent days _ that the president had made a terrible mistake and
was sorry. But Kerrey continued to express concern that the White
House was relying on distinctions that would be lost on most
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a necessity to make a legal case,'' he said,
``but his most difficult case is the political case.'' That was a
reference to the possibility of impeachment proceedings in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the private meetings, the White House took other
steps on Tuesday to try to put its relationship with Capitol Hill
on a firmer footing. It announced that Clinton had hired Gregory
Craig, director of policy planning at the State Department, to
serve as special counsel coordinating the reponse to Congress over
the Lewinsky matter. Clinton also brought back two former
legislative aides, Steve Ricchetti and Susan Brophy, as senior
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers expressed concern about the release of his
videotaped testimony. The Judiciary Committee may meet on Thursday,
and if it decides to release the tape, it could do so as early as
Friday. Last Friday, the House released Starr's report. On Tuesday,
Congress was told the Lewinsky matter cost $4.4 million to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not reviewed the videotape, because Clinton
and his lawyers do not have a copy, White House officials said. But
one aide said that a tape of any person's hours-long grand jury
testimony would produce unflattering moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the way TV will play it, they'll pick a piece
of it and play it over and over and over again,'' the aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said. ``It's not a pleasant
thing to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one camera filmed the testimony, so the prosecutors are not
shown. Clinton's advisers have said that he became quite angry and
even erupted at a couple of points during the questioning, which
was often confrontational. Clinton's allies in the White House and
on Capitol Hill are concerned that television news programs will
show the displays of anger without first showing the many minutes
of questioning that preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape will also show Clinton repeatedly refusing to
answer some questions and offering carefully calibrated answers to
others, according to descriptions of his testimony in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday morning, Clinton's senior aides
received some reassuring news in a meeting with pollsters and other
outside advisers. Three Democratic pollsters _ Mark Mellman, Geoff
Garin and Mark Penn _ told the group that there was no evidence
that Clinton's troubles would suppress Democratic turnout this
fall, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said that some elements of the Democrats' loyal
base, including black voters, may be more likely to go to the polls
because of a perception that Clinton was unfairly under attack.
They also noted that Clinton's job approval ratings remained
strong, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included Lloyd Cutler, the longtime Washington
lawyer, and Peter Kadzick, another Washington lawyer who is playing
an informal advisory role at the White House. One participant said
the group discussed how the White House should mount a defense as
the case moves to Congress. ``The consensus is that public opinion
is really going to drive this process now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Craig's appointment as special counsel is likely to result in a
lower-profile role for David Kendall, the president's private
lawyer, whose tight control of information has often angered the
president's other advisers. Several aides blamed Kendall's
appearance on an ABC news program Sunday for angering congressional
Democrats about legal dodges.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will report directly to the president, relieving John
Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, of day-to-day responsibility
for fending off impeachment hearings in the House, and, should the
hearings begin, impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said that it was
appropriate bring a new defense team onto the White House payroll.
``This is a constitutional process in which the House is
considering some serious issues,'' he said, ``and the office of the
presidency has an obligation to work closely with the House as they
move through this process and to defend the prerogatives of the
office of the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's aides continued the politically delicate task of
describing the president's mistakes in lacerating terms while
defending him from congressional criticism. Mike McCurry, the White
House press secretary, insisted that Clinton was not resorting to a
legalistic defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that is more profound than the
president admitting a mortal sin, asking for forgiveness, saying
how he has wronged people,'' he said. ``If anything, he has
confessed to far worse than the narrow legal question his lawyers
were being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings with Democrats on Capitol Hill, White House
aides got an earful about the legal tactics employed so far. After
meeting over a caucus lunch with senators, they gathered for an
hour in a basement meeting room with two dozen centrist Democrats,
and then with a group of House leaders in Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt's office. ``The leadership was a little tougher,'' said
one official who attended both meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said that one message the
congressmen delivered on Tuesday was that, ``In terms of the public
discussion, the average American does not understand the legalisms
and doesn't view them as being forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the members also urged the White House not to
cave in to the Republicans over health care, education, and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid reporters, most Democratic senators slipped out a side
door from their meeting. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York
said that the overall message was ``let's stand up and get through
this. There was no suggestion that we were not in any difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the meetings with White House officials, members of
Congress sparred on Tuesday over whether to release Clinton's
videotaped testimony. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who is the
ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, said that if
the Republicans were to force the disclosure they would
``jeopardize the process and demean our activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said that members who are not on the committee ``are
telling me strenuously that it would be a violation of the
bipartisan spirit if we were to let the video tape be released.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that the public ought to be able to judge
for itself whether Clinton was misleading. Rep. Edward Pease,
R-Ind., said, ``What I saw of the video deposition, I did not see
anything that we should withhold.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Tuesday that the House would not
formally adjourn this year, which would allow the Judiciary
Committee to keep working after the election.

   This week, a Utah state group will begin handing over Internet
filtering records to a critic who successfully fought to have the
files declared public documents.
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Michael Sims, a computer programmer in New York
City, hopes to find out whether students and teachers are being
kept from seeing innocuous Web sites as well as sites that are
arguably inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   Sims is a member of The Censorware Project, a volunteer group of
free speech advocates who are opposed to the use of software
filters by public institutions. He expects the records to reveal
which Internet destinations students and school employees were
prevented from reaching by SmartFilter, a software program used by
many Utah schools.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Secure Computing, the company that makes the
SmartFilter program, declined comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sims chose Utah as a test case because, unlike many other
states, Utah offers most of its schools Internet access and related
services through one group, the Utah Education Network.
</P>
<P>
   When Sims first approached the Utah Education Network for the
records, agency officials told him that the information in the logs
was the property of the schools and, therefore, the agency could
not release it.
</P>
<P>
   Sims then approached the Utah State Records Committee. In late
June the committee voted to give Sims the records. The decision,
lawyers said, was the first time, they are aware, that a state body
has decided to release filtering logs to an individual after
declaring the electronic documents a public record.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GREATEST IS HONORED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Cameras were clicking inside U.N. headquarters
Tuesday afternoon when the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, presented
the Greatest, Muhammad Ali, with the Messenger of Peace honor. This
was mostly a photo opportunity: the secretary-general presented Ali
with a framed citation and a lapel pin in the form of a dove. Ali
and his wife, Lonnie, presented the secretary-general with a pair
of boxing gloves. This was a relationship filled with deep,
longstanding mutual admiration.
</P>
<P>
   The boxer and the secretary-general shared a sports background.
Annan had been a sprinter and soccer player at Macalester College
in Minnesota. Ali, of course, is the three-time heavyweight
champion of the world, the greatest of all time. Each man has
devoted his life to the pursuit of peace. Annan as a diplomat, Ali
as an unofficial ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Annan established the Messenger of Peace honor as a way of
recognizing that peace is not the mere providence of governments
but hinges on the willingness of individual citizens to use their
gifts to inspire good will. Ali became the second former athlete to
receive the honor. Magic Johnson was honored as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Muhammad transcend national boundaries,'' Annan
said. ``Some people transcend their environment and their
profession. Some of the skills they learned in athletics, the
discipline, the art of competition, having compassion for those you
defeat, working with groups and working as a team and being part of
a team; knowing that you cannot achieve much without others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing that you need to rely on others, just as they rely
on you; regardless of how brilliant you are. Playing with others
without jealousy. There are certain qualities that that great
athletes pick up that eventually can stand them in good stead in
life. These are lessons these athletes can pass on.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Annan was named secretary-general in January 1997,
he initiated the Messenger of Peace to recognize a commitment to
peace, honor and human dignity. Annan recalled one of Ali's visits
to the United Nations when he drew a picture with the inscription
``The rent we pay here on earth is service to mankind and to other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan first met Ali in 1979 when Ali, at the request of Richard
Lapchick, a U.N. employee at the time and now the director of the
Study of Sport In Society institute, requested that he address the
Special Committee Against Apartheid. Actually Annan, who was born
in Ghana, admired Ali from afar for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired him first as an athlete, an outstanding, unique
boxer,'' Annan said. ``I also followed his own travails and
difficulties and saw the way he handled himself and how he became a
stronger and a better man. That's quite an achievement. Not all of
us who go through traumatic experiences are able to pick up the
pieces and move on stronger and better men, and Muhammad did
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony in Annan's office, Ali walked through the
U.N. corridors and became the magnet he has been for three decades.
Employees stopped, tourists snapped pictures. The Russian delegate,
the delegate from Poland, a delegate from the Republic of South
Korea all shook Ali's hand. Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistani delegate,
warmly greeted Ali and told of the time he visited Ali in the
champion's home in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Ali gave him a copy of a book of prayer and signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a boxer or an athlete,'' Kamal said. ``He is a
complete man.'' Outside on the U.N. Plaza, 200 children waited and
cheered as Ali arrived. One hundred of them had walked from Harlem
to meet the champ, some of them weren't born, their parents may not
have been born when Ali recorded his great triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Ali smiled and walked among them, accepting handshakes and
requests for photos with children. Diplomats negotiate, Kofi Annan
said, but the key to true and lasting good will is the efforts of
each nation's extraordinary individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get everyone involved,'' he said. ``If we can get
prominent people in society from all walks of life to help get the
message across, to mobilize the public to get involved in the work
we are trying to do to make this world a better place, we think it
will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the secretary-general excused himself, he offered one
final image to put Muhammad Ali in proper perspective. He compared
Ali to the wise farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmer knows instinctively that if you take something from
the earth today you have to put something back to be able to return
tomorrow to harvest,'' Annan said. ``Muhammad understands that.''

MEXICAN POLICE AGENTS SAID TO HAVE TIES TO DRUG DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Replaces 6th and 7th grafs adding Mexican official's statements)  (bl) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the top investigators of an elite Mexican
police unit that was trained by Americans may have ties to drug
traffickers, U.S. officials say. The disclosure threatens to
undermine an ambitious effort to overhaul the deeply corrupt
law-enforcement system of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government experts traveled to Mexico late last month to
administer routine lie-detector tests to dozens of police agents.
Now officials say some investigators who failed had been chosen for
their posts after elaborate U.S.-designed screening.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they were just beginning to assess the
damage that corrupt investigators might have wrought, a task that
could take months. Most senior officials in the unit were
implicated by the lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say even now that much of the sensitive information
that U.S. law-enforcement agents shared with Mexican counterparts
over the last year may have been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that everything we've been giving them has
ended up in the hands of the traffickers,'' said a senior U.S.
law-enforcement official who, as did others, insisted on anonymity.
``It's a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials were more cautious about the significance of the
tests. But they said they expected that U.S. collaboration with the
unit to be suspended until the Mexican attorney general's office
undertook an investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Mexican law-enforcement official said Tuesday night
that an administrative inquiry was under way and that one senior
investigator had been reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the official also challenged the dark
conclusions that U.S. officials drew about the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vetting process was not the one we agreed to; the
questions were not clear and they were not the ones we
authorized,'' the official, who insisted on anonymity, said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City. ``Failing a polygraph does
not mean that these people committed crimes or took money, and
there may be a lot of reasons why they did not tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the law is very clear. To work in this unit you have to
pass the polygraph.''
</P>
<P>
   The penetration of the unit, apparently by powerful drug gangs,
is the latest in a series of such calamities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Washington Post reported that Mexican officials
planned to press drug-corruption charges against a handful of army
soldiers who had been stationed at the Mexico City airport as part
of the armed forces' growing role in the antinarcotics fight.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, as successive administrations in Washington have
sought to work more closely with the Mexican authorities, both to
fight the flow of illegal drugs to the United States and to
strengthen the rule of law in a strategically vital neighbor, U.S.
officials have publicly embraced senior Mexican prosecutors, police
commanders and other officials who have later been revealed, one
after another, to have taken bribes from major drug smugglers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the most serious case the Mexican government announced early
last year that its drug-enforcement chief was in fact working
secretly with the man then considered the biggest cocaine
trafficker in the country, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Days earlier the
official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, had been basking in the
praise of the Clinton administration's drug-policy director, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and other administration officials vowed that such a
debacle would not occur again. They pressed for a sweeping
reorganization of how the United States gathers and disseminates
intelligence about trafficking. The reorganization plans have run
into wide opposition among Mexican law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for Mexico, U.S. law-enforcement officials
also provided extensive help in writing a new law against organized
crime, in setting up an investigative unit to enforce the law and
in screening hundreds of other police agents assigned to drug
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective members of the Organized Crime Unit, which was set
up 18 months ago, were submitted to extensive background and
financial checks, lie-detector tests and psychological evaluations.
Nearly all those chosen also received training from the FBI, the
Drug Enforcement Administration or both.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year and a half, during which the team of 70
investigators, prosecutors and intelligence analysts has been
responsible for investigating many of the most important
drug-trafficking and kidnapping cases, its record is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. officials praise the unit for what they say was
its leading role in the arrests of a handful of important smugglers
and the dismantling of a kidnapping ring that terrorized central
Mexico while receiving protection from state officials.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Dr. Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz, 38, a former university
professor who heads the unit, has won wide respect from U.S.
officials for what they say is honesty and courage. Gonzalez Ruiz
was one of three top unit officials who were said to have passed
the lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, U.S. officials have grown critical of the
unit for the same basic failing of the special forces that came
before it. It has been unable to capture leaders of the biggest
trafficking gangs, despite having access to some of the most
sensitive intelligence that Washington has ever given the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new law on organized crime the unit has pioneered
the use of protected witnesses and plea bargaining in criminal
cases. Among other actions Gonzalez Ruiz arranged this year for
testimony before a federal grand jury in Houston by a former
Mexican federal police chief who agreed to cooperate with
authorities in return for a reduced prison sentence on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit's handling of its witnesses has sometimes left a
lot to be desired. A highly valued informer who implicated senior
military officials in drug corruption, Tomas Colsa McGregor, was
murdered last year after having left the custody of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Another informer, Oliverio Chavez, was killed last week in
Ciudad Juarez while working with the unit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials said they had received reports
from several informers in recent months indicating that there were
corruption problems in the Organized Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although one official said the recent lie-detector tests
appeared to have been a response to those informers, other
officials said the tests were routine checks of the sort that the
United States conducts for elite police and intelligence units in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials, the testing, supervised by the
Justice Department, focused in part on whether senior investigators
had passed information to drug traffickers. Five of the eight
senior officials of the unit, including its chief investigator,
appeared to respond untruthfully to such questions.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first ruling of its kind, a federal appeals
court here has ruled that a law school graduate claiming a reading
disorder was entitled to extra time and other reasonable
accommodations on the New York state bar examination _ even though
an outside expert hired by the bar examiners said she had no
disability.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate, Marilyn Bartlett, received her degree from Vermont
Law School and worked in New York City as a medical malpractice
lawyer for almost two years but had to leave the firm after failing
the state bar exam repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for those with disabilities hailed the ruling Monday
by the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals as an important victory.
But those in charge of professional licensing organizations
expressed fear that it would hinder their efforts to maintain
professional standards and weed out those who seek to use
disability claims as a cover for academic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been only a handful of lower-court rulings on
when, and whether, the federal disabilities law requires
professional licensing organizations to give accommodations on
tests to those with learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first large wave of students diagnosed with learning
disabilities moved beyond college and into the professions, those
who administer the law, medical and accounting examinations have
become mired in the same murky legal questions that high schools
and colleges grapple with when faced with claims of learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia last year, three medical students with
attention deficit disorder lost their lawsuit seeking
accommodations. And in California, those with learning disabilities
have a pending class action against the state bar examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, thousands of students with attention deficit
disorder, dyslexia or other learning disabilities receive extra
time on their school exams, and standardized exams like the
Scholastic Assessment Test or Graduate Record Examination. While
extra time is the most commonly granted accommodation, school and
professional examining boards often grant other modifications like
testing in a separate quiet room, oral examinations or use of a
computer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, Dr.
Bartlett, who has a doctorate in educational administration and is
now teaching at Dowling College on Long Island, had asked for
extended time on the bar exam, permission to tape record her essays
and the opportunity to circle multiple-choice answers in the test
booklet rather than use the computerized answer sheet.
</P>
<P>
   At Vermont Law School, she received several accommodations
during exams, including extra time, a quiet room and the use of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such requests has mushroomed in recent years.
Among the 8,791 applicants who took the New York bar exam in July
1998, 402 had requested accommodations, and 332 had received them.
Five years ago, when Dr. Bartlett last took the examination, there
were 181 such requests, of which 155 were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Bartlett, the chairman of the New York State Board of
Law Examiners, said it was too soon to say whether the case would
be appealed or whether the bar examiners would change their
evaluation procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The New York bar examiners refused Dr. Bartlett's request for
accommodations based on the opinion of their outside expert, who
said her test results did not indicate any reading disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The board's outside expert, Dr. Frank Vellutino, said Dr.
Bartlett's scores on two parts of a reading test commonly used to
assess learning disabilities were above the 30th percentile _ too
high, he said, for her to have a genuine reading disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the lengthy trial record, however, the federal appeals
court said the cutoff was arbitrary, and the test results on the
two untimed subtests did not remove her from coverage under the
federal disability law, which took effect in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision says that just because someone finds a way to
compensate for their learning disability doesn't take away the
disability, any more than someone's taking medication, or wearing
glasses, to function well doesn't mean they are not disabled,''
said Ruth Lowenkron, one of Dr. Bartlett's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was written by Judge Thomas Meskill and joined by
Judge Jose Cabranes and Judge Eugene Nickerson, upholding last
year's trial decision by U.S. District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett, who has fought an uphill battle with a reading
disorder throughout her education,'' the ruling released Monday by
the Court of Appeals said, ``is among those for whom Congress
provided protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act and
the Rehabilitation Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bartlett's cognitive impairment _ her difficulties in
automatically decoding and processing the printed word _ limits her
major life activities of learning and reading to a substantial
degree. Reasonable accommodation of this disability will enable her
to compete fairly with others in taking the examination, so that it
will be her mastery of the legal skills and knowledge that the exam
is designed to test _ and not her disability _ that determines
whether or not she achieves a passing score.''
</P>
<P>
   The court offered no guidance on when professional examining
board may rely on outside experts, or whether they should simply
accept the applicant's own expert documentation _ a scenario some
professional boards find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves bar examiners in a very vulnerable position,''
said Erica Moeser, president of the National Conference of Bar
Examiners. ``The earlier cases suggested that boards should get
outside experts to evaluate claims of disability, that they
shouldn't try to make these decisions themselves because it's not
their expertise. They were damned if they don't, and now they're
damned if they do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett of the New York State Board of Law Examiners, who is no
relation to the plaintiff, also stressed that granting
accommodations for learning disabilities is an inexact science.
``It's much more difficult to evaluate than a physical disability,
and still more difficult to know whether the right accommodations
is double time, one half extra time, or one-third extra time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who represent students with disabilities said the case can
be read to warn professional boards not to question diagnoses of
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant thing about the case, in terms of
practical impact, is the finding that these professional bodies
should not be second guessing the determinations of learning
disabilities made by the applicant's own clinicians,'' said Sid
Wolinsky, a lawyer with Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland,
Calif., who represents the learning-disabled students in the
California case. ``This is a very important victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bartlett, 50, said she brought the lawsuit because she felt
that her situation presented a good test case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that at my age, with my history of career success, I
could show that learning disabled people are not the same as
low-functioning people, which is how a lot of learning-disabled
people are made to feel,'' said Dr. Bartlett, who worked as a
medical malpractice lawyer at Bower &AMP; Gardner, a New York City law
firm that has since disbanded, for nearly two years after
graduating from law school.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is policy at most law firms, she was fired after failing
the bar exam three times.
</P>
<P>
   When she first joined the firm, she said, she compensated for
her slowness in reading by coming in early, staying late, and
billing only for an 8-hour day. After a partner questioned that
practice, she disclosed her disability and was told that she should
report her real hours, and the firm's business manager would decide
what was reasonable to bill.
</P>
<P>
   When law seemed out of reach, Dr. Bartlett returned to
educational administration, the field she had been in before
attending law school and in which she holds a Ph.D. from New York
University. When she attended NYU, there was no federal
disabilities act and no formal program for accommodating learning
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But she did not give up her hope of becoming a lawyer. And in
July 1993, after the board of law examiners denied her most recent
application for accommodations, she sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want some 24- or 25-year-old who had always set their
sights on the law to get out of law school and find they were kept
out of the bar because of their learning disabilities,'' she said
in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After her lawsuit was filed, the parties agreed that Dr.
Bartlett could take the July 1993 bar examination _ her fifth
attempt _ with the accommodations she requested _ but that if she
passed the exam, the resulted would not be certified unless she
prevailed in her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the accommodations, Dr. Bartlett failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she expects to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want that piece of paper,'' she said.

CELLUCCI, HARSHBARGER SET TO SQUARE OFF FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Setting up a race that will decide whether the
Republicans will extend their eight-year hold on the governor's
office, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday handily won the GOP
gubernatorial nomination and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger
glided to a strong victory over his two Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns and surveys taken of voters exiting polls showed
Cellucci leading state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone by about 60 to 40
percent, thwarting his challenge from the right and ending the most
bitter Republican gubernatorial battle in recent state history.
</P>
<P>
   The initial results in one of the nation's most closely watched
congressional campaigns _ the Democratic race to replace US
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II _ in the crowded 10-person
race, showed Somerville Mayor Michael Capuano building a commanding
lead. The Democratic nominee is heavily favored to win the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hard-fought Democratic race for attorney general
was going down to the wire with initial returns and exit polls
showing state Senator Lois Pines of Newton holding an early lead
over Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly of Watertown. But
Reilly was rallying as the ballots were being counted late Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite and acrimonious fight in the GOP governor's race,
Malone, after conceding defeat, closed ranks behind Cellucci
Tuesday night. Aides said he intended to appear at Cellucci's
victory party and pledge his support in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the same returns and surveys showed
Harshbarger cruising to an easy victory, winning just over a
majority of the primary vote in a three way race and giving him a
strong send-off in his battle to regain the governor's office for
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's closest rival was former stater Senator Patricia
McGovern of Andover who was expected to get just over 30 percent of
the vote, while US Representative Brian J. Donnelly of Dennis,
lagged behind with about 15 percent. Both pledged their support to
Harshbarger and vowed work for his election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a Democrat, with Democratic values to run
Massachusetts,'' McGovern told supporters gathered at a Boston
hotel as she vowed to campaign for the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Warren Tolman of Watertown was also holding a lead
in his contest for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant
governor with Governors Councilor Dorothy A. Kelly Gay of
Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Cellucci's choice for lieutenant
governor, Jane Swift, a former state senator from North Adams,
appeared to be beating out Malone's choice for a running mate,
former radio talk show host Janet E. Jeghelian of Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   The primary results will set up a clear choice for Massachusetts
voters in November: whether to keep the Republican team that can
claim credit for the state's economic renaissance in the 1990s, or
return the Democrats, with promises of a more activist government,
to power.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cellucci and Harshbarger, who are known as moderates in
their own parties, will battle for the middle ground as they court
a large population of voters for the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like a compelling contrast between the two,''
said Todd Domke, a Republican political analyst. ``This is not like
John Silber versus Bill Weld in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   The major differences will be over the death penalty and taxes.
Cellucci strongly supports the death penalty and has built a career
on antitax positions. He has already accused the attorney general
of supporting tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   But Domke said what really is at stake is who will control the
governor's office and whether the Democrats will regain their
domination of Massachusetts politics.
</P>
<P>
   If Cellucci loses to Harshbarger, it's not likely the party will
win other statewide offices or the two congressional seats it is
seriously contesting, Domke said. ``That would mean, the state
would be a one-party oligarchy once again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, Cellucci would be able to drop the ``acting'' from
his title, and claim a huge victory all his own.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since William F. Weld handed over the office to him by
resigning 14 months ago, Cellucci, who first went to Beacon Hill as
a legislator in 1977, has had to carry out his duties as acting
governor under the pressure of Malone's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Malone, who declared his candidacy in early July 1997,
made it clear he would attack Cellucci from the right, particularly
on fiscal issues. His most persistent theme was that the acting
governor failed to keep state spending increases at the rate of
inflation, a level the treasurer advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Although he held almost of the same liberal positions as
Cellucci on such social issues as abortion, gun control,
affirmative action, and raising the minimum wage, Malone laid claim
to being the only true conservative and repeatedly referred to
Cellucci as a ``liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone also accused Cellucci of being a Beacon Hill insider,
saying he was too close to the Democrats who run the Legislature
and had hired too many Democrats to run his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that Malone's theme was not resonating with
Republican activists came at last April's GOP state convention in
Worcester, where Cellucci trounced the state treasurer by an almost
three-to-one ratio to win the party's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-primary Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll of likely GOP voters
showed Malone was unable to make the liberal label stick to
Cellucci, who has strong ties to the Republican Party grassroots
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Domke said Malone failed to make a compelling case for
Republicans to reject Cellucci, who he said proved to GOP voters
that he is competent and capable as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone's campaign also failed to adequately convey his own
accomplishments and likability and his ads calling Cellucci a
liberal seemed like name-calling _ harsh, unfair and
unconvincing,'' Domke said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Harshbarger emerged as the likely
front-runner after US Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, bruised
by family scandals and his first wife's accusation he verbally
bullied her for an annulment, unexpectedly withdrew from the
governor's race in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, who was campaigning for state treasurer, decided
several weeks later to challenge Harshbarger, hoping Democrats
alienated by the attorney general's style and his refusal to step
aside for Kennedy, would rally to her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger proved too resilient, never making a major
misstep she could exploit and continuing to build a campaign
organization and to far outmatch her in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were few differences between Harshbarger,
McGovern and Donnelly to spark much voter interest in the race,
something McGovern badly needed if she hoped to gain traction for
her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, who entered the race in January, put himself at a
serious disadvantage by his late start, one from which he never
recovered. He had not been politically active in Massachusetts
since the early 1990's and that was only in his South Shore-based
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   The former congressman, who had $712,000 in his federal campaign
account at the beginning of the year, was only able transfer a
portion of those funds to his state campaign. He was unable to
raise any serious amounts of campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agreed Donnelly's candidacy all but ended in July
when he decided against a scheme by which he would personally take
possession of the $300,000 or more balance and donate it to his
state account. As veteran congressman, Donnelly is able to use his
campaign funds for personal use after paying income tax.

PROPONENT OF AN EVER-POTENT LODESTONE: BAD TASTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE, Md. _ Two of the cast members are small, with
elaborate beards, pirate-style bandanas, enough leather to
upholster a couch. One has a nose ring and a silver tooth up front.
One wears jeans beneath leather pants strategically cut out to show
off both his denimed bottom and his front.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out they are not what they seem but drag kings, or female
performers who cross-dress as men: Sharon Niesp, who's appeared in
several of John Waters' films, and Maureen Fischer, better known as
Mo B. (for Bodacious) Dick. Well, you don't expect Miss Manners on
a John Waters set.
</P>
<P>
   This film is ``Pecker,'' filmed in Waters's hometown of
Baltimore, where he has made all 13 of his movies, most famously
``Pink Flamingos,'' his 1972 cult classic. ``It's about a
photographer called `Pecker,''' the publicity agent explained one
day on the set in December. ``No,'' he went on, though no one had
objected, ``it's not what you think. He used to peck at his food as
a child.'' Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker,'' which opens on Friday, is a comedy about a young
fellow (Edward Furlong) who's a short-order cook in a sub shop and
takes pictures all the time, of rats caught in flagrante delicto
(Waters often employs rats for his films), a woman shaving her
thighs on a bus, his own sweetly dysfunctional working-class
family, that sort of thing. When he is ``discovered'' by a chic
Manhattan art dealer (Lili Taylor) and becomes the sensation of the
New York art world, Pecker's everyday Baltimore life, including his
relationship with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) who runs _ well,
rules _ the local laundromat, is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has earned respect by being outrageous, though his more
recent films are no longer (italics)quite(end italics) so tasteless
_ not, shall we say, so regressed. (When I mentioned to him that
someone had recently raved to me about his 1988 film ``Hairspray,''
he smiled a wry smile and said, ``I accidentally made a family
movie.'')
</P>
<P>
   His last two films, ``Cry Baby'' and ``Serial Mom,'' were
official selections at the Cannes Film Festival. His films,
considered hip, do well abroad. ``Bad taste,'' he says, ``is
universal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set, in a Baltimore bar, Furlong gives his real-life
girlfriend Jackie _ she tutors the 8-year-old Lauren Hulsey, who
plays Pecker's little sister _ a swift smack on the lips before
heading into the movie's thrift shop, the Bargain Hut. One of the
drag kings is casing out the clothes on a rack, especially a man's
V-neck sweater, but falls back into character as Waters calls out
``Full Pecker!'' Furlong straightens up and swaggers a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, Baltimore's riposte to propriety, is 52, six foot one
inch tall, downtown-casually dressed, and thin, but not so thin as
his moustache, which looks as if it was drawn by an eyebrow pencil.
On a two-room set, he watches the actors in the next room on a
black-and-white television monitor, falling into director's body
English, waving his hand deprecatingly at the action when he
doesn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   (``Keep it manly,'' he shouts at one of the drag kings in the
other room; she shakes her head ``no'' at him on the monitor.) Even
when he's been waving he reassures the cast: after parceling out
lots of instructions, he says, ``Otherwise, everything was grand!''
</P>
<P>
   During his early films, when characters were competing to be
vile, he'd be yelling, ``Louder! Louder! Meaner!,'' but even then
he'd be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The people on this set are happier with their director than
Harriet was with Ozzie. They say he's gentle, kind, compassionate,
exacting but easy, laid back, fun, funny, a riot. To protect the
little girl in the cast, he has people say ``beep'' when the script
calls for foul language.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he gets to angry is: ``You don't have gum in that
scene, do you? It drives me crazy with that gum. Oh, it's
carrots?'' Then, glumly, ``I have gum paranoia now.'' The carrots
are for little sis, a rabid sugar addict who has been converted to
a vegetable addict. Waters is directing her on how to ``snort a
radish.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever seen him tense. Asked about this, he says: ``In
high school I always had Ns. `Needs improvement in self-control.' I
had straight Ns.''' At New York University, he was thrown out on
suspicion of smoking marijuana (when he realized the campus police
had been stationed by his room, he called The Daily News to tip
them off) but has since been asked back to lecture twice, which he
says makes his parents quite happy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Waters is setting up a crowd scene. ``Just get them there,
Bobby,'' he tells Robert Stevens, his director of cinematography.
``Geography, not filmmaking.'' To the actors, he says in a mocking
tone, ``If one person looks at the camera, I promise you, I'll take
billboards and write your name on them.'' Then as an aside,
``That's my Miranda warning.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It was natural for Waters to make a film about a photographer:
he is one himself and has had shows here and abroad. In July, Gavin
Brown's Enterprise, a gallery in the West Village, showed Waters'
pictures of the floors marked with colored tapes to indicate where
the actors should stand in ``Pecker.''
</P>
<P>
   His first photographs were of movie moments on the television
screen; he recombined them into short sequences of images he
thought were truly memorable, which sometimes meant the credits, or
the countdown before them. (``Director's Cut,'' a book of these
pictures, was published last year.)
</P>
<P>
   To make Pecker's photographs, he hired Chuck Shacochis, who
works at the Baltimore shop where Waters has his own photographs
developed. He showed Shacochis pictures by Matt Mathurin, Weegee
and Diane Arbus to give him an idea what he was looking for, then
told him to do his own thing. To make the pictures suitably beat
up, Shacochis printed them through an old piece of scratched-up
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Waters uses a lot of local talent. ``You go all around the
country,'' he says, ``and then it's right at home, like the Wizard
of Oz.'' He says the extras are better in Baltimore, which he long
ago dubbed the ``Hairdo Capital of the World.'' ``These people look
like real people. In Hollywood, they all look like actors who can't
get jobs. They all look ludicrously handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   A house was found that was just right for Pecker's family, but
the owner's son was on home detention and wearing an electronic
bracelet, and they had to get the parole board's permission to move
everybody. Then they had trouble getting a hotel to take him.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the bar, the crew remodeled an abandoned house as
the Pelt Room, a lesbian strip club. When the sign went up saying
``We Take It All Off!,'' people tried to pay to get in and children
were peeking through the window. In Maryland, it's illegal to have
both liquor and pubic hair (at least on view) in the same
establishment, so in the film the club gets closed down.
</P>
<P>
   This is a low-budget film, about $6.5 million. But Waters has
more leeway than he used to have. Van Smith, his costume designer,
says that in some of the early pictures, Divine's costumes were
glued or stapled together; for ``Pecker,'' Todd Oldham and Comme
des Garcons helped dress the New York art-world denizens.
</P>
<P>
   Waters once modeled for Comme des Garcons in Paris; he felt, he
says, ``like Don Knotts meets `Mahogany''' (a reference to the
designer played by Diana Ross in a movie you may have forgotten).
Still, a lot of the actors wear their own things. Patricia Hearst,
who plays a New York art collector, has been in three of his movies
and arrived on the set with two outfits by Claude Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, prized by his public _ he says that when ``Pink
Flamingos'' was released on video in 1997 and he made an appearance
in New York, the line was three blocks long, and everyone in it was
22 years old _ is prized by actors as well. Lili Taylor says, for
example, she signed on to ``Pecker'' even before reading the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong did read it, and says it's really rare to find
one that makes him laugh. And besides, he'd never worked on a film
that wasn't dark. (He's appeared in ``The Grass Harp,'' ``Little
Odessa'' and ``American Heart.'') Christina Ricci's mother was such
a John Waters fan herself that she showed her daughter some of his
movies and had her read his articles at the age of 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has already written the script for his next film, ``Cecil
B. DeMented,'' about teen-age Hollywood terrorists attacking the
film industry. Waters always writes his own scripts because, he
says, ``I don't want to do anything from someone else's
obsessions.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood has endured assaults on many fronts, John Waters
can be counted on to add insult _ and laughter _ to injury.

DE LA HOYA TAKES A RISK, TAKING TOUGHER FIGHTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya, promoted as the Golden Boy, has
felt for several years as if he has had to carry the tattered sport
of boxing on his shoulders. Now, at the age of 25, another
realization has struck him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just a fighter,'' De La Hoya said Tuesday. ``I'm an
enterprise. I support a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's overwhelming. But I can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council welterweight
champion, earned $38 million from five fights and his endorsements,
making him the second-highest-paid athlete in the United States,
behind Michael Jordan. For his rematch against Julio Cesar Chavez
(101-2-2) at the Thomas and Mack Center here on Friday night, De La
Hoya (28-0) will earn $12 million, plus a percentage of the
pay-per-view sales that could bring him up to $3 million more.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Bob Arum said the 18,000-seat arena is sold out,
and the pay television audience could approach the 850,000 viewers
for the De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker welterweight championship bout
in April 1997. The pay-per-view gross for that bout was $36
million, making it the biggest non-heavyweight boxing show in
pay-per-view history.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why they call De La Hoya the Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   However, De La Hoya's image began to tarnish over the last year
when he was criticized, mainly by the news media, for not fighting
tougher opponents in the welterweight division. And recently his
luster was dulled somewhat when an article in The Los Angeles Times
portrayed him as a hard-drinking skirt chaser who dropped loads of
money at casino gaming tables between bouts.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has met his boxing critics head on by ordering Arum
to make a fight with Ike Quartey, who was recently stripped of his
World Boxing Association welterweight championship for not
defending it in a timely fashion. That fight is scheduled to take
place Nov. 21. It will be De La Hoya's toughest bout since he
defeated Whitaker for the WBC title in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a step up from his recent opponents. De La Hoya's
defense against Patrick Charpentier on June 13 was an
embarrassment. Charpentier, the WBC's No. 1 contender and thus a
mandatory opponent for De La Hoya, was outclassed, landing just 5
of 111 punches and hitting the canvas three times before the fight
was stopped in the third round. And De La Hoya's rematch with
Chavez, who cuts easily and at age 36 is definitely on the downside
of his once great career, is a big mismatch. De La Hoya has been
made an 8-to-1 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said no one in his camp, including his father, Joel,
and Arum, wanted him to fight Chavez again. The last fight, in June
1996, was stopped in the fourth round after De La Hoya cut Chavez
over the left eye. De La Hoya didn't feel that Chavez, who said the
outcome would have been different were it not for the cut, had
given him the proper respect. ``It's personal,'' he said. ``If it
was up to me, I wouldn't even put it in the record books. It's him
and me in the ring, and I'm fighting to get the respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, for which Chavez will earn $6 million, it will
be all business. De La Hoya said he realized that in order to be
considered a great champion he had to fight, and beat, the best
fighters. It took a while to convince those around him that he was
ready to step up to a higher class of opponents, he said.
Apparently, only the Golden Boy was willing to risk the golden
goose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the one who has been pushing it,'' said Mike Hernandez,
a Los Angeles auto dealer who is De La Hoya's longtime adviser.
``Yes, he's ready to take that step. He's more experienced now. He
showed us a lot in his fight against Wilfredo Rivera. He showed a
lot of self-control.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are times outside the ring when that
self-control is not as evident. The article in The Los Angeles
Times detailed an incident in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, this past
spring when a drunken De La Hoya behaved badly at a bar with
several American college students who were there on spring break.
The article also reported on De La Hoya's admitted problem with
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The article angered Hernandez and De La Hoya's father, who
called it nonsense. Initially De La Hoya said he was angry as well.
But he could not deny the accuracy of the article and the accounts
of his behavior. After his anger subsided, De La Hoya said he had
thought about it and taken a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article woke me up and made me realize that I'm human,''
he said. ``I'm 25 years old and I have a lot of money. Anybody else
in my situation would just blow up. It was not learning a lesson.
It was a reality check: `Hey, I'm doing something wrong. Stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said that he had established a limit of $25,000 a night on
the amount De La Hoya could gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, De La Hoya has begun to change from a cardboard
cutout to a more three-dimensional character. Still, he is guarded
about his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to fight, stay focused and be a role model,'' De La
Hoya said.

SCHUMER GAINS EASY WIN OVER FERRARO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
seemed headed toward a landslide defeat in her attempt at a
political comeback, with early returns Tuesday night showing her
badly trailing Representative Charles Schumer in the Democratic
primary for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   News services declared Schumer the winner just seconds after the
polls closed at 9 p.m. Exit polls during the day showed Schumer
leading by a 3-1 margin in New York City, where three-quarters of
state Democratic primary ballots are usually cast.
</P>
<P>
   Reports also signaled Betsy McCaughey Ross _ the Republican
lieutenant-governor turned Democratic rebel _ would lose her race
to be the party's nominee for governor. New York City Councilman
Peter Vallone seemed to be the victor.
</P>
<P>
   If the early returns are borne out, the race could mark the end
of Ferraro's electoral career. She lost the same race six years
ago, placing second in a bitter four-way race that hinged on shady
allegations of her husband's business connections. Those
accusations were not re-aired this time around. In fact, the race
was most noted for its tameness.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was seen as a sure winner when she entered the Senate
race a year ago. Over the months, though, her name recognition was
nullified by what many observers deemed a lackluster campaign. She
never offered a rationale for her candidacy, except that she had
the best chance of beating the Republican incumbent, Senator
Alfonse D'Amato. It wasn't enough to rally supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also raised far more money, aired more TV commercials,
had the backing of party and labor organizations that could get
voters to the polls, and campaigned with zest. He also ran on a
strong record of 18 years as a congressman from Brooklyn and
sponsor of numerous popular laws, most notably the Brady Bill on
gun control and a bill to put 100,000 policemen on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro ran mainly on her history as the first woman to be
nominated vice president, which happened 14 years ago and on a
ticket _ Walter Mondale's against Ronald Reagan's reelection _ that
was one of the century's great losers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross may also beat a hasty retreat from the political
arena. A former think-tank scholar, she was tapped as George
Pataki's running mate in the governor's race four years ago _ then
grew disillusioned when Pataki, after winning, ignored her advice
on policy.
</P>
<P>
   After switching parties, she built her campaign on the financial
largesse of her husband, wealthy financier Wilbur Ross, but then,
just a few weeks ago, he withdrew the $2.5 million he had lent her
campaign, leaving her with virtually nothing. Her erratic
personality also sent most of her staff fleeing. With no money,
scattered staff, and an unheard message, her once-leading status in
the polls was sent reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, meanwhile, gained support in New York City and its
surrounding suburbs by campaigning, however unsuccessfully, for a
referendum on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's unpopular proposal to move
the Yankees to a new stadium on Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was seen as historically low, which also gave the edge
to the candidates with the best organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Republicans settled a bitter Senate primary in
Washington state, nominating an opponent for Democratic Senator
Patty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats nominated a candidate for governor in Minnesota,
hoping to end Republican control in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Democratic Governor Parris Glendening and
Republican Ellen Sauerbrey, who almost beat him four years ago, won
their nominations easily.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Democrats decided not to make a dead woman their Senate
nominee. Jacquelyn Ledgerwood, who died July 15, lost to air
conditioning repairman Don E. Carroll on a Democratic runoff
ballot. Carroll will face Senator Don Nickles, considered a shoo-in

VOTER POLLS GIVE SCHUMER BIG LEAD OVER FERRARO IN SENATE RACE

   NEW YORK _ Charles Schumer, a U.S. representative who had never
run for office outside his Park Slope, Brooklyn, neighborhood,
appeared headed Tuesday night toward winning the Democratic
nomination in New York to challenge Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
overwhelming Geraldine Ferraro in her second attempt to return to
public office, according to interviews with voters leaving the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, reaping the fruits of a decade of fund-raising and a
campaign marked by rigorous discipline and ceaseless television
advertising, easily defeated both Ferraro and the third major
candidate, Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of Schumer's victory, as found in surveys of voters
leaving the polls, indicated strength that crossed geographic, sex
and ethnic lines, despite a low turnout. The results suggested he
had gone some distance in erasing doubts many Democrats had about
his viability to defeat D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The results also appeared to signal an end to one of the most
notable political careers of the last 20 years. Ferraro, who ran
for vice president in 1984, said she decided to run again this time
because she felt she had been unfairly deprived of the 1992
nomination for Senate, by just 11,000 votes, because of unfounded
attacks on her ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was spared such treatment this time, yet surveys
suggested that she was losing by a far larger margin this time than
in 1992. Schumer's victory came as Democrats also chose Peter
Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, to challenge Gov.
George Pataki, in a primary that turned out to be less competitive
than had been expected, according to interviews with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone easily defeated three candidates, including Lt. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross, the former Republican running in a Democratic
primary for the first time. McCaughey Ross' name will appear on the
Liberal Party line in November.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in seven other states and the District of Columbia also
went to the polls Tuesday. In the capital, voters chose Anthony
Williams, who moved to Washington less than three years ago, as the
Democratic nominee for mayor in an election likely to determine who
will succeed Marion Barry. In Massachusetts, Acting Gov. Paul
Cellucci won the Republican primary for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was nominating candidates for governor, while
Maryland, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Washington
State were selecting nominees in several races.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Senate vote sets the stage for what is almost
sure to be one of the most ferociously fought races in the country
this fall. Schumer and D'Amato are both known in Washington as
streetwise, ambitious politicians who share talents for raising
funds, getting publicity and assailing their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has spent much of this decade quietly preparing himself
for the statewide stage, and D'Amato, facing what polls have long
suggested would be an extraordinarily difficult bid for a fourth
term, has been in effect running for re-election for almost two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls were closed Tuesday, Schumer's media
consultant, Hank Morris, was in a television editing booth,
producing advertisements directed at D'Amato that will be broadcast
in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Sandra Frankel, a town supervisor from a suburb
of Rochester, was leading in the race to run with Vallone as the
Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. And Eliot Spitzer, a
lawyer who used his family fortune to finance a campaign that was
also heavy on television advertising, was leading in the nomination
for state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The results, as signaled by the survey of voters, were a sharp
setback for women who have been seeking to break into the upper
ranks of New York state government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it seemed that the Democrats might have three
women on the statewide ticket: Ferraro for senator, McCaughey Ross
for governor and Catherine Abate for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that the only women running for statewide offices
will be Ms. Frankel and the Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor, Mary Donohue, a judge Pataki chose to be his running
mate. He is heavily favored, both because he has raised a huge
amount of money, over $15 million since July, and because McCaughey
Ross is likely to split the anti-Pataki vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and McCaughey Ross explicitly presented their
candidacies as appeals for women to gain political stature in New
York, a state that has never elected a woman as senator or
governor. But voter surveys found that most women disregarded those
appeals, voting instead for Schumer and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The contest to challenge D'Amato was remarkable for its lack of
open conflict, as the candidates avoided the kind of exchanges that
characterized the 1992 primary.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the decorous race will become clear Wednesday
morning, when all three Democratic Senate candidates are scheduled
to appear at a breakfast together with the state party chairwoman,
Judith Hope. In 1992, by contrast, Ferraro did not endorse the
Democratic candidate, Robert Abrams, until the last week of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's strong performance was a clear tribute to the
influence of money on American politics today. Schumer, who is a
member of the House Banking Committee, raised $13 million for the
race, more than five times as much as either Ferraro or Green. The
benefits of Schumer's fund-raising could be seen on television
stations across the state: an advertising campaign that began at
the start of the year and built up in the final two weeks of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The television advertisements proved to be particularly
significant this year because of the chronic lack of attention paid
to the race by the New York media. The candidates often found
themselves giving major speeches or press conferences with only a
single television camera in sight. Ferraro characterized the
contest Tuesday as ``a fight between money power and people
power.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking break with the established political
order, Anthony Williams, a government technocrat who moved to
Washington less than three years ago to help lift the city out of
its fiscal mess, won the Democratic nomination for mayor Tuesday
over three opponents who are longtime City Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' victory gave him the inside track to election as mayor
in November because of the Democrats' 10-to-1 enrollment advantage
over Republicans and because he is a black candidate in a
predominantly black city. If elected, he will succeed Mayor Marion
Barry, the man who dominated politics in this city for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican candidate, Carol Schwartz, who is white, said
Tuesday that she should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be overwhelmed by the numbers, but there is an
overwhelming response to me in the community,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the early tally in the Democratic primary Tuesday night,
Williams had 54 percent of the votes. He easily outdistanced the
three City Council members who opposed him: Kevin Chavous, who had
31 percent; Jack Evans, with 10 percent, and Harold Brazil, with 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because an outsider was nominated by the Democrats, the primary
could be read as a repudiation of the current city government,
which has been largely subordinated by a control board imposed by
Congress in response to a combination of out-of-control spending
and failure to collect all taxes owed that led to hundreds of
millions of dollars in deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Barry did not seek re-election after having won four of the
first five elections under the limited home rule that the city had
been given by Congress. The only time he did not win was after he
was sentenced to a six-month jail term for possession of cocaine
that interrupted his third term.
</P>
<P>
   His administration was marked by turmoil. Until recent
improvements imposed by the control board started to take root,
many residents held Barry and the City Council responsible for the
failing schools, budget deficits and a decline in city services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Williams' victory will mean that the District of Columbia
will have a real new beginning in terms of leadership,'' said Prof.
Charles Harris, a political scientist at Howard University who
specializes in the relationship between Congress and the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``His success will depend on how well he can build a consensus
among his constituencies and win support from Congress,'' Harris
said, adding what is often left unsaid by political candidates,
``There is a racial divide in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, his one-term replacement, Sharon Pratt Kelly, and
Williams are black, and the 1990 census said the black population
was 66 percent, with recent estimates putting it at closer to 60
percent, still the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, then, is in two minorities: whites and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, who was unopposed in her party's
primary, said in an interview Tuesday: ``I am not a partisan
person. I am not a racial person. They forgive me those perceived
handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, 54, a former special education teacher and a
resident of Washington for the past 32 years, warned against
writing her off. She received 33 percent of the vote in her first
campaign for mayor against Barry in 1986 and increased that to 42
percent against the mayor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to get far more than that this time,'' Ms. Schwartz
said. ``I've won citywide office in this town twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz's reference was to her elections as an at-large
member of the City Council. In both her mayoral races, her vote was
far greater than the 7 percent enrollment of Republicans in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the outsider, could turn Ms. Schwartz's City Council
experience against her, as he did in campaigning against the City
Council members he defeated in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   He has held public office only once, as a member of the Board of
Aldermen in New Haven in the early 1980s, and has spent the rest of
his career in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 46, has been chief financial officer for the
Department of Agriculture, deputy state comptroller of Connecticut,
executive director of the Community Development Agency in St. Louis
and assistant director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Washington in 1995 as chief financial officer and has
taken credit for eliminating the city's budget deficit and bringing
it to a surplus of $185 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in Los Angeles and then set upon his
peripatetic career. He has an undergraduate political science
degree from Yale University, a law degree from Harvard University
and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely mentioning Barry's name, the candidates all harkened
to the need to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   At a candidates' forum last week, one of Tuesday's losers,
Brazil said that, as mayor: ``I will work with Congress. I will
work with the Control Board. I will insist on accountability. I
will make Washington work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said: ``Philadelphia, Cleveland and New York all went
through control boards. They turned things around. What did they do
to accomplish that? They elected a good mayor. Having a new mayor
in the District of Columbia will leap us ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Council member seeking the nomination, Chavous, did
not attend the forum. He said in a campaign statement, ``This
election gives us an opportunity to reform our government and
restore our democratic rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncandidate at the mayoral forum, Wilbert Washington 2d, gave
this summation of the election, ``This is the first time that we
will have an election in the post-Barry era.''
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in Maryland, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts governor's race, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul
Cellucci defeated state Treasurer Joseph Malone by almost 2-to-1
for the Republican Party's nomination. He will face Tuesday's
winner of the Democratic primary, state Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, in a contest that political experts consider a
toss-up.

MCGWIRE EDGES AHEAD WITH NO. 63 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Combines budgeted McGwire, Sosa stories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With a four-homer performance over the weekend, it
appeared that the momentum in the Great Home Run Chase had swung to
Sammy Sosa, who caught Mark McGwire _ for the third time this
season _ at 62.
</P>
<P>
   But then McGwire broke a weeklong drought with No. 63 in the
first game of a doubleheader in St. Louis to nose back in front.
The two sluggers each had another game to play Tuesday night. With
Sosa's Cubs in the thick of a wild-card race and McGwire still the
center of attention for the Cardinals, does either one have an
advantage down the stretch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had an advantage this year because I've had more
opportunities,'' said Sosa before Tuesday night's game against the
Padres. ``Mark was injured and didn't have as many chances to go
out and play. That made me work even harder. No matter what
happens, I've got to get ready every day; I'm not only looking for
home runs, but also to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has answered the challenge all season. Don't forget that he
once trailed McGwire in homers, 24-9, but caught him at 47. In his
first game after tying the record, Sosa struck out four times in a
4-3 loss here Monday night. It was his first 0-for-4 game this
season. And not only did he lose the homer lead, but he had to face
San Diego's 18-game winner, Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule all by itself could make a big difference in the
final results. Starting tonight, both the Cardinals and Cubs have
10 games left. But St. Louis plays seven at home, while the Cubs
have only three in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about playing at home,'' said San Diego's
Tony Gwynn, who knows about late-season pressure, having flirted
with .400 down the stretch. ``There's a source of energy there. You
may recall that when (Sosa) was playing in St. Louis, it looked
like he started to tire or whatever. But when he got home in
Chicago, the crowd just electrified him. Four home runs later,
they're both tied again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa likes to talk about the pressure of the playoff race. To
him, it is a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as big a deal to him as you might think,'' said
Gwynn. ``He's said all along that he wants to win. He wants to get
to the playoff. But everywhere he's going, there are packed houses
and they're not coming to watch him try to get to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to No. 62, McGwire was perceived to have an
intangible advantage, and indeed he got there first. But Sosa can
beat him out for the season title and the record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has been having back spasms, an old problem, though he
said he was feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has the built-in incentive of the wild-race race to keep
him pumped. He is looking forward to getting back to Wrigley Field
for three games with the Reds this weekend, the Cubs' final
homestand. Sunday has been declared Sammy Sosa Day in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have a letdown,'' said Sosa. ``We're all human. We
never know what happens tomorrow. But I'm not going to be
struggling the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good chance,'' said Gwynn. ``There is a thin line
that separates a good hitter from just a guy who is able to put the
bat on the ball. But when it becomes something that people come out
and expect you to do, it's got to be one of the most difficult
things to do. It becomes even more magnified when people come to
the ballpark and that is what they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in San Diego, fans have been talking about this for about
a week. They knew he was coming here for four games and they wanted
to see him get hot. And he did. We had over 50,000 show up for a
Monday night game with school in session. That never happens.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa remains confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I got to No. 62 and I caught Mr. McGwire, my
man,'' said Sosa. ``I can't stop now. I know I have to go out and
compete and do my job. I did what everybody was waiting for me to
do. It's a pretty heavy responsibility to go out and finish strong
and take the team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what happens.''

   WASHINGTON _ In a striking break with the established political
order, Anthony Williams, a government technocrat who moved to
Washington less than three years ago to help lift the city out of
its fiscal mess, won the Democratic nomination for mayor Tuesday
over three opponents who are longtime City Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' victory gave him the inside track to election as mayor
in November because of the Democrats' 10-to-1 enrollment advantage
over Republicans and because he is a black candidate in a
predominantly black city. If elected, he will succeed Mayor Marion
Barry, the man who dominated politics in this city for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican candidate, Carol Schwartz, who is white, said
Tuesday that she should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be overwhelmed by the numbers, but there is an
overwhelming response to me in the community,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the early tally in the Democratic primary Tuesday night,
Williams had 54 percent of the votes. He easily outdistanced the
three City Council members who opposed him: Kevin Chavous, who had
31 percent; Jack Evans, with 10 percent, and Harold Brazil, with 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because an outsider was nominated by the Democrats, the primary
could be read as a repudiation of the current city government,
which has been largely subordinated by a control board imposed by
Congress in response to a combination of out-of-control spending
and failure to collect all taxes owed that led to hundreds of
millions of dollars in deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Barry did not seek re-election after having won four of the
first five elections under the limited home rule that the city had
been given by Congress. The only time he did not win was after he
was sentenced to a six-month jail term for possession of cocaine
that interrupted his third term.
</P>
<P>
   His administration was marked by turmoil. Until recent
improvements imposed by the control board started to take root,
many residents held Barry and the City Council responsible for the
failing schools, budget deficits and a decline in city services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Williams' victory will mean that the District of Columbia
will have a real new beginning in terms of leadership,'' said Prof.
Charles Harris, a political scientist at Howard University who
specializes in the relationship between Congress and the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``His success will depend on how well he can build a consensus
among his constituencies and win support from Congress,'' Harris
said, adding what is often left unsaid by political candidates,
``There is a racial divide in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, his one-term replacement, Sharon Pratt Kelly, and
Williams are black, and the 1990 census said the black population
was 66 percent, with recent estimates putting it at closer to 60
percent, still the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, then, is in two minorities: whites and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, who was unopposed in her party's
primary, said in an interview Tuesday: ``I am not a partisan
person. I am not a racial person. They forgive me those perceived
handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, 54, a former special education teacher and a
resident of Washington for the past 32 years, warned against
writing her off. She received 33 percent of the vote in her first
campaign for mayor against Barry in 1986 and increased that to 42
percent against the mayor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to get far more than that this time,'' Ms. Schwartz
said. ``I've won citywide office in this town twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz's reference was to her elections as an at-large
member of the City Council. In both her mayoral races, her vote was
far greater than the 7 percent enrollment of Republicans in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the outsider, could turn Ms. Schwartz's City Council
experience against her, as he did in campaigning against the City
Council members he defeated in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   He has held public office only once, as a member of the Board of
Aldermen in New Haven in the early 1980s, and has spent the rest of
his career in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 46, has been chief financial officer for the
Department of Agriculture, deputy state comptroller of Connecticut,
executive director of the Community Development Agency in St. Louis
and assistant director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Washington in 1995 as chief financial officer and has
taken credit for eliminating the city's budget deficit and bringing
it to a surplus of $185 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in Los Angeles and then set upon his
peripatetic career. He has an undergraduate political science
degree from Yale University, a law degree from Harvard University
and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely mentioning Barry's name, the candidates all harkened
to the need to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   At a candidates' forum last week, one of Tuesday's losers,
Brazil said that, as mayor: ``I will work with Congress. I will
work with the Control Board. I will insist on accountability. I
will make Washington work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said: ``Philadelphia, Cleveland and New York all went
through control boards. They turned things around. What did they do
to accomplish that? They elected a good mayor. Having a new mayor
in the District of Columbia will leap us ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Council member seeking the nomination, Chavous, did
not attend the forum. He said in a campaign statement, ``This
election gives us an opportunity to reform our government and
restore our democratic rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncandidate at the mayoral forum, Wilbert Washington 2d, gave
this summation of the election, ``This is the first time that we
will have an election in the post-Barry era.''
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in Maryland, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts governor's race, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul
Cellucci defeated state Treasurer Joseph Malone by almost 2-to-1
for the Republican Party's nomination. He will face Tuesday's
winner of the Democratic primary, state Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, in a contest that political experts consider a
toss-up.

HYDE WARNS AGAINST INTIMIDATION TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House committee that will weigh
possible impeachment charges against President Clinton promised
swift action Tuesday against any efforts to use smear tactics to
intimidate committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to rumors that some Clinton supporters may be trying
to gather embarrassing personal information about members of the
House Judiciary Committee, the chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
said the panel would refer any accusations of wrongdoing to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to intimidate members of Congress or interfere with
them in an impeachment proceeding could constitute a federal crime
and be punishable by up to five years in prison, Hyde, warned
committee members in a memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I request that you immediately notify me if you learn of any
activity or information relating to this concern,'' Hyde wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, made up of 21 Republicans and 16
Democrats, is about to consider whether the accusations against the
president arising from his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky are grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel who has been
investigating the Lewinsky matter, filed a report with Congress
asserting that there was ``substantial and credible'' evidence that
Clinton perjured himself, obstructed justice and misused his office
in trying to thwart the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's committee will decide if there is a basis for a full
impeachment inquiry. If the committee decides that there is, and
the full House agrees, hearings would be held and the House would
vote on whether to approve articles of impeachment. A ``yes'' vote
by a simple House majority would bring a Senate trial, where a
two-thirds majority would be required to convict and remove the
president. &QL;

   &UR; Eleanor Mondale &LR; , glamorous CBS entertainment reporter, told
the Washington Post that  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; 's suspicions about her
friendship with  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  are completely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report related how Lewinsky showed up at the Oval
Office one day last December, and  &UR; Betty Currie &LR;  told her she
couldn't see him because he ``already had a guest.'' Lewinsky said
she waited for 40 minutes, but after a Secret Service agent let
slip that the guest was Mondale, Lewinsky ``stormed away.''
</P>
<P>
   A report footnote says Lewinsky thought the two were
``romantically involved.'' Clinton was said to have been ``irate''
that Lewinsky had learned Mondale was visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Mondale, who has been pictured several times jogging with the
president, told the Washington Post that Lewinsky's ``speculation
is baseless, and has absolutely no foundation in fact.'' A
statement she issued through CBS said, ``I was in Washington, D.C.,
to cover the Kennedy Center Honors. I briefly stopped at the White
House to say hello on my way from the airport to interview the
honorees, as our families have been friendly for decades.''
</P>
<P>

   ``Madonna's MTV stage performance, which combined Eastern
mysticism with Western hedonism, did not sit well with sincere
Hindus, Vaishnavas and yoga practitioners around the globe,'' said
the statement. Spokesman  &UR; Tusta Krishnadas &LR;  said that the singer
had ``offended Hindus and Vaishnavas throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's response, issued through her publicist,  &UR; Liz &LR; 
 &UR; Rosenberg &LR; : ``The essence of purity and divinity is nonjudgment.
They should practice what they preach. If they're so pure, why are

WATCHWORD FOR PENNANT RACE IS `TECHNOLOGY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether you take your scores fast or slow, the
scoreboard-watching season is upon us. Players and coaches no
longer attempt to mask their interest. The Red Sox want to know
what the Blue Jays and Rangers are doing. And they're not afraid to
admit they're watching.
</P>
<P>
   Every night is exciting now. The Cubs and Mets are
shoulder-to-shoulder in the National League. Red Sox Nation is
nervous, the depleted Angels are struggling to hold on, and the
Indians are trying to win enough games to keep them away from the
Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and then we've got Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire marching
toward history in a place where no ballplayers have gone. Who'll be
next to set the record?
</P>
<P>
   But scoreboard-watching just isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, I sat in Earl Weaver's office and, at his request,
dialed the press box in Milwaukee's County Stadium (on a rotary
phone, I might add) to see how the Brewers were doing. It was late
September, the Orioles had a commanding lead in the American League
East, and a Milwaukee loss would clinch the division for Baltimore.
My spy in the press box delivered play-by-play and I relayed the
information to Earl until the Brewers finally lost, and the race
was officially over.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's hand-operated left-field scoreboard offers the same
old-timey process. For most of this century, Boston fans have held
their breath, waiting for the man behind the green wall to post a
big fat loss for the Yankees. Fenway grounds crew pranksters have
been known to slide a bogus ``10'' into the Yankee slot, just to
give Red Sox Nation a little heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   But now the sweet science of scoreboard-watching has gone
high-tech. Fans with Internet access can track every pitch of any
game. ESPN seems to deliver scores faster than the speed of light.
Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan carries a hand-held gizmo that
gives him updated scores instantly. For those who need information,
there are no more phone calls to other stadia, no more waiting for
the guy behind the wall to get out of his chair and update the
Yankee score. And the kids who answer the phone in the Globe sports
department are spared the dozens of calls we used to get from
barrooms late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees and Red Sox took the field Tuesday night, the
Blue Jays aleady held a 2-0 lead over the Indians. The prospect of
Boston's wild-card lead shrinking to two games seemed real. A
half-hour later, the Indians led the Blue Jays, 3-2, and Jason
Varitek crashed a three-run homer (his first of two homers) to give
the Sox a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   We also knew that McGwire was not starting the first game of a
doubleheader against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox inflated their lead to 7-0 in the fourth and the
Indians were up, 6-4, on the Jays. Just like that, it felt like the
Sox' lead had gone from two to four games. The Yankees were
trotting out a series of faceless pitchers (New York writers
believe it may have been a conspiracy _ the Yankees laying down to
punish the Blue Jays, who brawled in New York last week) and the
Red Sox' magic number had a chance to drop to 9 with a lucky 13 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was learned that McGwire had hit No. 63, a pinch
homer in the ninth inning of Game 1 in St. Louis. The Yankee
Stadium crowd, like so many others in this feel-good baseball
summer, roared its approval when the news was flashed on the big
board.

   Meanwhile, the Red Sox were leading, 9-0 (maybe Jimy Williams

 &HT;    Bush says ``The process in Washington is a sullied process''
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas -- The son of the man who raised the character
thing in a 1992 presidential race against Bill Clinton said Tuesday
he finds nothing redeeming about the very public airing of
Clinton's very personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very depressing time for me,'' Gov. George W.
Bush said. ``The process in Washington is a sullied process, and I
take no joy in any of this going on. It's sullied. It's not good
for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aligned himself squarely with the party line, siding with
Republicans urging cautious expediency in sorting out the Clinton
scandal. No calls for resignation, no high-volume moral
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the honorable outcome is for everybody to take a deep
breath and allow the process to work,'' Bush told the Austin
American-Statesman. ``It is a very serious business when the
impeachment proceedings are now taking place in the United States
House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bob Dole, who was in San Antonio Tuesday for a speech
at Trinity University, also cautioned against a rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding fathers didn't have in mind that you remove
somebody very easily,'' Dole said. ``It's time for everybody to let
the House do what it has to do under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who raised the character issue against Clinton in 1996,
said the scandal has not made him bitter about his defeat. ``The
election is over and it's history,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, an early-line top contender for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000, said Clinton's woes put a new focus on the
downside of seeking his dad's old job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a troubling period,'' he said. ``I think running for
president is a commitment to the bubble (of public scrutiny) and
I've got to make up my mind at the right time if that's what I want
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, who has seen _ up close and personal _ how the system
can spit out a once-popular president, likened a White House race
to loading the kids into the car for a long drive on an unknown
route to an uncertain destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this something I want to put my family through?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, a presidential run would mean high-pressure scrutiny
of a baby-boomer's past not up to the high moral standards he now
pushes.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report was
scorching the Internet, television cameras captured the moment in
Richardson as yet another reporter asked Bush if there was anything
in his 52 years that could call his character into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since I've been the governor of the great state of
Texas,'' said Bush, who, without citing chapter and verse, has said
``when I was young and irresponsible I was young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who preaches pre-marital abstinence and personal
responsibility, said he has learned from his mistakes of his
younger days. He acknowledges that he pushes a do-as-I-say, rather
than a do-what-I did, message on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The governor insists re-election is his only political goal.
Polls show him running way ahead. A Texas Poll completed last month
gave Bush a 47-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Garry Mauro. Bush backers would like him to run up big
numbers that sweep other GOP candidates into office and show
strength across demographic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush continues his push for Hispanic votes with stops in
San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Harlingen and El Paso, accompanied by
Tejano music star Emiliano Navaira.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush said he has not read the entire Starr report,
but is up to speed enough to take sides in the Clinton vs.
Independent Counsel Ken Starr skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more troubled by the president's behavior,'' he said when
asked if Starr had overstepped his bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is more troubled by Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky or the presidential lies about it, Bush paused and
responded with, ``All of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, a longtime Clinton friend, says Starr is the bad actor in
the national soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said repeatedly I started out embarrassed for the
president, for Hillary,'' Mauro said Monday. ``Then I got mad at
him. Now after reading the Starr report I'm still embarrassed, but
I'm mad at Starr. That was an outrageous format and, as a lawyer, I
read the so-called high crimes and treason, and there is no
evidence to back that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is counting on Clinton to help him raise about $1 million
at Sept. 27 fundraisers in San Antonio and Houston. Dole, who spoke
to reporters Tuesday before his speech, reiterated his opposition
to the law that created the independent counsel. But he didn't
criticize Starr. He said he hasn't read all of the Starr report,
but he suggested that its graphic detail was necessary to prove
that Clinton lied under oath about having a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Dole warned that the sex scandal will harm his credibility as a
world leader but he wouldn't say if Clinton should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a judgment he has to make,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a similar tack. ``That's up to him,'' Bush said when
asked if Clinton should resign. ``He is going to have to ask how
effective he is as the president of the United States. I'm
certainly not going to be out here on the sidelines chirping away,
giving him advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can figure out whether he is capable of being the president
of the United States much better than I can. I am counseling people
to allow the process to work.''

FERRARO SEEKS LEVERAGE 
FROM SOCCER TO ROCKER 
UNLIKELY THESPIAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geraldine Ferraro had problems with the most basic of
primary-day rituals Tuesday. Arriving at Public School 101 in
Forest Hills, Queens, she signed the register and stepped into the
voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of photographers gathered in a semicircle, waiting for
her to emerge and do whatever a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for governor does after voting: give a thumbs up, smile,
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers heard the pull of the lever once, twice, three
times. Then they heard Ms. Ferraro's voice say, ``It doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   She stepped out. Election personnel reset the machine. She
stepped back in, voted and left, trailed by the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Dual Careers
</P>
<P>
   Alexi Lalas, who is already famous in soccer, is hoping to make
it big as a rocker.
</P>
<P>
   He is already about the closest thing there is to an American
soccer star. A two-time member of the U.S. Olympic and World Cup
teams, Lalas was also the first American player to compete in
Italy's Serie A, which aficionados consider the best professional
soccer league in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas' fame is derived not only from his defensive play for the
New York/New Jersey MetroStars, but also from his flaming red hair
and bushy goatee, which gave him a kind of brand-label recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Will looks help him draw rock fans? After the soccer season,
Lalas plans to hit the road on a concert tour promoting his first
commercial rock-and-roll album, ``Ginger,'' released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes have tried to cross over into music, but only a
few have succeeded, most notably Shaquille O'Neal of Los Angeles
Lakers. But Lalas, 28, said that music is not a passing thing for
him. He has been writing songs and playing guitar since he was a
teen-ager, and released two CDs on small labels, one in Italy and
the other here.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime soccer fans seem to like his sound. The first
person in line Tuesday was Tara Legates of Glen Ridge, N.J., who
took a day off from work and rode two trains in her quest for
Lalas' autograph at the Official All-Star Cafe in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just great,'' she said eagerly as Lalas arrived. ``Plus
he's a total babe on top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, Scrooge?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Roger Daltrey, the rock musician who wants to
make the transition to the stage. Daltrey, the lead singer of the
Who, will play Ebenezer Scrooge in ``A Christmas Carol'' at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Is this casting against type? Perhaps. ``He seems about as
un-Scroogelike as possible,'' said Tim Hawkins, the producer of ``A
Christmas Carol,'' who approached Daltrey about the role a couple
of years ago. ``Roger is really great fun. He's a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Daltrey is showing every sign of being a spirited
performer. One Garden executive said that when Daltrey was
introduced at a promotional event at the Garden on Monday, he
pulled the microphone from its holder on the podium and started
swinging it.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Daltrey went to lunch. Then he wanted to go to his
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had a car for him,''the Garden executive said. ``He
said, `There was so much traffic getting here, let's take the
subway.' He said, `We're going uptown to the West Side.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `All right, I'll put you on the 1 and 9.' I slid my
card through twice so they didn't have to deal with the whole card
issue and said take the 1 and 9 local and get off at 57th
Street.'''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then said, ``I hope they figured out that the stop
after 50th Street was 59th.''

TOUGHER STANDARDS FOR KIDS' SLEEPWARE SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the vehement opposition of the cotton
industry, a coalition of consumer and fire-prevention organizations
is seeking to restore what they say are tougher flammability
standards for children's sleepware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially a fight about the profits of the cotton
industry verses our children's safety,'' Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
D-Conn., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLauro has attached an amendment to a spending bill for the
Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, preventing the enforcement of new federal standards
governing the fire-resistance quality of pajamas, bathrobes and
other sleeping garments for children over the age of nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLauro and consumer and fire-prevention advocates are
seeking to overturn an April 1996 vote by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission that allowed polyester and snug-fitting cotton
garments to legally be sold as sleepwear. Under federal
regulations, only clothing that is fire-resistant can be sold as
sleepwear.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of fire-resistant sleepwear has been a highly
contentious and highly emotional one. Research by the commission
found that many parents prefer cotton garments for their children
because they are more comfortable than polyester clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But cotton clothing is much more dangerous than polyester since
it is much more combustible. Between 200 and 300 children are
seriously burned each year when cotton garments, primarily
T-shirts, catch fire. In contrast, polyester is self-extinguishing,
though it can melt and produce burns when heated by an open flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great demand by consumers to buy untreated cotton
for their kids,'' said Ronald Medford, the commission's assistant
executive director for hazard identification and education.
</P>
<P>
   In changing the regulation, the commissioner said they wanted to
give consumers another alternative _ snug-fitting garments that
tend to be fire- resistant _ for consumers who wanted to buy cotton
sleepwear for their children. The change was supported by the
cotton industry who saw it as a way to help maintain market share
in the face of the onslaught of synthetic fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of misinformation on the part of people
who think this should be changed back,'' said Phillip Wakelyn,
senior scientist for the National Cotton Council.
</P>
<P>
   But in voting for a change in the regulations, the commissioners
also requested that the cotton industry mount a public education
campaign to convince parents not to use 100 per cent cotton
clothing such as T-shirts as sleep wear. To date, commissioners and
staff say they have been disappointed with the industry's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLauro and consumer advocates say they there was no valid
reason to change the federal standards on sleepwear. In 1970, two
years before the flamability standards were adopted, 60 children
died annually from garments that caught on fire. By 1991, that
figure had dropped to six children a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These standards have been in place for 25 years and they were
working,'' she said.

 McGWIRE HITS 63rd HOMER IN 8-6 LOSS TO PIRATES  
(th) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In a sleeveless blue T-shirt, his prodigious arms
folded casually, Mark McGwire said Tuesday that he was only
beginning to understand what the pursuit of the single-season home
run record by him and Sammy Sosa had meant to the country _ and,
maybe, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said, standing in the Cardinals' clubhouse
at Busch Stadium. ``I've seen the editorials and the front-page
stories about what this means to people. Just today I got a letter
from the prime minister of Japan, and from Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm slowly realizing the impact. And I don't think I'll
totally realize it until like a month after the season, when it can
all sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's doubleheader against the Pittsburgh
Pirates, McGwire had not hit a home run in six games, since he hit
No. 62 on Sept. 8 to break the record held by Roger Maris for the
last 37 years. Sosa, who was at 58 homers on that day, has hit four
since and tied McGwire for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   The homer deadlock, however, changed abruptly Tuesday night.
McGwire, who had been rested in the first game of a doubleheader,
was called into action by Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa to
pinch-hit for Delino DeShields in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cardinals trailing, 8-5, with one out and no one on,
McGwire swung at a 1-0 pitch from left-hander Jason Christensen and
sent one of his classic, arching blows into the left-center-field
stands for his 63rd home run of the season. It was also his 450th
career home run.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at his locker, McGwire pointed to a nearby St. Louis
Post-Dispatch headline. ``McGwire Stuck on 62,'' he read aloud, and
laughed. ``Imagine. `Stuck on 62.' I think we've spoiled these
people. Last night I got two singles, and, `Boo, boo!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite that way, though fans are invariably
disappointed when McGwire does not belt a ball over the fence. The
boos come more for the umpire who calls a strike on McGwire, and
for the pitcher who cannot throw in the strike zone to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The two home run hitters have put a new face on competition.
Compared with all the players who taunt and talk trash, McGwire and
Sosa have been as close to brotherly love as possible under the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have looked at athletes these days as greedy or
arrogant and then they see Sammy and I truly respecting one
another, and liking one another,'' McGwire said. ``Two guys from
two different backgrounds and countries appreciating what the other
is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's games _ Sosa's Cubs played in San Diego _
McGwire had only three hits, all singles, in his last 18 at-bats.
He had back spasms on Sunday, but he said his back was now
``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest he had gone without a homer this season was, as he
said, ``20-something at-bats.'' It was in early August, and he
recalled telling reporters, ``There's more important things in the
country than worrying about my hitting a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   About that statement, McGwire said: ``I got kind of testy. But
I'm human. It's a six-month season. And if you average 10 homers a
month, you can break the record. And I had been averaging that. But
I also hadn't yet realized just what all this meant to people. That
reaction by me never happened again.''
</P>
<P>
   Players told McGwire to enjoy the experience, and pointed to
Sosa, who was taking pleasure in it. ``But Sammy wasn't like
Griffey and me,'' McGwire said. ``He hadn't gone through all the
questions before.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had 58 homers last season and Ken Griffey Jr. had 56;
Sosa had 36. ``So Griffey and I have been getting it since last
year, `Can we break the record?' '' McGwire said. But on the
weekend of Aug. 7, the Cubs and Sosa were here for a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was before a game and Sammy and I looked at each other,''
McGwire said, ``and I guess we both thought, `All right, all the
cameras are around, let's make them happy.' '' They ran at each
other and embraced.
</P>
<P>
   And then some 10 days later, in a series between the two teams
in Wrigley Field, they did it again. When McGwire broke Maris'
record, it was against the Cubs, and Sosa ran in from his position
in right field to hug McGwire. After Sosa hit his 61st and 62nd
homers last Sunday, McGwire called to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   A woman called the office of La Russa. The woman had heard that
McGwire was going to play in one of the two games, but didn't know
which one. If it's the first, she told La Russa, she would leave
work early.
</P>
<P>
   ``She left her number with me,'' said La Russa, ``and if Mark
was playing the first game, I was supposed to call her.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa had decided to play McGwire in the second game because,
he said, ``All things being equal _ and they are, with
right-handers starting both games _ more people will be at the
second game than the first, and that would just give more people an
opportunity to see Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was asked if he would be disappointed if Sosa finished
ahead of him in homers at the end of the season, thereby
establishing the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all, not one iota,'' he said. ``It's been an
unbelievable year so far. All I can do is control what I can do.
I've done what I've done. However we end up, how can anybody say
anything negative if one is ahead of the other at the finish?''
</P>
<P>
   And if the two are tied for homers at season's end?
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``would be wonderful.'' &QL;

MAN ALLOWED TO ACT AS OWN LAWYER IN DEATH PENALTY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since capital punishment was
reinstated in New York three years ago, a defendant facing the
death penalty will be allowed to represent himself in court, a
Queens judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos said the defendant,
James Allen Gordon, a 26-year-old convicted drug dealer, had made
his request knowingly, unequivocally and in a timely fashion,
satisfying what the judge said were the three criteria under the
law for a defendant to represent himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are an intelligent person, an articulate person,'' Demakos
told Gordon, a tall, lean man who was wearing gold-rimmed glasses
and a blue-and-white checkered shirt. ``Your right to represent
yourself is granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who said in court that he had a 10th-grade education, is
accused of killing three women and bludgeoning a fourth with a
hammer in Jamaica, Queens, in July 1996. Jury screening in the
case, the third death penalty trial in the city since capital
punishment was reinstated in 1995, began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's unusual request to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers,
Russell Morea and Chris Renfroe, came five months after he
dismissed lawyers sent by the state Capital Defenders Office,
created by the Legislature and financed by the state to insure that
defendants in capital cases are adequately represented. In his
request Monday, Gordon complained about their defense and about the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who is sitting in this chair,'' Gordon said in
court Monday. ``I'm the one who is facing such an ugly situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a defendant has the right to self-representation
so long as the court finds the person to have made an intelligent
request and to be aware of its ramifications. ``The judge really
has no choice,'' Morea said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of a defendant
in a death penalty trial in Nevada to represent himself. The
defendant, Richard Moran, who pleaded guilty to three murders, was
executed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers experienced in capital cases Tuesday lamented
Gordon's request. Kevin Doyle, a lawyer with the State Capital
Defenders Office, declined to comment on Gordon, whom his office
represented until April, but said it was highly unusual for a
defendant facing the death penalty to represent himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital litigation is extraordinarily complex,'' he said.
``It's a challenge even for an experienced criminal-defense
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the death penalty, the lawyers said, requires
convincing jurors of mitigating circumstances in a defendant's
background _ for example, having been abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a case goes to trial with someone refusing to put on any
evidence about their psychological background, they are more likely
to get the death penalty,'' said Ronald Tabak, who is a lawyer with
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom and the president of New York
Lawyers Against the Death Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Demakos' ruling Tuesday came after he repeatedly asked Gordon
whether he understood the ramifications of his request. ``Voir dire
of individual jurors can be very complex,'' he told Gordon,
referring to the jury selection process. ``You would be at a
tremendous disadvantage. Do you understand that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon replied in a barely audible voice, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 33-count indictment, the Queens district attorney's office
charged that Gordon entered an apartment building in Jamaica,
Queens, early on the morning of July 10, 1996, and terrorized five
women. The authorities said that Gordon first went to the
first-floor apartment of Darlene Johnson, 28, with the intention of
robbing her. Instead, the indictment charged, he raped and
sodomized her and then fatally shot her in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that Gordon then went to a second-floor
apartment and fatally shot two women, Mary Mouzon, 33, and Hadiyah
Holliman, 18, and beat Ms. Holliman's twin sister, Zakkiyah
Holliman, with a hammer. A fourth woman, Latisha Crite, 19, a
visitor, escaped by jumping from a window, the indictment said. At
the time, police said Gordon killed the women while trying to
collect a $50 cocaine debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was arrested in Memphis a month after the murders in
Queens.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ariz.)   (Eds: Please note subslug for TV-SHOWS-ADS)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20)  
 (af)  
 By WARREN BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Fox ran an on-air promotion for a pair of sitcoms,
``Living in Captivity'' and ``Getting Personal.'' To make the point
that the shows were sassy and sexy compared with tamer Friday night
programming on other channels, the commercial depicted a man being
chased as a voice-over announced, ``We ran the censors off, and
boy, does it show!''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the appeal of such a sales pitch to the
much-coveted youth audience, which has long felt a healthy
antipathy toward anyone trying to tone down the latest records,
music videos or sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   But for more mature viewers who've been battered by Jerry
Springer's cat fights, Howard Stern's genitalia gags, ``South
Park's'' scatological cartoon children and ``Dawson Creek's''
libidinous teen-agers, the idea of one more television guardian who
has turned tail and run for cover may not be particularly
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there has been no shortage of public and media outcry
as raunchy programming has begun to pervade television in recent
months, spanning the dial and the daily schedule from Springer in
the morning to scantily clad porn stars on the E! channel in the
afternoon, from ``Ally McBeal'' salivating over a well-endowed nude
male model during prime time to late-night sex-obsessed gabfests on
CBS's ``Howard Stern Radio Show'' and MTV's ``Loveline.'' Even
veteran media watchers are expressing dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to violating traditional canons of taste, it
seems that anything goes on television right now,'' observes Mark
Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York
University. ``In fact, tastelessness is the new orthodoxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, though, amid castigations of reckless hosts
(there's an idea: let's make Jerry Springer feel really guilty) and
calls for stricter ratings accompanied by prayers for the arrival
of the vaunted V-chip, rarely has anyone asked what happened to the
censors.
</P>
<P>
   As Stern and Springer parade all of those naked, only slightly
pixelated strippers before the camera, where are the eagle eyes
who, just a few years ago, fretted about glimpses of David Caruso's
rear end on ``N.Y.P.D. Blue''? Or who, further back, worried about
relatively innocuous wisecracks by Tommy Smothers?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many censors skipped town more than a decade ago, as
the broadcast networks drastically reduced the size of their
internal standards and practices departments. Previously, these
in-house watchdogs held sway at the big three networks and weren't
particularly well loved by anyone, from producers to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Seen as inflexible, schoolmarmish and beholden to advertisers,
television censors often lived up to their image. Adhering to a
strict ``television code'' set down in 1952 by the National
Association of Broadcasters (which forbade not only profanity and
most sexual content but also anything involving fortunetelling or
mind reading), censors seemed particularly onerous to the public
whenever they tried to stifle candid discussion of topical issues
on shows like ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, few tears were shed when the old code was
abandoned and standards departments were cut in half in the 1980s _
partly for budgetary reasons but also in response to a changing
television landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Series like ``All in the Family'' had begun to push the
boundaries of explicit content a decade earlier, but the real
pressure came from the new cable channels, which faced less
government regulation than broadcasters and took the position that
their programming could be more risque because viewers had signed
up for the service and knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   As network standards departments weakened, several producers,
led by Steven Bochco, stepped up the assault on what was left of
censorship rules. Pressure groups aside, most viewers didn't object
much, because the rules were being broken ``by classy,
well-written, intelligent shows like `Hill Street Blues' and `St.
Elsewhere,' '' says Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse
University's Center for the Study of Popular Television. (The
challenge of getting around the censors may have actually pushed
those shows to be more creative and subtle when exploring adult
themes.)
</P>
<P>
   However, says Thompson, once these shows claimed new territory
in terms of what could be shown and said on the networks, ``that
opened everything up for the sleazier shows to move in and take
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to today's landscape and raises the question:
were the censors all bad?
</P>
<P>
   Miller of NYU and others cringe at the thought of returning to
an old-fashioned censorship system that would probably be far too
authoritarian for the 90s. But the search for alternative means of
regulation, like the rating system implemented last year, doesn't
seem to be going great guns, either.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, judging from current programming (almost all of the
aforementioned sexually explicit shows came into being after the
rating system was enacted), the ratings, including TV-MA (mature
audiences), seem to have had a far different effect than intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who wanted ratings to put the brakes on this new
explosion of raunchy television saw just the opposite happen,''
says Thompson. ``Anybody should have seen this coming. If you give
producers the opportunity to use a TV-MA rating, it's an invitation
to make TV-MA programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by affixing an MA rating on ``South Park,'' a channel
like Comedy Central, whose standards and practices department
consists of exactly one person, can feel that it has acted
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used the rating as a tool,'' says Comedy Central's
president, Doug Herzog. ``It warns people that this show is not for
everybody, and certainly not for kids.'' That seems reasonable
enough _ except to parents whose children are clamoring, and
perhaps sneaking off, to watch the show because it is topic A in
the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the rating system provides broadcasters and
cable networks an opportunity to wash their hands of monitoring and
occasionally censoring content, thereby freeing them from any
esthetic responsibility for what they transmit into living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And while some may tend to applaud this as a welcome end to
unwanted censorship, the reality is that only certain kinds of
censorship are going by the wayside. When it comes to muzzling
uncomfortable points of view or avoiding difficult and divisive
topics, censorship is apparently still alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   While gobs of sleazy content have slithered under the gates in
the past year, those hold-over network censors have stirred from
their slumber whenever a show has veered into political hot-potato
territory, as in the cases of ``Ellen'' and ``Nothing Sacred,''
which did battle with ABC over dealing candidly with subjects like
homosexuality, abortion and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Fox scrapped a drama about the sexual
harassment charges against Clarence Thomas, reportedly because of
objections by Fox's owner, Rupert Murdoch, who is friendly with
Justice Thomas. And earlier this year, NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' deleted a portion of the show satirizing the ownership of
networks by large conglomerates (the show's producers insist that
the segment was cut from the finished show for artistic reasons;
others aren't so sure).
</P>
<P>
   Miller of NYU says these instances and others like them indicate
that the more prevalent form of censorship in today's television
landscape comes not from a schoolmarm type armed with a list of
dirty words, but rather from ``a rocking-and-rolling CEO worried
about how his company may be affected by something said on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that the current age of anything-goes
television may not be particularly brave or daring after all. With
few censors to worry about, the only thing that programmers need
fear is skittish advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Miller points out, most advertisers have overcome their
old fears of sex because such programming delivers the young-adult
demographic and tends to stop channel surfers in their tracks. (How
many can cruise past Stern's show without at least taking a peek to
see what he's up to?) In some ways, raunch is the safest kind of
programming right now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there has been an odd reversal. While it once
required courage to defy the censors, now it takes backbone to
uphold any kind of censoring standards. Out there alone on the last
front lines of censorship are local station owners and network
affiliates, who must decide when to redraw the line that has been
all but erased by the networks, cable channels and syndicators.
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix station programmer recently dropped Stern's show
because she thought a segment in which mentally disabled people
engaged in a ``Frankenstein beauty contest'' might be a tad over
the line. Other stations must make similar judgments about the
latest outrage from Springer, but if they reject his high-rated
show, ``they run the risk that the station across the street will
pick it up and then trounce them in the ratings,'' says Andy
Grossman, an editor at the industry publication Multichannel News.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the in-house censors are not apt to return to an
active role any time soon _ and that we probably don't want them
to, considering their proven susceptibility to corporate pressures
and poor judgment _ it seems likely that the task of minding the
gates of good taste will increasingly fall not just to the local
station managers but also to series creators.
</P>
<P>
   With less outside censorship, they are forced into being censors
of their own work. Philip Rosenthal, executive producer of
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' says he imposes his own limitations on
what characters can and can't say ``because it's too easy to just
go for the raunchy line,'' he says. Not that the censors would stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even seen anyone from standards and practices the
whole time I've been working on the show,'' he says. ``That gives
you freedom, but it also makes you pause. Who is going to censor
you if not yourself?''

HELP WANTED: FOURTH SINGER, ABLE TO MAKE A SINGULAR SOUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Cori Ellison is a singer and the dramaturge at the New York City
Opera)  
 (af)  
 By CORI ELLISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anonymous 4 has just released its eighth recording,
and it will not be surprising if this CD, ``A Lammas Ladymass,''
sails to the top of the classical charts as most of the group's
earlier efforts have. But this new album of chant and polyphony for
the Roman Catholic feast of the Assumption, which celebrates the
Virgin Mary's passage into heaven, is itself a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Lammas Ladymass,'' from Harmonia Mundi France, marks the end
of an era for Anonymous 4, the New York-based female vocal quartet
specializing in medieval music.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ruth Cunningham, a member of the group since 1988,
suddenly announced that she was leaving to pursue a career in
healing through sound. With no successor in mind, Anonymous 4 faced
a daunting task: to recruit a new singer and have the ensemble
running like clockwork again by July, when it was to make its debut
at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   For any small ensemble, the departure of a member is a seismic
shift. It can result in a substantial change in sound, as it did
with the Tokyo String Quartet, or even dissolution, as it did with
the Cleveland Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   For an a cappella vocal ensemble, the repercussions are
especially serious. Human voices are far more variable in timbre
and thus harder to blend than other musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since this instrument comes housed in a case
susceptible to such indignities as phlegm, indigestion, fatigue and
age, and is governed by a circuit board vulnerable to vagaries like
moods, hormones and domestic discord, the challenges multiply.
</P>
<P>
   The women of Anonymous 4 knew that their personnel search would
demand more than placing want ads and vetting resumes. They relied
on word of mouth, disseminating the news of their quest through the
early-music grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner than you can say Perotin, they received some 20 demo
tapes. After ruling out applicants with a sound too radically
different from their own, they arranged to hear nine sopranos in
live auditions, several as many as three times.
</P>
<P>
   And on a sultry afternoon in May, the remaining members of
Anonymous 4 _ Susan Hellauer, Marsha Genensky and Johanna Maria
Rose _ convened for an audition at St. Michael's Church on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan, where the group, as ensemble in
residence, has presented an annual concert series since its
founding in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, Ms. Rose was inspired by a workshop in medieval
culture at Holy Cross Monastery in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to
experiment with women's voices in medieval music, an area then
dominated by men. She teamed up with other singers, including Ms.
Hellauer and Ms. Genensky, to form Anonymous 4, taking its name, in
eggheaded jest, from an unsigned medieval treatise describing
musical practice at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris around
1200.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began an intense, slow-cooking process of forging a
singular sound that critics have ecstatically praised, notable
especially for a unison so precise that it sounds positively
supernatural. This uncommon accord is rooted in a spiritual unison,
achieved through hard-won consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice a lot,'' said Ms. Hellauer, a wry, no-nonsense New
Yorker. ``Even back in the days when we were doing four concerts a
year. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehearsed as if we were doing 80,'' Ms. Rose chimed in,
blissfully unaware that she, like her companions, habitually
completes the others' sentences. ``And in rehearsal, we take time
to try everyone's ideas and every possibility. With four very
strong personalities, that takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Genensky, a sprightly, meticulous Californian, picked up the
thread: ``You might call it the obsessive-compulsive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Until signing with a major management firm in 1993, the group
handled its own bookings and publicity. The members still share
administrative tasks. Ms. Hellauer, a formidable musicologist, does
most of the musical research and translates Latin texts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Genensky and Ms. Rose deal with literary research _ the
quartet often incorporates contemporary readings into its musical
programs _ as well as with the group's manager and publicity agent.
Ms. Cunningham was responsible for the printed programs and travel
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   All this micromanagement has apparently paid off, for by now the
singers are anything but anonymous. By 1992, they were able to quit
their day jobs and jettison their pickup gigs. Their first
recording, ``An English Ladymass,'' also for Harmonia Mundi, was
named classical disk of the year by CD Review in 1993, and it clung
tenaciously to Billboard's classical top 10 chart for almost two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The group now boasts a repertory of a dozen programs, developing
a new one each season. It spends four months of the year on the
road, singing some 70 concerts.
</P>
<P>
   On that May afternoon, Anonymous 4 welcomed a hopeful singer for
her second audition, a pure lyric soprano whose spectacular musical
skills have made her familiar on New York's freelance vocal scene.
The audition took the form of a full-fledged rehearsal, with the
candidate tossed into a torrent of chant and polyphony to sink or
swim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hellauer first sat in a pew to listen, while the two other
veterans joined the candidate in the sanctuary, testing different
voicings and configurations. Ms. Hellauer gave pitches on a tiny
Casio keyboard and recorded the results on digital tape. After her
three colleagues tore through a motet, she offered comments ranging
from the purely technical (``The tuning is great, the blend not so
great'') to the poetic (``Make the duplets and triplets more
elastic than metrical, not like lazy Schumann triplets'') or the
outlandish (``Make it more like a Viking funeral'').
</P>
<P>
   To a listener accustomed to Anonymous 4's fabled blend, it was a
shock to discover how disparate the singers' voices really are, and
how closely they mirror their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rose's dusky soprano and Ms. Genensky's silvery one are
counterweights, and Ms. Hellauer's solid alto serves as anchor.
Clearly, their new fourth would have to be someone who was more
than a prodigious musician with a supple voice. She would have to
possess a sound, and a disposition, that could bridge the diversity
around her.
</P>
<P>
   By early June, the Anonymous 4 singers were in decision-making
mode, huddled over lattes at a favorite haunt on the Upper West
Side. ``We've been agonizing over this,'' said the quietly
smoldering Ms. Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've analyzed it to death,'' Ms. Genensky said in another of
those rapidly circulating conversations. ``Now we have to go with
our gut feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   MS. ROSE: It boils down to which color we want to go toward. We
had goose-bump moments with each candidate, but in different
pieces. We could choose any one of them. Each person would bring in
her own color, and we found ourselves adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   MS. HELLAUER: The bottom line is, what did it feel like to sing
with that person?
</P>
<P>
   MS. GENENSKY: And what will it feel like to be stuck in an
airport layover with her?
</P>
<P>
   MS. ROSE: What will it feel like after the fifth hour in the
rental car?
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, back at St. Michael's, the women of Anonymous
4 giddily introduced the newest member, Jacqueline Horner. Ms.
Horner, a petite, saucer-eyed native of Belfast, Northern Ireland,
pounded London cobblestones as a freelancer until two years ago,
when fate, in the form of a green-card lottery, sent her to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of her anointing, Ms. Horner was deluged with sheet
music and CD's. Recently, on the verge of her eighth rehearsal, she
had already weathered powwows with the group's manager, publicist
and photographer as well as a group excursion to Bloomingdale's to
hunt for new concert frocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's causing us all to re-evaluate our own singing,'' Ms.
Genensky said. ``I'd call our new sound rich but light, with depth
yet float. We're happy not to lose our ethereal sound, but now
there could be some moments of sexiness, which is especially nice
for the Hildegard program we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If her colleagues gush like blushing brides, Ms. Horner sounds
as if she were taking a veil of another sort. ``Of course, there is
some fear of the unknown,'' she said. ``I am giving up the
familiar, but it feels so right, so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horner might well tremble, with Anonymous 4 plunging into a
full schedule of European and American tours as well as concerts at
St. Michael's and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For now, she is
singing the parts vacated by Ms. Cunningham, but after
experimentation the singers may revoice some numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Between tours, the reconstituted group will tackle its first new
project, a program of music by Francesco Landini, a 14th-century
Italian poet and composer, scheduled for a European tour next May.
By then, Ms. Horner will have six programs under her belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim is to make everything as easy as possible for them, not
to cause a great tidal wave,'' she said. ``To a longtime
freelancer, it's a luxury to not have to scatter my energies, to
work in such detail, to focus in with colleagues I can grow and
develop with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I like touring. I love hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be worth checking back with her on that point in a year
or two.

PRICE IS RIGHT AS BRUINS FULLBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Sunday-evening conversation turned immediately
to Durell Price's mind and body. Price, UCLA's junior fullback,
described to his mother, Debbie, an exhaustion so complete he had
spent much of the day on the couch. He felt stiff and sore and
spent _ and he felt great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' he told her. ``But it's the exhaustion I
want.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the exhaustion of contribution, of six carries and two
catches and countless blocks in the Bruins' 49-31 victory over
Texas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the exhaustion of Price's first career start, which might
sound surprising considering his college prospects looked bright
after his senior season at Sylmar High.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, he's bound for Ohio State. The next _ after a
facsimile mix-up nullified his letter of intent _ he reconsiders
and signs with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   One minute he's a tailback. Twenty pounds later, he's a
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   One minute he's planning to redshirt during the 1998 season. A
few bug bites later, he's starting in front of 73,000 in the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me why Durell hasn't panned out,'' said Bruins
assistant Gary Bernardi, who recruited Price to Westwood. ``I tell
them it's not that, it's just he hasn't had the chance the other
kids have.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Until Craig Walendy's allergic reaction to mysterious
bug bites shelved his training camp and thrust Price into the
starting role. Now, after converting four short-yardage runs into
first downs, after catching two passes for 11 yards and blocking
like a pulling guard, Price believes he's here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Walendy returns to practice this week after a month of
spectating. Once he's ready for competition, he'll get plenty of
it. Fullback shy for years, the Bruins now must make room for two
in their tailback-oriented offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to coaching is to do things the players do best,''
coach Bob Toledo said. ``We can do things with Durell that we
haven't done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Price rushed for 1,666 yards and 36 touchdowns as a Sylmar
senior in 1995, and his UCLA career began with a seamless
transition. In his second game, against Northeast Louisiana, he
rushed for 110 yards. He had good balance and vision, and he could
catch. He compensated for modest speed with size and strength, or
so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Against Pacific-10 competition _ and sometimes in practice _
Price seemed a step slow hitting the hole. Added weight accentuated
the problem and he started the '97 season behind Skip Hicks,
Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He reluctantly moved to fullback and played sparingly behind
Walendy, a part-timer himself. With Hicks gaining 1,200 yards and
Cade McNown emerging as a pinpoint passer, the offense barely had
time for one fullback, much less two.
</P>
<P>
   Price returned from a midseason ankle injury and was left off
the travel squad to Stanford, initiating a heated post-practice
conversation with Bernardi. Price ranted for several minutes, then
listened as Bernardi explained the math: With a 60-man limit,
there's no room for a backup fullback who doesn't play special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Price spent the weekend alone in his apartment, pondering the
present and questioning the future. He moped for weeks until
running-backs coach Skip Peete pulled him aside after a team
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if I played tailback, I'd never make it (in
the NFL),'' Price recalled. ``It really caught me off guard. He
explained that there are tailbacks faster than me and that there
are 1,000 people trying to play tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You need to bring something to the table that other
guys don't have.' He said I could play fullback but have tailback
speed and hands and running ability, and I'd be different. It would
increase my chances. That really hit home. I had never had anybody
look me in the eye and say, `You're not going to make it in the NFL
as a tailback.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Price was convinced of his future, but when would it begin? If
he redshirted in '98, he'd have two years remaining _ two years
without Walendy, two years as the only fullback in a system that
uses only one fullback.
</P>
<P>
   But when spring practice concluded, Toledo warned Price to make
the most of his summer. He had to give the coaches a reason to
redshirt him, and reporting out of shape was not it. Besides,
Toledo said, Walendy could get injured, or ill, or bitten by an
unknown insect.
</P>
<P>
   Price attacked the summer conditioning program as if he were
going to play, then learned of Walendy's illness the day he
reported for training camp. His reaction: ``Thank God I didn't take
the summer off.''
</P>
<P>
   About that, there is no dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, it was tough for Durell when he realized tailback
wasn't his position,'' Toledo said. ``Until he bought into it, he
didn't give the effort he needed. But once he decided to be a
fullback, he worked hard. He sees the light.''

BETTE MIDLER SOFTENS THE EDGES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bette Midler's up-and-down recording career has always been
about juggling personas to create a portrait of an entertainer (and
woman) of many (often contradictory) parts.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Bathhouse Betty,'' her first album for Warner Brothers
after more than two decades on Atlantic, is arguably her most
multifaceted collection since her 1972 debut recording, ``The
Divine Miss M.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ms. Midler's continuing characters are here: the blowzy
aspiring art singer (``Song of Bernadette''), he post-disco diva
(``I'm Beautiful''), the wistfully sentimental Everywoman (``That's
How Love Moves''), the Hawaiian hula girl (``Ukulele Lady''), the
jazz nostalgist (``I'm Hip''), the original rock-and-roll mama
(``One Monkey Don't Stop No Show'') and the brash, defiant smut
queen (``Big Socks'').
</P>
<P>
   Several of those characters could be bunched under the umbrella
of the Divine Miss M, Ms. Midler's campy stage persona who has
always suggested a funny, precociously talented little girl playing
subversive games of dress-up.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ms. Midler is over 50, the edges of that incorrigible
cutup have softened. Nowhere on the album do you have a sense of
Ms. Midler breaking loose and recklessly kicking over the traces.
</P>
<P>
   But the three key pieces of this entertaining jigsaw puzzle of
an album are ballads of varying stripe that Ms. Midler delivers
with the blunt open-hearted power that has increased over the years
as her singing has gained in technical finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Walsh and Adam Cohen's ``Lullaby in Blue'' is a woman's
wistful reverie about a teen-age pregnancy and a daughter given up
for adoption. ``My One True Friend,'' the end title song from the
movie ``One True Thing,'' is a written-by-committee ballad (David
Foster, Carole King and Carole Bayer Sager) that aspires to be a
1998 hybrid of ``You've Got a Friend'' and ``Wind Beneath My
Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Midler's singing cuts right through its glossy Hollywood
sentiments to find a poignant core of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Mark Waldrop and Dick Gallagher's ``Laughing
Matters,'' from the off-Broadway musical ``When Pigs Fly.'' A
dreamy throw-up-your-hands ballad about the decline and fall of
almost everything, the song suggests a contemporary equivalent of a
Noel Coward reflection and finds an effortless blend of the wistful
and the comic. It closes the album on exactly the right
philosophical note.

IRAQI OFFICIAL CRITICIZES U.N. CHIEF OVER ROLE IN ARMS INSPECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A senior Iraqi official close to President
Saddam Hussein leveled an unusually direct attack on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday, apparently trying to draw
Annan into a growing confrontation over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is on the verge of cutting off all cooperation with U.N.
inspectors and could either expel inspectors or force a situation
in which they would have to be withdrawn, ending years of
painstaking disarmament and raising questions about how Iraq can be
prevented from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has demoralized the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's prohibited weapons and insuring
that Baghdad cannot build new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq wants a restructuring of the paralyzed commission and more
initiatives by Annan, who met on Monday with representatives of the
five permanent members of the Security Council _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ and this month's council
president, Hans Dahlgren of Sweden, to discuss a review of Iraqi
relations with the United Nations if and when cooperation resumes.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad on Tuesday, the Iraqi official, Hamed Youssef
Hummadi, an adviser in the president's office, said in an article
in an official newspaper, al-Qadissiya, that Annan had failed to
honor a promise the Iraqis said he made in February, ``which called
for ending the embargo imposed on Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's agreement, reached in a meeting with Saddam in Baghdad,
opened formerly closed sites to inspectors, a requirement for
moving toward the end of inspections. But it did not promise an
automatic end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is ``not enthusiastic'' about involving himself in this
crisis, at least not at this point, a Western diplomat said here
Tuesday. Diplomats say that it is impossible to know whether the
Iraqis really believe in their interpretation of events or are
merely trying to provoke reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Hummadi's comments reflected Iraqi annoyance with Annan's
insistence that Baghdad must reverse its decision, made on Aug. 5,
to stop on-site inspections, a clear violation of the
secretary-general's accord. Annan told diplomats from the Security
Council on Monday that he agrees with them that no review of
relations with Iraq can be conducted until the decision is
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the acting chief U.S. representative at the
United Nations, said in an interview Tuesday that if the Iraqis
wanted a comprehensive review of their relations with the United
Nations, that is exactly what they will get.

   ``We're very comfortable about what the bottom line of that
review would be,'' Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Egypt, another senior Iraqi official renewed the
attacks on U.N. inspectors Tuesday. Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahaf, who is seeking support at a meeting of the Arab League,
said that Iraq had ``no confidence in the arms inspection committee
and in the policies of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahaf is expected to have some success in Cairo, because
attitudes have been hardening against sanctions and the problems
they are causing Iraqi civilians, experts say.

   ``We face a rising tide of anger in the streets in many Middle
Eastern cities, which our friendly countries in the region are
finding harder to control,'' said Phebe Marr, a historian of modern
Iraq at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington who has returned
from several months in the region.  &QL;

SWISSAIR 111 BLACK BOXES STOPPED WORKING 6 MINUTES BEFORE IMPACT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Both ``black boxes'' recovered from the
wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 stopped recording about six minutes
before the jet crashed into the ocean, investigators said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The failure in the final minutes of the flight of both the
cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder leaves
investigators with no way of knowing exactly what the pilots said
or did as they frantically tried to keep the aircraft from plunging
into the ocean, about five miles off Peggy's Cove, a fishing
village near here, on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators at the Transportation Safety Board of Canada
said that they had ``significant information'' about how the
emergency on board the MD-11 jet developed before the failure of
the recorders that would help determine what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although the safety board did not announce the simultaneous
failures of the recorders until Tuesday afternoon, officials had
hinted in the last few days that it was very likely that both had
stopped working at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder was recovered on Sept. 6. The Swissair
MD-11 had one of the most sophisticated data recorders available,
capable of tracking technical data on hundreds of aspects of the
flight. The voice recorder, recovered Friday, contained a closed
loop tape that recorded 30 minutes of the pilots' conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking at the possibility that the jet's
electric system, or parts of the system, failed, which could partly
explain why some instruments on the jet emitted increasingly
unreliable information before stopping completely. The simultaneous
failure of both recorders would strengthen the suspicion that the
jet suffered a devastating electrical breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators know from the pilots' conversation with air
traffic controllers that the cockpit filled with smoke before the
crash. And they have recovered some bits of wreckage that indicate
something had caused enough heat to scorch parts of the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   John Maxwell, director of air investigations for the Canadian
board, said at a briefing on Saturday that it would be wrong to
conclude that the absence of information about the final six
minutes of the flight on both recorders would stymie investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many reports have been suggesting that we would be in somewhat
desperate straits without the last six minutes, but that is
certainly not the case,'' Maxwell said. He added that the problems
that caused the emergency were evident well before the last six
minutes of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Safety Board said that the false signals
picked up by the data recorder before it stopped operating were
being investigated by an international team of experts. The
information on the recorder is confusing and could take weeks to
decipher, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But to pursue the investigation further, officials said, it will
be necessary to take apart and study the wiring and components of
the MD-11 that are lying in badly damaged pieces on the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   American and Canadian divers have been working the frigid waters
of the Atlantic to retrieve the human remains of the 229 victims.
Once that work is substantially completed, the USS Grapple, a
specially equipped heavy salvage ship with a 300-ton-capacity
crane, will be able to hoist up the large pieces of fuselage so
that they can be brought ashore for study.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple has been moored in place over the site since Monday.

PRATCHARD MIGHT START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Canyon High lineman David Pratchard was
USC's No.3 center three days ago, but he might be the Trojans'
starter against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Pratchard moved up the depth chart because starting center Matt
McShane injured his knee Tuesday and had to be carted off the
field. McShane's injury was not determined by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? He sprained his knee,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``It's too early to tell. I didn't see it. I think he just
twisted it. In 48 hours, we'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is already missing its other top center, Eric Denmon, who
sprained his knee against San Diego State and is out this week.
This opens up an opportunity for Pratchard, who practiced sparingly
at center last season but has primarily been a guard. The biggest
obstacle facing USC will be getting Pratchard comfortable snapping
the ball to quarterbacks Mike Van Raaphorst and Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, we had a couple problems at first during the run
drill,'' Pratchard said. ``But then you start getting used to the
quarterbacks and it's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Jason Grain also worked out at center Tuesday, and
left tackle Brent McCaffrey is the emergency No. 5 snapper.
</P>
<P>
   It's all reminiscent of Hackett's first tenure at USC, when
injuries forced the Trojans to use sixth-string center Ray Peters
in a 20-7 loss to Arizona State that cost USC an undefeated season.
Quarterback Paul McDonald fumbled six snaps and lost four.
</P>
<P>
   __ Abrams not discouraged: Kicker Adam Abrams has tried to put
his 0-for-3 performance against San Diego State behind him,
something that might not have been so easy the previous two
seasons, when his starting role was not so secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed all three kicks by a yard each,'' Abrams said. ``I'm
hitting the ball solid. I just didn't do my job on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams made 12 straight field goals before his hat trick last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was maybe a situation where maybe he outthought
himself,'' Hackett said. ``I don't think we have a kicker
controversy. He just has to settle down. We'll continue to kick
field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's backup kicker, Adam Rendon, remains suspended with
almost no hope of returning to the team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Limited playbook: If USC's offense appears a little on the
plain side, there's a reason. Hackett said the Trojans are using no
more than 30 percent of his playbook, terming the offense
``vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably comfortable with 25-30 percent. At Irvine, we
put a huge burden on them because we introduced them to two years
of football,'' Hackett said. ``How it unfolds depends on the
maturity and development of the offense. I think the offensive line
and the tight ends, we need to be very conscious of them and build
slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Hackett said he would like to do is throw the ball
deep more often, especially with wide receiver R. Jay Soward
playing again.
</P>
<P>
   __ No favors: Oregon State coach Mike Riley had a request for
his former pupil, Soward, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can skip this one?'' Riley asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do that. I have to do what you taught me,'' Soward
replied.

RITE AID LETS UNION EXPAND IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's largest union will announce an
unusual agreement Wednesday with the Rite Aid pharmacy chain in
which the union's health-care plan will steer tens of millions of
dollars in business to Rite Aid and other unionized drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Rite Aid Corp. has promised not to fight organizing
drives by the union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, as 1199 sets out to unionize dozens more Rite Aid
stores in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of 1199, which represents 150,000 health-care workers,
have wrestled with the question of whether the union was
undermining unionized pharmacies by having the union's health plan
pay for purchases at nonunion pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for 1199's health plan to pay for
pharmaceutical purchases only at unionized stores, including not
just Rite Aid, but also the pharmaceutical departments at Pathmark
Stores, and Rock Bottom stores and 250 independent drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, 1199's president, said the agreement would be a
boon for unionized pharmacies because 1199's health plan covers
400,000 people and spends close to $60 million a year on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said: ``The bottom line is we expect to get 4,000 new
members in the next six months through this arrangement, and Rite
Aid will get close to $40 to $50 million worth of pharmaceutical
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Rite Aid would recognize 1199 as the collective
bargaining agent at additional pharmacies once more than half of a
drug store's employees signed cards showing they wanted to join
1199. In recent years, unions have increasingly sought recognition
through such card checks rather than through bitter, prolonged and
expensive election battles.
</P>
<P>
   To put labor's financial muscle behind unionized pharmacies,
Rivera said he planned to start a nationwide campaign to urge other
unions and union health plans to steer all their drug purchases to
unionized stores.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement calls for a Rite Aid subsidiary, Eagle Managed
Care, to run the drug reimbursement program for 1199's health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Grass, Rite Aid's chief executive, said in an interview:
``The benefit is we expect to get more value because currently 1199
members can go to any drug store in the New York metropolitan area.
It didn't seem to make sense to Dennis or to us to let union
members go to any store when they're patronizing nonunion stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, with 3,900 stores nationwide, is opening 10 new stores
each week, and Rivera said he hoped to capitalize on this expansion
by organizing all the new stores in the New York area. The union
already represents about 2,500 workers at the nearly 200 Rite Aid
stores in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the Hudson
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at 1199 said that over the next year, they hoped to
unionize at least 100 more Rite Aid stores, including new ones and
existing nonunion stores in upstate New York and in New Jersey.
Rivera said 1199 might urge its parent union, the Service Employees
International Union, to reach similar agreements with Rite Aid in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to subsidize employers who haven't met certain
labor standards,'' said Michael Rifkin, an executive vice president
of 1199.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the agreement is to encourage nonunion drug stores
to put up less resistance to unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, the drug purchasing card provided by
1199's health plan will be coded in such a way that it will not pay
for purchases at nonunion drug stores. Union officials said
exceptions would be made for union members who do not live near a
unionized pharmacy.

 By JAMES BENNET and ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton hired a raft of fresh advisers
and dispatched his top aides to placate congressional Democrats on
Tuesday, as members of the House Judiciary Committee bickered over
whether to release a videotape of his grand jury testimony about
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats accused Republicans of needlessly rushing to
release embarrassing television images of the president, but the
Republicans, who have the votes in the Judiciary Committee to force
the disclosure, argued that the testimony would help the public
judge whether the president had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   That question _ whether the president lied and whether he is now
trying to dodge behind a wall of legalistic language _ continued to
bedevil him, as several House and Senate Democrats angrily
criticized the White House in private meetings on Tuesday. Erskine
Bowles, the chief of staff, and other top aides tried to reassure
the congressional Democrats that Clinton was not resorting to
thinly sliced legal distinctions in rebuffing accusations of
perjury by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the meeting with Senate Democrats, which took
place over a caucus lunch, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware declared
that some Democrats believed that the party would be better off in
the fall elections if Clinton resigned, one person who was present
said. This person said that Biden added that he did not necessarily
agree with that view but that regardless Clinton would not resign,
so the Democrats should accept reality and make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by Biden on Tuesday evening, he said:
``I did not say the president should resign. I did not say the
country would be better off if he resigned. I do not think he will
resign.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should be worried that renegade Democrats might
call for Clinton to resign, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said: ``They
should worry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of television appearances on Sunday, Clinton's
lawyers insisted that the president had not lied under oath in
denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but many Democrats
as well as Republicans dismissed their remarks as finely nuanced
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said that Bowles repeated the White House message of
recent days _ that the president had made a terrible mistake and
was sorry. But Kerrey continued to express concern that the White
House was relying on distinctions that would be lost on most
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a necessity to make a legal case,'' he said,
``but his most difficult case is the political case.'' That was a
reference to the possibility of impeachment proceedings in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the private meetings, the White House took other
steps on Tuesday to try to put its relationship with Capitol Hill
on a firmer footing. It announced that Clinton had hired Gregory
Craig, director of policy planning at the State Department, to
serve as special counsel coordinating the reponse to Congress over
the Lewinsky matter. Clinton also brought back two former
legislative aides, Steve Ricchetti and Susan Brophy, as senior
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had their own disagreements on Tuesday. In the
Senate Republican lunch, according to several lawmakers, Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and half a dozen
Republicans suggested that Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, was being too conciliatory toward
the president and too public.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch, Hatch, said, ``Does everyone agree with
everything I've said? No. Many people feel I've been too fair.
We've got to let the House work its wheel. I've been saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, disclosed on Tuesday that Starr
had spent $4.4 million investigating Clinton's relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. He introduced a resolution demanding that Clinton pay
that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that the
president did not owe the taxpayers that money, but added that if
there was a ``serious effort'' to pass along a bill ``we'll
consider it when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers expressed concern about the release of his
videotaped testimony. The Judiciary Committee may meet on Thursday,
and if it decides to release the tape, it could do so as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not reviewed the videotape, because Clinton
and his lawyers do not have a copy, White House officials said. But
one aide said that a tape of any person's hours-long grand jury
testimony would produce unflattering moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the way TV will play it, they'll pick a piece
of it and play it over and over and over again,'' the aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said. ``It's not a pleasant
thing to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one camera filmed the testimony, so the prosecutors are not
shown. Clinton's advisers have said that he became quite angry and
even erupted at a couple of points during the questioning, which
was often confrontational. Clinton's allies in the White House and
on Capitol Hill are concerned that television news programs will
show the displays of anger without first showing the many minutes
of questioning that preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape will also show Clinton repeatedly refusing to
answer some questions and offering carefully calibrated answers to
others, according to descriptions of his testimony in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Craig's appointment as special counsel is likely to result in a
lower-profile role for David Kendall, the president's private
lawyer, whose tight control of information has often angered the
president's other advisers. Several aides blamed Kendall's
appearance on an ABC news program Sunday for angering congressional
Democrats about legal dodges.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will report directly to the president, relieving John
Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, of day-to-day responsibility
for fending off impeachment hearings in the House, and, should the
hearings begin, impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said that it was
appropriate bring a new defense team onto the White House payroll.
``This is a constitutional process in which the House is
considering some serious issues,'' he said, ``and the office of the
presidency has an obligation to work closely with the House as they
move through this process and to defend the prerogatives of the
office of the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's aides continued the politically delicate task of
describing the president's mistakes in lacerating terms while
defending him from congressional criticism. McCurry, the White
House press secretary, insisted that Clinton was not resorting to a
legalistic defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that is more profound than the
president admitting a mortal sin, asking for forgiveness, saying
how he has wronged people,'' he said. ``If anything, he has
confessed to far worse than the narrow legal question his lawyers
were being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings with Democrats on Capitol Hill, White House
aides got an earful about the legal tactics employed so far. After
meeting over a caucus lunch with senators, they gathered for an
hour in a basement meeting room with two dozen centrist Democrats,
and then with a group of House leaders in Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt's office. ``The leadership was a little tougher,'' said
one official who attended both meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said that one message the
congressmen delivered on Tuesday was that, ``In terms of the public
discussion, the average American does not understand the legalisms
and doesn't view them as being forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the members also urged the White House not to
cave in to the Republicans over health care, education, and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid reporters, most Democratic senators slipped out a side
door from their meeting. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York
said that the overall message was ``let's stand up and get through
this. There was no suggestion that we were not in any difficulty.''

<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday morning, Clinton's senior aides
received some reassuring news in a meeting with pollsters and other
outside advisers. Three Democratic pollsters _ Mark Mellman, Geoff
Garin and Mark Penn _ told the group that there was no evidence
that Clinton's troubles would suppress Democratic turnout this
fall, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said that some elements of the Democrats' loyal
base, including black voters, may be more likely to go to the polls
because of a perception that Clinton was unfairly under attack.
They also noted that Clinton's job approval ratings remained
strong, people who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included Lloyd Cutler, the longtime Washington
lawyer, and Peter Kadzick, another Washington lawyer who is playing
an informal advisory role at the White House. One participant said
the group discussed how the White House should mount a defense as
the case moves to Congress. ``The consensus is that public opinion
is really going to drive this process now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the meetings with White House officials, members of
Congress sparred on Tuesday over whether to release Clinton's
videotaped testimony. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who is the
ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, said that if
the Republicans were to force the disclosure they would
``jeopardize the process and demean our activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said that members who are not on the committee ``are
telling me strenuously that it would be a violation of the
bipartisan spirit if we were to let the video tape be released.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that the public ought to be able to judge
for itself whether Clinton was misleading. Rep. Edward Pease,
R-Ind., said, ``What I saw of the video deposition, I did not see
anything that we should withhold.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Tuesday that the House would not
formally adjourn this year, which would allow the Judiciary
Committee to keep working after the election.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: COMPETING STRATEGIES; CROWDED SKIES

<P>
   Singapore Airline and Delta Air Lines announced two differing
strategies to upgrade their long-haul in-flight service for
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines, which wins frequent plaudits for its
service, is investing about $300 million to upgrade its first-,
business- and economy-class offerings. Delta, meanwhile, is totally
eliminating its first-class service and upgrading its
business-class service on trans-Atlantic, trans-Pacific and United
States-Brazil routes.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines' new services are being phased in over the
next 18 months on its long-haul fleet of 37 Boeing 747-400s. The
new first class will feature airport check-in at a special lounge
and a redesigned airplane cabin with 12 so-called mini-suites
equipped with seat-beds, power outlets for computers, retractable
desks and 14-inch video monitors; previously there were 16 seats in
first class. Passengers in this cabin will be able to dine when
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines' new business-class service will have seats
that the airline says are based on a first-class seat frame; the
cabin will have 58 seats, down from 65. Seats will also have
privacy dividers and power outlets. The new business-class food
service will also be available whenever passengers wish.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines' economy-class passengers will have upgraded
seats and will be offered champagne throughout flights.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's new business class, which will be introduced next
spring, will feature new seats, upgraded wine and food, and a
modern entertainment system. Delta is investing $125 million in its
new business-class cabins, which will be offered on its MD-11 and
Boeing 767-ER and 777 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Choong Kong Cheong, deputy chairman and chief executive
officer of Singapore Airlines, said the carrier had opted to
upgrade all three of its in-flight cabins because ``Singapore's
passengers always expect the best from us.'' He added: ``We're
determined to stay ahead of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Singapore Airlines had been planning these changes
for two years and that it would proceed with them, despite the
recent crisis in the Asian economy. ``We're a global airline,'' he
said. ``The Asian economy has affected Asian airlines quite badly,
but other airlines are in the pink of health. We're continuing to
upgrade our product and service because we can't afford to be left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials said they had chosen to entirely eliminate
international first-class service because the demand for business
class far exceeded that for first class. According to data released
by the carrier, in 1997 the intercontinental business-class market
grew four times faster than that for first class; it also said
there were seven times the number of passengers in the industry's
business-class market than in the first-class market.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that on many nonstop trans-Atlantic routes Delta
has no competitors, Stephan Egli, vice president of Delta's
Atlantic and Pacific business unit, predicted that travelers on
these routes who have to choose between Delta's business-class
service and one-stop, first-class service on another carrier might
well pick Delta for its greater convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, aviation analyst for Paine Webber, said, ``The
paying first-class customer is limited to a relatively narrow
number of markets, which is why we see different carriers coming
out at different ends of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   900 Million by 2007
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers on U.S. air carriers is expected to
jump by 50 percent in the next nine years, according to the
Federation of Travel Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing projections from the Federal Aviation Administration,
Mark Brown, executive vice president of the travel club group, told
Reuters that airline ridership would reach 900 million by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Automobile Association, there were 599
million passengers in 1997, a 34 percent increase from a decade
earlier.

RED SOX DROP YANKEES 9-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees could write this one off to their desire
to have their starting pitchers well rested for the playoffs.
Manager Joe Torre, giving his starters an extra day of rest, used
the Kiddie Corps on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could explain it away by saying they encountered an
aberration, Tim Wakefield, whose knuckleballs dipped and darted so
unpredictably that his own catcher could not catch two consecutive
pitches in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever excuse is preferred, the Yankees lost another game,
this one a 9-4 decision to the Boston Red Sox, who are thankful for
small favors. The victory enabled the Red Sox to add a full game to
their wild-card lead for the first time since Aug. 25. A four-game
margin with 13 games to play looks a lot better to them than a
three-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek, at 26 no senior citizen himself, served as a
one-man wrecking crew against the Yankees' young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jerzembeck, making his first major league start, threw a
second-inning pitch to Varitek that wound up in the right field
stands for a three-run home run. Jerzembeck's replacement, Mike
Buddie, threw a fourth-inning pitch to Varitek that wound up
colliding with the facing of the third tier of the right field
stands, a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek also was the victim of Wakefield's first-inning pitches,
one up and one down, that he could not control. But the catcher was
flawless thereafter, and so, for long enough, was Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had battered him for five runs in four innings last
week in Boston, but Wakefield fluttered his way through their
lineup for six innings Tuesday night, baffling them on three
singles. That they rapped four hits against him in the seventh,
including a three-run home run by Scott Brosius, proved to be
immaterial in the overall scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Jerzembeck should have lasted so long.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander, who pitched an inning of relief in his
major league debut on Aug. 8, retired the Red Sox in order in the
first inning and retired two of the first three batters in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   But with Nomar Garciaparra at second base on a single and a
stolen base, the rookie walked Damon Buford, and Varitek followed
with the first of his right field blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Jerzembeck did not survive the third inning. Darren Lewis led
off with a single, went to second on a wild pitch and scored as
John Valentin singled. A groundout and a balk moved Valentin to
third, and a walk to Garciaparra sent Jerzembeck to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Buddie, a more experienced member of the Kiddie Corps (two
starts, 20 relief appearances), entered the game and allowed
Valentin to score on a sacrifice fly, but his more critical
contribution to the Red Sox victory came in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Buford began the inning with a single to left field, and Varitek
instantly showed that he was an equal opportunity slugger. Bringing
a total of five home runs and 26 runs batted in into the game,
Varitek hit his second home run of the game, the pair accounting
for nearly one-fifth of that pre-game RBI total.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees were able to zero in on Wakefield's
knuckleball, the Red Sox added another pair of runs in the seventh
inning on three singles against a member of the older generation of
Yankees pitchers, Mike Stanton. Mo Vaughn drove in the runs with
the third single.
</P>
<P>
   This was not what Tino Martinez had in mind when he talked
before the game about the Yankees' late-season skid, which has
resulted in a 12-15 record in the last four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's too concerned about anything right
now,'' Martinez said. ``If it was a couple days or a day before the
playoffs, maybe we'd be concerned, but we have plenty of time to
get things in order, get right and get ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The skid, however, has made it virtually impossible for the
Yankees to break the major league record for most victories in a
season. With a 104-45 record, the Yankees would have to win all of
their remaining 13 games to surpass the 116-victory total of the
1906 Chicago Cubs.

HIGH COURT FREES TWO MORE WENATCHEE CHILD SEX DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The convictions of Harold and Idella Everett, among the most
controversial of the Wenatchee child sex-abuse cases, were thrown
out Tuesday by a Washington State appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Wenatchee Police Detective Bob Perez used
intimidation and false information to get the couple to say they
had raped and molested their children.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel also ruled that Perez and state Child
Protective Services workers used improper methods to obtain
accusations from the Everett's children.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal had been pending for more than a year. Idella learned
of the court's decision exactly 24 hours after she had completed
her sentence and had walked through the prison doors as a free
woman.
</P>
<P>
   She stood in the front yard of a small house where she'd spent
her first day of freedom and screamed with joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter when the decision came, as long as it
came,'' the 45-year-old woman said minutes after receiving word.
``Now Harold has a chance to get his freedom and that's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaming down her cheeks, she added: ``The real
important thing is that we can get our names cleared and we can
prove to everyone that we're not the sex fiends that Perez said we
were. That's real, real, real important.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold, who is 69 and in poor health, is being held in a prison
near Spokane. He has two decades remaining on his 23-year-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Everetts and 43 others were charged with 29,726 counts of
child rape and molestation during the controversial Wenatchee
investigations of 1994 and 1995. Their cases are especially
significant because their daughters, Donna and Melinda, were the
principle accusers in most of the cases. The fact that CPS allowed
Perez to act as the girls' foster father while he developed the
sex-abuse cases has raised additional questions about the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's lawyers, Robert Van Siclen and Kathryn Russell,
wasted no time filing motions on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   As Russell produced papers to get Harold quickly released, Van
Siclen was trying to ensure police in the small town where Idella
is staying don't publicly notify residents that she had been
convicted of a sex crime. Officials and lawyers have asked that the
town not be identified by news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very unfair to tar her with that label because
she's no longer a convicted offender,'' Van Siclen said. ``The
appellate court ordered a withdrawal of the guilty pleas, so there
is no longer a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to Tuesday's ruling was torturous. Last December, the
appeals court agreed to examine the couple's request to withdraw
their guilty pleas and for a new trial, but said it needed more
information.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman County Superior Court Judge Wallis Friel was asked to
hold a rare fact-finding hearing. In a six-day hearing in April,
Friel was unflappable in keeping order and getting at facts as the
Everetts, their children, Perez, CPS workers and a dozen others
told their versions of what happened in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Friel submitted to the court a 64-page report that did not mince
words. He concluded the Everetts ``probably would not be found
guilty if tried again'' on more then 6,000 charges of child rape
and molestation.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the Division 3 Appeals Court judges in
Spokane _ John Schultheis, Frank Kurtz and Kenneth Kato _ echoed
most of Friel's findings, saying that:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``The evidence of Detective Perez's tactics is sufficient
on its face to support a finding of impropriety. Based upon our
common life experience, we know that type of conduct has the
potential of eliciting inaccurate and untruthful responses.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Melinda's 1996 recantation of her acusations was
``believable.'' She had said she was forced by Perez and CPS
workers to accuse her parents and other adults of sexual abuse.
They questioned the impact of the state's control on the child and
the fact that her stories changed while she was in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Statements from Melinda and the other children ``were
obtained by the state's use of improper interrogation techniques
including pressuring the children into accusing their parents and
others and lying to the children about what other witnesses had
said regarding the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rational trier of fact would believe the children's
allegations,'' the decision said.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Several factors would support suppression of Idella's
confession if she were allowed to withdraw her guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is in poor health, illiterate, low-functioning, in the
range of mild retardation, and quite naive. She initially denied
the allegations, but was bullied by Detective Perez, who repeatedly
stated she did it because her children said she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idella believed she could go home if she confessed, and that
if she did not, something would happen to her children ... Improper
interview techniques undermines the reliability of ... the
children's statements and Idella's confession.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Van Siclen said, ``shows that there are problems
in all of Wenatchee sex cases, and it should make it easier for
those still in prison because of this (investigatorial) misconduct
to get a chance at a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court of appeals has shown that it understands what
happened in Wenatchee and how justice system failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelan County Prosecutor Gary Riesen now has to decide whether
he will file new charges against the couple or allow Harold to go
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the prosecution has the courage now to accept the court
of appeals' decision and stop wasting state resources trying to
keep these innocent people in jail,'' said Russell, who wrote the
appeal with Van Siclen.
</P>
<P>
   Riesen did not return calls to his office for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Idella said the couple's ordeal won't be over until Riesen
announces his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get on with our lives. We knew that Perez was bad
and it's great that the court knows it too. But I want it all
behind us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hadn't spoken to her daughters, who are now
teen-agers in state custody,``because the state won't let me.'' She
has no information regarding Donna but has heard that ``Melinda
isn't doing too good ... She needs a mommy and I want her back.''
</P>
<P>
   She has no anger towards her girls because of their false
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt bad at first because I didn't understand it,'' she
said. ``Now I know it wasn't their fault, it was Bob Perez who
forced them to lie about everything. I just love them and I want it
all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, I hope this decision can help those other people
still in prison who shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people convicted in relation to the Wenatchee sex-abuse
investigations remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Two defendants, Carol and Mark Doggett, were previously ordered
released by a higher court and are awaiting a decision by Riesen on
whether they will face new charges. Several other cases have also
been overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For those still in prison, more than 50 lawyers, many of them
experts in appellate law, have joined with the University of
Washington's Innocence Project to try to win new trials.

SCALED-BACK PLAN FOR ROCKEFELLER CENTER APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Preservation officials approved a scaled-down plan on
Tuesday to expand the windows of Rockefeller Center's
boutique-sized shopfronts, allowing a compromise that they believe
will maintain the architectural spirit of the tourist magnet.
</P>
<P>
   The complex had sought to enlarge the boutique windows to two
stories and make several other changes to make it more attractive
to retailers. But after sharp criticism of the proposals,
Rockefeller Center officials modified their plans, reducing the
changes in scope and asking, for instance, that the boutique
windows be heightened by only 3 feet 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission voted
overwhelmingly to approve the latest changes. Among the most
significant changes that were approved was the relocation of the
restaurant Savories so that the entrance to the concourse on the
north and south side of the statue of Prometheus can be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two smaller statues also sculpted by Paul Manship,
Maiden and Youth, will be moved from the plaza level to the Channel
Gardens. And the three square blocks of Rockefeller Center will be
repaved in bluestone and sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been circulation and retail problems at
Rockefeller Center, and our proposal will solve those problems,''
said Richard Metsky, an architect with Beyer Blinder Belle, a
Manhattan firm. ``We're going to make adjustments to draw people
into the complex, then down into the concourse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Gabellini, the project's other architect and the owner
of Gabellini Associates, another Manhattan firm, said the plan
would ``polish'' Rockefeller Center, yet keep all ``the scale,
proportion and majesty of the center.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the chairman of the Landmarks Commission,
Jennifer Raab, called Rockefeller Center ``one of city's most
significant architectural treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing this icon must be done with great care,'' she said.
``We are pleased that the owners responded to the commission's
concerns at the June public hearing and came back with a
scaled-back, more modest proposal. The approved plan emphasizes
simple, clean design while respecting the buildings' historic
materials and massing.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was happy with the vote. Joyce Matz,
co-chairwoman of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board 5, said
she opposed the alteration to the Fifth Avenue windows. ``We wanted
to preserve the architectural integrity of this world-famous
landmark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matz said she was perturbed that she and other
preservationists were not heard before the vote. ``In a proposal
this significant there should have been more discussion,'' she
said. ``I'm not saying you should never alter a landmark, but the
character and uniqueness of the landmark should not be permanently
altered.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other approved alterations, the aluminum flagpoles
that flank the sunken plaza _ which serves as an ice-skating rink
in winter and as an outdoor garden restaurant the rest of the time
_ will be changed to bronze ``to be consistent with the tone of
most of the metal in Rockefeller Center,'' said Steven Rubenstein,
a spokesman for the complex.
</P>
<P>
   A large metal-and-glass marquee at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, whose
primary tenant is NBC but which also houses the Rainbow Room, will
be permanently removed. ``It was put up in the '80s and is not
original to the center,'' Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center's owners are in a consortium that includes
Goldman Sachs, Tishman Speyer, David Rockefeller, Troutlet
Investments and the Exor Group. Rubenstein said the owners always
expected some give and take with the Landmarks Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought this was an ongoing process,'' he said. ``They're
excited about what this means for the center. At no time did they
want to compromise the landmark during their stewardship.''

IN NEW YORK, SOME JUST HELD THEIR NOSES AND VOTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Mandel describes herself as cynical about a lot
of things, among them American politics in general and specifically
the report by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr detailing President
Clinton's alleged sexual peccadillos.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take more than mere turmoil in Washington to keep
even a confirmed cynic like Ms. Mandel at home on Election Day. Ms.
Mandel, a 33-year-old freelance writer, marched straight to her
neighborhood polling place in Chelsea on Tuesday at lunchtime and
voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole disgusting Starr report makes me more cynical about
our larger cultural sickness,'' she said. ``But I'm not cynical
about voting. I'm not cynical about elections. And I'm not cynical
about the elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was cynicism in the aftermath of the release of
the Starr report or just plain indifference, many voters did not
share Ms. Mandel's determination to participate in the electoral
process. Tuesday's New York primaries, in fact, were noteworthy for
their low voter turnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with some of the no-show voters did not make a
clear case that the details of the president's liaisons with Monica
Lewinsky turned off large numbers of New Yorkers. Some said they
stayed away because they were bored by the largely somnolent
campaigns. Others said they were afflicted with garden-variety
political apathy unrelated to recent events.
</P>
<P>
   And it is evident that, for all the clamor they have created in
political circles, Clinton's troubles seemed little more than the
muffled rumble of faraway thunder to many of the New Yorkers who
did rouse themselves to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always vote _ otherwise it gets worse,'' said Mike Grady, an
administrator with Met Life, who voted near his home in the Bronx
after work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get people who are easily turned on and turned off
by this or that thing,'' he added with a shrug. ``Then there are
the others, like me, who go and express their views no matter
what.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a third category, as illustrated by the case of
Anthony Salimeni. The 32-year-old school-bus driver said he is
registered to vote but never does because, Lewinsky saga or not, no
politician is trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say one thing and do another,'' Salimeni said as
he sat on the steps of the Asser Levy Recreation Center at 501 East
23rd Street in Kips Bay, watching the steady procession of voters
going to the polling place inside. ``It's been going on hundreds of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Robertson, 32, a fashion photographer who spent the day
playing with her 2-year-old daughter, Drew, in Riverside Park, said
the past few months of watching the news out of Washington has
brought her around to Salimeni's point of view. She said she did
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so dishonest, politics, I'm turned off by all of it,''
she said. ``Clinton, Monica and Starr _ that was the final straw.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Manness, voting at a polling place in the Peter Cooper
Village apartment complex, said she has a few friends who expressed
the same cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with what Clinton did, for sure,'' she said.
``But I vote just the same. I select those people who have some
degree of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   For many like her, an election invokes a sense of obligation in
the civics-textbook sense of the word and, no matter what, they
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a World War II veteran, and so everyone in my
family votes,'' said Martin Howard, 39, of the Bronx. ``People gave
their lives just so we could be here to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he is registered as a Conservative but that most of
his relatives were registered Democrats and they all voted Tuesday.
The controversy swirling around President Clinton could not tarnish
the electoral process in the eyes of his family or other voters,
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to matter one hill of beans,'' he said. ``It
might become an issue in November. But since it's not a
presidential election year, I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley McCain, a fund-raiser for AIDS programs who lives in
Stuyvesant Town, said she was fed up with both Republicans and
Democrats, but would not dream of staying away from the polls for
much the same reasons as Howard. ``Being black, I'm not going to
let anybody take that away from me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lewinsky matter has changed her outlook on the
elections. ``It will be interesting to see if people look at the
Republicans now as the great moral party,'' Ms. McCain said, adding
that personally she finds ``plenty of hypocrites'' in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lewinsky-Clinton story influenced Tuesday's voters at
all, it was to make some of them vote strategically. Ms. Mandel,
the Chelsea freelance writer, said she came out especially to vote
for Rep. Charles Schumer in the primary race for the U.S. Senate in
hopes he could beat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican incumbent,
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a D'Amato fan,'' Ms. Mandel said. ``And with
presidential elections coming up, it's important to have a strong
Democratic presence in the Senate, especially because there is a
leadership crisis in the Democrats.''

BIG GAMES HAPPEN IN SMALL PLACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has played in several of the nation's most
renowned stadiums in recent years, from Michigan's Big House to
Nebraska's Memorial Stadium and Tennessee's towering Neyland
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Bruins visit Robertson Stadium on Houston's
downtown campus. With a capacity of 20,500, it's little more than a
glorified high school facility. By comparison, the Pac-10's
smallest venue, Oregon State's Parker Stadium, holds 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cozy,'' said Houston coach Kim Helton, whose team is
playing all its games at Robertson for the first time since 1949.
``It's easy to get to. It's good to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a dismal atmosphere,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said. ``We're used to playing in big stadiums. But the important
thing is to be ready to play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   __ High praise: Quarterback Cade McNown, tailback Jermaine
Lewis, receiver Freddie Mitchell and linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo
(two sacks) were obvious contributors against Texas. Who else
played well? Toledo named names:
</P>
<P>
   Inside linebacker Ramogi Huma, who led the team with eight
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer, who was equally impressive with his
blocking as with his receiving (four catches, 81 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Pete Holland, whose consistency serves as a model
for talented sophomore Kenyon Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   __ Same play, different result: Tailback Lewis' 7-yard touchdown
run came on the same off-tackle power play as his botched
fourth-and-1 attempt last year at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning upfield before the hole developed, Lewis
stayed behind his blockers and eventually found a huge opening over
right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a year makes and what a difference a play
makes,'' Lewis said. ``As soon as it went wrong (last year), the
coaches lodged it in my head not to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Toledo awarded a scholarship to junior
fullback Mark Verti, a Rowland Heights native who was a walk-on in
1996 and 1997. Verti is one of UCLA's top special-teams
performers.... Mitchell was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the
Week for his 233 all-purpose yards. That does not include a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon.

 &HT;    Millwood wins 16th before heading to 'pen
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Braves let Kevin Millwood make one more start
Tuesday night. In turn, he gave them something to remember him by.
</P>
<P>
   The best fifth starter a team could have, Millwood threw seven
shutout innings to pitch the Braves past Philadelphia 3-0, giving
Atlanta five wins in the last six games. Slated to move by week's
end to the bullpen, where he will spent the postseason, Millwood
improved to 16-8, having won five of his last seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a watered-down lineup the night after clinching the
division, the Braves did all their scoring in the third, when Tyler
Green walked in two runs and Gerald Williams brought in the third
with a 45-foot single.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood hardly fooled the Phillies but he still threw seven
shutout innings before yielding to the bullpen. He allowed eight
hits _ three of them to Wendell Magee _ and three times let
Phillies leadoff men reach base but was able to control the damage.
</P>
<P>
   But he countered with the fastball. Of Millwood's first nine
strikeouts, six came after Phillies had reached base. In the fourth
and sixth innings after Philadelphia put men on first and second,
Millwood allowed just one ball to be put in play (a Bobby Estalella
foul-out) and recorded the rest of the outs with strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got a 3-0 lead out of nowhere in the third inning,
when Phillies starter Tyler Green temporarily misplaced the strike
zone. After zipping through the first two innings and throwing 10
strikes in his first 11 pitches, Green was off the plate with 12 of
his next 14 in the third and allowed Atlanta to bat through the
order.
</P>
<P>
   Green should have escaped the inning with no damage when, with
one out and men on first and second, rookie George Lombard hit a
potential double-play ball to first. But Lombard displayed his
outstanding speed in beating Desi Relaford's throw to first and
Green proceeded to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   He first walked Greg Colbrunn on five pitches to load the bases,
walked Ryan Klesko on four pitches to bring in the first run and
then walked Javy Lopez on five pitches to force in a second run.
Gerald Williams next chopped a ball off the plate and outran third
baseman Scott Rolen's throw for an RBI on a single that went 45
feet, giving Atlanta a 3-0 lead.

 &HT;    Karan's cornucopia of colors suggests indecision
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donna Karan assumed two curious stances Tuesday night
during the runway presentation of her spring/summer '99 DKNY
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The first came in her decision to sit, then squat, then stand
among the editors and buyers who'd come to the 14th floor of a
Hudson River warehouse to preview the collection for their
newspapers, magazines and stores.
</P>
<P>
   The second stance was Karan's choice of colors for the
collection. More accurately, DKNY showed an odd inability on the
designer's part to decide on a color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Her loosely cut clam-diggers, her knee- to floor-length skirts,
her sheer pullovers and cardigans and her form-over-function rain
jackets were offered up in a range of 72 colors.
</P>
<P>
   Come next season, that could prove an equally daunting number of
choices _ for everyone but New Yorkers, that is. Notes provided to
the show's audience declared that this was ``A collection that
says, `New York City.''' But New Yorkers in general _ and fashion
critics in particular _ wear black.
</P>
<P>
   The closest anything in the DKNY collection came to black were
pieces in the shade Karan calls ``mud.'' The bulk of the collection
came either in white or shades Karan refers to as ``melon,''
``limeade,'' ``citron,'' ``cement'' and ``sorbet.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the collection didn't look nearly as marketable as the
new ``sexy and naive'' DKNY underwear that was unveiled for the
show's finale. The bras and panties looked stretchy, comfortable
and sturdy. The clothes looked fabulous, but far too fragile for
the active lifestyles women lead.
</P>
<P>
   The sweaters, with their complicated cowl necks, looked like
they were made of mist rather than fabric. The dresses and skirts
were see-through _ with or without a ``lining'' skirt worn
underneath them. And the wispy, hooded rain jackets looked about as
useful during a cloudburst as a Kleenex would be.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Karan approached next season's DKNY collection in the
spirit of experimentation. Then again, she should sit, squat or
stand out in public more often to remain in closer touch with what
regular women and the unapologetically trend-conscious alike want
to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Jones New York chief designer Robin Howe emerged from the
drawing room where she was sketching ideas for her fall/winter '99
collection just long enough to grab a heaping plate of food and to
offer assurance that her focus on realistic careerwear remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance was unnecessary since the evidence of Howe's
intent _ the sensible suits and separates coming from Jones New
York for spring/summer '99 _ hung on every square inch of her
labyrinthine showroom's walls.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive array of clothes Howe designed for next season
might be short on innovation, but working women will find much in
the collection that's both stylish and suitable for the office.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing trends in color (gray, blue, mossy greens and
rich reds), shape (long, looser skirts and coats), patterns
(florals and strips) and pieces (jackets and sweater sets) are all
well represented in the collection. The shortest skirts coming from
Jones New York will graze the knee, but most of the skirt and dress
hemlines extended to the ankle. The best among them may be the
washed silk mock wrap skirt, which, as one staffer was overheard
observing, ``rules out worrying about the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Vittadini designs for the mature, moneyed woman are
always tasteful and always rendered in luxury fabrics, whether
they're considered the ``in'' thing or not.
</P>
<P>
   Vittadini's spring/summer '99 collection of contemporary style
casual classics is no exception. In it, she infuses healthy doses
of pale gray with the traditional warm weather color combinations
(navy and white, tan and cream, red and white). Much of what she
showed had a leisurely, yachting-life look. There were nautical
stripe sweaters, oversized windbreakers and short sailor pants. Her
dressier sweaters and shells were embroidered, loosely woven and
paired with Shantung silk Capri pants or A-line skirts. For
dressed-down occasions, she designed gray and white cashmere
separates that looked athletic and affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a casual expression in the collections,'' Vittadini
said, ``but I also think it's quite chic.''

REFORMS ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST, FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE WIN
APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   ( WASHINGTON )_ The nation's top judges
on Tuesday approved reforms aimed at reducing conflicts of interest
and increasing access to judges' financial disclosure reports.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Judicial Conference voted to slash charges for copies
of the reports by 60 percent and to lower other administrative
obstacles to the public. It also unveiled a series of ethics
training programs for judges.
</P>
<P>
   And the policy-making conference, headed by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, directed two committees to study allowing the
public to review judges' financial holdings at their local
courthouses. Currently, that option is available only in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   The judges called those and other reforms ``positive steps in
improving public access to financial disclosure reports without
compromising the security of judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial critics were heartened but stressed the changes should
not stop here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judicial Conference took long-overdue first steps,'' said
James C. Turner, a Washington lawyer and legal-system reformer.
``But these are only first steps. Full, local disclosure at the
courthouse is the obvious solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference's 27 members enacted the changes during a secret,
daylong meeting at the U.S. Supreme Court. They acted in response
to a series published this spring in BEGIN ITAL The Kansas City
Star END ITAL.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that federal judges in Kansas City and
elsewhere presided over scores of lawsuits against companies in
which they owned stock, despite laws forbidding such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's study of cases in four states identified more
than 300 court orders entered in violation of federal law. The
judges set hearings, granted motions, conducted trials and threw
out legal claims. At the same time, the judges owned as much as
$250,000 in stock in the companies being sued.
</P>
<P>
   The articles showed that few people look at judges' disclosure
reports because the judiciary places tight restrictions on their
release. The reports are stored only in Washington, the judiciary
releases them only after a lengthy administrative process and each
request sparks a warning to the judge about who is investigating
the holdings.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN ITAL The Star END ITAL also found that more than a third
of the reports were incomplete or contained errors.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Judicial Conference and its committees on
Tuesday announced a range of reforms. The judges:
</P>
<P>
   Slashed charges for copies of the disclosure reports from 50
cents a page to 20 cents a page.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped a requirement that each request to review the reports be
signed by a notary public. William Terrell Hodges, chairman of the
conference's executive committee, said judges could not determine
why notarization had ever been required.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed to post special order forms, required to obtain the
reports, on the Internet and at every federal courthouse.
Currently, the forms are available only in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Intensified and expanded ethics training for judges. Court
officials also will supply each of the nation's 2,000 federal
judges with standardized checklists to ensure that the judges
accurately complete disclosure reports and identify all financial
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered development of computer systems to help judges and their
clerks compare their stock holdings with the names of litigants in
their courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered a committee to consider requiring each corporation
involved in litigation to list all its parent and affiliated
companies as a way to help judges identify conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The most far-reaching reform still under consideration _ posting
all of a judge's assets at the local courthouse for anyone to see _
was not immediately approved. Hodges said two committees will study
the issue and the conference could act on the plan at its next
meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   The final proposal might include more than financial holdings,
he said. For example, a judge might list law firms at which
relatives and close friends work.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges said he hopes the conference's actions satisfy
congressional critics that the judiciary is serious about reform.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Sen. John Ashcroft and Sen. Charles Grassley accused
the judiciary of a ``disturbing pattern'' of ethical violations and
of blocking public access to the disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When federal judges fail to obey the laws that govern their
conduct, they send a terrible message to the public,'' the senators
said in a letter to judicial administrators.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, a House subcommittee chastised judges for their
ethical lapses and said it would consider legislation if the
judicial conference did not act.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers contacted on Tuesday said they wanted to study
the conference's actions before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also was swayed by Kansas City judges, who took
the lead in reform.
</P>
<P>
   In April, District Judge Scott O. Wright filed a list of his
investments with the clerk at the Kansas City courthouse. Soon, all
other judges in Western Missouri followed his example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants to come in and see it, they are free to do
so,'' Wright said at the time. ``It is clearly the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri state judges quickly decided to do the same. Now
judicial officials in Kansas are hammering out details for that
state's first system of judicial disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also campaigned for reform nationwide. He mailed letters
to more than 30 ranking federal judges, urging that they vote to
enact disclosure rules at all federal courthouses.

POLICE CONTROL OF SCHOOL SECURITY LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bringing to a close a wrenching debate about the role
of police officers in schools, the New York City Board of Education
has enough votes to turn over school security to the Police
Department, apparently becoming the first city in the nation to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal to be voted on Wednesday, the training,
recruiting and managing of the Division of School Safety's 3,200
officers will be turned over to the Police Department, though they
will not carry guns. In addition, uniformed and armed police
officers will continue to patrol 128 of the city's 1,100 schools.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of police officers in schools has weighed heavily on
the system, playing a key role in the departure of Ramon Cortines
as chancellor in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani engaged in a bitter feud with Cortines, who opposed
police control of school safety as an interference in the learning
atmosphere for the system's 1.1 million schoolchildren. Cortines
cited the dispute as a reason for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the current chancellor, Rudy Crew, was appointed,
he made clear that he also opposed police control of school safety.
But Crew's relations with Giuliani have been amiable and the two
crafted a compromise in which the Police Department is in charge
but, for the time being, does not increase its personnel in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to be voted on Wednesday is essentially a broad
outline of the takeover, but numerous questions remain, among them
these: Who decides whether a hallway fistfight warrants an arrest
by the police or a suspension by the principal? Will the current
3,200 officers be retrained? Who has the final say on whether to
add more schools to regular police patrols, the Police Commissioner
or the chancellor?
</P>
<P>
   Experts in public schools say that New York appears to be the
first big-city school system in which the municipal Police
Department is to oversee school security. More common, said Henry
Duvall of the Council of Great City Schools, a consortium of 51
urban districts, is what New York City now has: separate security
forces operated by a school district and supplemented in some cases
by officers from the municipal police force.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover has been urged for five years by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who has contended that the move would improve safety and
erase a Board of Education unit whose officers and officials have
been involved in school crimes and corruption over the years.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have grappled with improving the Division of
School Safety almost since it was created in 1969 and quickly
derided as the ``F Troop.'' But they have long resisted such a move
because of fears that the police would infringe on educators'
autonomy and create a prisonlike air in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some students from black and Hispanic communities, where tension
with police officers has been common, carry their distrust of the
department into schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Lopez, 18, a senior at George Washington High School in
Washington Heights, said he had detected a difference in
personality between school safety officers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With security guards,'' he said, ``you could be friends. With
cops, there's tension. We're going to have to keep our distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the result of a compromise between City Hall and
the Board of Education worked out over the last few months after a
change in the political makeup of the board gave Giuliani the best
chance he has had to implement the plan. Two members who opposed
the police in schools, Luis Reyes and Carol Gresser, were replaced
on July 1 by Irving Hamer Jr., who has said he opposes the plan,
and Terri Thomson, who is likely to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,200 officers in the board's Division of School Safety will
become employees of the New York Police Department but will not be
sworn, armed law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   They will be commanded by a deputy chief for school security,
who will appoint a liaison to the chancellor and serve on an
oversight committee whose membership will be named by the
chancellor and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan leaves several questions unanswered _ neither the
chancellor, Police Commissioner Howard Safir nor Giuliani have
commented in detail _ though board officials say they will be
worked out before the takeover takes effect, sometime between Nov.
1 and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A key question among critics of the plan is whether principals
truly maintain their authority over school discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials say they do, unless a serious incident arises.
But who prevails _ the principal or the Police Department _ on
borderline cases like student fights remains murky. The language of
the ``memorandum of understanding,'' which has not been publicly
released but leaked to reporters, leaves ample room for either to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``School security personnel and/or NYPD officers, to the fullest
extent practicable, in instance not requiring immediate arrest or
other immediate action, shall consult with the principal of a
school or his or her designee prior to placing a student enrolled
at such school under arrest,'' the memo says. ``Officers shall take
into account any information provided by the principal or
designee.''
</P>
<P>
   Other points still to be worked out include specifically how the
training of officers will differ and whether any of the current
force will be dismissed or retrained. The memo says that within two
months of the implementation, tentatively set for Nov. 1 and
renewable after four years, police will put in place a
``recruitment, hiring and training plan'' in consultation with the
 &QR; 
chancellor's staff but leaves open whether that means new recruits
or current personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not call for an increase in the number of schools
already patrolled by one to three regular police officers beyond
the 128. But it does leave open the option if the chancellor and
police commissioner concur although it does not spell out what
happens if they do not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crew and William Thompson Jr., president of the Board of
Education, have worked the phone and held meetings over the summer
to ease concerns about a plan that some believe presents far more
sensitivities than the merger of the transit and housing police
with the regular Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school is a community where established relationships
among teachers, guidance counselors and students are more important
than those with the police,'' said Jeremy Travis, head of the
National Institute of Justice and a former New York police deputy
commissioner who headed a commission that studied the school safety
division in the early 1990s. ``The overwhelming responsibility for
safety is with that community, not the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Brooklyn representative on the board, had at first
opposed a larger police role in the schools but said he supported
the plan because it did not mandate an increase in armed patrol of
schools and proposed that precinct commanders, principals, parents
and staff sit down and work out a safety plan for individual
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good compromise,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Others, too, who had expressed reservation have been won over.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, who had
opposed a police takeover in principle, said he supported this plan
after a recent briefing with the chancellor and board president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support it,'' said Walcott, who was appeased when it became
clear the guards would not be armed police officers who might put
``an air into the schools that does not need to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think there are some issues that need to be
resolved. But I have a lot of confidence in the chancellor and
board president to really negotiate and do what is best for the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, said they would withhold judgment until the
details of the plan were worked out. Among them was Carl Haynes,
president of Teamsters Local 232, which represents the school
safety officers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said he had met with board officials Tuesday
afternoon and was reviewing the plan. Likewise, a spokeswoman for
the principals' union said that it had just received a copy of the
proposal Tuesday and that officials were reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Among students, there was both suspicion of the police and hopes
safety might approve.
</P>
<P>
   James Johnson, 16, a junior at Martin Luther King High School in
Manhattan, said safety might improve if the police controlled
security, but he had misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All police officers ain't good police officers,'' said
Johnson, who said he has been stopped by officers looking for
suspected drug dealers. ``Some of them bother you for no reason.
They assume things about you because of the way you dress or the
way you carry yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, like Francesca Fontaine, 16, a junior at King,
seemed more receptive to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think it's going to be a problem,'' she
said. ``It will be like having another security guard, just well
trained and more experienced.''

COMMENTARY: GOD AND SWOOSH AT ST. JOHN'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When James Keady took a course in Catholic social
teaching last semester at St. John's University, his professor
suggested that he look into sports and social justice for a term
paper. It made sense to Keady, who was studying theology and
working as a graduate assistant coach for the men's soccer team. He
settled on a topic when he saw a newspaper article about
allegations of unsafe conditions in the far-flung Asian factories
making Nike products.
</P>
<P>
   The topic hit close to home, because the university has been
negotiating a sponsorship contract with Nike. Keady questioned
whether St. John's, the nation's largest Catholic university,
should be making deals with a company whose chairman and
co-founder, Philip Knight, makes millions while the factory workers
hired by subcontractors scrape by on what human rights advocates
call starvation wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Phil Knight earned it,'' Keady said. ``OK How many
pairs of shoes did Phil Knight glue together last year? He made it
on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   What started as a classroom assignment went from the realm of
the intellectual to the domain of the practical. What if, as a
matter of conscience, he could not wear the Nike logo when the deal
was sealed? He said school officials could not ease his concerns,
and his coach demanded that he either ``drop the issue, wear Nike
or resign.''
</P>
<P>
   So he quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't drop the issue publicly,'' said Keady, who
now teaches freshman religion at St. Francis Prep in Queens. ``I'm
a student of Mahatma Gandhi, and he said that resistance needs to
be public and provocative if it is going to effect change.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials and coaches say they are surprised by the
reason for his resignation, saying they were under the impression
that he had left to take a better-paying teaching job. David Masur,
the men's soccer coach, said he was shocked when Keady resigned in
late June. He said that only a month before, Keady had told him
that he had no problem wearing Nike gear after the company had
announced initiatives to improve its overseas business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave him an ultimatum,'' Masur said. ``We did have
many differences. Jim had to find a way where he could fulfill his
duties as a graduate assistant, as opposed to running around
promoting himself and promoting this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, promotion is what this boils down to, since Nike's
contracts with schools usually include guidelines on where and how
the ``swoosh'' logo must be worn, and involve coaches and officials
in devising new ways to promote the logo. While outright criticism
may not be prohibited in the deal, there is the expectation that
everybody does his bit.
</P>
<P>
   Keady said he changed his mind about Nike when he learned that
its labor initiatives did not address the questions of paying
workers a livable wage and guaranteeing them the right to organize
unions. The Rev. Paul Surlis, his theology professor, said such
concerns were reflected in Catholic social teaching that dated to
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running through the whole body of teaching is the right to
just wages, the right to organize, and that labor is not a
commodity,'' Father Surlis said. ``The movement of jobs from this
country to the Philippines, Indonesia, China and Southeast Asia
effectively is treating labor as a commodity, where people in
desperate situations will take any employment.''
</P>
<P>
   For Keady, the decision was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if at the end of the day, I say in good conscience that I
can't wear their equipment?'' he said. ``I can't be a billboard for
Nike. I can't be a marketing tool for Nike.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at St. John's said they have shared their own concerns
with Nike during the ongoing negotiations, and would rather work
with the company and have some influence than walk away. Robert
Crimmins, the university's executive vice president, said St.
John's is asking for independent monitoring of factories and has
told the company that it wants verifiable assurances that workers
are being treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't live up to it, we won't be doing business with
them,'' Crimmins said. ``We will do the best we can to get them to
change. We think they are a good organization led by a moral
individual who wants to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of all this, some of Keady's friends wondered why he
had left a championship soccer team he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One friend told me I screwed it up,'' he said. ``He told me to
get over it. I say there are more important things than games.''

MEDIA GIANTS COULD SWALLOW UP BRITISH SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Manchester United. Then Arsenal. Then Liverpool,
Newcastle, Tottenham soon every soccer club in Britain could find
itself on media giants' shopping lists, a prospect that terrifies
fans of the beautiful game.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's $1.05 billion bid for
Manchester United, a move that has shaken the foundations of
English soccer, other companies are already seeking to get involved
in what they believe will be a lucrative enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of reasons to believe that: Soccer, especially in
Europe, has become a big-money enterprise, the product of satellite
and pay-per-view television and the big clubs' realization of the
cash that's theirs for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, who made the ManU offer through British Sky
Broadcasting (in which his News Corp. owns a controlling interest),
already owns the Dodgers and has been a major player in world
rugby. His television empire, of which BSkyB (which owns the rights
to broadcast the English Premier League through 2001) is only a
part, could disseminate England's No.1 club throughout the world,
reaping huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to know whether or not the sale will go through.
U.S. investment bank Soloman Smith Barney confirmed that one of its
clients asked for information on the club, leading to talk that a
rival bid approaching $1.2 million would soon be made. And rumors
are that Interpublic Group of Cos., the planet's third-largest
advertising agency holding company, will bid for the team, although
it says it has ``no plans'' to do so. Manchester United's board of
directors, who have approved the Murdoch bid, say they legally
would have to listen to a higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   The British government is expected to investigate the offer
BSkyB's Premier League broadcast contract will be a starting point
and might refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which could lead to a drawn-out regulatory review.
United officials might prefer a rival bid to such an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, however, is close to Prime Minister Tony Blair; that
could pay off for him, even as United fans plead for government
intervention. They fear that Murdoch cares nothing for the club's
tradition and performance, just for its potential profits.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning champion Arsenal, meanwhile, is in talks with Carlton
Communications, one of Britain's largest TV and film companies; a
$464 million bid is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Granada, another TV company, has been rumored to be after
Liverpool, although the club's directors deny it. And Newcastle,
Aston Villa and even unfancied Sheffield United are being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   All this movement has sent stock prices soaring (Manchester
United is a publicly traded company; Arsenal is not). And if the
offers are approved, it could bode well for the proposed European
Super League, which is about nothing more so than money.
</P>
<P>
   And cash is what all of this is about. Soccer, like other
sports, has always revolved around the almighty dollar (or pound),
but that's often been obscured by the traditions of the game,
particularly in England, home to the sport's roots. Whether
Murdoch's, or any other company's, involvement is good or bad for
the game, it will alter the sport's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   __ A revolving door: The resignations last week by Germany's
Berti Vogts, Spain's Javier Clemente and Bulgaria's Hristo Bonev
leaves just 10 of the 32 men who guided teams into the World Cup
still on the job. That's how it works at soccer's highest levels
even winners don't last long but the past few months have been
murder on coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Vogts stepped down following a disappointing pair of games in
Malta, citing unceasing media pressure and wanting to maintain
``any remnants of dignity left over for me.'' It was a sad finish
for the man who was once one of Germany's greatest defenders, and
who guided the Germans to the European title just two years ago. He
was replaced by Erich Ribbeck after Jupp Heynckes (fired at Real
Madrid after winning the European Champions Cup in May) turned down
the job and after an offer to former star player Paul Breitner was
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, who failed to get Spain out of the first round of the
World Cup, resigned under pressure after the stunning 3-2 loss to
lowly Cyprus in a 2000 European Championship qualifier 11 days ago.
Luis Aragones declined the job when the Spanish federation wouldn't
give him the control he craved, and Jose Antonio Camacho is
expected to get the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Bonev, who quit after a one-sided Euro loss to Poland, was
replaced by Dimitar Dimitrov. Other new hirings: Japan, Philippe
Troussier (South Africa's coach in France); Argentina, Marcelo
Bielsa; and Iran, Mansour Pourheidari.
</P>
<P>
   __ Corner kicks: One of the candidates for the vacant U.S.
national team coaching job might not be available for long. Former
U.S. coach Bora Milutinovic is negotiating to take charge in Costa
Rica, according to reports in the Central American country. Bora
took the Ticos to the second round of the 1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   - The Orange County Zodiac's first ALeague playoff appearance
was a short one, but it generated one superb moment: Cerritos
native Eddie Soto dribbling through the Seattle Sounders' defense,
then rolling the ball under goalkeeper Dusty Hudock and into the
net. That bit of brilliance gave the Zodiac an early lead, but it
wouldn't last; the Sounders got goals from Peter Hattrup and Dick
McCormick, the last a 76th-minute penalty kick, to knock O.C. out.
</P>
<P>
   - Mia Hamm, who moved within one goal of 100 in the U.S. women's
team's 9-0 romp over Mexico in Saturday's U.S. Women's Cup opener,
has always had high standards, sometimes ridiculously so. Consider
her comments after scoring twice and assisting on four other goals
against the Mexicans: ``I think I struggled. I didn't think that I
was mentally focused. We had a hard week of practice, and I was
physically drained. That was my fault. I missed way too many
opportunities to put the ball away.'' She can make amends Friday
against Russia in Rochester, N.Y., and Sunday against Brazil in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   - USC and UCLA's heated rivalry has carried over to women's
soccer, not in the least because of Troy's refusal (following
Pac-10 inter-conference transfer rules) to allow UCLA (and former
Trojan) defender Rhi Tanaka a fourth year of eligibility. But the
Bruins and Women of Troy will get together this weekend for a
superb pair of doubleheaders. No.11 Nebraska and 25th-ranked Baylor
are in town for USC's Fila Challenge. The action kicks off at
UCLA's Spaulding Field on Sunday, with USC taking on Baylor at 6
p.m. and the Bruins hooking up with the Cornhuskers at 8. On
Sunday, they head to the Coliseum and switch opponents, with UCLA
playing at 11 a.m. and the Women of Troy at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   - The European Champions League kicks off today, and we get a
biggie: Inter Milan, with Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio, takes on
reigning champion Real Madrid, with Roberto Carlos and Davor Suker,
in a Group C clash at Seville. ESPN2 will carry the clash at 11:30
a.m.

IN CONNECTICUT, DEMOCRATS GET THEIR BALANCED TICKET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Denise L. Nappier won the Democratic Party
nomination for Connecticut treasurer on Tuesday, much to the relief
of party leaders who had feared that without a minority candidate
like her, Democrats would wind up with an all-white slate in a year
that the Republican ticket includes three minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier, who is black, seemed well aware of those concerns
as she spoke to a multiracial crowd at her victory party on Tuesday
night. ``What we have is a slate of candidates that reflects the
face of Connecticut,'' said Ms. Nappier, who is treasurer of the
City of Hartford. ``Ain't no stopping us now.''
</P>
<P>
   She defeated Frank A. Lecce, a securities broker from West
Hartford who outspent Ms. Nappier and won the support from some
old-guard Democratic leaders who objected to what they saw as a
quota system for the party's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's other statewide race was between two state
representatives seeking the Democratic nomination for secretary of
the state. As of 10 p.m., Susan Bysiewicz of Middletown had a lead
over Ellen Scalettar of Woodbridge, who had been endorsed at the
party convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier also had won the party's endorsement at the
convention, although by a narrow margin, but Lecce immediately
began working on the primary election. In fact, in both statewide
races, the candidates running without the party's endorsement
bought advertisements on television, while the two endorsed
candidates could not afford to, and instead depended on local
Democratic workers.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was open only to registered Democrats, who make up
about 700,000 of the state's approximately 2 million registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor, Barbara B. Kennelly,
threw her support to Ms. Nappier after Gov. John Rowland began
boasting about the diversity of the Republicans' slate of statewide
candidates, which includes two African-American men and a Hispanic
woman.
</P>
<P>
   With some Democratic officials playing down the importance of a
racially diverse ticket, black leaders within the party formed a
Connecticut African-American Democratic Organization that they said
would stay in business to promote black candidates in the future.
The group's chairman, Maurice B. Mosley, a former state
representative from Waterbury, suggested on Tuesday the depth of
the rift that developed between black leaders and the party
establishment over the possibility of an all-white ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever gives up power _ you have to take it,'' Mosley
said. ``But we are at our best when we're down _ when we're
slapped, when we're kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. William R. Dyson, a Democrat from New Haven who is
co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee, warned that without a
minority candidate on Mrs. Kennelly's ticket, ``She would not have
credibility with a large segment of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that members of many town committees had not agreed
with him about the gravity of the issue for the party. ``There is a
segment of the population that said, `We've been dwelling on this
long enough,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign appearances, Ms. Nappier stressed her qualifications
and played down the issue of race. ``This is not a campaign about
black and white,'' she said. ``It's about green, and how to get
someone in office who will protect the state's assets and make them
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecce said that he resented the need to constantly answer
questions about diversity on the ticket, noting that he had started
campaigning two years ago and that party leaders could have found
another slot for a black candidate. He told audiences how he had
immigrated from Italy at age 11, and bolstered the point by
displaying the Statue of Liberty on his campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Secretary of the state nomination, Mrs.
Scalettar stressed her endorsement by leading state Democrats,
while Ms. Bysiewicz spent about $100,000 on television ads
featuring her family.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two statewide contests, the other race that drew the
most attention and spending was a four-way contest for the
Democratic nomination to replace Mrs. Kennelly as the U.S.
representative from the 1st Congressional District, which covers
the Hartford area.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, John B. Larson, 50, a former president pro tem of
the state Senate, defeated his main competitor, Miles S. Rapoport
the secretary of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After what had been a low-key campaign, the two front-runners
engaged in a ferocious television battle last weekend. Rapoport,
48, accused Larson of voting to cut services and raise taxes when
he was in the state Senate. Larson said that the advertisements
were a gross distortion of his records. He took ads branding
Rapoport ``desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport, who has built his career as an advocate of campaign
finance reform, defended his ads. ``A close race in the final days
_ you can't be so nice that you're undone,'' he said as he voted on
Tuesday morning. Rapoport offered a last-minute truce in the
television war. Larson, who had accused Rapoport of abandoning his
principles for expediency, refused the offer. ``That's like bombing
Pearl Harbor and then saying, `Oh, never mind,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport won the endorsement of many labor unions, who helped
him field more than 1,000 poll workers and telephone canvassers
today. The other two candidates were James R. McCavanaugh, 58, a
16-year state representative, and Joseph M. Suggs Jr., 58, a former
state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st District is strongly Democratic, so the winner of the
party's nomination generally is assured election in November. But a
Republican candidate, Kevin J. O'Connor, signaled that he planned a
scrappy campaign by buying television ads on Hartford newscasts on
Tuesday night, finishing with the slogan: ``You gotta believe.''

GIBSON GETS DEFENSIVE ABOUT CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even David Gibson admits the temptation to run his
way should crawl into the mind of an opposing offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the slender Gibson of USC, a Mater Dei High graduate,
is a bit undersized - 6-foot-2, 215 pounds for his weakside
linebacker position. Sending a 300-pound lineman to block a
215-pounder seems to make pretty good sense.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Tollner and the San Diego State offense took that approach
on Saturday evening when the Aztecs visited the L.A. Coliseum. San
Diego State directed running back Jonas Lewis toward Gibson on the
Aztecs' first two offensive plays. The result was four yards and
the need for a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved to them early that I could make the play,''
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't, then the final result certainly did. Gibson, who
is a junior, finished with eight solo tackles, three sacks, three
forced fumbles and a fumble recovery to earn Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week honors.
</P>
<P>
   This week's opposing head coach noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Gibson is really playing good football for them,'' said
Oregon State coach Mike Reilly, whose team tangles with USC at the
Coliseum on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's most spectacular play against San Diego State may have
been a five-yard sack of Brian Russell when Gibson missed the
initial tackle, quickly hopped up and chased Russell down before he
could reach the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity at a clean shot and missed,'' Gibson
said. ``There was no way I was letting the guy get away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was another five-yard sack of Russell when Gibson
leaped over an offensive lineman and got back in the backfield so
quickly that running back Larry Ned, in his haste to pick up the
blitz, knocked the ball out of Russell's hands. Gibson, who was
credited with the forced fumble, finished off the play by falling
on the loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just expect Gibby to make plays,'' middle linebacker Chris
Claiborne said. ``He brings to the (weakside) linebacker a lot of
speed. He's very tenacious. It would be terrible not having him on
the field all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson started at the rover safety position in the 1997 season
opener against Florida State but was replaced as the starter by
Antuan Simmons during the next five games. He rarely saw the field
in two of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Gibson said. ``One game you're starting and
everybody's talking about you. The next game you're not even
playing. That's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson came off the bench in the fifth week to make nine tackles
against Arizona State and followed that with a marvelous 13-tackle
performance in a win at Notre Dame. At that point, he became a
starter again and was selected as Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Week after contributing nine tackles, three sacks and two forced
fumbles against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the year with 66 tackles, a team-high 20 tackles for
loss and a Pac-10 best five forced fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the return of a healthy Grant Pearsall, who missed
last season with a knee injury, Gibson was slated to start the year
as a backup strong safety. A few days into the team's fall training
camp at UC Irvine, though, USC Paul Hackett realized, ``We needed
to get them both on the field at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gibson, who is one of the team's biggest hitters, moved
closer to the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fine with me,'' said Gibson. ``It was either split time
with Grant Pearsall or become a linebacker. To tell you the truth,
it's a good spot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a chance to spend more time at the training table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard to stay slim as a safety,'' said Gibson, who
estimates he's added from 5-7 pounds since the position change.
``This allows me to eat more. I used to wake up and not eat
breakfast. Now, it's three meals a day. (Unfortunately) most of it
is in the mid-section.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall had to leave the Purdue game after twisting his knee in
the first quarter and hasn't been back on the field since. While
Ifeanyi Ohalete has filled in nicely at strong safety, Gibson, who
had five solo tackles, two assists and a key fumble recovery in the
victory over Purdue, has been a star at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Gibson is going to make plays,'' linebacker coach Shawn
Slocum said, ``no matter what position he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's happy to be playing linebacker and regularly
mixing it up with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can use my speed to get away from the lineman when I need
to,'' Gibson said. ``But I'm not afraid to come up and smack
someone in the mouth. When they're expecting me to run around them,
I'll come up and smack 'em. That is an advantage for me.''

BELANGER MIGHT MISS UP TO SIX WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During last year's National Hockey League
preseason, the Los Angeles Kings were expecting to take a long look
at young winger Pavel Rosa, who they were hoping would be able to
step in and provide some spark to their offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosa suffered a concussion in an exhibition game, and it
wound up ruining his season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings suffered a similar though less severe setback on their
third day of practice Tuesday, when they lost 20-year-old prospect
Eric Belanger, a fifth-round draft choice two years ago. Belanger,
a playmaking center, suffered a broken left hand that is expected
to sideline him for up to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, one of a number of youngsters given a strong chance of
making the Kings' roster, had 51 points in 56 games last season
playing for Fredericton in the American Hockey League. The injury
occurred when Belanger jammed his hand into the midsection of
another player during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Also ailing are centers Jozef Stumpel (sprained ankle) and Jason
Morgan (knee tendinitis) and winger Dan Bylsma, who is recovering
from foot surgery. None are expected to play when the Kings open
the exhibition season with games against the Colorado Avalanche on
Saturday and Sunday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rosy outlook: The good news for the Kings is that Rosa, 21,
appears to have put his post-concussion syndrome problems behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who the Kings are hoping will prove to be the natural
goal-scorer they need, had 63 goals and 153 points in his final
year of junior hockey two years ago. But last season, he played in
only three minor-league games, two of them with the Long Beach Ice
Dogs of the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to not play hockey for so long,'' said Rosa, who
spent the summer working out in his native Czech Republic. ``I
played hockey for 15 years every day. I didn't want to stop, but I
had to stop. I thought about my health first.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Al Murray, the Kings' director of amateur scouting, ``I
have only seen Pavel Rosa be one of the elite players at every
level he's played at. I don't know if Pavel can play at the NHL
level (this year), but I'm not going to shortchange him. He's a
very focused, self-motivated individual who is used to succeeding,
and he doesn't expect anything less of himself than success.''
</P>
<P>
   __ At a standstill: There was no hint of progress Tuesday in
negotiations with the four unsigned Kings, defensemen Rob Blake and
Aki Berg, goalie Jamie Storr and enforcer Matt Johnson. Among the
Kings' offers to the latter three have been one-year deals with
10-percent raises, which would bump Berg's salary to $467,500,
Storr's to $605,000 and Johnson's to $440,000.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's agent, Larry Kelly of Ottawa, said late Tuesday afternoon
that it's almost certain his client will sign a contract to play
professionally in Europe, possibly late this week. Berg is
scheduled to fly to his native Finland today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost definite in my mind,'' Kelly said. ``We're fed up.
It's unfortunate and absolutely unnecessary.''

HARTMAN HAS EMERGED FROM CAMPOS' SHADOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Kevin Hartman's emergence this season as one
of Major League Soccer's more capable goalkeepers has been
obscured, perhaps, by the brilliance of the Los Angeles Galaxy's
attack, but his play in the nets has plenty to do with why they're
a favorite to capture the MLS crown next month.
</P>
<P>
   The former UCLA standout has provided the backbone for the
Galaxy (22-7, 64 points), who continue their countdown to the
playoffs tonight in San Jose against the last-place Clash (11-18,
27), and if that's a surprise, well what's new?
</P>
<P>
   After a season spent in Jorge Campos' shadow, Hartman, 24, has
performed beyond all expectations this season, but that's just
habit. Everywhere he's played, he's been doubted, and each time
he's demonstrated his worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven a lot this season,'' says Zak Abdel, the Galaxy's
goalkeeping coach and a former netminder for Egypt's national team.
``I told everyone he'd be special. ... He wants to play in England,
and to be honest, I think he's good enough to make it right now. If
he gets a little more experience, he'll be big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit an undying confidence and an unerring work ethic, which
has carried him through difficulties in high school (he was only a
part-time starter at Peninsula in Palos Verdes), in college (he
settled for Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills, then moved to
Westwood to be the Bruins' No.3 'keeper), and leading to the pros
(he had to pay his own way to Umbro's goalkeeping camp, where he
turned heads with his work habits and shot-stopping abilities).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything Kevin's gotten and that he's done with the
Galaxy is attributable to his work ethic, his professional approach
to the game,'' says Sigi Schmid, Hartman's coach at UCLA.
``Everybody gets addicted to Kevin once they see him work. You
know, here's somebody who really wants it. He's constantly had to
prove it, but he's always had the confidence in himself that he can
do it. More than that, he's got the work ethic to build up that
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's led to a sensational sophomore season in MLS, where he
ranks third with a 1.48 goals-against average and first with 20
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kevin came into the league, he was a little
helter-skelter,'' Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano says. ``His natural
ability, I think, carried him a lot through college, it got him
through at that level. When he came into the pros, I think he
realized it's a lot more about control, about being in control and
transmitting and radiating that to your defense and teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   He's added nuance to his game, learned how to manage his defense
and control his box, and he's emerged as another fine goalkeeping
prospect for America's future.
</P>
<P>
   He's not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lacked confidence in myself,'' he says. ``Sometimes
I believe I'm not playing well or I'm not in form, but I've always
had a belief in myself and I always will. I believe I can play at
this level, and I believe there's a level beyond this I can play
at. As I get older and I progress toward the peak of my career, I
hope I find myself there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Galaxy notes: Defender Robin Fraser and midfielder Clint
Mathis will miss tonight's match, serving suspensions for yellow
card accumulation, and midfielder Martin Machon is playing for
Guatemala in an exhibition against a South American all-star team.
It is Machon's first chance to impress new Guatemala coach Lujan
Manera. ... In addition, defender Ezra Hendrickson and midfielder
Wellington Sanchez are slowed by ankle injuries. ... Lawrence
Lozzano, acquired Aug. 7 from San Jose, is expected to make his
Galaxy debut tonight, teaming with Steve Jolley in central defense.
A hamstring injury has sidelined the Cerritos native since June.
... No English-language radio yet: Attorneys for the Galaxy and
One-on-One Sports are poring over contracts, and a deal could be
announced later this week. ... San Jose's faint hopes to reach the
MLS playoffs will die with a loss in any of their last three games.

IN CONNECTICUT, DEMOCRATS GET THEIR BALANCED TICKET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct coding)  By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Denise L. Nappier won the Democratic Party
nomination for Connecticut treasurer on Tuesday, much to the relief
of party leaders who had feared that without a minority candidate
like her, Democrats would wind up with an all-white slate in a year
that the Republican ticket includes three minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier, who is black, seemed well aware of those concerns
as she spoke to a multiracial crowd at her victory party on Tuesday
night. ``What we have is a slate of candidates that reflects the
face of Connecticut,'' said Ms. Nappier, who is treasurer of the
City of Hartford. ``Ain't no stopping us now.''
</P>
<P>
   She defeated Frank A. Lecce, a securities broker from West
Hartford who outspent Ms. Nappier and won the support from some
old-guard Democratic leaders who objected to what they saw as a
quota system for the party's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's other statewide race was between two state
representatives seeking the Democratic nomination for secretary of
the state. As of 10 p.m., Susan Bysiewicz of Middletown had a lead
over Ellen Scalettar of Woodbridge, who had been endorsed at the
party convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier also had won the party's endorsement at the
convention, although by a narrow margin, but Lecce immediately
began working on the primary election. In fact, in both statewide
races, the candidates running without the party's endorsement
bought advertisements on television, while the two endorsed
candidates could not afford to, and instead depended on local
Democratic workers.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was open only to registered Democrats, who make up
about 700,000 of the state's approximately 2 million registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor, Barbara B. Kennelly,
threw her support to Ms. Nappier after Gov. John Rowland began
boasting about the diversity of the Republicans' slate of statewide
candidates, which includes two African-American men and a Hispanic
woman.
</P>
<P>
   With some Democratic officials playing down the importance of a
racially diverse ticket, black leaders within the party formed a
Connecticut African-American Democratic Organization that they said
would stay in business to promote black candidates in the future.
The group's chairman, Maurice B. Mosley, a former state
representative from Waterbury, suggested on Tuesday the depth of
the rift that developed between black leaders and the party
establishment over the possibility of an all-white ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever gives up power _ you have to take it,'' Mosley
said. ``But we are at our best when we're down _ when we're
slapped, when we're kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. William R. Dyson, a Democrat from New Haven who is
co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee, warned that without a
minority candidate on Mrs. Kennelly's ticket, ``She would not have
credibility with a large segment of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that members of many town committees had not agreed
with him about the gravity of the issue for the party. ``There is a
segment of the population that said, `We've been dwelling on this
long enough,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign appearances, Ms. Nappier stressed her qualifications
and played down the issue of race. ``This is not a campaign about
black and white,'' she said. ``It's about green, and how to get
someone in office who will protect the state's assets and make them
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecce said that he resented the need to constantly answer
questions about diversity on the ticket, noting that he had started
campaigning two years ago and that party leaders could have found
another slot for a black candidate. He told audiences how he had
immigrated from Italy at age 11, and bolstered the point by
displaying the Statue of Liberty on his campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Secretary of the state nomination, Mrs.
Scalettar stressed her endorsement by leading state Democrats,
while Ms. Bysiewicz spent about $100,000 on television ads
featuring her family.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two statewide contests, the other race that drew the
most attention and spending was a four-way contest for the
Democratic nomination to replace Mrs. Kennelly as the U.S.
representative from the 1st Congressional District, which covers
the Hartford area.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, John B. Larson, 50, a former president pro tem of
the state Senate, defeated his main competitor, Miles S. Rapoport
the secretary of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After what had been a low-key campaign, the two front-runners
engaged in a ferocious television battle last weekend. Rapoport,
48, accused Larson of voting to cut services and raise taxes when
he was in the state Senate. Larson said that the advertisements
were a gross distortion of his records. He took ads branding
Rapoport ``desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport, who has built his career as an advocate of campaign
finance reform, defended his ads. ``A close race in the final days
_ you can't be so nice that you're undone,'' he said as he voted on
Tuesday morning. Rapoport offered a last-minute truce in the
television war. Larson, who had accused Rapoport of abandoning his
principles for expediency, refused the offer. ``That's like bombing
Pearl Harbor and then saying, `Oh, never mind,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport won the endorsement of many labor unions, who helped
him field more than 1,000 poll workers and telephone canvassers
today. The other two candidates were James R. McCavanaugh, 58, a
16-year state representative, and Joseph M. Suggs Jr., 58, a former
state treasurer.

SPITZER WINS NEW YORK AG RACE; WILL BATTLE VACCO IN NOVEMBER
ELECTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eliot Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer who spent
millions of his own money to finance a campaign for state attorney
general, won the Democratic Party primary nomination on Tuesday,
and will take on the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, in the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer beat back a challenge from three other Democrats: state
Sen. Catherine Abate; G. Oliver Koppell, a former attorney general;
and Evan Davis, a former counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a former Manhattan prosecutor who has never held public
office, showed he was a fierce campaigner and a moderate on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With 71 percent of the precincts reporting, Spitzer received
179,257 votes, or 41 percent. Ms. Abate received 120,731 votes, or
28 percent; Koppell 94,229 votes, or 22 percent; and Davis 39,198
votes, or 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his immense personal wealth, Spitzer was able to
mount the kind of aggressive media campaign that won him the name
recognition that other candidates appeared to lack. He spent about
$3 million in his primary campaign and plans to spend millions more
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's money itself became an issue during the campaign, as
the three other candidates repeatedly accused him of trying to buy
the election. His father is a wealthy Manhattan real estate
developer and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Spitzer, Tuesday's victory was an affirmation of his costly
efforts to rise from political obscurity. In 1994, he spent roughly
$3 million, much of it his own money, in a failed attempt to win
the Democratic nomination for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road to get here,'' he told supporters
gathered on Tuesday night at the Broadway Ballroom at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. ``But tonight, we begin a campaign to
return the majesty and dignity of the attorney general's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's opponent in November, Vacco, was elected attorney
general in 1994, and is widely viewed as the weakest of the
statewide incumbents up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has been accused of undermining the integrity of the
office. Among the complaints are that he fired dozens of lawyers
and replaced them with less experienced ones with ties to the
Republican and Conservative Parties. On at least seven occasions,
his office was criticized for missing filing deadlines and court
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has also come under attack because he resisted joining a
lawsuit that many other states had filed against tobacco companies
to recoup Medicaid dollars they had spent treating tobacco-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually sued, but only after nearly two years of criticism
accusing him of being soft on tobacco companies because they are
major donors to the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, poll after poll indicates that Vacco is
not very well known among many New Yorkers. His challenger will
have the opportunity to conduct an aggressive advertising campaign
intended to define Vacco in the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vacco could prove to be a formidable candidate. He has
more than $3.1 million in his campaign coffers and will no doubt
receive more money from the state party should he need it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has shown a talent for getting good publicity on
a variety of consumer-related issues like cracking down on ticket
scalpers and abuses by health insurers. He may also benefit greatly
from the coattails of the popular Republican governor, George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the race are high. The attorney general's office
has an annual budget of $139 million and a staff of 450 lawyers who
defend the state from hundreds of lawsuits, from charges against
government officials to complaints over accidents on state
property.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for both Vacco and Spitzer will be generating
interest in a race that threatens to be overshadowed by the other
major races, primarily those for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primary, the four Democratic candidates for
attorney general complained that they were having a hard time
getting voters to pay attention, let alone choose a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which there were few ideological differences
between the candidates, the central issue became who had the right
credentials for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a partner at a New York City law firm, founded a
nonprofit group, the Center for the Community Interest, that seeks
to help community organizations combat crime and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate, who represents Manhattan in the state Senate, has run
a number of major agencies, including the city's Probation and
Correction Departments.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a long legal background that includes a Supreme Court
clerkship, work on the House Watergate inquiry, and a partnership
at a large New York City law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell, who represented the Bronx in the state Assembly for 23
years, was selected by his colleagues in 1993 to complete the
unexpired term of Robert Abrams as attorney general, though he was
defeated in his bid for a full term in office.

VALLONE WINS DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trouncing his opponents in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, Peter Vallone, who has spent a
quarter-century on the New York City Council and 12 years as its
leader, propelled himself Tuesday into a far more daunting struggle
against Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a first-term Republican, enjoys widespread popularity
and faces none of the voter unrest that sent scores of incumbents
into retirement in 1994. Vallone, the speaker of the Council, has
less than $1 million left in his campaign treasury, while Pataki,
one of the most prodigious fund-raisers in the nation, has well
over $10 million. And Vallone does not have the Liberal Party
nomination, without which no Democrat has won statewide office in
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate on social issues who preaches fiscal conservatism,
Vallone, 63, is his party's most centrist gubernatorial nominee in
a generation or more, a potential advantage at a time when many
voters have turned away from the left.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the name recognition his primary victory will gain
him, he enters the general election campaign with less stature
statewide than any Democratic gubernatorial nominee since at least
1966. Since then, the party's standard-bearers have been Arthur
Goldberg, a former justice of the Supreme Court, Hugh Carey and
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Such obstacles could not temper Vallone's delight at his
election-night headquarters at the Grand Hyatt hotel in
mid-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really, really good,'' Vallone said in an interview
Tuesday night, an hour after the polls closed. ``What I've been
talking about for over a year, putting New York first again and
jobs and education, has been well received, whether it's in Erie
County or St. Lawrence County or Bronx County.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he faced an uphill fight, and with a tweak
at Pataki's paid speechmaking, challenged the governor to a series
of debates. ``I'd like to see him debate me as often as he gave
these speeches out of state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters leaving the polls indicated that Vallone
had taken three-fifths of the vote, to one-fifth for Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross. Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, and
James Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner, finished
a distant third and fourth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross conceded defeat in an interview within minutes of
the polls' closing Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that my supporters and I have been
able to do in this race is to define the agenda, to identify the
issues that will be the focus of this gubernatorial campaign,'' she
said. In particular, she cited her calls for improved schools and
expanded kindergarten and prekindergarten education.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was ``no question'' she would continue
campaigning as the nominee of the Liberal Party. Many of the
Democrats who were working for her campaign planned to abandon it
if she lost the primary, rather than risk being blackballed from
party politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross never managed to shake off the unsavory images
left by her unorthodox history in politics, or her well-publicized
money troubles in the stretch run. Her campaign was also hobbled by
a dissension that saw several top officials depart.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lieutenant governor's campaign began to fade in
midsummer, Vallone was left with no real competition.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to seize the interest of voters who seemed either
distracted from the contest or bored by it, McCaughey Ross turned
in the final week to attacking Vallone, questioning his commitment
to abortion rights and education.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary for lieutenant governor, Sandra Frankel, a town
supervisor from the Rochester area, easily bested Charlie King, a
Manhattan lawyer, and Clyde Rabideau, the mayor of Plattsburg, whom
Vallone had tapped as his preferred choice. Ms. Frankel had 52
percent of the vote to 32 percent for King and 16 percent for
Rabideau.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's victory was strikingly broad, cutting across all
divisions of race, sex, age, income, education, religion, region
and political beliefs. Exit polls indicated that he even defeated
McCaughey Ross by almost 2-1 in upstate New York, a region where he
was virtually unknown six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Council speaker may actually be better known than Pataki was
at this time four years ago, when he was a first-term state
senator. But Vallone lacks a crucial advantage Pataki had in 1994:
the backing of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who helped his fellow
Republican raise $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone carries into the seven-week general election campaign
the burden of the assumption, shared even by many in the party,
that the governor is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   That pessimism has hung like a pall over the Democratic side of
the race from the start. Last year, the two Democrats who were
viewed as the strongest potential challengers to Pataki bowed out,
Rep. Charles Schumer to run for Senate and State Comptroller H.
Carl McCall to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against Pataki could be further complicated by the
presence of two well-known, minor-party candidates on the Nov. 3
ballot who could splinter the anti-Pataki vote. McCaughey Ross is
the Liberal Party nominee, and B. Thomas Golisano, a wealthy
Rochester businessman, is running for the second time on the
Independence Party line.
</P>
<P>
   The contest has stirred great interest only through the
soap-operatic travails of McCaughey Ross, Pataki's one-time
protegee, who engaged in a highly public feud with him and who
switched only last year from Republican to Democrat. Throughout the
primary contest, the three other candidates have questioned the
sincerity of her conversion and her positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, she confirmed what Democrats had long suspected,
that her husband, Wilbur Ross, an investment banker, would not
provide anywhere near the $10 million for her campaign that she had
predicted. Ross withdrew half the $4 million he had given to her
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ross, who has had little to say publicly about the
matter, released a terse statement saying, ``My office has received
a number of phone calls from reporters today, so I wanted to let
members of the media know that I voted for Betsy today prior to
going out of state on a business trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, a lifelong resident of Astoria, Queens, has spent most
of his years in and around city politics. The son of a judge, he
was a lawyer in private practice, ran for Congress in 1972 _ his
only electoral loss _ and was elected to the City Council in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, he has been chief of the Council, the
second-most-powerful post in city government. Through much of the
year, even as polls showed McCaughey Ross leading, Vallone largely
ignored her, confident that voters would conclude that he was the
only viable Democratic candidate. Primary voters may have got the
message; in exit polls, they overwhelmingly chose him as the
Democrat with the best chance of beating

SCHUMER BEATS FERRARO IN SENATE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to reflect that Schumer has definitely won, and for general
refinements) (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``a'' news file) 
(th) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Schumer, a nine-term Brooklyn congressman who
had never before run for office outside his Park Slope
neighborhood, won the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato on Tuesday night, overwhelming Geraldine Ferraro in
her second attempt to return to public office.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, reaping the fruits of a decade of fund-raising and a
campaign marked by rigorous discipline and ceaseless television
advertising, easily defeated both Ferraro and the third major
candidate, New York City Public Advocate Mark Green. The scope of
Schumer's victory showed strength that crossed geographic, sex and
ethnic lines, and suggested that he had gone some distance in
erasing doubts many Democrats once said they had about his
viability as a challenger to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The results also appeared to signal an end to one of the most
notable political careers of the last 20 years. Ferraro, the 1984
Democratic vice presidential nominee, had said she decided to run
for the Senate again this time largely because she felt she had
been unfairly deprived of the 1992 Senate nomination, because of
unfair attacks on her ethics. Ferraro was spared such treatment
this time, yet a voter survey conducted by Edison Media Research
suggested that she was losing by a far larger margin this time than
in 1992, when she was defeated by just under 11,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's victory came on a day of notably low voter turnout,
reflecting an absence of interest in the contests.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic primary voters also chose New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone to challenge Gov. George Pataki, in a primary
that turned out to be far less competitive than had been expected,
according to interviews with voters. Vallone easily defeated three
candidates, including Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the former
Republican running in a Democratic primary for the first time. Ms.
McCaughey Ross' name will still appear on the Liberal Party line in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is heavily favored, both because he has raised a huge
amount of money, more than $15 million as of July, and because Ms.
McCaughey, who pledged Tuesday night to campaign aggressively on
the Liberal Party line, is apt to split the anti-Pataki vote.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's opponents called to concede even before the final
results were tallied. Green called Schumer at 9:02 Tuesday night,
and Ferraro conceded at 9:34, Schumer's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, in the prepared text of his acceptance speech, signaled
that after a primary in which he avoided attacks on his opponents,
he intended to run aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned one thing in his last 18 years in the Senate,
it is that Al D'Amato has been there too long,'' Schumer said.
``You just can't trust him to do the right thing, and New Yorkers
deserve a senator we can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schumer's remarks suggested, the outcome of the Senate vote
sets the stage for what is almost sure to be one of the most
ferociously fought races in the country this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and D'Amato are both known in Washington as streetwise,
ambitious politicians who share talents for raising money, getting
publicity and assailing their opponents. Schumer has spent much of
this decade quietly preparing himself for the statewide stage, and
D'Amato, facing what polls have long suggested would be a difficult
bid for a fourth term, has been preparing for this re-election
almost from the moment he won his third term in 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even before the polls were closed Tuesday, Schumer's media
consultant, Hank Morris, was in a television editing booth,
producing advertisements directed at D'Amato that will be broadcast
in the next two days. And even before Schumer had made his way out
to declare victory Tuesday night, the D'Amato campaign issued a
withering statement reprising what has been the senator's standard
attack on Democratic candidates: that they are too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the Democratic Party has nominated the most
left-of-center candidate they could,'' said D'Amato's campaign
manager, Jon Lerner. ``In November, the voters will have a clear
choice between Chuck Schumer, who believes in old-style
tax-and-spend liberalism, and Al D'Amato, who has a proven record
of fighting for the forgotten middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   In other statewide races, Sandra Frankel, a town supervisor from
a suburb of Rochester, was leading in the race to run with Vallone
as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. And Eliot
Spitzer, a lawyer who used his family fortune to finance a campaign
that was also heavy on television advertising, was leading in the
nomination for state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 primary shaped up as a sharp setback for women who have
been seeking to break into the upper ranks of New York state
government. Earlier this year, it seemed that the Democrats might
have three women on the statewide ticket: Ms. Ferraro for senator,
Ms. McCaughey Ross for governor and Catherine Abate for attorney
general. It now appears that there will be only two women running
for statewide office. Ms. Frankel and Mary Donohue, a Republican,
will oppose each other for lieutenant governor, a position of
virtually no importance in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Ms. McCaughey Ross explicitly presented their
candidacies as appeals for women to gain political stature in New
York, a state that has never elected a woman as senator or
governor. ``If they turn out, I win this,'' Ferraro said of women
during a last campaign appearance Tuesday. But voter surveys found
that most women disregarded those appeals, voting instead for
Schumer and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The contest to challenge D'Amato was remarkable for its lack of
open conflict, as the candidates avoided the kind of exchanges that
characterized the 1992 primary. One benefit of the decorous race
will become clear Wednesday morning, when all three Democratic
Senate candidates are to appear at a breakfast together with state
party chairwoman Judith Hope. In 1992, by contrast, Ms. Ferraro did
not endorse the Democratic candidate, Robert Abrams, until the last
week of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's strong performance was a clear tribute to the
influence of money on American politics today. Schumer, who is a
member of the House Banking Committee, raised $13 million for the
race, more than five times as much as either Ferraro or Green. The
benefits of Schumer's fund-raising could be seen on television
stations across the state: an advertising campaign that began at
the start of the year and built to a crescendo in the final two
weeks of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The television ads proved to be particularly significant this
year because of the chronic lack of attention paid to the race by
the New York media. The candidates often found themselves giving
major speeches or press conferences with only a single television
camera in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro on Tuesday characterized the contest as a ``a fight
between money power and people power.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ferraro and Green blamed their losses, to a large extent,
on Schumer's formidable fund-raising advantage. For his part,
Schumer implicitly pointed to his campaign bankroll as evidence
that he would be able to mount the challenge to D'Amato that Abrams
had failed to make.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after the 1992 Democratic primary, Abrams
immediately began trying to raise money, while D'Amato's aides
headed for television stations, where they bought time to broadcast
a flood of ads attacking Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of voters leaving the polls suggested some areas of
strength for Schumer. Schumer defeated Ms. Ferraro among female
voters, a critical New York constituency that D'Amato has
aggressively courted for much of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer received about 40 percent of the upstate vote, an area
where the Brooklyn Democrat was assumed to be weak, and where
D'Amato must do well to win a fourth term. Similarly, Schumer, who
is Jewish, received about 40 percent of the Roman Catholic vote,
another constituency at the heart of D'Amato's base.

PRIMARY DAY POLL: HOW IT WAS DONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-ELECT) 
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Primary Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by
voters as they left voting stations throughout New York state on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The results are based on 1,490 Democratic primary voters,
located in 50 randomly selected precincts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls
should differ by no more than 4 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to
interview all Democratic primary voters who turned out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential
sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical
difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Primary
Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take the time to fill
out the questionnaires, may introduce other sources of error into
the poll.

QB PAIN REIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He bounced around professional football for a decade before
signing a free-agent contract with his current team a year ago. He
has never played in a Super Bowl. He started one game last season.
</P>
<P>
   He is smaller than most quarterbacks though probably smarter,
and if he makes a lasting mark on the sport, he will do it as a
coach or executive.
</P>
<P>
   He gets by on a detailed knowledge of the playbook and a
dependable if unspectacular arm. He won't throw it to the other
team too often. He won't throw it 70 yards in the air either.
</P>
<P>
   He is the average backup quarterback. And, be he ever so humble,
this season he is the most valuable player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two weeks, big-name starters were bruised, broken,
torn, sprained, strained and brained at the most alarming rate
since the alarming rate of !ital!last!off! September.
</P>
<P>
   And in their place, nameless, faceless, graceless second
stringers have shucked their clipboards and NFL Properties baseball
caps and tried to keep playoff hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 12 backup quarterbacks have seen action because of
injuries, and they're a more varied bunch than our ``average''
would suggest. There are aging former starters: Randall Cunningham,
who directed Minnesota's winning touchdown drive at St. Louis on
Sunday, and Dave Krieg, who earned the save in Tennessee's opening
victory at Cincinnati, and Bubby Brister (Denver), John Friesz
(Seattle), Rich Gannon (Kansas City) and Steve Walsh (Tampa Bay).
There are young guys eager for a shot: Danny Wuerffel, who survived
the Carolina rush to lead New Orleans to a second straight victory,
and Trent Green (Washington), Eric Zeier (Baltimore), Jason Garrett
(Dallas) and Donald Hollas (Oakland). And there's Doug Flutie, who
nearly pulled out a victory for Buffalo at San Diego in his return
from the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are proving that as long as quarterback injuries
seem to be unpreventable, an NFL team had better have something in
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for personnel people and coaches is the same''
from year to year, Randy Cross, the former UCLA and San Francisco
49ers lineman who is now a network analyst, said from his home in
Georgia. ``This just emphasizes the need to have a guy on the bench
who knows your system.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Year of the Quarterback only in the medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   One quarterback's season ended late in the opening game: New
Orleans' Billy Joe Hobert (torn right Achilles' tendon).
</P>
<P>
   Two are expected to miss as much as half the season after
hurting themselves Sunday: Dallas' Aikman (broken left collarbone)
and Minnesota's Brad Johnson (broken right leg).
</P>
<P>
   Two were injured in week 1 and sat out week 2: Kansas City's
Elvis Grbac (sprained right shoulder) and Washington's Gus Frerotte
(sprained left shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   Five were injured in week 1 and returned to action in week 2:
Oakland's Jeff George (hyperextended left elbow), Tampa Bay's Trent
Dilfer (bruised right thigh), Tennessee's Steve McNair (bruised
right elbow), Buffalo's Rob Johnson (concussion) and Baltimore's
Jim Harbaugh (broken right ring finger).
</P>
<P>
   And two quarterbacks could join the casualty list in week 3
after getting hurt in week 2: Denver's John Elway (strained right
hamstring) and Philadelphia's Bobby Hoying (sprained right knee).
As of Tuesday, each planned to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL office wants you to think this is nothing unusual. It
reports that 26 of the 30 teams had the same starting quarterback
in games 1 and 2, the same number as the first two weeks of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime quarterbacks get hurt, somebody wants to write a story
declaring a trend,'' said Greg Aiello, the NFL's vice president of
communications. ``We could show you stories people wrote 20 years
ago about the quarterback being an endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL's accounting of injury-related substitutions doesn't
count Washington's, even though it was Frerotte's injury that gave
Green the chance to outperform him and win the start Monday night.
And it overlooks the fact the 12 teams that have been forced to use
backup quarterbacks in '98 are two more than in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The consistency of the problem only goes to show it's
unsolvable. A series of rule changes in recent years, banning head
hunting, defining late hits and liberalizing the grounding-the-ball
rule, have failed to make the world of faster, stronger
pass-rushers safe for quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   What can possibly be done to help a quarterback running for
extra yardage instead of sliding down (Aikman), hitting his passing
hand on a rusher (Harbaugh), rolling out, untouched (Elway), or
fading back, untouched (Hobert)? The only ``preventable'' injury in
the first two weeks was Brad Johnson's; the play should have been
whistled dead after a Minnesota lineman's false start.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Sign the best backup you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Which was easier before free agency and salary caps, when Miami
could back up Bob Griese with Earl Morrall, and Dan Marino with Don
Strock, and San Francisco could have future Hall of Famers Joe
Montana and Steve Young in the same locker room. Now, a
second-stringer makes one (1) solid start, as Rob Johnson did for
Jacksonville last year, and somebody else wants to pay him $25
million to start.
</P>
<P>
   It was Buffalo that traded for Johnson and paid him all that
money last summer. And you know what the Bills also did last
summer? They signed Flutie as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when you can't be safe, you don't want to be sorry.

AIKMAN SAYS PAIN PERSISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said yesterday
that his broken left collarbone continues to cause him considerable
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who will miss a minimum of four games because of the
injury sustained Sunday in a loss to the Denver Broncos, no longer
wears a sling on his left arm but continues to be limited in what
he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said his rehabilitation includes treatment with an
electric stimulant on his collarbone 20 minutes a day and walking
on a treadmill; he said jogging causes too much discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   While coach Chan Gailey speculated about Aikman being able to
hand the ball off in three weeks and possibly be ready to play in
four, Aikman refused to give a timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been optimistic,'' Aikman said. ``But I don't want
to back myself into a corner when I will be back. But eight weeks
is on the long end of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors have predicted Aikman to be out four to eight
weeks, though the bone could be healed in six weeks. Aikman said if
he returns sooner than six weeks, padding will probably be used to
try to protect the shoulder. &QL; 
MEDIOCRITY STIRS HOPE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite Aikman's injury, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said his
team's goal of reaching the playoffs remains intact because of the
mediocre play in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Giants stand at 1-1, while the Eagles and
Cardinals are 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who says the division race is up for grabs because the
other opponents don't have an established quarterback, said the key
for the Cowboys is staying competitive until Aikman returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's up for grabs if you look at the quarterbacks,''
Jones said. ``The teams that are established at quarterback have
the ability to make an offense go.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gailey says he is focused only on his team, he has
noticed the problems of his NFC East rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to wish bad on anybody, but if they wanted to
continue to do that, that suits me fine,'' Gailey said. &QL; 
NOT SEEKING DEPTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's absence will not force the team to sign a third
quarterback, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, Jones said, believe that Aikman will return in four
to five weeks. Furthermore, the team has confidence that Jason
Garrett and second-year man Mike Quinn can do the job, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have other options on the team to be the emergency
quarterback, however, neither Jones nor Gailey would divulge which
player the Cowboys were thinking about using.
</P>
<P>
   The list of candidates likely includes wide receiver-tight end
Eric Bjornson, who played quarterback in college for the University
of Washington. Other players who have experience at quarterback are
wide receiver Billy Davis and cornerback Deion Sanders; both played
quarterback in high school.

ASTROS' DIM METS' WILD-CARD HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For two games in a row, the New York Mets rallied here
on ninth-inning home runs to stay alive in games crucial to the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, they went on to beat the Houston Astros in 13
innings, and when Chicago lost later that night the Mets and Cubs
were tied for the wild card. But Tuesday, in the first game of a
doubleheader, it was Houston's turn, as the Astros hit a pair of
extra-inning home runs in a 6-5 12-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   The first, by Jeff Bagwell in the bottom of the 11th, erased the
lead Carlos Baerga and Rey Ordonez had given the Mets with
back-to-back doubles in the top of the inning. The second, by Derek
Bell leading off the 12th, gave Houston a franchise-record 97
victories and left the Mets a half-game behind the Cubs with both
teams scheduled to play later Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have played two tough games here yesterday and today,''
said John Franco, who gave up Bagwell's home run. ``At least
everyone knows we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets and Astros played as significant a series
here was October 1986, in perhaps the greatest National League
championship series ever.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the stakes are a little lower for the Astros,
who clinched the NL Central on Monday night. But they are not
necessarily lower for the Mets, and the last two days have been
eerily reminiscent of the sixth game of that 1986 series, when the
Mets outlasted the Astros in 16 innings to advance to the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mets are trying to advance to the post-season for the
first time in a decade. And for the second consecutive game in the
Astrodome, they rallied from a 4-2 deficit with a two-run
ninth-inning home run to force extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the big hit was by Carlos Baerga, whose dramatic shot
came off of Scott Elarton. And in the bottom of the ninth, the
rookie Jay Payton, who has had his elbow rebuilt twice, made a
perfect one-hop throw from left field to Todd Hundley to cut down
Tim Bogar at the plate with the potential winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell came on to bail the Mets out of further trouble in
that inning. Baerga, who had been in a terrible slump, doubled to
left center with two out in the top of the 11th for his fourth hit
of the game. And when Ordonez, who in the second inning had hit his
first homer since Sept. 2, 1997, followed with a run-scoring double
to right-center field, it looked as if the Mets were headed for
their second improbable comeback victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   All they needed was three outs. But Franco, who had closed out
Monday night's victory for his franchise-record 37th save,
surrendered a lead-off home run to Jeff Bagwell on his fourth pitch
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get the ball in on Bagwell and it sunk away,'' said
Franco, who had converted 16 straight saves since the last time he
failed, on Aug. 4. ``And he's a low-ball hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who warmed up in the bullpen three times today and three
times Monday, added, ``I just missed my location, and it may have
come from a little bit of a tired arm.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Franco eventually struck out Carl Everett with runners on first
and third to end the 11th. But when Bell led off the bottom of the
12th by belting a full-count pitch from the rookie right-hander
Jeff Tam, the Mets faced the second game Tuesday night knowing had
fallen behind the Cubs, if only for a few hours, in the post-season
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ball game,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said
between games. ``It was a really good one. A good hitter got a home
run off a good pitcher. We did everything we could.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could remember the last time Baerga had delivered as
meaningful a hit. Actually, no one could recall Baerga's last
significant hit at all.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman's average had shriveled to .266 before the
game from .292 on Aug. 6. On Monday night, Valentine had pinch-hit
for the switch-hitting Baerga _ who is better from the left side _
with the left-handed hitting Matt Franco in a close game, something
Valentine would probably not have done earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Baerga standing in against the right-handed Elarton
with one out and one on in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga had singled off Shane Reynolds with two out in the second
and scored on Ordonez's shot to left, which snapped a streak of 527
homerless at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Like Baerga, Ordonez, who has now homered once in each of his
first three major league seasons, was due. And the shortstop's
blast gave the Mets a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga nearly gave the Mets a two-run lead when he grounded a
shot toward the hole between short and third with Lenny Harris on
second and two out in the fourth. But the ball hit Harris in the
right foot, and Harris was automatically out.
</P>
<P>
   That came back to haunt the Mets in the bottom of the fourth
when Armando Reynoso bounced a pair of wild pitches off Hundley,
which led to a pair of Houston runs, giving the Astros a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell singled past a diving Ordonez for a two-out insurance
run off Greg McMichael in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But then Monday's hero, Brian McRae, drew a walk off the
6-foot-8-inch Elarton. Harris followed with a fielder's choice
grounder but beat the relay to keep the Mets alive.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Baerga, who lined his sixth homer of the season into
the right-field corner, setting the stage for Bagwell and Bell.

MODANO, HULL AND LEHTINEN ON TWO-WAY STREET FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _Through the mundane workings of a 50-player NHL
training camp, the trio of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen shines like an Eric Clapton guitar solo at a high school
talent show.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the Stars' sometimes cattlelike workouts, it's easy
to discern the dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy cow,'' center Brian Skrudland said. ``You can sure tell
when they step on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars' deadliest offensive line has yet to score a
goal in the first two days of scrimmage action at training camp,
the Modano-Hull-Lehtinen combination has been making slick breakout
moves, finding each other with no-look passes and tossing some
pucks blindly into areas of the ice just in time for a linemate to
outrace a defender for possession.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the trio has been a burst of playmaking electricity on
a team that has a history of doing things the simple way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong chemistry on finding each other, on getting
open,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It's really evident.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the chemistry might be potent, Hitchcock isn't
about to crown the triumvirate the NHL's top scoring line. Instead,
the Stars' coach is warning that the line has to find its niche as
a combination of great offense with great defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano has to be our best checking center iceman,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He has to go out and play against the other team's best
players, match their intensity level and be prepared to outplay
them. And not just offensively, but defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation, of course, is to wind them up and turn them
loose. After all, Hull, who was a free-agent pickup in the summer,
has averaged 55 goals a season throughout his career, Modano was
ranked this year as the No. 8 player in the NHL by ``The Hockey
News'' and Lehtinen is last year's winner of the Selke Trophy for
top defensive forward in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they can work this two-way hockey thing out for
themselves, can't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford for Mike to get away from'' his defensive
role, Hitchcock said. ``We've had discussions with him and
discussions with Hull.''
</P>
<P>
   And both say they are on board. Modano swears by his new status
as a player who emphasizes defense as much as offense. It's that
change that has catapulted him to his high standing in the NHL. In
the seven seasons before Hitchcock installed him as a defensive
demon, Modano carried a career minus-34 ranking _ meaning that when
he was on the ice, there were 34 more even-strength goals scored
against his team than his team scored.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two seasons under Hitchcock's plan, Modano is a plus
68.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system works,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull also is buying in. He's bucking his reputation as a
defensively deficient player by working hard on both sides of the
ice in training camp. Hitchcock even was so bold as to call Hull
``one of the best forecheckers in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Hitch was a smart coach,'' Hull said with a
laugh. ``Honestly, forechecking is just part of the game, and I've
always done it.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the chemistry is there and all three players are on board
with Hitchcock's philosophy to play them against the other team's
top offensive players, what can be accomplished in training camp?
Let's start the regular season, already.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be fun to watch, and who knows how good they
can be,'' said Skrudland, a checking-line center who has seen his
share of offensively talented lines. ``And the funnest part is that
I'm not on the other team.''
