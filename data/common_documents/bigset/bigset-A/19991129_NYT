KITNA FINALLY CRACKS UNDER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A few weeks ago, the Seahawks trekked to Green Bay and
had a pretty fun night watching a guy named Brett Farve make a mess
out of a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Wild. Under pressure. A little over-amped to prove he was still
a great quarterback even without the guidance of his old coach and
mentor, Mike Holmgren, Favre threw four interceptions and came
unraveled as the faithful Cheeseheads at Lambeau Field watched,
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the former Super Bowl MVP suffered the indignity of
seeing a no-name, former NFL Europe kid named Jon Kitna execute a
perfectly professional effort to lead the rising Hawks to a strong,
impressive ``Monday Night Football'' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sunday, it was Jon Kitna's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was for real and the charmed life of this extremely
likeable young quarterback was more frog than prince, more pumpkin
than chariot.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young quarterback, it was a pretty harsh lesson,''
Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said after the 16-3 offensive
Hindenberg in which Kitna threw five interceptions and lost one
fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kitna has too much drive, too much talent, too much
eagerness to learn to be suddenly viewed as a Cinderella. His best
days are still ahead _ maybe as far ahead as next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it is simply a mixed blessing, getting a reputation
for being a crucial cog on an improving football team.
</P>
<P>
   With a legion of Seahawks fans stuffed into the Kingdome to
confirm for themselves that these Hawks are playoff-ready, the
Buccaneers showed what it means to be a marked man in the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a good quarterback, make no mistake about it,''
Warren Sapp, Tampa Bay's outstanding tackle, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in here and only throw (as few picks as Kitna
had so far this season) you can play,'' he added. ``We just did
some things today to get him out of his rhythm. That's what we
wanted to do. We didn't want him to get comfortable throwing the
ball to Joey (Galloway) and (Derrick) Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept cracking the routes, trying to put pressure on
him and we got a couple of good rushes on him. Whenever you turn
the ball over six times, it's tough. We know because we've done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in what the Bucs did to Kitna and the Hawks _
smacking them with a loss that proved for certain that the Bucs are
a super defensive team and that Kitna and the Seahawks will use a
few more tires to screech around those daunting learning curves.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that despite a series of games since Green Bay
in which Kitna has seemed to press and the Seahawks offense has
quivered, Seattle ran off a five-game win streak and still holds an
8-3 record and first place in the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Denver tried to do to Kitna what Tampa Bay did Sunday. The
Broncos' entire game plan was about making Kitna beat them. In
fact, Mike Shanahan dared Kitna to beat them by stacking the run
defense on Ricky Watters, holding him to 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But on that afternoon, Kitna found just enough out there to pick
apart the Broncos secondary, move the ball and gain 20-17 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, too, ganged up on Kitna. The pressure was there and
Kitna looked as if he was pressing to get things done, but Watters
pulled out a huge game _ opening up the offense just enough for
Kitna to find a few big passing plays to Watters and Sean Dawkins
for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay, unlike Denver and Kansas City, had exactly the
right mix of talent, motivation and game plan to make sure that
Kitna did not succeed _ which explains the rash of interceptions
and the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever accolades Holmgren deserves for pushing the Seahawks to
this new level of respectability, Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy is a
pro, too _ not caring one bit that the Tampa offense is ugly and
that everything the Bucs do is about their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy's method was just too advanced for Kitna _ not that the QB
shied away from reprimands and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches talked all week about how our backs are going to
touch a lot of balls this week. (The coaches told me the Bucs were)
going to drop coverage. They're going to play soft. You're not
going to be able to throw the ball down field,'' Kitna said. ``On
those (first two interceptions) I just tried to make a play when
maybe there wasn't a play there. (I should have) hit the back,
maybe see what he can do. I just got a little greedy maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   With confessions like this, Kitna re-invests faith in himself _
an openness and willingness to persevere that will serve him and
his team well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is always tough on me,'' Kitna said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be tough on the quarterback. The quarterback has
to play well for you to win. I didn't do that today. I'm sure it
will be a humbling experience when I have to watch that film, as
it's humbling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the great thing about this league, we ain't got much time
to think about it. We'll learn from it. I'll learn from it. I
really feel I learn well from adverse situations, when things don't
go quite how I expect them to go. I'll be humble. I'll go in there
and take my lumps and apologize to my teammates for the way I
played today and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kitna's performance made the Seahawks' offense look uglier
than Tampa Bay's _ an oddly impressive accomplishment. But so far,
Kitna and the Hawks have supplied no reason to doubt that from this
egg, something better can arise.

LUCK RUNS OUT FOR KITNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He had become the Seahawks poster boy, the big-game
television promo, the local car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Jon Kitna got pulled down by the tacks, pre-empted by
Warren Sapp and taken for a test drive on his most trying day as a
starting NFL quarterback _ a five-interception, three-sack,
two-fumble shortfall in a 16-3 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Kitna had led a charmed life in his brief stay in
the pros. He had avoided adversity as he would one of those
300-pounders trying to take his head off. He had averaged less than
a pass theft and just 1{ sacks per game in 18 outings.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp and his overeager defensive cronies changed all that,
forcing the Central Washington University alum into a spate of
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Facing postgame inquisitors, Kitna recognized all this. He
accepted the blame. He also didn't seem too shaken by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll apologize to my teammates and move on,'' he said. ``I
just got a little greedy, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna started out against the Bucs as if he might be headed for
a career day. He connected on his first three passes. He drove his
club to the Tampa Bay 5 on the initial series, settling for a field
goal and what would be the Seahawks' only points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs had all the answers after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just a little confusion when the game
started,'' Seahawks tight end Christian Fauria said. ``We did a lot
of checking off that put us in positions we shouldn't have been in.
We usually correct those things. I was waiting for something to
happen where we got rolling, but we never got rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Said offensive guard Brian Habib, ``Jon got some pressure on
him. He might have made some bad throws out there, but I think we
all contributed to it. I don't think we helped him too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown knew what happened. He has been
on the delivery end of this sort of thing with opposing
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely feel for him,'' Brown said of Kitna. ``I'm
sure eventually he started pressing. You think you feel the rush
and you throw off the back foot and you just kind of lose what
makes you good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the interceptions piled up, Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren
said he never once considered pulling Kitna in favor of backup
quarterback Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren mentioned that veteran Miami quarterback Dan Marino, a
certain Hall of Famer once he retires, suffered through a
five-interception outing on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young quarterback, it was a harsh lesson,'' Holmgren
said. ``But I think it will be a lesson that he looks at and is
better because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his five misguided throws, Kitna insists he made a bad choice
on just one _ the second ball, a second-quarter toss over the
middle intended for Fauria, and intercepted by Bucs linebacker
Derrick Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second interception, that was a force and a press,'' Kitna
said. ``On the other ones, when you get down everybody knows you're
throwing and you have to try to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Brooks victimized him, Kitna had tried to find Joey
Galloway on a slant pattern and Bucs cornerback Donnie Abraham came
up with the ball early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay linebacker Alshemond Singleton and cornerbacks Ronde
Barber and Brian Kelly also had interceptions, while Sapp and
Brooks forced Kitna fumbles. Rubbing it in, Sapp did a little dance
after he created his turnover, holding the ball aloft while the
Kingdome crowd booed him. Sapp also was seen yapping at the
Seahawks quarterback after several plays.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna said he never got frustrated by his miscues or rattled by
Sapp's monologue.
</P>
<P>
   After the final gun had sounded, Kitna would take one more
blind-side hit before reaching the safety of his locker room. Of
course, it was Sapp. The oversize player ran down Kitna near the
Kingdome's south end zone and put him in a bearhug.
</P>
<P>
   The players exchanged good-natured words before heading to their
respective stadium corners. The healing process already had begun
for the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Maybe we'll see you in January,''' Kitna said,
referring to a possible Super Bowl game. ``He said, `If you got the
(stuff).' I said, `We got the (stuff).' ''

DRIVERS WHO KILL GET OWN TASTE OF NO MERCY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gregory Francis Schmidt could spend 25 years behind
bars for not controlling his anger when a truck cut him off on the
freeway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of handling it as a daily irritation on a Phoenix-area
freeway, Schmidt squeezed off eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Gillis Champagne, 21, a passenger in the truck,
was dead. A bullet passed through his neck, severing an artery.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area is a hotbed for such hotheaded drivers, and
prosecutors and judges in Maricopa County show no mercy for such
violent reactions. Prison sentences are sought for anyone who
flashes or uses a gun on a roadway.
</P>
<P>
   When he is sentenced in January, Schmidt, 29, can expect to join
a string of Phoenix area men spending decades in prison because of
a flash of fury behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a very hard stance with people who solve problems on
the highway by using a gun,'' said Bill FitzGerald, spokesman for
the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable. You simply can't decide to solve a problem
by getting out a gun because you don't like how somebody drives or
how someone has given you a hand signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, road rage is unusual. Out of 177 million drivers,
about 1,000 die each year in such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, it's a different story.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city ranked third in the nation for dangerous
driving incidents and third again on a list of metropolitan areas
with the highest aggressive-driving death rates.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the growing violence, Arizona lawmakers in 1998
passed the nation's first aggressive-driving law, said Alberto
Gutier, director of the Governor's Office of Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Now, brazen drivers who make multiple risky maneuvers, such as
tailgating, unsafe lane changes or overtaking and passing another
vehicle on the right shoulder, can be cited.
</P>
<P>
   But passing laws is only a start, said Leon James, a University
of Hawaii professor known as Dr. Driving, whose lifework is to
educate and prevent driver warfare.
</P>
<P>
   He works with Congress and the states to develop prevention
programs. A pilot program in Miami-Dade County, Fla., which
features a video called ``Roadrageous,'' is the first to try
education in the battle against aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   What James really wants is to see laws passed requiring every
licensed driver to take periodic anger-management courses.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every American is an aggressive driver, he said. The
learning starts in the infant car seat, listening to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressive driving has been here since Roman times, since the
beginning of streets and horse-drawn vehicles,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is it can lead to an act of violence, which he said
is a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the mid 1980s, when traffic congestion became
reality for millions of Americans. It's so widespread now that some
therapists specialize in helping drivers afraid of losing control.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol and other drugs, particularly methamphetamine, commonly
play a role in road rage, James said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, at least six men are awaiting trial on
charges of killing people on the roadways during the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their victims were innocent passersby, people such as
Schara Marshall, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Schara was killed while returning from her first
homecoming dance. She was in a car the driver of which turned in
front of a truck in west Phoenix. A chase ensued. Shots were fired,
and Schara was struck in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had moved from the Sunnyslope area to a far west
Phoenix subdivision to get away from the crime, said her mother,
Bonnie Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Schara's killer still has not been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis Champagne's mother, Linda, said road rage is so
commonplace in the Phoenix area, victims often end up a mere
mention in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   That devastated Champagne after losing her son.
</P>
<P>
   She wants the world to know he was the light of her life. He
loved to help others. He wanted to be a physical therapist. He was
living at home to save money to marry his high school sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so into being physically fit,'' she recalled. ``He was
always telling me, `Mom, stand up straight! Watch your posture!' ''
</P>
<P>
   She still can't get used to the quiet in the house.
</P>
<P>
   His friends, family, the neighbor children, even his dog, will
never fully recover from the loss, said Champagne, an obstetrics
nurse at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this happen?'' asked the mother, who still cries at
the mention of his name. ``He was only a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   She still struggles to get up in the morning, but she's ready to
bring something positive from the sadness.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Roger, want to get a state law passed to
make it a crime to carry loaded weapons in a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not follow it,'' she said. ``But it would give
police a little more control. It might save someone's life.'' &QL;

MILISA TRYING TO WEIGH IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mate Milisa has a problem that isn't going to earn the 49er
basketball player much sympathy from the, shall we say, generally
robust American population.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Zagreb in Croatia is struggling to keep his weight
on. In a land where cheeseburgers and fries are considered one of
the four main food groups, Mate isn't going to find many people who
can relate. Jenny Craig can't help him.
</P>
<P>
   So the 49ers' center must depend on his own diligence in the
weight room and at the dinner table. He has one ally -- his girl
friend, Ivana, who moved here from Zagreb this summer and has been
in charge of the menu. Mate calls her dishes ``crazy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Milisa certainly won't find any allies in the Big West. He won
second-team honors last season as a way-too-lean 6-11, 225-pounder.
Now he's a muscled up 245 pounder who can fill a lane by himself.
Sunday afternoon at the Pyramid, he scored 24 points to go with six
rebounds, three steals and three blocks in the 49ers' 78-77 win
over Southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Milisa was identified as a talent by the basketball cognoscente
long before he arrived in Long Beach. He began playing club
basketball in Croatia at the age of 15 and he's been a member of
Croatia's national team since he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited by Georgetown, Utah and Indiana, among others,
and one can assume Rick Majerus might have had a weight-gain tip or
two. But Long Beach got him on a lucky bounce last season, after he
played a year at James Madison University and another at a Florida
junior college.
</P>
<P>
   Milisa, who turns 24 in January, improved each year, but his
body didn't keep up. He averaged 13.9 points and 5.6 rebounds for
the 49ers last season, but he lacked the physical game so crucial
to the current era of drive-by basketball. He took care of that
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work at it,'' he said after Sunday's win. ``I had to
change my diet and add protein shakes and supplements and work in
the weight room. This really was the first summer I had off in the
last five or six years, when I could concentrate on the weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a struggle. I must have a fast metabolism, because
food goes right through me. I really don't know whether I will be
able to keep the weight on during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA will follow his progress as closely as Wayne Morgan.
During a forgettable 13-15 season a year ago, several scouts made
stops at the Pyramid to take a look at his development. More will
come this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what (the scouts) say.'' Milisa said. ``My missing link
is size and strength. I want to play professional basketball, so I
care what they say. But I don't want to worry about it. I want to
focus on the games and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning is always fun. The 49ers haven't had much fun the last
three seasons, but this is easily the most physically gifted team
the 49ers have had since Morgan replaced Seth Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Milisa no longer is the only big man on campus. Junior Grant
Stone also returned with more muscle (and shaper elbows), and 6-9
newcomer James Williams, who will literally roar at his opponents
during the game, will also be a presence once he gets comfortable
in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also are deep in the backcourt. Morgan has six options
there depending on where he wants to play Antrone Lee and how
quickly he wants to work transfer Brad Smith into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the only go-to guy was guard Rock Lloyd, who
averaged 18 points a game. When the shooting guard's stroke is on,
he can personally ruin a defense. But a pass to Lloyd is a one-way
ticket, and like any shooter, he doesn't know when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan stopped him Sunday. After missing seven of eight shots,
Morgan put Lloyd on the bench for good with 17 minutes left in the
game. The 49ers wobbled at the end but won anyway, primarily
because Milisa, Stone and Williams, shooting 18-for-28 combined,
stepped up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan plans to use this muscle. ``But other teams will see that
we're bigger, too,'' said Morgan. ``(The Salukis) knew it, and they
tried to deny them the ball and take the ball in (offensively) and
get them out of the game. That's a battle of wills.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Milisa admits this is the first time he's ever been
considered a go-to guy. He's played with all of the Croatians now
populating NBA rosters, but usually as part of the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in this position before,'' he said. ``The last
time I played (for the national team), I was one of three guys (in
the pivot). Rock's the guy who sets us up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a work in progress,'' said Morgan. ``I want to play
uptempo. We have a good bench. When Rock has his 17-footer working,
it makes things a lot easier. And that will happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In between those times, it's nice to have a bigger and better
Milisa in the paint as an alternative. I'd say he's hungry for the
opportunity, but hungry probably isn't the word he would choose.

FRANKEL WINS TWO TURF WARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Victory in one of the million-dollar
Breeders' Cup races continued to elude Bobby Frankel earlier this
month at Gulfstream Park in Florida. A nice consolation prize
arrived Sunday at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer won two $500,000 races as Happyanunoit and jockey
Brice Blanc surged to a narrow victory in the Matriarch about an
hour after Super Quercus and Alex Solis swept to a mild upset in
the Hollywood Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask for anything better,'' said Frankel, whose barn
raked in $660,000 Sunday, including Spanish Fern's small
third-place purse in the Matriarch.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he could ask for one thing, and that would be a
Breeders' Cup win. After four out-of-the-money finishes Nov. 6,
Frankel is 0 for 35 in racing's richest event, the only blemish on
a Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankel has never seemed frustrated by his Breeders' Cup
failures. And as long as he has Hollywood Park in the fall, he'll
never have to beg.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the six-week Hollywood fall season has been anchored
by the three-day collection of grass-course stakes known as the
Turf Festival. This year it consisted of six stakes Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's two wins gave him six for his career in the Turf
Festival, more than any other trainer and only one less than jockey
Corey Nakatani's seven.
</P>
<P>
   They include victories in three of the past four runnings of the
Matriarch, the year's final major race for filly and mare turf
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Happyanunoit, imported from New Zealand for owner
John Amerman, the former Mattel chairman, had won the Palomar
Handicap at Del Mar in August and dominated the Vinery First Lady
at Keeneland in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The latter race might have set her up nicely for the Breeders'
Cup Filly and Mare Turf. But Amerman would have had to pay a hefty
supplemental nominating fee, and Frankel decided ``the mathematics
didn't figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sent off at 2-1 odds in the $500,000 Matriarch, narrowly second
in the betting to Breeders' Cup Mile runner-up Tuzla, she found
good position in fifth early in the 1[-mile race and had a clear
shot from the outside at the top of the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankel thought Tuzla had gotten a jump on his filly. ``At
the 16th pole, I didn't think we were going to get there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla's roots as a miler showed, though, in the final strides.
Happyanunoit got up by a neck and paid $6.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was the extra distance, I don't know,'' said David
Flores, who rode Tuzla. ``I thought I was home free.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who trains Tuzla, seemed to blame Flores. ``Brice
timed it perfectly,'' he said. ``He was the more patient of the
two, and he got the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanc is becoming one of the circuit's more reliable turf
riders. The list includes Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Solis won half of the Turf Festival stakes as he rode Super
Quercus ($11) to a two-length victory over Manndar in the $500,000
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex has been very lucky for me on turf,'' Frankel said.
``He's very patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenth in the 14-horse field early in the 1[-mile Derby, Solis
sent the 3-year-old French-bred to the outside turning for home and
got the lead from runner-up Manndar and third-place Fighting Falcon
as 5-2 favorite Mula Gula faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Super Quercus has finished worse than second only once in eight
starts. That was a slow-starting third in the Oak Tree Derby last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't been out in a year, (and) he figured to be a little
sharper the second time off the layoff,'' Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Frankel plans to rest Super Quercus for a summer and fall
campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex seems to think this horse can win the Breeders' Cup Mile
next year,'' Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8,824: Laffit Pincay, without mounts in the richer stakes at
Hollywood Park, went to Turf Paradise in Arizona on Sunday and
rallied Kits Peak to a }-length victory for trainer Walter Greenman
in the $75,000 Queen of the Green Handicap for fillies and mares on
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is nine wins from tying Bill Shoemaker's career record of
8,833 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Jockey Isaias Enriquez was examined and released from
Centinela Hospital after hitting the dirt hard following the first
race. He's expected to ride Wednesday. His mount, Melancholy Baby,
fell after finishing third, pitching Enriquez over her head; the
horse got up and appeared all right. Enriquez was unconscious
briefly and was removed from the track on a stretcher.... Fans bet
more than $1.4 million on the pick-six after Hollywood Park
guaranteed a $1 million pool. Twenty perfect tickets paid $40,539
each.... Solis also won Friday's Miesque Stakes with Prairie
Princess and Saturday's Citation with Brave Act.... Frankel's
earlier Turf Festival winners were Eternity Star in the 1991
Hollywood Derby, Wandesta in the 1996 Matriarch, Ryafan in the 1997
Matriarch, and Star's Proud Penny in the 1997 Miesque.

UCLA WOMEN FALL TO TENNESSEE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It can happen once, but not twice _ not against a
great team.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA played tentatively and waited until the second half to
explode for the second time this season. This time, however, the
Bruins were facing six-time national champion Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (2-1) fought uphill the entire game, and the Lady
Vols' balanced attack made the fight even more difficult as No. 4
UCLA dropped its first game of the season to No. 5 Tennessee 88-77
Sunday at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Kellie Jolly and Chamique Holdsclaw didn't necessarily
mean Tennessee would be lacking depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought losing those two players might have dropped them a
bit,'' UCLA forward Maylana Martin said. ``I thought they might
struggle a bit, but they had a couple of people step up in the end.
Tamika (Catchings) played well, and so did their freshman guard
(Kara Lawson).''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols' reinforcements were key down the stretch with
their solid fundamentals and consistency. That was due in part to
their talented recruiting class. Tennessee (3-1) had three freshmen
on the floor at the end, including Lawson who finished the game
with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think that we rebuild, but reload,'' Tennessee
coach Pat Summitt said. ``I'm looking out there at the end of the
game, and we had three freshmen making big plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee established its presence early and led 40-31 at
halftime. The Lady Vols were extremely aggressive offensively
behind Catchings, a junior All-American and Naismith Player of the
Year candidate. Catchings scored 15 of her 28 points in the first
half and collected 13 rebounds for her first double-double of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tamika's) got tremendous speed up and down the floor,''
Summitt said. ``She makes everyone else better because of her
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding and depth were two key factors for Tennessee. The
Lady Vols outrebounded UCLA 45-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said of the
rebounding statistics. ``I think Pat does a good job knowing what
works for the basketball team. She takes a lot of pride in stopping
her opponent's strengths, ... and what works for us is rebounding''
</P>
<P>
   After shooting 13 of 36 in the first half, UCLA came out more
aggressively in the second, scoring 10 points in three minutes. The
Bruins closed within one at 48-47 after a Marie Philman layup with
14:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA collected seven steals and forced 10 turnovers in the
second half. Unfortunately for the Bruins, Tennessee's bench upped
the intensity and increased the lead. The Bruins once again cut it
to four, 60-56, but the Lady Vols didn't allow the Bruins to come
closer. The Tennessee bench outscored UCLA's bench 27-15.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee also had help from Semeka Randall's 11 points and five
assists and Kristen Clement's 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who played 39 minutes, had 24 points and six rebounds
for UCLA. Janae Hubbard added 12 points; while guards Nicole
Kaczmarski and Michelle Greco each had 11. Greco also had six
assists.

COUPLES FATTENS HIS AMPLE WALLET

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ The 17th annual Skins Game turned out be a
rewarding experience, figuratively and literally, for Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who said he was moved when asked to take the place of
the late Payne Stewart in the popular competition, finished with a
record $635,000 in winnings, thanks to a $510,000 day Sunday at
Landmark Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   He won 11 skins overall and also set records for most money won
in Skins Game history ($1.975 million), most money won on a single
hole ($410,000), most money won on Sunday ($510,000) and most
birdies (nine) for 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara finished second with $170,000 and Sergio Garcia was
third at $70,000. David Duval was shut out for the second time. He
also didn't win any money in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara jokingly gave Couples a new nickname after the two-day
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Mr. Skins, that's all you can say,'' said O'Meara, the
defending champion. ``Freddie `Skins' Couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Couples attributed his success to good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it every time,'' he said. ``Luck is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to the Skins Game. There is a lot of luck
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good golf also enters into the equation, and there was
a lot of it on Sunday's back nine. Couples birdied five holes,
including one on the par-5, 563-yard 18th hole that netted him
$410,000. The 18th hole, already designated a $200,000 Super Skin,
was another $210,000 richer thanks to a three-hole carryover.
</P>
<P>
   Couples started the hole poorly when he drove into a bush left
of the fairway. O'Meara's drive went far to the right, while Duval
and Garcia found the fairway off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Couples hacked out of trouble with an 8-iron, followed by a
210-yard 4-iron to 12 feet. O'Meara left his second shot under the
lip of a bunker short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real smart play for somebody who's been playing for
20 years,'' O'Meara said after taking himself out of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Duval also surrendered after going for the green in two but
leaving his 255-yard 3-wood short and in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was over the green and in a bunker from 269 yards out and
left his third shot about eight feet short. Couples promptly
drained his putt and Garcia missed to make Couples the big winner.
</P>
<P>
   Couples said he was surprised at the hole's sudden turn of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``After walking up to my drive, I thought somebody was going to
make birdie,'' he said. ``I also thought David's ball was going to
carry. Sergio looked to be on the back edge, and it made my shot a
lot easier because there was nothing to lose. If I hit a good shot,
I make five and go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't think I would win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the previous eight holes were won outright.
Couples' two-putt birdie from 50 feet on the par-5 10th hole was
worth $100,000, O'Meara drained a 40-footer for birdie to win
$170,000 on the 232-yard 13th hole, and Garcia won $70,000 on the
next hole, a 314-yard par-4 in which each player attempted to drive
the green but found greenside bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia made a two-footer for birdie after almost holing out from
the sand, and Duval missed from four feet.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's putter often betrayed him over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had won some skins, but that's how this game is, the
nature of this format,'' Duval said. ``I don't worry about it. I
had a couple of chances. I would have liked another chance or two,
but just didn't make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia also wished a few more putts would have dropped, like a
six-footer for birdie on the 17th, but he still called the weekend
a pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time,'' he said. ``I'm just a little
disappointed I couldn't make one of the last two putts. (Duval)
also missed some, and I know how he feels.''

KANSAS CITY SEEKS A TOUGHER POLICY ON SLUMLORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Newspapers
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Nearly two years ago, Kansas City launched a
``slumlord of the month'' installment on its government TV channel,
in hopes of shaming problem landlords into cleaning up their rental
properties.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It withered on the vine. It didn't have any real teeth to it,
if you're not hitting them in their pocketbooks. Some of them even
considered it a badge of honor,'' said Nanci Regan, neighborhood
development supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   So now, prodded by exasperated homeowners, Kansas City officials
are preparing to recommend to the City Council a more comprehensive
get-tough approach.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies will include a ``landlords school'' similar to school
for drunken drivers; intensive probation and community service;
civil court action to gain more control over the properties; and
lobbying for higher fines and more jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists applaud the effort, but some are
skeptical and think it still does not go far enough. Some residents
want landlord licensing, something that Kansas City, Kan., now
requires but which landlords in Kansas City, Mo., have lobbied
against.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Williard, tagged the first ``slumlord of the month'' in
1998, scoffs at the new approach. Williard said the city should
stop harassing property owners who provided affordable, if not
immaculate, housing for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where will you put the poor people when we gentrify all the
areas?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Neighborhood and Community Services will
describe the plan to a City Council committee next month. An
internal memo explains that _ rather than creating new regulations
for all landlords to follow _ the department wants to ``target
problem rental property owners'' who have a history of Municipal
Court violations and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ostracizes the bad folks, rather than doing
landlord//tenant licensing that goes after everyone,'' said Bob
Mohart, the department's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to treat these people like multiple DUIs,'' he said.
``And when you have an aggravated problem, you march them across
the street to Circuit Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The landlord school would consist of a basic eight-hour program
for first-time offenders and a more intense program for repeat
offenders. Courses could cover landlord/tenant law, tenant
screening, housing codes, permit requirements, and the effect of
nuisance violations and poor property maintenance on the entire
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the city and neighborhood representatives want to do is
provide the foundation, the educational piece, so landlords know
what the laws are. And for those who just are not complying, there
is this additional responsibility to attend this further training,
to get them to understand that what they do affects the
neighborhood,'' said Iris Archer, neighborhood preservation
division manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even if landlords do not take the courses seriously, they would
be required to attend, Mohart said. That erases the excuse of
ignorance if future violations occur. Failure to comply could
result in house arrest or jail time.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were still trying to estimate how many
people might be required to attend such a school.
</P>
<P>
   Other strategies include requiring out-of-town landlords to
appoint a local registered agent, empowered to improve properties
and correct problems. The landlord might also be required to file a
letter of credit or post a bond that would be accessible for
property improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Without those controls, neighborhood activists complain,
out-of-town owners too often avoid prosecution and let their
properties slide into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   The city's neighborhood attorney, Holly Steinhauser, also is
exploring a new legal strategy in civil court action: receivership.
Courts give those cases docketing priority, and a judge hears them.
If the property is deemed unsanitary or unsafe, the judge can
appoint a receiver with power to apply rent payments and borrow
against the property to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner does nothing for two years, the receiver can apply
to have the property put into his name or that of a non-profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a priority of our office to attempt one of those,''
Steinhauser said. ``It is one more tool in our toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser has recently sent her first letter notifying an
owner and mortgage company of her intent to file a receivership
petition after 60 days, if no abatement or foreclosure has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Mohart also is asking the council to lobby the state legislature
for several changes to add more teeth to the city's enforcement
mechanism. Among those would be authority to increase the maximum
fine for property code violations from $500 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible course of action would be to have Missouri
toughen its control over limited liability corporations, using
Kansas as an example. Kansas requires corporations to publicly
register with the state, divulging owners and ownership percentages
and where they can be served notice of violations, so they can be
located and prosecuted more easily.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the new approach, some landlords protested that
they were being unfairly singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Williard has battled the city for years over his property
maintenance approach in north Hyde Park and the East Side. City
records show he has been cited repeatedly for properties with trash
and debris, unlicensed or disabled vehicles in the yard, broken
windows, weeds, porches and gutters in disrepair, peeling paint and
other violations.
</P>
<P>
   He and his attorney, Dan Franco, dismiss those as minor
infractions and argue that the city has carried out a vendetta
against Williard, forcing him to spend thousands of dollars on
legal fees that could have gone for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Williard acknowledged in letters to the editor and in an
interview that his properties were not ``Mission Hills'' fancy, but
he said they were often in better shape than other, neighboring
properties that were not cited. He said he provides affordable
shelter for low-income residents who might otherwise have no place
to go, or who would have to rely on government subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Williard said he improves the houses that he buys, and that he
has saved properties the city would have been forced to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made them into livable, usable properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williard says his main opponents are owners of the majestic
stone mansions just blocks from his houses, who want to drive out
all the rental units in the neighborhood to improve their property
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is the gentrification of Hyde Park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Franco said he thought most landlords were
sophisticated investors and did not need a ``landlords school.'' He
suggested mediation and fair code enforcement that did not try to
drive a landlord out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists, however, argue that weaknesses in the
city ordinances seriously impede the efforts of conscientious
homeowners in areas on the verge of a renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   John Gladeau, president of the Old Hyde Park Historic District,
points to decrepit rental properties next door to beautifully
restored Victorian homes. ``It makes it hard to bring back these
transitional neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladeau is particularly concerned about the high percentage of
absentee landlords in his neighborhood, out of reach of process
servers and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first formed five years ago,'' he said, ``we submitted
a list of 38 problem apartment buildings to the city....The only
ones with any progress are the ones owned by in-town owners.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gladeau cited one property on Wyandotte Street
that has had three out-of-state owners since 1993. A mattress has
adorned the front lawn for months. It also has peeling paint,
deteriorating columns, and broken windows, and it has been vacant
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rafoth, from Iowa, owned the building until October, when
a bank foreclosed on the property. Rafoth blamed bad tenants for
the problems and said it was a nightmare trying to keep drug
dealers and vagrants out. He said management companies and the city
bureaucracy merely added to his problems. He finally shut the
building down and boarded it up.
</P>
<P>
   But Gladeau and others think out-of-town landlords need to take
more responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate landlord licensing, which would require all
landlords to fix up their buildings or lose the ability to rent the
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City proposed that several years ago, and respectable
landlords lobbied hard against it as an onerous burden. Mohart so
far is not receptive to reintroducing the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is we're not going to create another huge city
bureaucracy,'' he said. ``We think, and our lawyers think, we can
get this done with existing resources.''

BUCS STOP SEAHAWKS, 16-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So many things had gone so well for the Seahawks
during a five-game winning streak that staked them to an 8-2
record.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Sunday's game, that was again the case.
</P>
<P>
   The offense took the opening kickoff and moved smartly through
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' vaunted defense to a field goal by mixing
the passing of Jon Kitna and running of Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was dominating, limiting the Bucs to 156 total yards
by holding them to negative yardage on six series and fewer than 10
yards on 13 of their 15 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   They even knocked Trent Dilfer out of the game when defensive
end Phillip Daniels drove the Bucs quarterback to the Kingdome turf
on a third-quarter sack, breaking Dilfer's right collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was sorely missing: turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 games, the Seahawks did not force one.
Kitna, meanwhile, turned the ball over six times _ five
interceptions, one fewer than he had thrown in his first nine
starts, and a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of this glaring discrepancy was a 16-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said earlier in the week that turnovers would decide the
game,'' coach Mike Holmgren said. ``We had too many and we didn't
create any. That's exactly the story of this game _ it was
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough turnovers to gag the life from any chance the Seahawks
had of winning.
</P>
<P>
   But they live to learn from their mistakes, and try to find ways
to eliminate them next week against the Raiders in Oakland _ where
the Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the Raiders Sunday. At 8-3, the
Seahawks hold a two-game lead over the Chiefs (6-5) in the AFC
West.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat of Sunday's effort would make that a one-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very humbling loss but we're 8-3 and there's
absolutely no reason to go in the tank,'' guard Pete Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks can't allow the self-inflicted misery against the
Bucs to become self-doubt as they continue their quest of winning
the franchise's first division title since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a five-game win streak and we were feeling real good
about ourselves. Maybe too good,'' Watters said. ``But it's
happened everywhere I've been, even with the Niners. We bounced
back every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was upset, a little downcast and understandably
frustrated after the Seahawks produced their lowest point total
since being shut out in back-to-back games in the 2-14 season in
1992 _ a span of 115 games over almost seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmgren admitted his team was due for a game like this,
especially against a defense as aggressive and aggravating as the
Bucs'.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, something like this was going to happen,''
Holmgren said as he left his post-game news conference. ``We were
playing very, very well. But games like this just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also agreed with Watters' assessment that perhaps the
players were feeling too good about themselves after winning five
in a row and grabbing a three-game lead in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were feeling really good, and I want them to feel good,''
Holmgren said. ``But this feeling is a little new for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the locker room was a little too familiar for the
players who have been around as the Seahawks have failed to post a
winning record since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly what we'd done leading up to this game gave us
margin for error,'' Kendall said. ``But now we can't sit back and
think we've done anything. Like I've been saying for a while, 8-2
is a nice start, but until that little letter shows up next to your
name in the standings, it ain't over. This game proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense played well enough to win this game. Holmgren said
it, and so did any offensive player who was being honest with
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bucs ranked among the top 10, if not top five, in
almost every defensive statistical category, the Seahawks defenders
took it as a personal challenge to play with them, if not outplay
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been challenged all week to attempt to play as well as
their defense,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, who led the effort
with 12 tackles and a sack. ``We wanted to match their defensive
intensity. We didn't want to get shoved around. We didn't want to
be embarrassed. We just wanted to handle our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Despite playing without defensive tackle Sam Adams
(sprained knee) and cornerback Willie Williams (concussion), the
Seahawks yielded a season-low 156 yards. Without their 54-yard
drive to a Martin Gramatica field goal in the second quarter and a
67-yard drive to Shaun King's 2-yard touchdown pass to Patrick
Harper in the fourth quarter, the Bucs netted 25 yards on their
other 42 plays.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of dominating effort the defensive players have
been talking about turning in all season as they were allowing an
average of 341.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   But what's better? Allowing a lot of yards, and coming up with a
lot of turnovers? Or not allowing yards, and not getting turnovers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation when you don't get any turnovers,''
said Daniels, who couldn't even force one with his
collarbone-cracking sack of Dilfer. ``You can't win like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would have helped if the Seahawks offense could
have found a way to crack the Tampa Bay defense. The Bucs pressured
Kitna into a pathetic performance (19 of 44 for 197 yards) by
blitzing up the middle and into his face. They took away his
security-blanket crossing routes by dropping a linebacker into the
middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously had a really good game plan on defense,''
Watters said. ``We were kind of scratching our heads out there. It
was as if we didn't even practice, we didn't know where they were
coming from out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Seahawks are left to scratch to regain the swagger that
was slapped out of them as they head into a stretch of four games
against division opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how good a team we are next week when we play
Oakland in Oakland,'' Daniels said. ``We'll see how well we bounce
back from this situation.''

BUCS' DEFENSE COMES UP `HUGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Trent Dilfer had to high-five his defensive teammates
with his left hand following Tampa Bay's 16-3 victory Sunday
against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer's right arm was in a sling and he was hurting after
breaking his collarbone in the third quarter. Still he managed to
smile broadly through the pain. Dilfer's replacement, rookie Shaun
King, had been effective. His defense had been dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay forced six Seahawks turnovers _ intercepting Jon Kitna
a career-high five times _ and kept Seattle out of the end zone for
the first time in Mike Holmgren's coaching tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reeling over the loss of Dilfer, who is likely out
for the season, the Bucs were basking in victory. It is the first
win against expansion-twin Seattle and a key momentum boost
entering next Monday night's pivotal game against Minnesota. Both
teams share the NFC Central Division lead with a 7-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did today ... it was huge,'' said Tampa Bay safety
John Lynch, who led the Bucs with seven tackles. ``This is a team
with a lot of pride, in our defense in particular. You look for
challenges like playing this caliber of team and we stepped it up
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's win over the surging Seahawks surprised no one in
the Bucs' locker room. The way they won may have.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, who had beaten only two winning teams, came to the
Kingdome ranked last in the league in turnover ratio. Usually they
are the team trying to compensate for miscues. And they didn't
expect that to change so dramatically this weekend considering
Kitna had led the Seahawks on a five-game winning streak and to the
AFC West Division lead by playing smart, mostly conservative ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ranks right up there with the our best performances,''
said All-Pro defensive tackle Warren Sapp, grinning after his
three-tackle, one-sack effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that we got him (Kitna) rattled, we just put
him in some positions that he wasn't comfortable in. We just kept
the pressure on him and forced him to make the plays. We didn't get
the number of sacks we wanted, but we got the pressure on him and
it got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Sapp said their team pretty much followed its game
plan. It naturally was concerned about facing elite players such as
Joey Galloway and Ricky Watters, but the Bucs felt they also knew
Holmgren's tendencies from his days coaching their NFC Central
rival Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren Sapp was really destructive,'' said Seahawks offensive
guard Brian Habib, whose line allowed three sacks. ``They had a lot
of guys who came on blitzes that we were not able to pick up.
Whether it was an assignment error, or just too many guys, we
couldn't pick it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the Seahawks, the Bucs' offense had helped Tampa Bay to
a four-game winning streak by being adequate, not flashy. The
defense has saved the offense on several occasions but Tampa Bay's
bench still took a collective gulp when Dilfer went down.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Eric Zeier was listed as the emergency quarterback for
this game, still not 100 percent recovered from a shoulder injury.
So King, a second round draft choice out of Tulane, made his first
regular-season appearance on the Bucs' opening drive of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which amassed a meager 48 yards total to that point,
went three-and-out in King's first two drives.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick Dunn's 17-yard run in the final seconds of the third
quarter finally gave the Bucs their first first down since the
opening quarter. Five plays later King connected with Patrick Hape
for a touchdown reception and a 13-3 scoring cushion. King finished
3-for-7 for 32 yards and led Tampa Bay to a field goal in addition
to his touchdown toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (King) seemed very confident when he first came into the
huddle, surprisingly confident,'' said veteran Bucs center Tony
Mayberry. ``I remember my first game and I was wide-eyed, but Shaun
did a great job of not getting rattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And thanks to our defense, we won. Again.''

BRUINS BROUGHT TO A HALT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometimes, the most lowly of teams can be the most
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who have been on a roll the last five weeks, found
that out Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. They poured 44 shots on Islanders netminder
Roberto Luongo, who was making his NHL debut, and scored exactly
once.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, a group of young no-name players who are laboring
near the Eastern Conference basement, triumphed over the Bruins at
the FleetCenter, 2-1. It was Boston's first loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had tons of chances but created no traffic in front
of Luongo, making it a relatively easy night for the 20-year-old
despite the shot totals. Boston's players, though frustrated at
their lack of finish, tipped their caps to the kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stays deep in his net and he's in good position,'' said
left wing Dave Andreychuk, who had a game-high nine shots on net.
``The first couple of periods, we really didn't get people in front
of him. A goalie like that, if he sees it, he's so deep that if he
gets a good look at it, he's going to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said his club made Luongo look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it tough on us but we made it look tougher than it
was,'' said Burns. ``I don't really think we got those golden
opportunities. We shot at him but did we shoot at the right place?
But he did play well, let's give him credit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders produced just 20 shots and scored on their first
one when Jamie Heward did something that rarely happens _ he beat
defenseman Ray Bourque. Heward made a nice move to go inside on the
Bruins' captain, then found Jorgen Jonsson chugging to the net.
Jonsson beat goalie Byron Dafoe and the Islanders had a 1-0 lead at
1:31 of the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins pulled even at 6:02 of the second as a result of a
nice individual effort by Jason Allison. Allison, who was
positioned behind the net, had defenseman Mathieu Biron draped all
over him. Allison skated left to right behind the net, with Biron
still clinging to him, and one-handed a pass to Anson Carter in
front. Carter, who had eight shots in the game, rapped it past
Luongo for his sixth goal of the season and the 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bruins chances later, Boston's fruitlessness turned to
frustration with 55 seconds left in the period when New York took
the lead for good. With the teams skating four per side, the
Islanders' mammoth defenseman, Zdeno Chara, scored his second goal
of the season, taking advantage of a big mismatch. Chara, who is 6
feet 9 inches and 246 pounds, skated from left to right around the
net with 5-8, 184-pound Samsonov trying to stop him. Then Chara
reversed direction, heading back to the left behind the net and
beat Dafoe with a backhanded wraparound at the left post at 19:05.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mismatch,'' said Burns. ``I think the defense was
starting to read it, too, but they were trying to get Samsonov off
so they could make a switch, but he kept on going back and back and
back. Sammy, when he gets going like that, you almost need a large
hook to pull him away from it. He's got a long reach, that Chara.
He came around and caught Byron by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he should've had it but was fooled a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured with his reach he would've tried to wrap it all the
way around,'' said Dafoe. ``So, I gave him a little poke check and
he put it on the inside (of his stick). That's my fault, I
should've had that. I probably should've gone down with the paddle
on the ice and taken the whole bottom away. It's a bad time to give
up a goal like that, going into the third period. It really
deflated us. I expected him to go further around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first, the Bruins outshot the Islanders, 29-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two periods, we threw everything we had at them,''
said Dafoe. ``Unfortunately, we only came up with one goal. I think
we deserved better than what we got.''

LATEST LOSS DEALS PATRIOTS' HOPES A BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ The Patriots have become the anti-Maytag:
They always need fixing.
</P>
<P>
   By now New England's product would have been returned and
declared a lemon. Or the repairman would have had to answer for not
doing the things necessary to fix the problem. Not once (in a 24-17
loss to the Jets). Not twice (a 27-17 loss to Miami). But three
times following Sunday's 17-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking responsibility for this,'' said coach Pete Carroll,
whose job security is at an all-time low. ``We have to make
adjustments and right now we're not making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe wouldn't put it on the coach. He wouldn't put it on
his teammates. He wouldn't even put it on the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the quarterback of this team,'' said Bledsoe, who was 18
of 34 for 205 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. ``I'm
responsible for scoring points and we don't score enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only New England score was Bledsoe's 45-yard pass to Terry
Glenn in the fourth quarter with the game well in hand for Buffalo.
By then mistakes, turnovers, and penalties had done in New England,
which fell to 6-5, in fourth place in the AFC East and some believe
far, far away from getting back into the running for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see about that,'' said Carroll. ``We need some
help from other teams. Right now we can't worry about what other
teams are doing. We have to correct our problems. It's happened
three weeks in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn did not start for disciplinary reasons. He had missed the
first part of Thursday's practice, and Carroll decided to bench him
for a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't hurt the Patriots too badly, though they went down,
3-0, on Steve Christie's 28-yard field goal with 1:32 remaining in
the first. A huge interference penalty on safety Chris Carter as he
and Eric Moulds jockeyed for position on Doug Flutie's floater
inside the New England 10 set the stage for the early score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I touched him,'' said Carter. ``We were both
going for the ball. That's a judgment call. There's nothing I can
do about that one.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots felt helpless on that play, they could have done
something about the Bills' second-quarter score, a 54-yard pass
from Flutie to Moulds. It was second and 6 from the Bills' 46, and
Flutie was in the shotgun, then dropped back and watched the
situation develop. Cornerback Steve Israel fell at the 40, leaving
Moulds wide open at the 25, where he caught the pass and jogged in
for the score with 1:01 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked the wrong time to fall down,'' said Israel. ``I think
my foot got tangled up in his. You saw what happened. We had some
missed coverages and mistakes and penalties that really cost us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half the Patriots were penalized eight times for
101 yards (they had none in the second half). The Patriots actually
ran the ball better than the Bills _ 93 yards to 92 _ but once
again failed miserably in converting third-down chances (3 of 13).
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, the Patriots lost a game in
which they rushed 25 or more times. They even won the possession
battle, 30:46 to 29:14.
</P>
<P>
   Every time they had something working, a penalty or mistake
would end their momentum. The Patriots had an 11-play drive working
in the first quarter when Ben Coates was called for holding. They
had driven to the Bills' 24 in their next possession when Coates
was flagged for offensive interference. From there the Patriots
were forced to pass, and Bledsoe threw an interception to Ken Irvin
on a pass intended for Troy Brown down the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had another decent drive in the second quarter, but
an intentional grounding call on Bledsoe, who was being heavily
rushed and threw the ball to the ground toward a fallen Kevin
Faulk, cost the Patriots dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The one superb play they made, punter Lee Johnson running for a
first down when pressured by Bills safety Keion Carpenter, didn't
spark anything.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was sacked six times, knocked down repeatedly, and
hurried frequently. The Bills did the same things the Jets and
Dolphins did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty down right now,'' said Bledsoe. ``To lose three in
a row is very disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Even trailing, 10-0, at the half, the Patriots could have come
back. But there weren't enough adjustments made in the locker room.
Chad Eaton made a play early in the third quarter when he stripped
the ball loose from fullback Jonathan Linton, Israel recovering at
the Bills 43. But the offense went three and out.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum again gone, the Bills and Flutie piled on. Starting
at their 20, the Patriots' defense left backup tight end Bobby
Collins wide open in the middle of the field for a 45-yard gain.
Then Flutie dumped a pass off to Sam Gash, who danced down the
right sideline, avoiding a tackle by Andy Katzenmoyer. Gash, who
looked more like Barry Sanders than a 245-pound fullback, dashed 31
yards for the score with 10:21 left in the third to make it 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed little hope. Still, the Patriots moved the ball
from their 33 to the Buffalo 6 as Bledsoe went to an intermediate
passing game. But Faulk, carrying up the middle on first and goal,
had the ball come loose on a hit by linebacker John Holecek, giving
it back to the Bills with 4:49 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating,'' said Willie McGinest. ``That's the only word I
can come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Can it be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it can be fixed,'' he said. ``I can fix myself. I
can make myself better. I can't fix everybody else.''

GUARD SPURNS SUMMITT, AND DAD, FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget the final score, which favored Tennessee
88-77. A better barometer that the UCLA women's basketball team is
gaining on the Lady Vols was Nicole Kaczmarski's presence in the
Bruins' backcourt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski, who started and supplied the Bruins with 38 solid
minutes, grew up on Long Island and was more than a blip on
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt's radar screen. Summitt homed in on
5-foot-11 point guard, who is the reigning national high school
Player of the Year. She showed up at two of Kaczmarski's practices
at Sachem High, the women's hoops equivalent of God appearing to
Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski called it ``a great honor'' to be pursued by arguably
the best coach, male or female, of the top women's program in the
land. She chose to go to UCLA anyway, which, truth to tell,
couldn't have devastated Summitt as much as it did Kaczmarski's
father, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   There were other point guards for Summitt to recruit; in place
of Kaczmarski she landed a more-than-suitable alternative in Kara
Lawson, who had 19 points and zero turnovers in 28 minutes to help
hand No.4 UCLA its first loss in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kaczmarski, on the other hand, had only one baby left in
the nest. Her decision to fly so far from the coop was hard on both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was big-time upset at me (for choosing UCLA),''
Kaczmarski said. ``Me and my dad are inseparable. So not being able
to look in the stands after every shot and see him is the toughest
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to UCLA was something I wanted to do, so I did it. I
guess I really didn't realize how far it was going to be. I've had
my share of homesickness. The first week I was like, `I want to go
home!' But I guess that's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski, 18, wouldn't have set herself up for so much angst
if she didn't think the Bruins, under seventh-year coach Kathy
Olivier, weren't really, really close to the national supremacy
that Vols fans have come to view as Tennessee's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``My junior year I liked Tennessee a lot, because of its success
and Coach Summitt,'' Kaczmarski said. And yet she committed to UCLA
early in her senior year because ``I wanted to go to a program
where they haven't won a championship in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be Tennessee, which has won six national titles _
including three in a row this decade _ since UCLA captured its lone
national championship in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt's teams have been so dominant, they've lost back-to-back
games just four times in the 1990s. As soon as the Bruins stop
beating themselves up over the fact they were within one point of
Tennessee before letting the Vols wiggle out of their grasps in the
final 13 minutes, they'll see they have many reasons to be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list is the fact an 11-point margin is a veritable
nail-biter for Tennessee, which beat UCLA by 23 at Knoxville last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols lost three games last season and only four other
opponents managed to hang within 11 points of them. In 13 of its 31
wins, Tennessee enjoyed at least a 30-point cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the Bruins fell without the services of veteran point guard
Erica Gomez, who is sidelined until January after undergoing left
shoulder surgery. And they were effectively missing starting center
Janae Hubbard, who fumbled a perfect pass from Kaczmarski under the
basket on the game's opening possession and saw her confidence slip
through her fingers along with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, a senior whose hulking presence underneath was a
strength the Bruins had to exploit to counter Tennessee's
considerable depth and skill, didn't have a rebound in the first
half. The Vols capitalized on Hubbard's inertia by grabbing 14 of
the 23 rebounds at UCLA's end in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard missed four of her first five shots, then made four of
her final five and finished with nine points and two rebounds. All
she needs is a little more time to get in sync with Kaczmarski, who
had 11 points, four steals, three assists and two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole offense will benefit from having Gomez back. She'll
lighten Kaczmarski's load and act as a sort of security blanket for
her teammates, who look a little lost on the court without her.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's backcourt may have come straight from New York's backyard
(Gomez is from New Jersey), but local talent is what has brought
the Bruins to the cusp of greatness. Olivier is a big believer in
keeping the homegrown talent from pulling up its roots. A case in
point is senior forward Maylana Martin, who had her pick of schools
and chose to play not far from her hometown of Perris.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to players such as Martin and Huntington Beach's Marie
Philman and LaCrescenta's Michelle Greco, ``People on the West
Coast know there's a sport other than volleyball now,'' Summitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier's aim is to keep hoarding the local jewels and go
outside for the one or two gems that will complete UCLA's national
crown. It's a strategy similar to the one Summitt started with at
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Success has turned the whole country into Summitt's backyard, as
evidenced by the fact 11 of the 14 Vols on this year's squad _
including all the starters _ are from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's here, Kaczmarski wouldn't dream of being anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all about UCLA now,'' said Kaczmarski, who survived her
first Thanksgiving away from home thanks to a huge assist by Greco,
who brought the freshman home with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of growing up,'' Kaczmarski said with a shrug
and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking about herself but her words rang true for the
Bruins, too.

IT CAN BE HARD TO FOLLOW THIS LEADER

<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ These are the souls that try men's minds.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, even the souls that have become so trying
for us all can see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to push the panic button,'' Patriots receiver Troy
Brown said Sunday, only half jokingly, as he sat in a locker room
that was as quiet as a morgue.
</P>
<P>
   It was an hour after Brown's Patriots had lost their third
straight game, a 17-7 debacle to the Buffalo Bills in which they
did not score a point until there were less than three minutes left
in the game and most probably in their season. The silence of the
lambs was appropriate for such a situation as this.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was gone from this room despite some brave words that tried
to argue to the contrary. It is over for the Patriots and probably
for coach Pete Carroll. For this season in their case and maybe for
good in his because in three years they have tracked steadily
downward from the 1996 Super Bowl season to this _ a team with a
busload of millionaires that probably killed any chance of making
the playoffs under a fittingly leaden sky.
</P>
<P>
   This was a loss that came as a shock to these Patriots despite
their recent struggles, a loss they had grown to expect would not
happen despite the mounting evidence the last two weekends of their
slow decline.
</P>
<P>
   For three years they have played this kind of football, winning
big early then fading like autumn leaves before rallying in the
cold to make the playoffs just as all seemed lost. It had become
their pattern and so they believed nothing would change this time
when they dug another hole for themselves. But they are a year
older and their rivals in the AFC East are a bit better and this
time they have not been able to do what they did in 1996, 1997, and
1998. This time they have not been able to survive their own
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in fourth place now and we gotta depend on someone
else,'' Brown said, resignation in his voice. ``Right now we're
depending on people to help us and that's a bad situation to be
in.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the worst of situations, but it is one of their own
making. After opening the season 6-2 by beating up a string of
losing teams they were ill-prepared for the iron of the AFC East.
After a week's respite at midseason they have lost to the Jets, the
Dolphins, and the Bills in ever more confused fashion, reaching a
point with their offense Sunday when they seemed incapable of
making a play.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Drew Bledsoe has been sacked 13 times (six
Sunday) and knocked flat three times as many more, yet the
offensive line has for the most part played well enough. How can
this be, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had time to hold the ball for quite a bit and we still were
covering them, so that was a big key _ our secondary playing real
well,'' Bills coach Wade Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   They did play well, but not as well as the Patriots' receivers
played poorly. There are men locked in solitary confinement seeing
more daylight than some of the Patriots' receivers have found the
past three games, and because of that Bledsoe is taking a pounding
and looking more and more confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three weeks we haven't produced,'' Bledsoe said after
completing 18 of 34 passes for only 205 yards with one interception
and those six sacks. ``What exactly the reason for that is, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't know, who does?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good teams and we're making mistakes that become
magnified because you are playing a good team and we are not able
to overcome it,'' Carroll said. ``What I will tell you is that we
have to go back to work and we have to hang together to create our
offense again because right now we don't have anything that is
giving us a chance to win football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   This does not sound like an answer to a question. This sounds
like a man lost in space. If that is the case, Carroll is not alone
in this feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have become a team in doubt. Although they try to
say the right words, what they say belies how they feel _ lost.
They doubt themselves. They doubt their coaches. They doubt the
plans they are being given. They doubt the kind of discipline that
comes too late and at the wrong time, as it seemed to Sunday when
Carroll finally decided to punish a player for his actions and
chose the worst of times to suddenly try to transform his image
from Barney into The Terminator.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's decision to bench his best receiver, Terry Glenn, for
the first quarter Sunday because he was two hours late for a
Thursday practice and had an interlude with the local constabulary
at 4 a.m. before his arrival might have made sense had Carroll not
spent the previous two years turning a blind eye to every such
transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the biggest game of the year, he benches his most potent
receiver when his team has the wind? And then puts him back into
the game in the second quarter against the wind and lets him play
the rest of the day? Is this discipline or self-flagellation?
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of Carroll's players wondered why the team was
being punished for one man's wayward ways in the biggest game of
the year. It was a question worth asking but, like most Sunday, it
had no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what that was and I don't have any other comment on
it,'' Carroll said when asked if the benching of Glenn had been a
punishment. What the question should have been was who was he
punishing, Glenn or everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of decision that makes you scratch your head,
but there were plenty of those Sunday. Perhaps the most glaring
came with 13 minutes to play and New England trailing, 17-0. The
ball was finally inside Bills territory at the 48, fourth and 1.
The Patriots knew what they had to do. They had to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   But not GO FOR IT, for Pete's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sneaking the ball for the first down to keep the
drive alive, something they've done successfully a half-dozen times
this year, they went for it all and threw the ball. Rather, they
tried to throw the ball, but Bledsoe never had a chance, being
sacked even though he was in the shotgun when the play began.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that all about?'' one Patriot defender rightfully
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But do we have an answer?
</P>
<P>
   I think not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a route that we wanted to throw right there,'' Carroll
explained. ``That situation is one that is really easy to critique
and be critical of and we were taking a shot to try to make a first
down. We didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   No they didn't. Not this day and not this season.

CARROLL NO ANSWER MAN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Having answered only a few questions, but
one too many for his liking, Patriots coach-under-fire Pete Carroll
concluded his postgame press conference Sunday with, ``I'm done.
See you.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Pete, the drug-free Daddy Butch Hobson of this southbound
train, is not the only problem with the 1999 New England Patriots,
but in the wake of another no-show, drum-beating _ this one a 17-7
thumping at the hands of the Buffalo Bills _ the coach admitted,
``I'm taking responsibility for these.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is taking responsibility, but unless he is playing dumb,
he has no answers for what is happening to his team. Many of the
folks on sports talk radio seem to have a better handle on the
problem, and that's a scary situation. Patriots owner Bob Kraft,
ever the locker room gadfly, has been conspicuously absent from the
postgame scene the last two weeks and Sunday left the premises well
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's abundantly clear that Carroll's players don't
take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the fellas be partying this week? Who'll be pulled
over by the cops at 4 a.m. or be late for practice? And what will
Pete do about it? Will he place individuals on double secret
probation? Hide the car keys? Send them to bed without dessert?
Lock up the pool cues? Force them to watch ``Regis and Kathie
Lee''?
</P>
<P>
   We're told he fined defensive back Lawyer Milloy and wideout
Vincent Brisby for their part in a Thanksgiving Eve altercation at
a charity event in Saugus. And he tried to get Terry Glenn's
attention by benching the receiver for the first period Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was late for a meeting Thursday and paid the price. Sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Glenn said of this latest embarrassment.
``Live it, learn from it, and move on. That's all I've got to say.
But you are either a championship team or not a championship team,
and no coming late to a meeting is going to keep you from being a
championship team. Take that the way you want.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's take it this way: Glenn is dumping all over his coach.
He does it when he is pulled over by the Foxborough cops in the wee
hours of the morning three days before game day. He does it when he
is late. He does it when he works out on his own offseason program.
And he does it with his latest statement.
</P>
<P>
   Not to bring up a sore subject, but can you imagine Glenn
getting away with all this with Bully Bill Parcells in charge? Is
it an accident that Parcells got the most out of Glenn _ way back
when the gifted receiver was a rookie?
</P>
<P>
   The Carroll Patriots are in the midst of their third annual Tuna
Meltdown. Every year since Parcells left, he has beaten the
Patriots in midseason and each Tuna loss triggered a major New
England swoon. In 1997 and '98, the Patriots went 1-3 after losing
to the Jets. This year they are 0-2 since the Jets beat them. This
makes them an aggregate 2-8 in midseason stretches that start
against the Tuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams play us with a lot of cover two (a cornerback bumps him
at the line, backed up by a safety),'' said Glenn. ``It seems like
Bill originated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beleaguered quarterback Drew Bledsoe (sacked six times, his team
8 for 37 in third-down efficiency over the last three weeks)
admitted, ``The Dolphins and Bills took a couple of things from
what the Jets did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, QB Drew was a ringleader in an infamous Patriot
off-field episode when he and teammates Max Lane and Scott Zolak
did a stage dive into a mosh pit at a Boston nightclub and were
sued by a young woman who suffered a spinal injury. In the ensuing
game, the Patriots were humiliated at Tampa Bay, 27-7. It was the
low point of Carroll's rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a new low, one that leaves the Patriots with
virtually no margin for error over the next five weeks. Once
playoff bound with a 6-2 record, they are 6-5 and have four
division losses.
</P>
<P>
   And Carroll has no answers. He continues his soft parade of
cliche and inaction. He admitted benching Glenn and fining Milloy
and Brisby, but said, ``We take care of that stuff internally. We
keep it in house.''
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, ex-Patriots beat New England. It's amazing. Has
any team ever lost three straight games that ended with one of its
former quarterbacks calling the plays (Ray Lucas, Zolak, Doug
Flutie)? Patriots fans watching Sunsday were treated to the sight
of castoff Sam Gash making a 31-yard TD catch and run. Then Gash
took his own shot at the Patriot organization.
</P>
<P>
   Leaderless, clueless, simmering on the edge of mutiny, the
Patriots lurch toward December facing a series of winnable games.
But it's hard to make a case for them this morning. It feels like
the window is closing on the young, talented group that made it to
the Super Bowl just before Carroll's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   And it feels like only a matter of weeks before Coach Carroll
utters a firm, final ``I'm done. See you.''

SONICS SEND MESSAGE TO PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was late in the fourth quarter Sunday night when
Sonics guard Brent Barry threw a pass off the backboard. Ruben
Patterson trailed, caught the ball and finished a stirring
alley-oop play.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Barry wondered aloud if the Indiana Pacers thought
he was gloating near the end of the Sonics' 102-91 win in KeyArena.
When asked the last time he threw such a playground-style lob,
Barry joked: ``When I was playing NBA Live on PlayStation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, though, was not the only one with a joystick in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the game wasn't nearly as close as the final score
indicated, there were plenty of times when the Sonics seemed to toy
with the Pacers. The Sonics (11-3) built a 17-point lead in the
first quarter and cruised to their sixth consecutive victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Barry-Patterson connection with 46 seconds left
put an exclamation point on a message the Sonics are trying to
send.
</P>
<P>
   Said point guard Gary Payton: ``We're trying to let people know
_ like the old Sonics of two or three years ago _ when you come in
here, it's not going to be that easy for you to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics made it difficult for the Pacers to compete, let
alone win.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense suffocated Indiana's heavy hitters _ Reggie Miller
and Mark Jackson _ early. Once the Sonics took that pair out of the
game, the Pacers offense seemed paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Payton mostly checked Miller, while Barry handled Jackson.
Miller and Jackson combined for eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's 31 points led four Sonics in double-figure scoring.
Horace Grant took advantage of the Pacers slow front line. He
finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics ran circles around the aging Pacers, who appeared
slow and lacked energy. The game perhaps gave Sonics coach Paul
Westphal a bit of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics basically won because of their energy. They
constantly beat the Pacers with fast breaks, and quick scores.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Westphal had to watch quicker, more athletic teams
outplay a ripe Sonics squad. But these Sonics gave Indiana coach
Larry Bird a taste of what Westphal has already gone through.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that hurts us is our foot speed,'' Bird said.
``We've played a lot of teams with quickness that are maybe getting
better looks. We haven't been as consistent as we'd like. Teams are
just beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Sonics keep moving right along _ surprisingly to
some and impressively to most.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Pacers' record, they are still considered one of the
top teams in the Eastern Conference. The Sonics had played just
three teams with winning records. So the victory was like passing a
quiz before taking a big test.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics face perhaps their toughest test to date when the Los
Angeles Lakers come to KeyArena Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win any games with your mouth. So I don't want to
start talking,'' Westphal said. ``Our record is 11-3. We haven't
played anybody yet according to anybody. So when we play somebody,
we'll find out what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   They still have not put together a solid game, if you wanted to
nitpick what the Sonics did against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   After charging ahead 35-18 in the second quarter, the Sonics
lead was cut to 54-42 at halftime. They stormed ahead 81-55 in the
third, and led by 21 points with 10:03 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics' bench players could not keep the cushion
warm against the Pacers' reserve unit. Westphal wound up having to
reinsert Payton, Barry, Patterson and Horace Grant with 7:25 left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 88-75 at that point. But their lead never dipped
below nine points. They compensated for 43-percent shooting by
holding the Pacers to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lapses we shouldn't have had. But I'm not too upset
about it. We did a lot of good things. ... We got stops when needed
them,'' Westphal said. ``I still think we can get more efficient
offensively. But when you shoot 43 percent and win a game going
away against a tough team like Indiana, that's something to be
happy about.''

BUCS STOP SEAHAWKS, 16-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So many things had gone so well for the Seahawks
during a five-game winning streak that staked them to an 8-2
record.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Sunday's game, that was again the case.
</P>
<P>
   The offense took the opening kickoff and moved smartly through
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' vaunted defense to a field goal by mixing
the passing of Jon Kitna and running of Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was dominating, limiting the Bucs to 156 total yards
by holding them to negative yardage on six series and fewer than 10
yards on 13 of their 15 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   They even knocked Trent Dilfer out of the game when defensive
end Phillip Daniels drove the Bucs quarterback to the Kingdome turf
on a third-quarter sack, breaking Dilfer's right collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was sorely missing: turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 games, the Seahawks did not force one.
Kitna, meanwhile, turned the ball over six times _ five
interceptions, one fewer than he had thrown in his first nine
starts, and a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of this glaring discrepancy was a 16-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said earlier in the week that turnovers would decide the
game,'' coach Mike Holmgren said. ``We had too many and we didn't
create any. That's exactly the story of this game _ it was
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough turnovers to gag the life from any chance the Seahawks
had of winning.
</P>
<P>
   But they live to learn from their mistakes, and try to find ways
to eliminate them next week against the Raiders in Oakland _ where
the Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the Raiders Sunday. At 8-3, the
Seahawks hold a two-game lead over the Chiefs (6-5) in the AFC
West.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat of Sunday's effort would make that a one-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very humbling loss but we're 8-3 and there's
absolutely no reason to go in the tank,'' guard Pete Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks can't allow the self-inflicted misery against the
Bucs to become self-doubt as they continue their quest of winning
the franchise's first division title since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a five-game win streak and we were feeling real good
about ourselves. Maybe too good,'' Watters said. ``But it's
happened everywhere I've been, even with the Niners. We bounced
back every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was upset, a little downcast and understandably
frustrated after the Seahawks produced their lowest point total
since being shut out in back-to-back games in the 2-14 season in
1992 _ a span of 115 games over almost seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmgren admitted his team was due for a game like this,
especially against a defense as aggressive and aggravating as the
Bucs'.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, something like this was going to happen,''
Holmgren said as he left his post-game news conference. ``We were
playing very, very well. But games like this just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also agreed with Watters' assessment that perhaps the
players were feeling too good about themselves after winning five
in a row and grabbing a three-game lead in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were feeling really good, and I want them to feel good,''
Holmgren said. ``But this feeling is a little new for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the locker room was a little too familiar for the
players who have been around as the Seahawks have failed to post a
winning record since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly what we'd done leading up to this game gave us
margin for error,'' Kendall said. ``But now we can't sit back and
think we've done anything. Like I've been saying for a while, 8-2
is a nice start, but until that little letter shows up next to your
name in the standings, it ain't over. This game proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense played well enough to win this game. Holmgren said
it, and so did any offensive player who was being honest with
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bucs ranked among the top 10, if not top five, in
almost every defensive statistical category, the Seahawks defenders
took it as a personal challenge to play with them, if not outplay
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been challenged all week to attempt to play as well as
their defense,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, who led the effort
with 12 tackles and a sack. ``We wanted to match their defensive
intensity. We didn't want to get shoved around. We didn't want to
be embarrassed. We just wanted to handle our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Despite playing without defensive tackle Sam Adams
(sprained knee) and cornerback Willie Williams (concussion), the
Seahawks yielded a season-low 156 yards. Without their 54-yard
drive to a Martin Gramatica field goal in the second quarter and a
67-yard drive to Shaun King's 2-yard touchdown pass to Patrick
Harper in the fourth quarter, the Bucs netted 25 yards on their
other 42 plays.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of dominating effort the defensive players have
been talking about turning in all season as they were allowing an
average of 341.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   But what's better? Allowing a lot of yards, and coming up with a
lot of turnovers? Or not allowing yards, and not getting turnovers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation when you don't get any turnovers,''
said Daniels, who couldn't even force one with his
collarbone-cracking sack of Dilfer. ``You can't win like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would have helped if the Seahawks offense could
have found a way to crack the Tampa Bay defense. The Bucs pressured
Kitna into a pathetic performance (19 of 44 for 197 yards) by
blitzing up the middle and into his face. They took away his
security-blanket crossing routes by dropping a linebacker into the
middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously had a really good game plan on defense,''
Watters said. ``We were kind of scratching our heads out there. It
was as if we didn't even practice, we didn't know where they were
coming from out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Seahawks are left to scratch to regain the swagger that
was slapped out of them as they head into a stretch of four games
against division opponents.

   ``We'll see how good a team we are next week when we play
Oakland in Oakland,'' Daniels said. ``We'll see how well we bounce
back from this situation.''

CARTER TOOK HIS CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins outshot the Islanders, 44-20, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
at the FleetCenter, but rookie New York goaltender Roberto Luongo,
a first-round pick (fourth overall) in the 1997 draft, was the
deciding factor in the Islanders' 2-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots didn't go in, and the bottom line is you've got to
score goals; you don't win games by outshooting the other team,''
said Bruins forward Anson Carter, who had his team's lone goal,
6:02 into the second period. His score tied the game at 1, Carter
taking a feed from Jason Allison behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen sometimes. We had a lot of quality shots,
so you've got to give their goalie credit,'' said Carter. ``He made
some good saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins kept putting pressure on Luongo, who had a 6-6-3
record in 15 games for Lowell in the American Hockey League with an
impressive 2.98 goals-against average and 90.6 save percentage.
Luongo, the highest-drafted goalie ever, got the call to the NHL
Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of pressure on Luongo late, but he kept the
puck from getting past him. ``There was a loose puck and I fanned
on it . . . those things are going to happen,'' said Carter, who
was switched from center to wing in the second period to give the
Bruins a lift offensively while teaming with Sergei Samsonov and
Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goalie was down and everyone was in front of the net and I
thought we had a chance to chip it over his shoulder, but it wasn't
meant to be,'' said Carter, who had eight shots during his 23:44.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns ``wanted to create some offense, (the
Islanders) really didn't have a so-called No. 1 line, and he wanted
to put me with Allie and Samsonov, hoping to generate some
things,'' Carter said. ``We didn't have much going in the first
period, and to generate more offense, he wanted more speed with
Allie to try to get the loose pucks.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal the Bruins did score was an impressive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice play,'' said Carter, who has seven goals and 19
points. ``Jason got it deep and I went in front of the net and I
made sure to yell at him early so he could look for me when he was
coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, the Islanders turned defensive while
sitting on their lead, getting outshot, 12-2. Even when the Bruins'
P.J. Axelsson drew a double major late in the game, New York had no
shots on net.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to protect the lead, they didn't give up the
big goal at a critical time during the game, so I have to take my
hat off to them,'' Carter said. ``I thought we'd tie it up, which
is typical of this club. We get stronger as the game goes on, but
we weren't able to get the key goal at the key time to get the
crowd into it, to get our bench pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing to the Islanders, in 14th place team in the Eastern
Conference, was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be successful in this league, you've got to
beat the teams you're supposed to beat, and we had a chance to beat
them and we should have beaten them,'' said Carter. ``It was a must
win for us, regardless where they are in the standings.''

BUCS' DEFENSE COMES UP `HUGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Trent Dilfer had to high-five his defensive teammates
with his left hand following Tampa Bay's 16-3 victory Sunday
against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer's right arm was in a sling and he was hurting after
breaking his collarbone in the third quarter. Still he managed to
smile broadly through the pain. Dilfer's replacement, rookie Shaun
King, had been effective. His defense had been dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay forced six Seahawks turnovers _ intercepting Jon Kitna
a career-high five times _ and kept Seattle out of the end zone for
the first time in Mike Holmgren's coaching tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reeling over the loss of Dilfer, who is likely out
for the season, the Bucs were basking in victory. It is the first
win against expansion-twin Seattle and a key momentum boost
entering next Monday night's pivotal game against Minnesota. Both
teams share the NFC Central Division lead with a 7-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did today ... it was huge,'' said Tampa Bay safety
John Lynch, who led the Bucs with seven tackles. ``This is a team
with a lot of pride, in our defense in particular. You look for
challenges like playing this caliber of team and we stepped it up
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's win over the surging Seahawks surprised no one in
the Bucs' locker room. The way they won may have.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, who had beaten only two winning teams, came to the
Kingdome ranked last in the league in turnover ratio. Usually they
are the team trying to compensate for miscues. And they didn't
expect that to change so dramatically this weekend considering
Kitna had led the Seahawks on a five-game winning streak and to the
AFC West Division lead by playing smart, mostly conservative ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ranks right up there with the our best performances,''
said All-Pro defensive tackle Warren Sapp, grinning after his
three-tackle, one-sack effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that we got him (Kitna) rattled, we just put
him in some positions that he wasn't comfortable in. We just kept
the pressure on him and forced him to make the plays. We didn't get
the number of sacks we wanted, but we got the pressure on him and
it got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Sapp said their team pretty much followed its game
plan. It naturally was concerned about facing elite players such as
Joey Galloway and Ricky Watters, but the Bucs felt they also knew
Holmgren's tendencies from his days coaching their NFC Central
rival Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren Sapp was really destructive,'' said Seahawks offensive
guard Brian Habib, whose line allowed three sacks. ``They had a lot
of guys who came on blitzes that we were not able to pick up.
Whether it was an assignment error, or just too many guys, we
couldn't pick it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the Seahawks, the Bucs' offense had helped Tampa Bay to
a four-game winning streak by being adequate, not flashy. The
defense has saved the offense on several occasions but Tampa Bay's
bench still took a collective gulp when Dilfer went down.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Eric Zeier was listed as the emergency quarterback for
this game, still not 100 percent recovered from a shoulder injury.
So King, a second round draft choice out of Tulane, made his first
regular-season appearance on the Bucs' opening drive of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which amassed a meager 48 yards total to that point,
went three-and-out in King's first two drives.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick Dunn's 17-yard run in the final seconds of the third
quarter finally gave the Bucs their first first down since the
opening quarter. Five plays later King connected with Patrick Hape
for a touchdown reception and a 13-3 scoring cushion. King finished
3-for-7 for 32 yards and led Tampa Bay to a field goal in addition
to his touchdown toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (King) seemed very confident when he first came into the
huddle, surprisingly confident,'' said veteran Bucs center Tony
Mayberry. ``I remember my first game and I was wide-eyed, but Shaun
did a great job of not getting rattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And thanks to our defense, we won. Again.''

LUCK RUNS OUT FOR KITNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He had become the Seahawks poster boy, the big-game
television promo, the local car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Jon Kitna got pulled down by the tacks, pre-empted by
Warren Sapp and taken for a test drive on his most trying day as a
starting NFL quarterback _ a five-interception, three-sack,
two-fumble shortfall in a 16-3 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Kitna had led a charmed life in his brief stay in
the pros. He had avoided adversity as he would one of those
300-pounders trying to take his head off. He had averaged less than
a pass theft and just 1{ sacks per game in 18 outings.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp and his overeager defensive cronies changed all that,
forcing the Central Washington University alum into a spate of
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Facing postgame inquisitors, Kitna recognized all this. He
accepted the blame. He also didn't seem too shaken by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll apologize to my teammates and move on,'' he said. ``I
just got a little greedy, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna started out against the Bucs as if he might be headed for
a career day. He connected on his first three passes. He drove his
club to the Tampa Bay 5 on the initial series, settling for a field
goal and what would be the Seahawks' only points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs had all the answers after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just a little confusion when the game
started,'' Seahawks tight end Christian Fauria said. ``We did a lot
of checking off that put us in positions we shouldn't have been in.
We usually correct those things. I was waiting for something to
happen where we got rolling, but we never got rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Said offensive guard Brian Habib, ``Jon got some pressure on
him. He might have made some bad throws out there, but I think we
all contributed to it. I don't think we helped him too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown knew what happened. He has been
on the delivery end of this sort of thing with opposing
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely feel for him,'' Brown said of Kitna. ``I'm
sure eventually he started pressing. You think you feel the rush
and you throw off the back foot and you just kind of lose what
makes you good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the interceptions piled up, Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren
said he never once considered pulling Kitna in favor of backup
quarterback Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren mentioned that veteran Miami quarterback Dan Marino, a
certain Hall of Famer once he retires, suffered through a
five-interception outing on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young quarterback, it was a harsh lesson,'' Holmgren
said. ``But I think it will be a lesson that he looks at and is
better because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his five misguided throws, Kitna insists he made a bad choice
on just one _ the second ball, a second-quarter toss over the
middle intended for Fauria, and intercepted by Bucs linebacker
Derrick Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second interception, that was a force and a press,'' Kitna
said. ``On the other ones, when you get down everybody knows you're
throwing and you have to try to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Brooks victimized him, Kitna had tried to find Joey
Galloway on a slant pattern and Bucs cornerback Donnie Abraham came
up with the ball early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay linebacker Alshemond Singleton and cornerbacks Ronde
Barber and Brian Kelly also had interceptions, while Sapp and
Brooks forced Kitna fumbles. Rubbing it in, Sapp did a little dance
after he created his turnover, holding the ball aloft while the
Kingdome crowd booed him. Sapp also was seen yapping at the
Seahawks quarterback after several plays.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna said he never got frustrated by his miscues or rattled by
Sapp's monologue.
</P>
<P>
   After the final gun had sounded, Kitna would take one more
blind-side hit before reaching the safety of his locker room. Of
course, it was Sapp. The oversize player ran down Kitna near the
Kingdome's south end zone and put him in a bearhug.
</P>
<P>
   The players exchanged good-natured words before heading to their
respective stadium corners. The healing process already had begun
for the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Maybe we'll see you in January,''' Kitna said,
referring to a possible Super Bowl game. ``He said, `If you got the
(stuff).' I said, `We got the (stuff).' ''

CELTICS HAVE 4 DAYS TO FIND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Paul Pierce left Philips Arena Saturday night, he had
nothing to say and no answers for why the Celtics suffered another
fourth-quarter collapse, against the Hawks. He walked brusquely to
the team bus, declining to comment about Boston's three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Let the soul-searching and problem-solving begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have almost a week to contemplate what went wrong.
They will find out Friday night against Miami whether it was enough
time to fix what's broken, restore team confidence, and again find
a way to finish off teams in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday between 1 and 3, Boston held an optional workout in
Waltham. Players who needed medical attention reported, as did
those who wanted to lift weights or work on specific parts of their
game. The coaching staff was available during the two-hour session.
Monday at practice, the coaches and players officially will start
addressing the team's recent difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was not alone in his quick exit or inability to find
suitable answers over the weekend. The visitors left the floor and
the arena as soon as possible. Following their 94-84 loss to
Atlanta, some of the men in green looked shaken. The locker room
scene was somber. The players seemed more devastated by their
final-quarter failure facing the Hawks than they had been over a
similarly scripted defeat one night earlier against the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said point guard Kenny Anderson.
``Even when we get a lead, we have to keep playing. We just didn't
do the things we needed to do to win. Everybody has the same
schedule. We can't make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Added forward Antoine Walker: ``Without question, it's
frustrating. If you care and you're trying to win, then you're
frustrated. We've shown that we can beat them. But we haven't put
them away. And it's coming back to haunt us. We beat ourselves
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Celtics have four days of practice to beat up on each
other in hopes of getting better.

DRIVERS WHO KILL GET OWN TASTE OF NO MERCY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gregory Francis Schmidt could spend 25 years behind
bars for not controlling his anger when a truck cut him off on the
freeway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of handling it as a daily irritation on a Phoenix-area
freeway, Schmidt squeezed off eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Gillis Champagne, 21, a passenger in the truck,
was dead. A bullet passed through his neck, severing an artery.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area is a hotbed for such hotheaded drivers, and
prosecutors and judges in Maricopa County show no mercy for such
violent reactions. Prison sentences are sought for anyone who
flashes or uses a gun on a roadway.
</P>
<P>
   When he is sentenced in January, Schmidt, 29, can expect to join
a string of Phoenix area men spending decades in prison because of
a flash of fury behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a very hard stance with people who solve problems on
the highway by using a gun,'' said Bill FitzGerald, spokesman for
the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable. You simply can't decide to solve a problem
by getting out a gun because you don't like how somebody drives or
how someone has given you a hand signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, road rage is unusual. Out of 177 million drivers,
about 1,000 die each year in such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, it's a different story.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city ranked third in the nation for dangerous
driving incidents and third again on a list of metropolitan areas
with the highest aggressive-driving death rates.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the growing violence, Arizona lawmakers in 1998
passed the nation's first aggressive-driving law, said Alberto
Gutier, director of the Governor's Office of Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Now, brazen drivers who make multiple risky maneuvers, such as
tailgating, unsafe lane changes or overtaking and passing another
vehicle on the right shoulder, can be cited.
</P>
<P>
   But passing laws is only a start, said Leon James, a University
of Hawaii professor known as Dr. Driving, whose lifework is to
educate and prevent driver warfare.
</P>
<P>
   He works with Congress and the states to develop prevention
programs. A pilot program in Miami-Dade County, Fla., which
features a video called ``Roadrageous,'' is the first to try
education in the battle against aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   What James really wants is to see laws passed requiring every
licensed driver to take periodic anger-management courses.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every American is an aggressive driver, he said. The
learning starts in the infant car seat, listening to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressive driving has been here since Roman times, since the
beginning of streets and horse-drawn vehicles,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is it can lead to an act of violence, which he said
is a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the mid 1980s, when traffic congestion became
reality for millions of Americans. It's so widespread now that some
therapists specialize in helping drivers afraid of losing control.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol and other drugs, particularly methamphetamine, commonly
play a role in road rage, James said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, at least six men are awaiting trial on
charges of killing people on the roadways during the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their victims were innocent passersby, people such as
Schara Marshall, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Schara was killed while returning from her first
homecoming dance. She was in a car the driver of which turned in
front of a truck in west Phoenix. A chase ensued. Shots were fired,
and Schara was struck in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had moved from the Sunnyslope area to a far west
Phoenix subdivision to get away from the crime, said her mother,
Bonnie Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Schara's killer still has not been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis Champagne's mother, Linda, said road rage is so
commonplace in the Phoenix area, victims often end up a mere
mention in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   That devastated Champagne after losing her son.
</P>
<P>
   She wants the world to know he was the light of her life. He
loved to help others. He wanted to be a physical therapist. He was
living at home to save money to marry his high school sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so into being physically fit,'' she recalled. ``He was
always telling me, `Mom, stand up straight! Watch your posture!' ''
</P>
<P>
   She still can't get used to the quiet in the house.
</P>
<P>
   His friends, family, the neighbor children, even his dog, will
never fully recover from the loss, said Champagne, an obstetrics
nurse at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this happen?'' asked the mother, who still cries at
the mention of his name. ``He was only a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   She still struggles to get up in the morning, but she's ready to
bring something positive from the sadness.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Roger, want to get a state law passed to
make it a crime to carry loaded weapons in a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not follow it,'' she said. ``But it would give
police a little more control. It might save someone's life.'' &QL;

HISPANICS RESIST ARIZONA'S REDISTRICTING LAW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Seven months after Arizona Gov. Jane Hull signed a law
that governs how boundaries for Arizona voting districts are drawn,
local and national Hispanic leaders remain hopeful that it will be
struck down on the basis that it weakens the political power of
Latinos and other people of color.
</P>
<P>
   A score of national civil rights groups and Hispanic
politicians, mostly Democrats, contend that the U.S. Justice
Department should block the law, which requires the Arizona
Legislature to use exact head counts in redrawing political
boundaries after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say an exact head count is a flawed method that was
shown to undercount Hispanics by more than 1 million people during
the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``will deny minorities the representation they
deserve,'' said Rep. Ramon Valadez, D-Tucson. ``This law was
clearly passed with the intent to discriminate (against
minorities).''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up an estimated 20 percent of Arizona's
population, yet only four of the 30 state senators and seven of the
60 state representatives are Hispanic, Valadez said.
</P>
<P>
   Using more accurate census numbers in the next round of
redistricting will offer better opportunities for Hispanic voters
to elect a candidate of their choice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Wes Marsh, a Republican from District 28 who championed the
law, rejects the notion the head count system will hurt minorities.
He said Friday that he is confident Arizona will be able to prove
the law benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intent to discriminate against anyone,'' Marsh
said. ``We don't want to guess. We want to use exact numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is still waiting for Arizona to submit
information, including committee reports and a list of minority
groups it has consulted about the law, that shows the law doesn't
stifle ethnic minorities' political power, a spokeswoman for the
Justice Department's civil rights division said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has already failed to reply to the Justice Department's
September deadline, Christine DiBartolo said. Still, the state can
submit the information anytime, with the caveat that the law can't
go into effect until the Justice Department signs off on it, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stein, chief counsel for the civil rights division of the
Arizona Attorney General's Office, wasn't available for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 census, an exact head count method was used to
calculate population figures and data that ranged from age and
income to ethnic origin. Afterward, the Census Bureau randomly
surveyed 150,000 households to see how close the two sets of
numbers and data matched up.
</P>
<P>
   The findings showed that the exact head count system missed
about 5 percent, or more than 1 million, of the Hispanics
nationwide, said Marisa Demeo of the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, a national civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, at least 90,000 people were not counted, more than
30,000 of whom were Latinos and roughly 20,000 Native Americans,
Demeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Demeo and other minority rights advocates theorize that
Hispanics and other people of color, especially recent immigrants,
tend not to return mail surveys because of cultural and language
differences. Many newcomers, in particular undocumented immigrants
from Mexico and other Latin American or South American countries,
fear any questionnaires would be used to deport or discriminate
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to produce a more accurate count, the Clinton
administration endorsed a plan to contact 90 percent of all
residents in the country in 2000, then use statistical sampling to
estimate the makeup of the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, fear sampling will overestimate minorities,
who in most cases tend to join the Democratic Party or have
Democratic leanings. Thus, congressional Republicans challenged the
census plan in court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against using sampling
to reallocate federal congressional seats. But the court left up to
the states to decide what numbers to apply, either exact head
counts or sampling, when redoing local political districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the court's ruling, the Census Bureau will now try to
count everyone, instead of just 90 percent of households originally
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau will then conduct a survey of 300,000 households in
the country, said Pat Cantwell of the Census Bureau in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   After comparing the results from the head count and the survey,
the bureau will estimate those missed and adjust the numbers,
Cantwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The department will subsequently release two sets of numbers:
the head count and those drawn from the representative sample,
Cantwell said. &QL;

CITIES, STATES LOBBY FOR THEIR SHARE OF INTERNET INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Newspapers
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Almost every day, thousands of people plop down
in front of their home computers to buy everything from groceries
to books to cars.
</P>
<P>
   They shop without the hassle of leaving home, battling traffic
or fighting crowds. Just a few keystrokes and the merchandise is
theirs. No clerks. No lines. And, often, no sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a break for consumers now may mean tax increases for
them in the future, say city and state officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, consumers save on sales tax when they buy
over the Internet from a company not in their state.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, state and municipal leaders are afraid they
will lose tax revenue to Internet sales, forcing them to raise
other taxes to offset those losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs police protection, fire protection, streets,
roads, schools and all the things that make a community work,''
said Randy Arndt, spokesman for the National League of Cities in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are not paying sales tax as electronic commerce
grows, what you are doing is shifting a higher and higher
percentage of the cost of services to the sales taxes collected
over the counter or to property taxes, income taxes and other sorts
of things,'' Arndt said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that states are constitutionally barred from
collecting sales taxes on businesses that don't have a
``substantial physical presence'' within their boundaries. Since
many Internet and catalog sales are made across state borders, the
transactions can't be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing their potential problem, cities and states across the
country are campaigning for the ability to tax Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Just how Internet sales would be taxed is complicated by the
fact that sales taxes differ from city to city and state to state.
Some items, such as food, are taxed in some states but not in
others.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 7,600 taxing jurisdictions throughout the
country. States and cities are banding together to come up with a
simplified way for multistate sellers to collect sales taxes on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the local businesses that sell their goods on the Internet
is Wolferman's Inc. of Lenexa, Kan. Wolferman's, a 111-year-old
gift company known for its 2-inch-tall English muffins, sells about
600,000 gifts a year. About 80,000 of the gifts are sold over the
Internet, mostly to out-of-state customers, said Mike Ruchensky,
the company's vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ruchensky said it's one thing to collect sales tax for a
Missouri or Kansas customer. It's another to collect sales tax for
some city in Pennsylvania, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that it would cost his company about $25,000 to buy
the computer software needed to collect sales tax nationally. He
said that expense could be prohibitive for some smaller companies
that sell on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to collect (sales taxes) for every township, city
and county and state across the country, that's when it gets
complex, that's when it gets difficult,'' Ruchensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruchensky said he didn't think his company would lose a lot of
business if Internet sales transactions were taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't tend to look at sales tax when they're buying
gifts,'' he said. ``People are shopping online because it's easy,
it's convenient and it's always available.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is being studied by the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce. The commission was created by Congress last
year to examine issues related to taxing the Internet. At that
time, Congress placed a three-year moratorium on imposing new
Internet taxes to give the commission time to develop its
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The panel had 18 months to study the issue, after which it would
submit a report to Congress. The report is expected in April.
Congress has the final decision about whether states and local
governments can tax Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities and states want their fair share,'' said Kansas City
Councilman Kelvin Simmons, who serves on a National League of
Cities steering committee that is studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he had talked with city financial analysts to try
to figure out how much money the city is missing out on, but there
are no definitive numbers yet.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Internet sales are booming nationwide, but cities
and states share in none of that revenue. In an economic downturn,
the extra revenue could be critical to cities' financial survival,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities would like to see the feds give great deference to them
in regard to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is opposed by some consumer groups who note that states
have been collecting large budget surpluses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of money grab is unnecessary,'' said James Plummer,
a policy analyst at Consumer Alert, a nonprofit consumer advocacy
group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are already paying plenty of taxes. They don't need
to have state and local governments collecting taxes from
businesses in other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Andal is a member of the federal panel studying Internet
taxation. He opposes any attempt by the states to tax Internet
sales unless the seller has a substantial physical presence in the
state.

<P>
   ... the seller has a substantial physical presence in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that local government will shut down if it can't tax
Internet sales are ``hysterical,'' said Andal, who serves on a
California state board that controls the state revenue department.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they got their way and they were able to start this massive
new sales (tax) compliance program...they would harm the growth of
the Internet and actually harm revenues they are getting from the
growth of the Net,'' Andal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking strictly at just a revenue picture, the
states are winning. There is a lot more money coming in as a result
of the Internet,'' he said. ``Those companies are hiring thousands
of people and paying good salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study conducted at the Center for Research in
Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas showed that
e-commerce has created 400,000 jobs within the past year.
Researchers surveyed 3,400 Internet companies, of which about a
third hadn't existed before 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies suggest that any economic growth created by the
Internet might be choked off if Internet sales were taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of
Chicago, conducted his own study of 25,000 online buyers. He
concluded that imposing a sales tax on remote commerce would cut
spending by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to taxing Internet sales is building in Congress.
Bills already have been introduced in the House and the Senate to
make permanent the temporary ban on Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah outlined a plan
for states to phase in a voluntary, simplified e-commerce tax
system in which a ``trusted third party'' would use computer
software to calculate, collect and distribute sales taxes based on
the location of the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, chairman of the National Governors' Association, will
present the proposal to the e-commerce advisory commission when it
meets in San Francisco in December.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $170 million in taxes already is going uncollected
because of Internet sales, according to a study released last
summer by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young. That figure represents
just a fraction of 1 percent of total state and local government
sales-tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Local government leaders say they aren't as worried now as they
will be in five or six years, when Internet sales are projected to
reach between $100 billion and $200 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the current level, it may not present a significant
challenge, but I don't think you can look at it today and assume
that it's going to remain that way,'' said Overland Park Mayor Ed
Eilert. ``The correct assumption is that Internet transactions will
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, Kansas is expected to lose about $49 million in
uncollected taxes on Internet sales, according to a report by
Shirley Sicilian, director of the Office of Policy &AMP; Research at
the state's Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Missouri is looking at estimated losses ranging as
high as $100 million by 2003, said George Rafael, director of
legislation and regulations for the Missouri Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Some have predicted that the Internet would change the face of
shopping as we know it. ``Kiss Your Mall Goodbye,'' proclaimed a
headline on the cover of a 1998 issue of Time.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsday suggestion that the Internet eventually will
replace the shopping mall couldn't have been welcome news for
cities that depend heavily on sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Park Mall generates sales taxes for Overland Park, Kan.,
totaling about $3.9 million a year, or about 9 percent of the
city's total sales-tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club Plaza each year generates about $20 million in
sales taxes, of which Kansas City gets between $5 million and $5.6
million, city officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes from the Plaza make up 4 percent to 4.5 percent of
the $120 million that Kansas City collects in sales taxes each year
for several specific purposes such as Liberty Memorial, the Kansas
City Area Transportation Authority, capital improvements and debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people continue to use catalog sales or Internet sales on
an increased basis, then it will affect our ability to receive tax
revenues for those kinds of programs,'' said Janice Reed, Kansas
City's finance director.
</P>
<P>
   The issue takes on added significance for some suburban
governments in the Kansas City area that get more than 25 percent
of their money from sales taxes. For example, Overland Park gets
about 46 percent of its revenue from sales taxes. Shawnee gets
about 56 percent from sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, some suburban governments depend on sales taxes,
but not to such a large extent. Independence gets about 29 percent
of its money from sales taxes. Lee's Summit collects 24 percent
from sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, the situation isn't any better.
</P>
<P>
   Both Missouri and Kansas lean on sales taxes. This year, Kansas
took in about 40 percent of its general-fund revenue, or $1.6
billion, from sales taxes. About $1.7 billion, or 25 percent, of
Missouri's general revenue fund came from sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that revenue source is no longer there or dissipates
significantly because of Internet transactions that aren't taxable,
then where does local government go?'' asked Overland Park Mayor
Eilert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other taxing source that local governments have is
the property tax.''
Kansas City Star reporter Lynn Horsley and The Associated Press

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ He tells you he knows exactly what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he's telling himself, trying to convince himself that
it won't really be so bad.
</P>
<P>
   But it will. Oh, yes. It will.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those first 14 games of Steve Francis' NBA career.
This is the night when the rookie point guard gets his real baptism
as a professional by the city _ and the country _ he spurned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever started a game at Duke's Cameron Indoor
Stadium?'' Francis asks a short, middle-aged columnist in what
might be the most ridiculous question of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I want to tell him. There was the night Michael Jordan,
James Worthy and Sam Perkins couldn't hit Tobacco Road from the
sidewalk, and I had to drop in 30 to bail out North Carolina. Or
the time when I launched an airball that Lorenzo Charles caught and
dunked, resulting in Jim Valvano's giving me a hug a midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   But his eyes are a little glassy, and Francis is staring off
into space, trying to sell himself on the notion that he has seen
and heard the worst that fans can offer. Of course, he hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Duke students are crazy,'' Francis said. ``They're loud,
and they're all pumped up, and they never shut their mouths.
Nothing can be wilder than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not wilder, just more vicious, and shouted with much more
venom. For all of their loud reputation, the Dookies are known more
for the cleverness of their opponent-baiting. But just as the game
is different at the NBA level, here you put a deep-pocketed wise
guy in a $300 courtside seat and serve him a couple of drinks, and
the things that come out of his mouth might be enough to curl
Methuselah's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely worried about Steve,'' said Charles Barkley.
``He doesn't know what he's in for.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the team, it is the second stop on the ``Friends
Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   First Scottie Pippen in Portland, and now the raft of former
Rockets _ Othella Harrington, Michael Dickerson, Brent Price and
Antoine Carr _ in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But for Francis, it is the return to the scene of the crime. The
crime: never having made the scene after the Grizzlies took him
with the No. 2 overall selection in the NBA draft last June.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and his agent had told management he did not want to
play in Vancouver. He said it was too far away from his family in
Maryland. He said he wanted to play point guard in the NBA and
noted that the Grizzlies already had a young player at that spot in
Mike Bibby. He had made his position clear, he thought. Which
explains the look Francis wore _ that of sucking on a lemon _ when
commissioner David Stern announced his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business decision,'' Francis said. ``Nothing personal
against anybody and nothing against the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Vancouver Province ran a large, blunt,
two-word headline: ``Head Case!''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Francis was being vilified coast-to-coast in two
countries as just another example of today's spoiled young athlete.
</P>
<P>
   So does anyone remember an All-America quarterback with a
poster-boy smile who did virtually the same thing in 1983, refusing
to play for the Baltimore Colts and engineering a trade to Denver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to talk to John Elway about that someday,''
Francis said. ``But I guess it all eventually worked out for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the Rockets are hoping for Francis. After 14
games, there have been flashes of athletic brilliance mixed with so
many moments of rookie bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard what they said about him right after the draft,''
said coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``But we did our homework, we talked
to so many people, and we haven't seen signs that he's some
big-headed kid. I think he just wanted to play this position and
play someplace where he felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis is not Pippen, who as a free agent made a choice to join
the Rockets, signed a five-year, $82 million contract, then cut and
ran after one disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   But just because you're a rookie, should you not use the
leverage if you have it? After all, why become the next Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, the best young player nobody knows? Why tie yourself
to a hapless franchise that hasn't had a 25-win season in four
years of existence and is in danger of being relocated to who knows
where?
</P>
<P>
   Francis is a sincere, hard-working kid who wants to be in
Houston even at 3-11 and believes he's ready to handle anything,
even this. The chants, the slurs, the personal insults.
</P>
<P>
   I'd tell him what it was like when I dumped on Larry Bird at
Boston Garden, but he'll find out soon enough.

KANSAS CITY CENTER WATCHES WEATHER OVER HALF THE PLANET FOR
AIRCRART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Newspapers
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A three-mile-high volcano in Ecuador is spewing
a plume of ash that has drifted 78 miles. A low cloud cover
blankets a swath from the Carolinas to Florida. Low-level
turbulence over California could lead to dangerous wind shears in
canyons and passes.
</P>
<P>
   All of these weather conditions are of vital interest to any
aircraft cruising through those areas _ not to mention passengers
traveling over the peak air travel period between Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Larry Jacobs is around to warn pilots about weather
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs sits in the Aviation Weather Center, a nondescript
concrete building surrounded by Platte County fields, not far from
Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the world is at his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   A computer monitor shows the Tungurahua volcano as a bright red
spot on a satellite mosaic of South America. Another monitor shows
thunderstorm activity over Australia and Indonesia. A bank of
screens tracks atmospheric conditions across North America and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever information we can get, we are grateful,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other meteorologists at the Aviation Weather Center take
thousands of bits of data and weave a picture that is crucial to
pilots flying over half the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has the National Weather Service's only center for
issuing condition alerts and warnings for American and foreign
aircraft from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans. In March, it will
assume responsibility for the Caribbean tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City also has one of two World Area Forecast System
centers that, by international agreement, divide responsibility for
the big picture of global aviation weather. The other center is
near London.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of 49 government employees at the Aviation Weather
Center work round-the-clock collecting information from satellites,
radar, weather balloons, ground stations and pilot reports.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorologists study them and issue 24-hour forecasts,
continually sending out bulletins so pilots will know about
turbulence, wind direction, icing conditions, visibility and a
range of factors that can affect a smooth and safe flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our stock in trade, providing information on hazards,''
said Fred Foss, chief of domestic operations at the center. ``If we
weren't here, then there would be no assurance to the fliers,
thence to the flying public, that some human being was constantly
looking, surveying the airspace for hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   The information is not useful just to large carriers. Private
aviators outnumber commercial aircraft by more than 10 to one and
also use the information, especially to learn about conditions that
require instrument navigation instead of visual observation.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has had a government weather station since 1888.
Aviation forecasts became routine in the 1920s. In 1982 a national
aviation weather unit was established here.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Aviation Weather Center moved from the 17th floor
of the Bolling Federal Building downtown to the $10 million
structure it shares with the National Weather Service's training
center.
</P>
<P>
   The new building has an uninterruptible power supply and backup
generators, which already have proved necessary when a backhoe
severed a power cable. The computer screens didn't go dark.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is part of the National Weather Service, the
aviation center contributes to a system that is run by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Advisories and warnings from the Kansas City center are
transmitted to the 21 FAA regional control centers across the
country, such as in Olathe. From there, the pertinent portions are
radioed directly to the cockpits. The information also is sent to
the airlines' dispatching centers, which strategically manage the
movement of their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information is available at www.awc-kc.noaa.gov on
the Internet. Various commercial outlets use the government data to
tailor products for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries provide similar services within their domestic
airspace. But regional operations are gradually being phased out as
the World Area Forecast System is consolidated into just the Kansas
City and London operations, said David Rodenhuis, director of the
Kansas City center.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its global responsibilities, the Kansas City center
is experimenting with a project aimed at reducing delays on U.S.
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says nearly three-fourths of all flight delays in 1999
have been caused by weather. The Air Transport Association, an
industry trade group, estimates delays cost $4.5 billion in the
$775 billion commercial airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two summers, forecasters have attempted to provide
as much as six hours warning of thunderstorms. Then they
collaborate online with the FAA and with as many as a dozen private
airlines to map out a national strategy for re-routing flights and
avoiding congestion at hubs.

   Delays can be exacerbated by a projected rise in passenger
travel and an additional 2,500 aircraft in American skies by 2008.
Theoretically, greater lead-time in storm warnings, and more
cooperation between industry and government, can help air traffic
move more efficiently.

   ``This is still experimental but we're trying to make it
operational,'' Rodenhuis said. ``There have been some adjustments
all along, but we're getting better at it.''

FLUTIE WEARS HIS SUCCESS WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Ex-Boston College Eagle that he is, and
always will be, Doug Flutie came to his postgame news conference
Sunday fully prepared to defend the honor of The Heights. The loss
of a friendly bet with Bills teammate Bruce Smith left Flutie in
the embarrassing position of having to wear a Virginia Tech
baseball cap to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd wear it,'' said a smiling Flutie, promptly turning
the maroon Tech cap backward over his locks and topping it with,
what else, a Boston College cap. ``I just didn't say how I'd wear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-creative Flutie again worked the field Sunday, much
like he did in his long-ago college days, helping to orchestrate a
17-7 win over the Patriots. Flutie tossed a pair of TD passes _ one
to top receiver Eric Moulds and another to ex-Patriot Sam Gash _
and otherwise prevented a strong New England defense from taking
away too much of the Ralph Wilson turf.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be forgotten, either, was the performance of the equally
stingy Buffalo defense. The Patriots could muster only 93 yards on
the ground (vs. 92 by the Bills) and 205 yards in the air (vs. 207
by the Bills). The difference in the score came down to the two
strikes Flutie tossed to Moulds and Gash, but it was all backed by
the grinding Buffalo defense that gave up only one big play (a Drew
Bledsoe 45-yard TD pass to Terry Glenn) all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to play conservatively,'' said Flutie, eager to
acknowledge his supporting defense, even if he has made a career
out of running and gunning, especially in his Canadian salad days.
``You're out there, and you know the defense is shutting 'em down.
Because the defense is playing so well, there's never really a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is a rock _ it's their second shutout this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his math is lacking some, but his touch remains much the
same. Bledsoe's TD pass to Glenn came late in the fourth quarter, a
fact that Flutie, likely along with many others in the crowd,
simply didn't factor in the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie began to put away the victory with a quick-strike drive
in the closing moments of the first half. The Bills, holding a 3-0
lead, began a drive on their 42 with only 1:37 to go. He first hit
Jonathan Linton out of the backfield for a 4-yard pickup, then
connected on the next play on a 54-yard TD strike to Moulds. Two
plays, 36 seconds, game effectively finished.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel was in man-to-man coverage against Moulds, but
slipped just as Moulds blew past him, ultimately leaving Moulds
with open acres to haul in Flutie's relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him get some outside release,'' said Flutie. ``Then, as
I released it, (Moulds) started to stumble a little bit. But he got
in his I've-got-to-get-it speed and went and got it. At first, I
thought, `Oh, my God, I might have overthrown it.' But he got
outside very quickly, and no way once Israel stumbled was he going
to keep up with Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was still working with the 10-0 lead when Gash, his
trusty fullback, popped out to the right side for a familiar
play-action pass. Gash ended up trotting it in for a 31-yard TD,
after keeping just inbounds by employing a slow-rotation spin
within inches of the sideline. Solid most of the day, the New
England defense was embarrassed by the poor coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to (Gash), `You don't get your hands on it very often,
and when you do you've got to make it last,' '' said Flutie.
``Sam's one of the great leaders on this team. He keeps his mouth
shut, and does some of the real dirty work, banging up in (the
line) all the time, and he just doesn't complain about anything.
And he's also got a pair of great hands for that kind of play
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The TD strike to Gash was Flutie's 16th this season. He broke
the 200-yard plateau for the seventh time this season and has 2,536
yards through the air this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a little more today because I know people back home
are watching,'' said Flutie, who also spent three years with the
Patriots, using most of that time wondering what in the world to do
with his talents. ``Usually, when my season ended in Canada, I'd
come back and watch their games. The Pats were my home team . . . I
know their people on the field a lot more than any other NFL team,
that's for sure.''

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION

REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

AWARD-WINNING EFFORT BY GASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Every Monday, the Bills hand out a weekly
award, for which there is no silver-plated bowl, lacquered plaque,
or even so much as a US Savings Bond. The Sam Gash Award is
presented to the Bill who plays with the most grit, determination
and 60-minute selflessness, usually between the hours of 1-4 p.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gash, who regularly did all of that during his six years with
the Patriots, played with his usual thump and bump in the Bills'
impressive 17-7 win here Sunday over New England. The wide-bodied
fullback did his usual job of playing can opener for the Bills'
running backs, but he also hauled in a career-best 31-yard
touchdown pass from Doug Flutie to help send his ex-teammates
reeling out of Ralph Wilson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game you win is a big win,'' said the ever-humble Gash,
who showed up at the postgame podium in his standard steel-toed
work boots and rugged-wear jeans, looking more longshoreman than
million-dollar battering ram. ``But (when playing New England),
yeah, I have a lot of personal feelings that I don't care much
about. I've still got a lot of good friends over there, guys I
played with and everything . . . but as far as the team and the
organization, I'm just not a big fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beloved by his teammates during his six years in Foxborough, the
now 30-year-old Gash departed as a free agent after the '97 season.
It was Pete Carroll's first year in charge on the New England
sideline and it was also the season Gash was building himself back
from the knee injury that ended his '96 season _ relegating him to
crutches and sideline cheerleading when the Patriots went on to the
Super Bowl in January of '97.
</P>
<P>
   Here in hard-hat Western New York, the 240-pound Gash is equally
embraced by his teammates. Come this morning, coach Wade Phillips
will call his charges together and give out The Gash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like in fun,'' said Gash, sounding slightly
embarrassed by it all, undoubtedly realizing such awards typically
are handed out in the names of players past, not present. ``I guess
it's given out to guys who play hard and who are unheralded. I
don't know much about it really other than, you know, I get it
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought he might be presented his own award Monday,
Gash smiled somewhat sheepishly and said, ``I might be in the
running.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Berchtold, the club's vice president of
communications, Phillips has presented the award both seasons that
Gash has been with the Bills. The award presentation is, like Gash,
made with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys circle around, Coach names who it is, and the guys
stand and applaud,'' said Berchtold. ``That's about it . . . and
Sam's usually the guy who wins it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gash was somewhat out of character when he hauled in his second
TD pass of the season. Rather than boring into the New England
line, creating space for running backs Antowain Smith or Jonathan
Linton, he popped out toward the right sideline on a play-action
pass with a little less than five minutes gone in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play we've seen a lot,'' said Phillips. ``But evidently
(New England) hadn't seen it. They were defending the run and it
kind of caught everyone in there a little bit. And I know now
everyone is going to be saying, `Why don't you run Sam more?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gash as a running back was a topic of conversation during the
week. The Bills' No. 1 runner, Smith (nine carries, 21 yards
Sunday) was limping around with a turf toe suffered two weeks
earlier. But Phillips was adamant that he wanted to keep Gash at
fullback and stick with a rotation of Smith and Linton (17 carries,
67 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our best blocker, but he's not our best ball-carrier,''
Phillips had said about Gash. ``We wouldn't have a lead blocker,
and that's his position. In my expert opinion, he's not a featured
ball carrier, expect maybe for high school. What he does here is
block, and slip out sometimes and catch a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Gash did when the Bills stood, first and 10, at
the New England 31. Flutie connected with him at the 18 and Gash,
eluding the likes of Andy Katzenmoyer and Chris Carter, made a slow
spinning move at the sideline, a square dancer suddenly slipping
into ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd call that a Barry Sanders move,'' said
Linton, amused at the comparison made by someone in the postgame
crowd. ``That was more like Barry Word, maybe. Hey, he's a great
player, it couldn't happen to a better guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gash, no surprise, wasn't the least bit boastful about the poor
man's pirouette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd pull out an old spin move from high school,'' he
said, after first crediting wide receiver Andre Reed with a clean
pick to open up the passing possibility. ``So, I just spun as slow
as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in turn, screwed the Patriots a little deeper into the
turf.

MAKE NO MISTAKE, BILLS' STRATEGY WORKED
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By WILL MCDONOUGH 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ The Buffalo mind-set was this: If we don't
screw it up, they won't beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been killing ourselves with mistakes,'' said Bills
general manager John Butler outside his team's locker room an hour
before kickoff Sunday. ``We've done some foolish things, made some
stupid mistakes at the wrong time. We can't keep doing that and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Patriots, the Bills weren't playing
giveaway Sunday. They played a solid ``team'' game, and converted
big plays at critical times, something the Patriots could not do on
either side of the ball during a 17-7 Buffalo victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our defense would do a good job,'' said Bills
offensive coordinator Joe Pendry after the game. ``We didn't want
to turn the ball over and give them good field position. We wanted
to stay patient, we wanted to be efficient, and we did that. Both
sides did the job. We got enough on offense, and our defense played
a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defensive game plan surprised Pendry and Doug
Flutie in the first half. ``We knew they would play some
eight-man-up stuff on defense, but not as much as they did,'' said
Pendry. ``They were determined to stop our run, and in the first
half they did.''
</P>
<P>
   It was very windy in Ralph Wilson Stadium. ``This is a day you
run the ball here,'' said Bills former All-Pro guard, Reggie
McKenzie, before the game. ``It will be tough to throw the ball
consistently with the wind like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had a similar strategy. Throw short, try to establish
the run. The irony of the first half was that Buffalo was
outrushed, 75-11, when it was supposed to be the superior running
team, and still led, 10-0, at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in the game,'' said Buffalo linebacker John
Holecek, ``is that we made two big plays on defense when they were
driving the ball in our territory. We got the interception, and
then stopped them inside our 10 when we (forced a) fumble. They
were driving the ball on us, and we didn't think they could do that
to us. They had us a little off-balance. In the second half, we
made some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo went ahead, 3-0, in the first period when a very
generous pass interference call went against the Patriots' Chris
Carter at the New England 8, a penalty that cost the Patriots 42
yards and resulted in a 28-yard field goal by Steve Christie.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball 10 of the first
13 minutes and couldn't do anything with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we hit that touchdown pass to Eric Moulds, we had only
eight offensive plays in that period,'' said Pendry. ``We (the
defense) couldn't seem to get the ball back. They were driving it
and holding it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, who were being outplayed, got the ball back at their
42 with 1:37 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the wind that period and weren't doing anything with
it,'' said Pendry. ``I asked Doug before the game if the wind was
going to bother him and he said no. So we took the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On second and 6 from his 46, with 1:09 to play, Flutie went into
a no-back backfield. He stood in the shotgun, alone, with five
receivers spread across the field. ``They blitzed us,'' said
Pendry. ``So we knew we had man coverage. Doug saw it coming and
threw it to Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulds was shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve Israel racing down
the field, but Israel fell down, and Moulds was all alone to gather
in the Flutie floater and run for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots gave us a few plays we hadn't seen from them
before,'' said Buffalo defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell. ``So we
made some adjustments at the half.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo went ahead, 17-0, early in the third, virtually putting
the game away when Sam Gash caught a 31-yard touchdown pass from
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they were playing so many men on the line to stop our
run,'' said Pendry, ``play-action passes became our biggest weapon.
On the one to Sam (Gash), he released out of our backfield and
their linebacker couldn't stay with him. That type of play worked
well for us. We froze the linebackers and Doug did a good job of
getting it to the right guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was an efficient 5 for 6 passing in the first half. He
was 9 for 16 in the game, averaging more than 11 yards per attempt,
which is extremely high. Most of his throws were for 10 yards or
fewer, and they dinked and dunked their way down the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coverage was excellent,'' said Cottrell. ``We covered
their guys. We made Drew (Bledsoe) hold the ball, and this gave our
rush a chance to get to him. We didn't blitz him as much as the
Jets and Miami did, but our front four did a great job of getting
to him. But they had time because of the coverage we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was sacked six times, Flutie once. Bledsoe had one
interception, Flutie had none. Flutie had guys open. For the most
part, Bledsoe did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't upset that we didn't get the shutout,'' said
Cottrell. ``They only scored 7, and that came late in the fourth
period. They made a great play, and we didn't. I said to
(cornerback) Thomas (Smith) after their touchdown, `Which way is
the wind blowing?' He rolled his eyes up a little bit, and he said,
`Oh, I forget Coach.' It was into the wind. Before the game I
cautioned our guys about underthrown balls into the wind, and to be
careful, and that's what happened. But we didn't come for the
shutout. We came for the win, and that's all that mattered.''

MINUTEMEN ENJOY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Nothing exceeds a national championship,
particularly when you win it after coming off a 2-9 campaign, your
school's worst finish this century. Following that up with a share
of your league title this season, after a 1-3 start, is impressive,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if you want more proof of the unprecedented success the
University of Massachusetts football team has had under second-year
coach Mark Whipple, consider this: The Minutemen have played 27
games under Whipple (22 regular season, five postseason), and in
each contest, they have entered the fourth quarter with a chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Hofstra led UMass, 27-7, entering the fourth, and
went on to win, 27-14. That has been the toughest hill the
Minutemen have had to climb since Whipple took over.
</P>
<P>
   Even Division 1 Toledo couldn't stage a rout, leading 17-3
entering the fourth before winning, 24-3. The Minutemen's other
loss this season was a 26-21 decision to Villanova, in which UMass
failed to score deep in Wildcat territory as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they suffered a 33-30 loss at Delaware (which led,
26-23, entering the fourth), a 44-41 overtime defeat to Connecticut
(which trailed, 41-34) in Storrs, and a 28-27 setback to UConn in
Amherst (with the score tied at 21).
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't surprising that the defending Division 1-AA
national champions would enter overtime in Saturday's first-round
playoff game against Furman more composed than their host. Entering
the fourth quarter, UMass led, 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-seeded Minutemen went on to beat the seventh seed,
30-23, in overtime on a Marcel Shipp 1-yard run and a solid
defensive stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the best time I've had playing football, and
I just thank God I had the opportunity to play in it,'' said UMass
quarterback Todd Bankhead. ``I'm just glad to have the opportunity
to continue playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, UMass was 10-3 in contests in which it
entered the fourth quarter either tied, trailing by 7 points or
fewer, or leading by 7 or fewer during Whipple's tenure. That
included a 3-0 mark this year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Minutemen entered the fourth having withstood
Furman's explosive offense and hard-hitting defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furman entered the contest having outscored its opponents,
118-34, in the first quarter, and 109-35 in the fourth. Saturday,
at a venue where the hosts had lost just once all year (in their
season opener), the teams were tied, 7-7, after the first, and
Furman outscored UMass, 3-0, in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When Furman kicker Jason Wells missed a 37-yard field goal with
12 seconds left, the Paladins blew a big opportunity to win.
</P>
<P>
   It took UMass four plays to score in overtime, the drive capped
by a 1-yard run by Shipp, who fumbled while heading into the end
zone in the third period. ``We knew what we had to do in the
overtime,'' said Shipp. ``We just stepped it up and won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Furman then started its drive at the UMass 25, and ended its
season at the 35, having lost 4 yards on a rush, 6 on a sack, and
having thrown two incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our seniors just showed up,'' said UMass junior linebacker
Kole Ayi. ``First play of overtime they try to run a quick toss and
(senior linebacker) Matt Dawson makes a play. Second play, (senior
defensive tackle) Aaron Parker makes a sack. You could tell they
didn't want the game to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Minutemen face a Georgia Southern team that beat
Northern Arizona, 72-29, Saturday, in what will be a rematch of
last year's national title game.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Georgia Southern, which can score, knows all about
UMass's ability to put a close game away after three periods. Last
year, UMass led Georgia Southern, 38-33, entering the fourth. The
Minutemen won, 55-43.

BOWL A BUILDING BLOCK FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now that Boston College has completed its regular
season, the Eagles can talk about the postseason. The first salvo
will come Monday when they will hold a press conference to announce
their acceptance of a berth in the Insight.Com Bowl in Tucson Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   For the Eagles, it is a quantum leap from a year ago, when they
were finishing their second consecutive 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this season, which ended with Friday's 38-14 loss
to Virginia Tech, is that an 8-3 record can be the foundation for a
program.
</P>
<P>
   So can a bowl game. The Insight.Com Bowl is a nice first step in
the reconstruction job that Eagles coach Tom O'Brien undertook when
he arrived at The Heights three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Brien said after Friday's loss, ``Three years ago, we were
in the headlines for all the wrong reasons; this week we were in
the headlines for all the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowl games are recruiting tools for coaches. They provide
exposure on television, extra practice time in December, not to
mention the financial advantages for the conference and school.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College's opponent has yet to be determined and probably
will not be officially named until after Saturday's Big 12
championship game between Nebraska and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the champion is decided, the other Big 12 bowl commitments
can be locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it is either 7-4 Oklahoma or 6-5 Colorado. Strictly
by the numbers, Oklahoma would be the choice. But bowl pairings are
not based on numbers, at least not wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado beat Oklahoma in the regular season, which is a factor
in its favor. The other plus for Colorado is fan support.
</P>
<P>
   Word has spread to the offices of the Insight.Com Bowl and the
Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La., that Oklahoma, enjoying a
resurgence under first-year coach Bobby Stoops, will be happy to go
to any bowl and bring fans to either venue.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado fans, however, are more picky, and may pass up the
chance to celebrate the millennium in Shreveport. Tucson? That
might work, and that is very much a factor when bowls issue
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Some sort of decision, or preference list, will be put together
by the Insight.Com Bowl committee at a meeting Monday, but right
now the tilt is toward Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter. BC is ready for the next level, which is
contending for the Big East title. Another recruiting class like
this season's and the Eagles will be a prime-time team in a
conference that is coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is O'Brien. He has done a solid job turning the
Eagles in the right direction. In the next few weeks, he will be
rewarded for that with another contract extension. Don't be
surprised if BC officials come up with creative ways to also extend
O'Brien's financial package, such as a funded annuity, which will
guarantee O'Brien a large package if he makes a long-term
commitment to BC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's last-second loss to Stanford was what Irish fans
feared. It was the first time since 1960 that the Irish have seven
losses in a season. Under three years of coach Bob Davie, Notre
Dame has lost 16 games. Only Joe Kuharich, who lost 18 games in his
first three years in South Bend, had a worse start. And it marked
the first four-loss November for the Irish since the ill-fated
Gerry Faust team lost four in 1983 . . . Nebraska's 33-30 overtime
victory over Colorado Friday may have kept the Huskers technically
alive for a spot in the BCS Championship game in the Sugar Bowl in
New Orleans Jan. 4, but the Huskers have almost no chance to catch
No. 2 Virginia Tech in the rankings, and they know it. ``By now
it's probably Florida State and Virginia Tech,'' said Nebraska
linebacker Tony Ortiz. ``Our focus right now is the Big 12
championship game.'' . . . Hawaii's Cinderella season finally hit a
speed bump when the Rainbows lost to Washington State. Still, it is
going to a bowl game against Oregon State in Honolulu Christmas Day
. . . Has any team started out with such high hopes as Arizona _
which was a consensus Top 5 pick at the start of the season _ but
never recovered from an opening-game pounding by Penn State? The
Wildcats ended their dreary season with a 42-27 loss to Arizona
State, finishing 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts's 30-23 overtime win over Furman
Saturday was one of the best games played on any level of college
football this season and shows how exciting a playoff system can be
when the stakes are that high and the quality of play is that good
. . . Despite losses by Arkansas and Texas, the Cotton Bowl is
still hoping for that matchup in its Jan. 1 game . . . Joe
Hamilton's four-touchdown effort in a 50-47 win over Georgia
Saturday keeps alive his slim chances of stealing the Heisman
Trophy from Wisconsin's Ron Dayne. But the loss to Wake Forest last
week probably doomed Hamilton, since many Heisman voters already
had sent in their votes . . . In three weeks, Penn State went from
a contender for the national championship to a three-loss team that
probably will face Texas A&AMP;M in the Alamo Bowl.

   The Kansas City Star plans to move the following stories for use

KC-WEATH -- A three-mile-high volcano in Ecuador is spewing a plume
of ash that has drifted 78 miles. A low cloud cover blankets a
swath from the Carolinas to Florida. Low-level turbulence over
California could lead to dangerous wind shears in canyons and
passes.
</P>
<P>
   All of these weather conditions are of vital interest to any
aircraft cruising through those areas _ not to mention passengers
traveling over the peak air travel period between Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Larry Jacobs is around to warn pilots about weather
hazards.

</P>
<P>
   KC-ECOM -- Almost every day, thousands of people plop down in
front of their home computers to buy everything from groceries to
books to cars.
</P>
<P>
   They shop without the hassle of leaving home, battling traffic
or fighting crowds. Just a few keystrokes and the merchandise is
theirs. No clerks. No lines. And, often, no sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a break for consumers now may mean tax increases for
them in the future, say city and state officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, consumers save on sales tax when they buy
over the Internet from a company not in their state.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, state and municipal leaders are afraid they
will lose tax revenue to Internet sales, forcing them to raise
other taxes to offset those losses.

   KC-SLUM -- Nearly two years ago, Kansas City launched a
``slumlord of the month'' installment on its government TV channel,
in hopes of shaming problem landlords into cleaning up their rental
properties.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It withered on the vine. It didn't have any real teeth to it,
if you're not hitting them in their pocketbooks. Some of them even
considered it a badge of honor,'' said Nanci Regan, neighborhood
development supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   So now, prodded by exasperated homeowners, Kansas City officials
are preparing to recommend to the City Council a more comprehensive
get-tough approach.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies will include a ``landlords school'' similar to school
for drunken drivers; intensive probation and community service;
civil court action to gain more control over the properties; and
lobbying for higher fines and more jail time.

DEVILS AND SHARKS TIE, 3-3 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Jason Arnott's breakaway goal with 4:48 left
in the third period had given the New Jersey Devils a 3-2 lead just
after they had killed a hooking penalty on Arnott. He was set up by
the rookie Scott Gomez and beat goaltender Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose's Owen Nolan tied the game again when he scored a
short-handed goal with 2:05 remaining, his 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So ended a trip on which Bobby Holik was suspended, defenseman
Lyle Odelein was scratched twice and talked about leaving the
Devils and Denis Pederson was sidelined indefinitely with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, in the midst of 6 games in 11 days, play six of
their next seven at home, where they are 8-1-2. Holik must sit out
one more game, on Wednesday against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sharks, the Devils scored 3:51 into the game on a
goal that should not have been allowed. Television replays showed
that the Devils' Claude Lemieux redirected Jason Arnott's pass with
his right skate past Shields, but the officials ruled it a goal.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose countered five minutes later when Marco Sturm's shot
glanced into the net off goaltender Martin Brodeur, who was down on
the ice and trying to scramble back in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The first period included a pair of fights between the Devils'
Krzysztof Oliwa and San Jose's Brantt Myhres. They were ejected
after the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded goals in the second period, Niklas Sundstrom
scoring for San Jose at 1:27 and Vadim Sharifijanov tying the game
for the Devils at 12:12.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, Holik served the second game of his suspension,
while Odelein was a healthy scratch for the second time in a week
and said he would talk to General Manager Lou Lamoriello because
``maybe it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Odelein had not been a healthy scratch since his rookie season
with Montreal in 1990-91 until Wednesday night, when Coach Robbie
Ftorek held him out of the Devils' 2-1 victory in Anaheim. He
started Thursday night and played almost 10 minutes in a 4-2 loss
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely hurts to get scratched for the first time, and
now the second time,'' said Odelein, who can become a free agent
after the season. ``I thought I had a good game in Phoenix. Maybe I
have some anger, but I've got a lot of pride and I'm not going to
sit back and take it. Maybe it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie's the coach, and I'm not going to question him,''
Odelein, 31, said. ``I know I can play and be valuable to somebody
in the league, that's for sure. I'm not going to cause problems on
this team.''

`TOY STORY' PLAYS HUGE FOR HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Woody and Buzz Lightyear lured massive numbers of
moviegoers to the nation's multiplexes as ``Toy Story 2'' dominated
a robust Thanksgiving holiday with an estimated $80.8 million at
3,236 theaters during the Wednesday-Sunday period, studio sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' riding the crest of widespread recognition of
the 1995 original, solid reviews and a well-tuned marketing
campaign, destroyed last year's record of $45.7 million by ``A
Bug's Life'' for top Thanksgiving performance. Sell-out business
ruled at many theaters following its nationwide rollout Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public really wanted to see this movie, and people who
have seen it say they want to see it again,'' said distribution
chief Chuck Viane. ``It's going to be around for a long time. The
beauty of this movie is that it actually exceeds the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' co-produced with Pixar Animation and featuring
the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, began the holiday by
grossing $9.5 million on Wednesday and $13.2 million on Thursday
before setting a single-day studio record Friday with $22.8
million, followed by $21.5 million Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Viane said the Friday-Sunday number should be $57.7 million,
giving ``Toy Story 2'' the third-highest weekend gross ever after
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' with $72.8 million and ``Star
Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' with $64.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``Toy Story 2'' dominated every audience sector except for
young adults and came in well above forecasts. ``No one expected
numbers like this because family films have not been doing that
well,'' he added. ``It will certainly make it to $200 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' which first opened at the El Capitan in
Hollywood for five days on Nov. 19 before going nationwide, also
posted the third-highest gross for a five-day period behind only
``Phantom Menace'' with $105 million and ``Independence Day'' with
$85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell noted that Disney and Pixar,
which saw domestic grosses for the original ``Toy Story'' hit
$191.8 million, had planned initially to release ``Toy Story 2'' as
a direct-to-video title. ``It's ironic they didn't originally see
much potential in a theatrical sequel,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Three other high-profile entries turned in solid performances
during the five-day period - MGM's second weekend of ``The World Is
Not Enough'' with $35 million at 3,163 theaters; Universal's
opening of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days'' with $31 million
at 2,592 sites; and Paramount's second weekend of ``Sleepy Hollow''
with $27.4 million at 3,067 screens.
</P>
<P>
   With that quartet grossing nearly $175 million, overall business
approached the $210 million mark for an impressive 27 percent jump
from last year's holiday period. Year-to-date business has gone
past the $6.6 billion mark and is running 9 percent ahead of last
year's record-setting pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The domestic box office just won't quit,'' said Rockwell,
noting that rivals have decided to hold off any major new releases
this coming weekend. ``These four movies should have the field to
themselves for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``World,'' the 20th James Bond movie, has topped $75 million in
10 days and appears headed toward becoming the best performer in
the series. 1997's ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' is the top domestic
grosser with $125.2 million and 1995's ``Goldeneye'' has the
worldwide mark with $351 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days,'' which carries an R rating, posted a better
per-theater average than ``World'' and showed that Schwarzenegger,
who plays an ex-cop battling Satan, still carries significant box
office power. Bucksbaum noted that the thriller faced significant
competition for the young adult audience from ``Sleepy Hollow,''
which has topped $62 million in 10 days, while ``Toy Story 2''
competed most directly against the Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
finished a distant fifth with $9.1 million at 3,043 theaters.
Bucksbaum said the animated entry, which has gone past $77 million,
benefited from sell-outs of ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``The Bone Collector'' followed in
sixth with $7.3 million at 2,505 theaters to pass $53 million
overall. Rounding out the top 10 were Lions Gate's third weekend of
``Dogma'' with $4.8 million at 1,292 locations, 20th Century Fox's
third weekend of ``Anywhere But Here'' with $4 million at 1,666
sites, Disney's fourth weekend of ``The Insider'' with $3.3 million
at 1,672 theaters and USA Films' fifth weekend of ``Being John
Malkovich'' with $2.9 million at 589 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``The Sixth Sense'' continued to draw well after 17
weeks with $2.2 million at 1,017 theaters, pushing its overall take
to $272.4 million. MGM's opening of ``Flawless,'' a drama-comedy
with Robert De Niro as a recovering stroke victim, posted moderate
returns with $2 million at 478 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also saw the appearance of $9 tickets in the Los
Angeles area with the General Cinema chain raising prices at the
Avco in Westwood and the Beverly Connection in West Hollywood,
eclipsing the previous top price in the region of $8.50. However, a
number of Manhattan movie houses charge $9.50.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Wednesday through Sunday at North
American theaters. Final figures are to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 estimated box office grosses:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Toy Story 2,'' $80.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The World Is Not Enough,'' $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``End of Days,'' $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Sleepy Hollow,'' $27.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Pokemon,'' $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``The Bone Collector,'' $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Dogma,'' $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Anywhere But Here,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``The Insider,'' $3.3 million.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it was just another sleepy forgotten town in
the green hills of Bosnia. Now, Srebrenica _ ``place of silver,''
known to the Romans as Argentaria _ stands as the ultimate symbol
of the horror that Serbian ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic has
unleashed in the Balkans in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a reminder that, as Europe enters the 21st century,
no nightmare is too horrifying to be real.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-century since 1945, politicians have repeatedly
chanted about ``learning the lessons of history.'' ``Never again,''
the history books told us.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, as Bosnia showed, none of the lessons had truly been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The world has rightly been shocked by the killings in Kosovo,
where maybe 5,000 Albanians died in the whole province in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   At Srebrenica, more than 7,000 were murdered _ mostly shot in
the head before being dumped in mass graves _ in just a few days in
July 1995. Even by the lethal standards set by Milosevic's
placemen, it is a daunting record.
</P>
<P>
   A film broadcast on Britain's BBC2 Saturday night exposed with
searing clarity the horror of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   It exposed, too, the responsibility of Western powers who
refused to help, repeatedly turning their faces away from a reality
that stared them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The TV program shows us events unfolding before our eyes, as
recorded by the Serbs themselves. ``A catastrophe witnessed by
camcorder,'' in the words of filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian Muslim is asked by an unseen questioner: ``Are you
afraid?'' He looks into the camera with the certainty of
approaching death, and asks quietly: ``How could I not be afraid?''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb cameraman never seems to leave Mladic's side; the
pictures, intended to provide heroic propaganda, bear witness to
preparations for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   We see the division of the civilians, where the men (from age 11
to 77) are separated from the women and young children. The men _
their eyes turn to the camera, freeze-framed before death.
</P>
<P>
   Zumra Shekhomerovic torments herself because of her failure to
do something _ anything _ to fight for her husband as he was
separated from her, after placing his trembling hand on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret so much that I didn't scream or shout for help. Maybe
it would be easier to live now. I just left silently. My tears were
flowing like a river _ and still do today.''
</P>
<P>
   A standard get-out clause for politicians is to claim that
things only become clear in retrospect. ``20-20 vision is easy with
hindsight, isn't it?'' they like to say.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no hindsight was needed. Every Muslim in Bosnia
understood what the Serb forces were capable of; only the Western
governments refused to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain played a key role in blocking U.N. military action that
might have stopped the Serbs. Politicians sneered at the
``naivete'' of anybody who suggested a more robust approach. And
yet, it was impossible to spend any time in the Balkans and fail to
understand. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The pattern of threats was clear from the start. A snapshot
remains vivid in the memory from the earliest days of the Bosnian
war, more than three years before Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving a Muslim woman and two children out of Bosnia, at
the request of a Sarajevo friend. At a Serb checkpoint on a
mountain road, the gunman questioned my passengers, with a sadistic
enjoyment that would have seemed appropriate for an SS man
questioning a Jew in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and children were terrified of the gunman's absolute
power; he relished their fear. We all knew that if he and his
colleagues decided to bundle my passengers out of the car (kidnap,
kill, whatever) I could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I, with my cozy British passport, would have bleated
ineffectually, and eventually driven off _ with a gun at my head if
my complaints were too prolonged and foolhardy. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As later became clear on a grand scale, good intentions count
for nothing, unless they are backed up by some kind of force.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was common sense, and the ability to keep
one's eyes and mind open, to understand that simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Paddy Ashdown (then leader of Britain's Liberal
Democrat Party) _ who was outspoken on the need for action _ wrote
to John Major, then Prime Minister, to ask for undertakings
regarding the safety of Muslims in the besieged enclave of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Major replied: ``Britain's concern for the safety of civilians
in the eastern enclaves is well known.'' In reality, the concern
was limited, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, The Independent revealed that the U.N. _ with
the encouragement of London _ had, in effect, given up on
Srebrenica back in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Bernard Janvier, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, was
blunt with his advice: ``We must be pragmatic _ but above all
honest with the men whose security is our hands: without lightning
rods, stay out of the storm!''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give up on the ``safe area.'' Britain played a
key role in formulating this policy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Ashdown wrote again to ministers, regarding Robert Block's
reports in the Independent, there was an indignant response. The
letters from Malcolm Rifkind, then foreign secretary, and from John
Major have been seen by the Independent; they are evasive and
threatening by turns.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind complained of ``absurd allegations''; Major complained
of a ``disgraceful'' line of questioning, and demanded that Ashdown
apologize. ``Our forces have worked valiantly to bring humanitarian
relief to the people of Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, as far as it went. But the aggressive bluster
from Downing Street sought to conceal the fact that Britain had
indeed been ready to let Bosnia be trampled _ so that the
``humanitarian relief'' would not be put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The British forces in Bosnia were hamstrung because, under their
political mandate, they could not take tough action that was
clearly needed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch in Srebrenica faced similar difficulties. The Dutch
battalion was supposed to protect the ``safe enclave'' of
Srebrenica, but could not do so alone.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Serbs were moving in on
Srebrenica, the Dutch commander, Col. Ton Karremans, asked U.N.
headquarters for Serb positions to be bombed. His requests were
repeatedly denied. One request was turned down because it had been
submitted on the wrong form.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch have been criticized _ and have criticized themselves
_ for their manifest failure to protect the Muslims of Srebrenica. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devastating testimony in Saturday night's film comes from Hasan
Nuhanovic, a Bosnian interpreter who was forced to let his father,
mother and sister be driven out of the relative safety of the Dutch
compound near Srebrenica; they were never seen again. He still
reproaches himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason at such moments, you have no brain, you are so
obedient that you just do what they tell you. Nobody even
complained when they walked towards the gate, knowing that they
were probably going to die.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are sickening scenes where Dutch soldiers celebrated with
a literal knees-up _ waving their cans of Heineken beer in the air
as they danced _ after they came out of Srebrenica to the safety of
U.N. headquarters in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the buck did not stop with the Dutch. It stopped
with the Western governments _ especially the U.K., which was
determined not to let the heat be turned up high.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself admitted two weeks ago that the insufficient
military response resulted from ``an inability to recognize the
scope of the evil confronting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate criminals were, of course, the Serb and the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Serbs bury themselves in denial about crimes
that their compatriots have committed. Say the word ``Srebrenica''
to the average Serb today, and you will hear a long and fluent
lecture about Western propaganda and Muslim lies. That must
eventually change.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the film _ whose importance is such that it will
be shown at the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague _
may one day be heard and understood in Serbia, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, denial of the Holocaust _ the Auschwitzluge _ is a
punishable crime. In Serbia, with luck, the ``Srebrenica lie''
might also one day be a crime; but that day is a long way off, even
if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic steps down tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``pragmatism,'' Britain played a key role in allowing
the nightmare of Srebrenica to take place. Understanding that
failure can help ensure that ``never again'' is no longer just a
hollow cry. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it was just another sleepy forgotten town in
the green hills of Bosnia. Now, Srebrenica _ ``place of silver,''
known to the Romans as Argentaria _ stands as the ultimate symbol
of the horror that Serbian ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic has
unleashed in the Balkans in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a reminder that, as Europe enters the 21st century,
no nightmare is too horrifying to be real.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-century since 1945, politicians have repeatedly
chanted about ``learning the lessons of history.'' ``Never again,''
the history books told us.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, as Bosnia showed, none of the lessons had truly been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The world has rightly been shocked by the killings in Kosovo,
where maybe 5,000 Albanians died in the whole province in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   At Srebrenica, more than 7,000 were murdered _ mostly shot in
the head before being dumped in mass graves _ in just a few days in
July 1995. Even by the lethal standards set by Milosevic's
placemen, it is a daunting record.
</P>
<P>
   A film broadcast on Britain's BBC2 Saturday night exposed with
searing clarity the horror of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   It exposed, too, the responsibility of Western powers who
refused to help, repeatedly turning their faces away from a reality
that stared them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The TV program shows us events unfolding before our eyes, as
recorded by the Serbs themselves. ``A catastrophe witnessed by
camcorder,'' in the words of filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian Muslim is asked by an unseen questioner: ``Are you
afraid?'' He looks into the camera with the certainty of
approaching death, and asks quietly: ``How could I not be afraid?''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb cameraman never seems to leave Mladic's side; the
pictures, intended to provide heroic propaganda, bear witness to
preparations for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   We see the division of the civilians, where the men (from age 11
to 77) are separated from the women and young children. The men _
their eyes turn to the camera, freeze-framed before death.
</P>
<P>
   Zumra Shekhomerovic torments herself because of her failure to
do something _ anything _ to fight for her husband as he was
separated from her, after placing his trembling hand on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret so much that I didn't scream or shout for help. Maybe
it would be easier to live now. I just left silently. My tears were
flowing like a river _ and still do today.''
</P>
<P>
   A standard get-out clause for politicians is to claim that
things only become clear in retrospect. ``20-20 vision is easy with
hindsight, isn't it?'' they like to say.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no hindsight was needed. Every Muslim in Bosnia
understood what the Serb forces were capable of; only the Western
governments refused to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain played a key role in blocking U.N. military action that
might have stopped the Serbs. Politicians sneered at the
``naivete'' of anybody who suggested a more robust approach. And
yet, it was impossible to spend any time in the Balkans and fail to
understand. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of threats was clear from the start. A snapshot
remains vivid in the memory from the earliest days of the Bosnian
war, more than three years before Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving a Muslim woman and two children out of Bosnia, at
the request of a Sarajevo friend. At a Serb checkpoint on a
mountain road, the gunman questioned my passengers, with a sadistic
enjoyment that would have seemed appropriate for an SS man
questioning a Jew in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and children were terrified of the gunman's absolute
power; he relished their fear. We all knew that if he and his
colleagues decided to bundle my passengers out of the car (kidnap,
kill, whatever) I could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I, with my cozy British passport, would have bleated
ineffectually, and eventually driven off _ with a gun at my head if
my complaints were too prolonged and foolhardy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As later became clear on a grand scale, good intentions count
for nothing, unless they are backed up by some kind of force.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was common sense, and the ability to keep
one's eyes and mind open, to understand that simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Paddy Ashdown (then leader of Britain's Liberal
Democrat Party) _ who was outspoken on the need for action _ wrote
to John Major, then Prime Minister, to ask for undertakings
regarding the safety of Muslims in the besieged enclave of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Major replied: ``Britain's concern for the safety of civilians
in the eastern enclaves is well known.'' In reality, the concern
was limited, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, The Independent revealed that the U.N. _ with
the encouragement of London _ had, in effect, given up on
Srebrenica back in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Bernard Janvier, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, was
blunt with his advice: ``We must be pragmatic _ but above all
honest with the men whose security is our hands: without lightning
rods, stay out of the storm!''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give up on the ``safe area.'' Britain played a
key role in formulating this policy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Ashdown wrote again to ministers, regarding Robert Block's
reports in the Independent, there was an indignant response. The
letters from Malcolm Rifkind, then foreign secretary, and from John
Major have been seen by the Independent; they are evasive and
threatening by turns.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind complained of ``absurd allegations''; Major complained
of a ``disgraceful'' line of questioning, and demanded that Ashdown
apologize. ``Our forces have worked valiantly to bring humanitarian
relief to the people of Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, as far as it went. But the aggressive bluster
from Downing Street sought to conceal the fact that Britain had
indeed been ready to let Bosnia be trampled _ so that the
``humanitarian relief'' would not be put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The British forces in Bosnia were hamstrung because, under their
political mandate, they could not take tough action that was
clearly needed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch in Srebrenica faced similar difficulties. The Dutch
battalion was supposed to protect the ``safe enclave'' of
Srebrenica, but could not do so alone.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Serbs were moving in on
Srebrenica, the Dutch commander, Col. Ton Karremans, asked U.N.
headquarters for Serb positions to be bombed. His requests were
repeatedly denied. One request was turned down because it had been
submitted on the wrong form.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch have been criticized _ and have criticized themselves
_ for their manifest failure to protect the Muslims of Srebrenica. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devastating testimony in Saturday night's film comes from Hasan
Nuhanovic, a Bosnian interpreter who was forced to let his father,
mother and sister be driven out of the relative safety of the Dutch
compound near Srebrenica; they were never seen again. He still
reproaches himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason at such moments, you have no brain, you are so
obedient that you just do what they tell you. Nobody even
complained when they walked towards the gate, knowing that they
were probably going to die.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are sickening scenes where Dutch soldiers celebrated with
a literal knees-up _ waving their cans of Heineken beer in the air
as they danced _ after they came out of Srebrenica to the safety of
U.N. headquarters in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the buck did not stop with the Dutch. It stopped
with the Western governments _ especially the U.K., which was
determined not to let the heat be turned up high.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself admitted two weeks ago that the insufficient
military response resulted from ``an inability to recognize the
scope of the evil confronting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate criminals were, of course, the Serb and the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Serbs bury themselves in denial about crimes
that their compatriots have committed. Say the word ``Srebrenica''
to the average Serb today, and you will hear a long and fluent
lecture about Western propaganda and Muslim lies. That must
eventually change.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the film _ whose importance is such that it will
be shown at the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague _
may one day be heard and understood in Serbia, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, denial of the Holocaust _ the Auschwitzluge _ is a
punishable crime. In Serbia, with luck, the ``Srebrenica lie''
might also one day be a crime; but that day is a long way off, even
if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic steps down tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``pragmatism,'' Britain played a key role in allowing
the nightmare of Srebrenica to take place. Understanding that
failure can help ensure that ``never again'' is no longer just a
hollow cry. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn. In the next few days tens of
thousands of protesters will descend on Seattle in a bid to stop a
new round of trade negotiations by the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
   They see themselves as Luke Skywalkers to the WTO's Darth Vader,
fighting to save the world from the threat of increased poverty and
environmental destruction. Their ultimate ambition: to destroy the
WTO and the liberal trading system it represents.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barricades will be a small army of
corporate lobbyists, many of them linked to Western governments.
They see themselves _ and the WTO _ as defenders of a global free
trading system that enshrines the principles of multilateralism and
promises unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of protagonists pose a profound threat to a
constituency that will not be well represented in Seattle _ namely,
the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the arguments advanced by critics of the Seattle talks
would be laughable, were it not for the fact that they enjoy such
wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-WTO witch-hunter general in the U.K. is Teddy
Goldsmith, editor of the Ecologist magazine. His view is that the
only beneficiaries of trade are giant companies for whom ``free
trade'' means the freedom to exploit, plunder and pollute; it
follows that more trade is bad trade.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith could usefully spend some time discussing his views
with people in the developing world whose livelihoods depend on,
and have often been enhanced by, international trade.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of poor women in Bangladesh, textile exports have
created employment opportunities and the income needed to buy food
and send children to school.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania, desperately poor smallholder farmers can earn more
by selling coffee to the EU than by producing for the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   And trade has played a pivotal role in sustaining the economic
growth that has lifted 371 million people out of poverty in east
Asia over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, trade has the potential to inflict social and environmental
damage. But it can also act as a force for human development. For
many millions of poor people, access to markets in rich countries
is literally a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   According to those behind the barricades in Seattle, poor
countries should abandon the pursuit of prosperity through trade,
in favor of self-reliance. Yet the fact is that trade is now the
main engine of growth in the global economy, having grown at twice
the rate of world output for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   International trade gives poor countries access to rich
consumers, generating employment and investment in the process.
Such countries would be the main victims of any descent into
protectionism, not least because they lack the economic power and
retaliatory capacity to defend their interests.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they need a rules-based system to govern world trade
_ and it is why so many developing countries are lining up to join
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to suggest that what currently pass for
multilateral trade rules are even remotely tolerable. They are
rigged in favor of the rich, often with devastating implications
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Western protectionism costs the world's poorest countries about
$700 billion a year _ 14 times what they receive in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rich nations have failed to act on their pledges to phase out
trade barriers against textiles and clothing, the biggest
manufacturing export from the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The market for agricultural goods _ which are often all that
poor countries have to sell _ remains closed behind a bewildering
array of trade barriers, most of them designed to protect wealthy
farmers and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle, the United States will try to force developing
countries to open their markets further to the import of subsidized
farm exports from the West, destroying the livelihoods of local
farmers in the process. It must not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazen hypocrisy on the part of rich governments is not the only
problem. All too often, WTO rules provide a convenient smoke screen
for corporate self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of intellectual property. Under the WTO, the
patents protection enjoyed by multinational companies has already
been extended. Now the EU and the US are insisting, in flagrant
violation of the Biodiversity Convention, that patenting law be
applied to all plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   That is an act of bio-piracy, made worse by the fact that
companies are already patenting traditional medicines and plants
produced in countries such as India and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of the losers are in the south. The WTO is being
used by American companies as a battering ram to open up the
European market for genetically modified foods and growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes are needed if the WTO is to succeed in laying the
foundations for a trading system that contributes towards human
development and environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle talks should focus on improving market access for
poor countries and ending agricultural export dumping by rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As India has argued, the intellectual property rules should be
torn up and rewritten to reflect the interests of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative demanded by the Seattle protesters may be
unthinkable. But what we have now is unacceptable. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Major changes are needed if the WTO is to succeed in laying the
foundations for a trading system that contributes towards human
development and environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle talks should focus on improving market access for
poor countries and ending agricultural export dumping by rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As India has argued, the intellectual property rules should be
torn up and rewritten to reflect the interests of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative demanded by the Seattle protesters may be
unthinkable. But what we have now is unacceptable. &QL;

EAT, EAT, EAT AND BE MERRY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ We must look silly to most of the rest of the
world. For the next month, our biggest worry in America, judging
from reports in the media, is that we will eat too much.
<P>
   In many countries, when the typical large family gathers for the
holiday feast, in the center of the table is a roasted and stuffed
grasshopper. Dad and the kids argue over who will get the green
meat.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not condemning our holiday gluttony. Au contraire, I'm
condemning our response to that gluttony, which is to express shame
and self-loathing, emotions that can sometimes ruin your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Shut up and go for it. If the world ends on New Year's Eve, you
will regret every slice of pie you dismissed with that smug,
self-righteous wave. It's not like you're up for the role of lead
skeleton babe in that new Hollywood sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Gluttony is its own reward, but as frosting on the cake, I'm
sponsoring a contest to see who can gain the most weight between
Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. A few tips:
</P>
<P>
   -- Steal a concept from the diet gurus, who recommend eating
several small meals per day. Eat several large meals per day. Or
one continuous meal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Avoid ``calorie-deficient'' foods. Pick the celery bits out
of your turkey dressing and feed 'em to the dog. Instead of pouring
gravy over your mashed potatoes and turkey, eliminate the mashed
potatoes and turkey. Try my new concept, ``reverse liposuction.''
 &UR; Waiter, bring us the jumbo gravy tureen and six &LR; 
 &UR; straws, please! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- Avoid strenuous exercise. You could pull a groin muscle and
wind up in the hospital, where the food is not conducive to
gluttony. Avoid even minimal exercise, by using your brain. To
prevent having to burn calories by rummaging around for the
misplaced TV remote, I wear mine on a gold chain around my neck.
Stylish  &UR; and  &LR; functional.
</P>
<P>
   Send your total weight gain and tales of gluttony to me. Winner
receives dinner for two at a nice San Francisco restaurant, plus a
dinner for your companion.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TOO EARLY to panic, but Jack the veteran cabbie scoffs at
San Francisco's plan to put 250 extra cabs on the street for New
Year's Eve. He says there's not that many extra cabs available, and
many drivers are going to stay home rather than drive through the
century's biggest party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be lucky to get half the regular fleet onto the
street,'' Jack says.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead and party, just don't plan to go home for a couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
   SOME OF LIFE'S great questions go unanswered, so I am patenting
the Kiddie's Counter, a small handheld computer chip device for
tots.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: ``How many times have I told you to pick up your dirty
clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   Tot (after punching in relevant data): ``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   IN LOS ANGELES over the weekend, they had another long-distance
freeway chase of a crazy guy, telecast live on several stations via
news-copter cams. The cops finally disabled the car with spike
strips, and when the guy got out of the car and brandished a gun,
the cops shot him full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A. stations keep showing these spectacles, they're going to
have to come up with a new term to replace ``live TV coverage.''
You can't have live death.
</P>
<P>
   Last time one of these chases was telecast, the public expressed
outrage that such a grisly event would take over TV programming.
Station managers vowed that next time they would at least put the
telecast on seven-second delay, in case something gory happened.
</P>
<P>
   They lied. Several L.A. stations and two San Diego stations
carried it all live, including the grand finale. The acting manager
of a San Diego station said, ``As soon as we saw he had the gun, we
widened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, no close-ups of bullets ripping through flesh on that TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   I worry that they're going soft down in So Cal.
</P>
<P>
   A HOMELESS MAN pushed a massively loaded shopping cart along
Linden Street in Hayes Valley. A couple of hours later, the man was
gone, his cart was tipped over and the belongings strewn all over
the street. Atop one pile of the man's stuff was a booklet,
``Homeless Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Clint Reilly's booklet paid off for this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOW HIRING,'' says the sign in the window of the FaultLine
Brewery, opening soon at Fillmore and Chestnut in the Marina. Lou
Bristol peeked in the window and saw a pair of boxing gloves on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be a tough job interview,'' says Lou.
</P>
<P>
   THE LADY on the TV news report was 117 years old, although she
could pass for 100. I didn't get her name, but she lives in Merced.
</P>
<P>
   As on any media report of an amazingly old person, the woman was
asked the secret of her longevity. Why do we always ask that? Why
not ask, ``What were the Wright Brothers really like?'' Or, ``Do
think we've screwed up the century?'' Or, ``Before TV, what did you
sit around and stare at?'' Or, ``Want to ride a really cool roller
coaster?''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the woman said that every day when she wakes up, she has
a cup of coffee, a sip of whiskey and a Twinkie, then she goes back
to bed.
</P>
<P>
   What the hell, I'm willing to give it a try.

 SEATTLE FEARS EXPLOSION OF WTO PROTESTS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From City Hall to the trendy stores and boutiques
downtown, this city's movers and shakers are wondering whether the
summit meeting of the World Trade Organization this week is going
to be one big, bad headache.
</P>
<P>
   With huge protests Tuesday expected to be rowdy and rumors of
violence growing louder, politicians and business leaders fear that
the city's image _ which has been burnished in recent years as a
hip, happening place for software-writing, latte-sipping young
professionals _ will become synonymous with riots and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Even protest organizers, who clearly are having the time of
their lives preparing for what they call ``a festival of democracy
in the streets,'' worry that things may get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the protesters _ ranging from union members
to environmentalists _ are expected to be peaceful. But small
radical fringe groups are planning violence, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear (the rumors), you kind of ask, `Whose bright
idea was it to have the WTO here?' '' said Chai Mann, president of
Fox's Gem Shop on Fifth Avenue in Seattle's downtown, which will be
Ground Zero in tomorrow's demonstrations. ``WTO is the antithesis
of what we want for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stores in the area are expected to close all day Tuesday
and board up their windows.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page headline in the Seattle Times summed up the growing
paranoia: ``WTO _ Whose Idea Was This?'' The article went on to
warn of ``terrorist attacks'' _ without explaining further.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a trial run of the protests went off peaceably. About
1,000 people marched through downtown, pausing before chain stores
that they call symbols of WTO-style corporate power _ Gap and
Starbucks, among others. The scene was festive. Dancing
stilt-walkers wore monarch butterfly costumes (to symbolize claims
that butterflies are being killed by genetically engineered corn).
Giant puppets of corporate executives such as Gap board chairman
Donald Fisher also joined in.
</P>
<P>
   But things will get much more serious Tuesday, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the AFL-CIO's nervousness about being associated
publicly with law-breaking young demonstrators, the unions are
closing their protest march _ about 30,000 union members from
across the country are expected _ to other participants.
</P>
<P>
   The others, most of whom are loosely organized as an alliance
called Direct Action Network, will be marching separately.
Organizers say that demonstrators intend to lie down in streets or
lock themselves to police barriers or one another. They have two
goals: preventing delegates from entering the downtown convention
center for the start of the WTO talks, and getting hundreds
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Direct Action Network, whose leaders are veterans of protests
against old-growth logging in California and British Columbia, has
repeatedly stressed the importance of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nonviolent scene but a chaotic _ and fun _ one at the
network's base camp, ``The Convergence,'' a large former nightclub
and adjacent garage a mile from downtown in the bohemian Capitol
Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of dreadlocks, pierced noses and lips and
eyebrows. There's a wildly painted hippie bus that looks like it
came from the Ken Kesey collection, and a stretch limousine with a
mock Cruise missile on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, classes are given to the hundreds of people wandering
around. There's a nonviolence class, a legal class _ that's what to
do when you're in jail _ a puppet-making class, and others.
</P>
<P>
   At the nonviolence class, about 100 young folks listen intently
as two veterans of Humboldt County timber wars give them the
rundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defusing anger is the most important thing,'' they are told.
``You have to recognize the humanity in the cops, show that you
realize they're human. Make eye contact.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many more detailed instructions, in a remarkably
professional lesson on the science of nonviolent protest.
</P>
<P>
   There's also role-playing, with the class divided into
pepper-spraying, violent cops and peaceable protesters. Instructors
explain what a pain hold is. Why not to wear jewelry (especially
those nose and lip rings, which make a mess of you if a cop yanks
on them). How to breathe through tear gas. Why to scream loudly
whenever a cop touches you, whether or not it really hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything like this in England,'' said one
participant, a diminutive woman named Fiona, from Brighton. ``We
just do protests, but we never get taught this. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But organizers say that small Seattle anarchist groups have
rebelled against the network's nonviolent philosophy and are
planning violence. What sort, they don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential for things to go wrong, Seattle Mayor Paul
Schell bristles when people raise the specter of the 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Mayor Richard
Daley ordered police to take violent action against anti-war
demonstrators. Or of the recent uproar when New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani threatened to evict the Brooklyn Museum because an art
exhibit offended his Catholic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no Mayor Daley, and I'm no Mayor Giuliani,'' Schell said.
``I'm confident we will not overreact.'`

THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS PUBLIC AND GLOBAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are pouring into Seattle this weekend in vans
and on buses, by air and on foot _ the college students and the
church groups, the environmental campaigners, the Teamsters, Ralph
Nader, Chinese dissidents and the man who became a hero in France
for defacing a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   All of them say they are outraged at the growing power of a
group few even heard about five years ago, the World Trade
Organization. And so, with tens of thousands massing, they are
planning to turn what initially sounded like the yawner of all
international meetings _ a gathering of trade ministers from 135
countries to start the ``Millennium Round'' of trade liberalization
talks _ into the Woodstock of the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the WTO itself, with its paltry annual budget of
$80 million, not even enough to buy an F-22 fighter for the Air
Force, isn't the real target of the protesters. It's merely a
symbol, a bureaucratic metaphor for the idea that the markets have
become the real governing force of the '90s _ frequently with the
willing participation of governments and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The real target is a sense that the role of the private sector
and the role of the public sector that is supposed to rein in
market forces has become hopelessly blurred _ a bit like those
so-called non-commercials on public television that, with each
passing year, seem to turn into longer and longer plugs for
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply that governments have shrunk and the private
sector has risen. In fact, the public sector has increasingly
become the champion of private enterprise. That reflects a
sea-change in traditional political constituencies. The parties
that used to get elected by arguing that government must tame
capitalism's excesses and stand up for those left behind _
big-government Democrats, Europe's battered Socialists _ have
mostly re-tooled themselves and changed the priorities of
governments, aligning them more closely than ever with the
priorities of corporations and a swelling class of
worker-investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the shift has created a lot of political
confusion about whose interests are being protected. Consider the
union members in Seattle. True, the forces of globalized trade are
threatening to move their jobs to China. But like many workers
across America, their huge pension funds and 401-K's have been
spiking upward precisely because they are invested in companies and
countries that have benefited greatly from ever-freer trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that trade only affected major corporations,''
Mickey Kantor, the former trade representative and long-time
Democratic political strategist, said last week. ``Now it affects
people's jobs, their education and of course their portfolios. And
it creates some pretty wacky politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which left and right have unified to become the
champion of corporate priorities was on full display in the
congressional session that just ended. Democrats and Republicans
may be in a death-battle for control of the White House and
Congress, but they managed to find common ground on repealing
Depression-era laws preventing banks, securities firms and
insurance concerns from merging those businesses (while doing
nothing about those $1.50 ATM fees that drive most banking
customers crazy) and passing a law limiting lawsuits arising out of
Y2K disasters.
</P>
<P>
   And look at the bills that business interests got killed: There
was no increase in the minimum wage, no new limits on ``soft
money'' in political campaigns, no ban on agricultural mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Or look abroad: The generals who staged the coup in Pakistan
made their first priority a crackdown on corruption. The country's
terrible reputation among foreign investors, they warned, was as
big a threat to the nation as India's nukes.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say governments have entirely given up on reining
in market forces. Japan is focusing its attentions at Seattle on
retaining protections for farmers, steelmakers and other
industries. France is forever battling globalization. Here at home,
even the market-friendly new Democrats of the Clinton
administration have breathed new life into anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a few miles north of the WTO meeting in Seattle, and
Microsoft employees will offer up an earful about how the Justice
Department is mired in old economic thinking, and is threatening
the economic engine that has driven one of the greatest expansions
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But even those protests are muted by the not-so-secret belief
among Microsoft's investors that a breakup of the company might
turn into a bonanza for their shareholdings _ exactly what happened
after the government went after AT&AMP;T.

</P>
<P>
   So is the public good suffering as the role of government and
the role of business blur? It depends on what you think governments
ought to be doing for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Those promotional spots for sponsors on public television have
expanded precisely because there is increasing opposition to using
taxpayer money to fund TV or the arts. So now the P in PBS now
stands for something more like ``public-private partnership,'' and
it seems likely that public financing will play an ever-smaller
role.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the most sacrosanct of public functions _
education _ is a constant battleground in the public-private wars.
School vouchers, charter schools and for-profit educational
companies that run schools all blur the line between what
governments can achieve and what the private sector can.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, good civic and economic arguments can be
made for more private financing. But with the loss of public money
inevitably comes a loss of public control, and less of a voice for
public debate over priorities.
</P>
<P>
   And that, at the heart of it, is the argument that will be
shouted on the streets in Seattle. People who don't usually have
much in common _ the Rainforest Action Network and the United
Steelworkers, for example _ are convinced that the WTO's rise
represents the ultimate victory for corporate interests that want
the rules of the global economy written on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough examples on the table now, from the arguments
over whether countries can ban genetically modified foods, or the
argument that we can't ban products made by child labor because it
violates some trade agreement,'' said Nader, the longtime consumer
advocate who years ago moved beyond auto safety to make the case
that a global economic rule-setter like the WTO is unsafe at any
speed. ``People aren't buying the idea anymore that globalization
is inevitable and their governments have to go with the flow of the
market. That's what is unifying the protesters you are going to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over genetically modified organisms is a prime example
of the alliance of governments and corporations _ and of the
continuing frictions between countries with different domestic
standards. While American companies and regulators argue that these
foods are safe, Europeans have banned many of them as threats to
consumer safety and the environment. The United States is
challenging rules that require labeling of all genetically modified
foods in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the explosive issue of how to handle the concerns of
labor. Unions will be in Seattle to argue that global trade
agreements should protect the rights of workers, just as they have
long protected intellectual property and investments abroad. They
want the new trade agreement to include provisions that set minimum
labor standards in factories around the world. They oppose imports
from countries that ban unions, China included. In an election year
in which Vice President Al Gore is desperate for deeper union
support, they have more than a little political leverage.
</P>
<P>
   But developing nations like India and China say that such
restrictions are simply a form of American protectionism. They
insist that labor issues are a domestic problem unrelated to
international trade, and want any rulemaking relegated to the
toothless International Labor Organization. The Clinton
administration supported that position a few years ago, but now
wants a ``study group'' within the WTO to take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To the protesters on the street, that's far too little action.
To the developing nations, it's far too much. All of this has
opened up the new divide of globalization, the argument over who
will make the rules, and on whose behalf. ``It's not going to be
the WTO with its closed-door, big-business policies,'' vows Nader.
He could be right: The very fact that a WTO negotiation is
triggering screaming in the streets could mean that the pendulum is
beginning to swing back, and that global politics may rear its head
and attempt to trump the imperatives of global economics.

 WASHINGTON: after AT&AMP;T.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So is the public good suffering as the role of government and
the role of business blur? It depends on what you think governments
ought to be doing for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Those promotional spots for sponsors on public television have
expanded precisely because there is increasing opposition to using
taxpayer money to fund TV or the arts. So now the P in PBS now
stands for something more like ``public-private partnership,'' and
it seems likely that public financing will play an ever-smaller
role.
</P>

   And of course the most sacrosanct of public functions _
education _ is a constant battleground in the public-private wars.

THEIR BIGGEST CAMPAIGN MAY BE AGAINST TYPE-CASTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, the story line on Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has been that he has a big, bad temper. But here's a news
flash: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has one, too. Even Bush does
not dispute a description by the writer Richard Ben Cramer that he
is the ``Roman Candle'' of the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   The word on Bush, a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Business
School, is that he is a cutup who lacks the intellectual heft to be
president. But why doesn't anyone ever mention that McCain ranked
fifth from last in the Class of 1958 at the United States Naval
Academy? Or that, like Bush, he was known for preferring carousing
over cramming?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore still cannot shake the impression that
his public presentation is awkward and wooden and that he sometimes
seems condescending. The truth is, Bill Bradley can be awkward and
wooden and sometimes  &UR; he &LR;  seems condescending.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley is trying to counter a perception that he
was aloof from his colleagues when he was a senator from New
Jersey, and that he was not particularly affable. But Gore was a
loner who made few friends in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or unfair, the portrayals of presidential candidates by the
news media, the pundits and the late-night comics are often
exaggerated. They are certainly not complete depictions of who the
candidates really are. The images (some would say stereotypes) are
the product of many factors, including early widely reported
incidents that become ingrained and remain largely unchallenged by
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because these images are often founded on some truth,
they can be impossible for politicians to overcome. It is not
implausible to suggest that Dan Quayle might still be in
competition for the Republican nomination this year were it not for
his placement of an unfortunate ``e'' at the end of potato seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The public's impression of candidates may be more important than
ever in the campaign of 2000 because there is a dearth of raging
issues dividing the parties. As a result, voters may place even
more emphasis on what they think of the candidates personally.
</P>
<P>
   That has led the contenders to scramble to define themselves
before their opponents define them first. A crucial event in this
rush to fill-in-the-blanks will take place later this week when
Bush, the Republican front-runner, participates in the first of a
series of nationally televised debates with his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And several campaigns _ Republican and Democratic alike _ have
begun or are preparing barrages of TV commercials designed to shape
(or reshape) the images of their candidates. Bradley, for one, has
a new commercial portraying him as an engaged senator, with
tributes from two former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Jay Leno test,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic
strategist in Chicago. ``If a salient quality of yours begins to
become a frequent repeat joke in Jay Leno's monologue, then you've
reached such a level of attention and penetration that that quality
will begin to define you. These things are almost always unfair.
People are more complex than one quality. Bush may not be a genius,
but he's not a moron either _ or he wouldn't be where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the current campaign season started so early and some
preliminary impressions have already been formed, the coming
debates may be less an opportunity for candidates to make positive
impressions or define themselves through their ideas. Instead, the
debates may be more about warding off destructive images and
avoiding gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates can be more corrective than necessarily reinforcing
positive points,'' said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at
Northeastern University in Boston who is an authority on debates.
``Ross Perot in '92 was thought to be something of a joke. In that
first debate he really captured a lot of people's fancy and it
allowed him to be taken seriously _ briefly as it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media consultant, says debates
offer voters a rare opportunity ``to compare what they've heard to
what they consider the reality they can see with their own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate on Thursday, Bush has the most at stake because
the event is something of a coming out _ and because he needs to
combat the questions about his depth. Moving already to put those
questions to rest, Bush sought out interviews recently to
demonstrate he is no tenderfoot in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to head it off before it does filter down,'' said
Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant. ``The danger is to let a
perception become a reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But politicians have to take care to not appear as if they are
cynically reinventing themselves. Gore became the butt of new jokes
last March when, stumping in Iowa, he played up his farming bona
fides, glossing over the reality that he was raised in a hotel in
Washington. Recalling his youthful summers at the family farm in
Tennessee, he said his father ``taught me how to clean out hog
waste with a shovel and a hose.''
</P>
<P>
   Such setbacks explain why McCain, fearful that the temper label
might stick, did not dare dispute that he has one. Instead, he
raised the issue head-on in a debate last month by asserting that
people sometimes mistake his passion on policy for a temper. The
remark was part of a spin offense that has helped stoke a debate
over whether a hothead in the Oval Office was such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by candidates to undo existing perceptions are not
entirely new. Ronald Reagan, in his debate with Jimmy Carter in
1980, uttered the world ``peace'' over and over to overcome his
image as a warmonger. In his debate with Walter F. Mondale four
years later, Reagan quieted whispers about his age by teasing
Mondale about his youth and inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   It does not always work. Quayle's debate with Gore in 1992
became a test of manhood: He had to prove he was sharp and deep,
not a shallow caricature. Quayle drew many laudatory reviews, but
in the end he probably didn't get as much credit as he deserved:
his image was already set in cement.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the Democratic strategist, argues that reporters
will instinctively seize upon actions that confirm existing
impressions of candidates. ``The press will always lead with a
confirmation of an existing doubt,'' he said. `` `McCain, in a
flash of temper,' or `Bush didn't know the capital of New
Hampshire.' If Bush muffs a question, it hurts him more than if
McCain does. The question would be: Is he smart enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Carville said, ``If Gore comes off as stiff and
patrician, it will hurt him more than if Bradley does.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore might not mind being called stiff and patrician
these days, as long as it deflects attention from other more
damaging impressions linked to his well-known fund-raising event at
a Buddhist temple, his high praise for Clinton during the Lewinsky
scandal and his (inaccurate) boast that he invented the Internet _
all of which have contributed to an image of Gore as another garden
variety pol who will do or say anything to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to counter that perception with new commercials
that show him in a nonpolitical role and highlight his personal
history as a Vietnam veteran and reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Another remedy for politicians who worry that they are not
fairly portrayed in the media is to personally interact with lots
of voters, especially in small states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   After observing a more animated Gore at a town meeting last week
in Council Bluffs, Iowa, several Democrats said they were
unexpectedly impressed. ``I've always heard how stiff and wooden he
was,'' said Brad Miller, 40, a construction worker. ``But he had
some witticisms today that really surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore may have wowed one voter, Leno is a harder sell.
In his monologue the other night, he described an ``Al Gore doll''
that comes with ``no moving parts.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

   Here are some of the things that airline flight attendants have
watched passengers lug on board: Mariachi hats, potted palms,
boogie boards, shopping bags brimming with canned hams, a live duck
in a cage, cases of wine, covered-dish casseroles, multi-tiered
wedding cakes, a three-foot-tall religious statue for lawn display,
an automobile transmission and a freshly severed buck's head with
its antlers poking out of a trash bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen an animal head myself, but it wouldn't surprise
me one bit,'' said Tim Carey, a flight attendant who, like many of
his colleagues, dreads the long Thanksgiving holiday travel season,
which peaks today, the year's busiest single day for air travel. By
Tuesday, nearly 20 million passengers, a record, will have flown
domestic airlines during the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday travel
period, according to the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
   And they're carting a lot more stuff aboard than ever before.
Today, 6 out of 10 passengers haul a suitcase with them onto
flights. In 1992, only 2 out of 10 did, according a survey cited by
the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that represents about
46,000 of the more than 100,000 domestic flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants have always traded war stories about the
things passengers bring on board. But in the past few years, as
fully booked flights have become the norm and a proliferation of
carry-on bags have overwhelmed already tight storage space, the
situation has deteriorated from an annoyance into what flight
attendants say is a serious safety problem. In fact, it's their No.
1 workplace complaint _ and a significant cause of flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Airline employees sometimes suffer back and other injuries from
hoisting carry-on bags into storage compartments. Other injuries to
flight attendants and passengers are caused when bags fall from
overfilled storage bins. Furthermore, loose-cannon carry-on baggage
can block aisles and exits during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   While lawn statues and animal-head trophies make for colorful
anecdotes back at the hotel, the real problem comes from everyday
bags and laptops. The flight attendants union is lobbying the
federal government to adopt an industrywide law that would limit
carry-on luggage to a single bag, weighing 13 pounds or less, whose
combined length, width and height must not exceed 45 inches.
Laptops, briefcases, purses and even diaper bags would count under
that rule, which would replace the current hodgepodge of unevenly
enforced policies at individual airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers _ especially frequent fliers _ generally dislike the
idea of restrictions. Consumer advocates say the airlines created
the problem by reducing storage space, cramming customers into
planes, reducing connection times between flights and allowing
checked-baggage service to deteriorate to the point where 1 out of
every 200 passengers reports lost or delayed baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a touchy one in the fiercely competitive airline
industry. In the last year or two, most major carriers have imposed
stricter limits on both the number and size of carry-on baggage.
But airlines are loathe to alienate their frequent flyers _
especially business travelers, who are their most profitable
market. To the dismay of the flight attendants union, for example,
Continental Airlines refit 150 of its aircraft last year with
bigger overhead storage bins to accommodate more carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants say it's actually a small percentage of
passengers who cause the biggest problems. Among them are
infrequent flyers, especially those bound for foreign countries to
visit relatives, who trudge on board with live chickens, baskets of
food and overflowing shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring on jugs of gasoline because it's cheaper to buy
it here,'' said Henri Simonetti, a longtime flight attendant who,
like Carey, did not want to identify the airline he works for.
``Not that they intend to pose a safety threat, but please _ you
can't imagine a worse safety threat that a volatile fuel seeping
from the overhead bin.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passengers tend to be reasonable when the rules are
explained, flight crew members say. More difficult to handle are
hardened business passengers unable to find space for their
carry-ons. These customers are often paying full fare, and
traveling on a tight schedule that is vulnerable to the slightest
delay and conducive to frayed tempers.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core business-trip routes are considered to be the worst.
``Los Angeles to New York can be a  &UR; very &LR;  difficult trip,''
Simonetti said. ``You'll hear: `I'm a member of your frequent flier
club. I'm on your airline five times a week. Therefore, I should be
able to bring my five pieces of carry-on luggage on board,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Witkowski, the director of air safety and health
at the attendants union, said the only solution is a federal law to
reduce carry-on luggage by 50 percent and leave no wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got assaults that occur because passengers take out
their frustrations on the flight attendants,'' he said. ``People
are being injured and it's got to stop.''

   WASHINGTON _ At first, the survey results seemed depressingly
familiar: Nearly two-thirds of those who responded said they had
had a racially offensive encounter with a colleague during the 12
previous months, and there was a wide disparity in how blacks and
whites saw the state of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling is the setting in which the answers occurred.
This was not Simi Valley, Calif., or Decatur, Ill., or even a
typical college campus. This was the military, which has been held
up as the paragon of racial integration, tolerance and equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are contained in a 265-page report issued last week
on how the nearly 1.4 million men and women in the armed forces
view the racial climate there. More than 40,000 enlisted men and
women and officers responded.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of black members of the military _ a rate five
times higher than among whites _ said they believed they had
received a worse evaluation than they deserved because of their
race. And while only 17 percent of whites said the military was
paying ``too little attention'' to racism and discrimination in its
ranks, 38 percent of Hispanic military personnel and 62 percent of
blacks felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   This racial Rashomon is nothing new in the civilian world. From
the O.J. Simpson trial to opinions about the police to the need for
affirmative action, whites and minorities, especially blacks and
Hispanics, have seen things through such different lenses as to
make one wonder if they are on the same planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going on and those incidents are being experienced
in an environment that we think is doing pretty well on race, it
gives you pause to wonder what might be happening on the factory
floor or in offices around the country,'' said Edwin Dorn, a former
under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the report's findings raise the question of whether any
institution can ever do enough to bridge racially divided
perceptions, or whether racial attitudes are so deep-seated that
nothing can root them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson number one is that blacks will always see race
relations in a more pessimistic way than whites,'' said Charles
Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who has studied the
military. ``This cuts across gender and rank and is not likely to
change in the foreseeable future. But it also shows that blacks and
white do not have to hold identical views of the racial situation
in order to succeed together. That's why we don't care about
attitudes. We care about behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion would, no doubt, cause jitters among liberals
since many of their favored ideas, like producing minority role
models and diversity training, focus on influencing racial
attitudes rather than discriminatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the military, especially the Army,
is far and away the most racially integrated institution in
American society. Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American men
and women make up 32 percent of the armed forces, although as in
civilian society they are more heavily clustered at the bottom
ranks than at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, the military's largest branch, blacks make up
nearly one-quarter of the staff sergeants, master sergeants and
first sergeants. More than 15 percent of all military officers are
members of a minority group.
</P>
<P>
   As Moskos and John Sibley Butler, co-authors of ``All That We
Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way,''
(Twentieth Century Fund) point out, at some point in virtually
every white soldier's career, his or her boss will be black; this
is something that few, if any, other institutions in the country
can claim.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of racial integration has flowed into other
areas. Studies indicate that the most racially integrated cities in
the country _ places like Fayetteville, N.C., Lawton, Okla., and
Jacksonville, N.C. _ are military towns. The armed forces also
devote a tremendous amount of time and effort to promoting good
race relations and equal opportunity. Incoming military personnel
undergo intensive training in race relations Military units have a
race relations adviser to make sure things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet widely different perceptions remain about the state of race
relations and the military's efforts to improve things. Such a
finding leads to questions over whether whites understate the
problem to shield themselves from guilt or the charge of racism and
minorities overstate it out of pressure not to be out of step with
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Cooper &AMP; Seacrest, an Alexandria, Va., polling
company, inquired into racial attitudes in Fayetteville, N.C. In
their survey, 53 percent of black respondents who were interviewed
individually by black questioners and told that their answers would
be confidential agreed with the statement that ``as a country we
focus too much on issues of race.''When African-Americans were
asked the same question in a focus group, nearly everyone
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   But before Pentagon officials take comfort in a notion that the
study merely reflects the grousing that normally goes on in the
ranks they should contemplate one other finding. About 85 percent
of white, Hispanic and Asian respondents, and 79 percent of blacks,
said they did not officially report a bothersome racial incident in
the previous 12 months. The leading cause was that they didn't
think anything would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at such a finding, Pentagon officials might well recall
the words of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin L. Powell, the most successful African-American ever in the
military. ``The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is
the day you have stopped leading them,'' Powell wrote. ``They have
either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded you do
not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.''

``Los Angeles to New York can be a  &UR; very &LR;  difficult trip,''
Simonetti said. ``You'll hear: `I'm a member of your frequent flier
club. I'm on your airline five times a week. Therefore, I should be
able to bring my five pieces of carry-on luggage on board,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Witkowski, the director of air safety and health
at the attendants union, said the only solution is a federal law to
reduce carry-on luggage by 50 percent and leave no wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got assaults that occur because passengers take out
their frustrations on the flight attendants,'' he said. ``People
are being injured and it's got to stop.''

   Soon after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean,
the personal-injury lawyers at R. Jack Clapp and Associates
marshaled their resources and mobilized their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say class-action lawsuit, the Washington,
D.C., firm, which specializes in aviation disasters, launched
EgyptAir990.com _ a Web site that at first blush appears primarily
concerned with helping the bereaved deal with loss, but on closer
examination is all about financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Such online opportunism hardly burnishes the flagging reputation
of lawyers, a profession so unpopular that even the reviled HMO
industry now feels at liberty to smack them around.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to head off legislation that would strip health
maintenance organizations of their immunity from patients'
lawsuits, an HMO advocacy group last month broadcast a TV
commercial that explicitly portrayed lawyers as sharks: ``America's
richest trial lawyers are circling _ and your health plan is the
bait: Call Congress today.''
</P>
<P>
   But now some lawyers and bar associations are biting back _
adopting a range of strategies to reverse the profession's slide in
stature.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's bar association, for instance, convened a
series of town meetings this year so people could air gripes about
lawyers and the legal system. The upshot: legal triage clinics
where lawyers advise walk-in clients pro bono, and sensitivity
training for cranky court personnel. In Louisiana, the bar
association has produced ``Louisiana Lawyers: Enriching Louisiana
Life(C),'' a six-minute video starring earnest lawyers feeding the
homeless at a soup kitchen; empathetic lawyers strolling with AIDS
patients; and wise lawyers teaching kids about the legal
consequences of illicit drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think all we do is sit at our desks and bill
time,'' noted Michael Ferachi, a civil litigator shown painting an
elderly neighbor's house. ``But this gives us a chance to show
people that were interested in caring for others that can't care
for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To recast lawyers as protectors rather than predators, other bar
associations have also gone the feel-good route. Cut to a classroom
brought to you in a TV spot sponsored by the Ohio bar:
</P>
<P>
   ``Class, what do your parents do for a living?'' inquires a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad protects people,'' volunteers one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so he's a police officer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, his dad is like my mom,'' chimes in a little girl. ``She
helps sick and hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so they're doctors?'' wonders the teacher. No, say the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the exasperated teacher asks, ``So what do your parents
do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lawyers!'' cry the tykes in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Mills, a cultural critic and author of ``The Triumph of
Meanness: America's War Against Its Better Self,'' says the public
relations blitz may be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't change the shark image when the lawyers who make the
headlines have gotten huge divorce settlements, thwarted the
Justice Department or outfoxed a district attorney on a criminal
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry image of lawyers has been rounded out lately by tacky
late-night commercials for ambulance chasers; the legal lobby's
opposition to tort reform; and the one-two punch of the O.J.
Simpson trial and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawyers cringe at the proliferation of obnoxious TV
judges past their prime (time), presiding over video kangaroo
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood's portrayal of the profession isn't all bad. Paul
Levinson, a professor of communications at Fordham University,
believes that the popularity of TV dramas like ``Law and Order''
and ``The Practice'' has had the curious effect of both idealizing
the profession and pointing up its real-life deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The committed, diligent TV lawyers on both shows deserve
admiration, he explains, but their decency may signal
disillusionment with actual lawyers. ``When doctors stopped making
house calls in the Sixties, `Marcus Welby' became a hit,'' Levinson
said. ``It fulfilled our wishes for an old-fashioned doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same holds true for the lawyers on `The Practice,' who are
utterly devoted to clients. We fervently wish we could fulfill
fantasies of such lawyers as knights in shining armor.''
</P>
<P>
   And now such yearnings have some lawyers looking to heal
themselves. Carl Bogus, a professor at Roger Williams University
Law School, who this year organized a soul-searching conference,
Lawyer Collaboration With Systems of Evil, argues that lawyers
needn't indulge litigious clients who file questionable suits.
Notable cases arguably include the coffee drinker who sued
McDonald's after scalding herself or, more recently, the parents of
the Columbine High School gunman who intend to target his school
district for not doing more to prevent his carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers used to say no to clients more often,'' Bogus
complained. ``Lawyers used to say, you may have a right to make
this argument but there's something offensive to making this
argument. Go get yourself another lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for clients, they're pretty happy with the lawyers they
have _ suggesting the limits of a legal charm offensive in a system
that is by its nature adversarial and often cutthroat. A recent
survey by the American Bar Association, for example, found that 75
percent of people expressed satisfaction with their own lawyer's
performance, regardless of what they thought about the profession
in general. ``People think about lawyers like they think about
congressmen,'' said Stephen Gillers, Vice Dean of New York
University Law School. ``Lawyers are a bad group, but my lawyer is
real good.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first, the survey results seemed depressingly
familiar: Nearly two-thirds of those who responded said they had
had a racially offensive encounter with a colleague during the 12
previous months, and there was a wide disparity in how blacks and
whites saw the state of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling is the setting in which the answers occurred.
This was not Simi Valley, Calif., or Decatur, Ill., or even a
typical college campus. This was the military, which has been held
up as the paragon of racial integration, tolerance and equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are contained in a 265-page report issued last week
on how the nearly 1.4 million men and women in the armed forces
view the racial climate there. More than 40,000 enlisted men and
women and officers responded.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of black members of the military _ a rate five
times higher than among whites _ said they believed they had
received a worse evaluation than they deserved because of their
race. And while only 17 percent of whites said the military was
paying ``too little attention'' to racism and discrimination in its
ranks, 38 percent of Hispanic military personnel and 62 percent of
blacks felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   This racial Rashomon is nothing new in the civilian world. From
the O.J. Simpson trial to opinions about the police to the need for
affirmative action, whites and minorities, especially blacks and
Hispanics, have seen things through such different lenses as to
make one wonder if they are on the same planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going on and those incidents are being experienced
in an environment that we think is doing pretty well on race, it
gives you pause to wonder what might be happening on the factory
floor or in offices around the country,'' said Edwin Dorn, a former
under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the report's findings raise the question of whether any
institution can ever do enough to bridge racially divided
perceptions, or whether racial attitudes are so deep-seated that
nothing can root them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson number one is that blacks will always see race
relations in a more pessimistic way than whites,'' said Charles
Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who has studied the
military. ``This cuts across gender and rank and is not likely to
change in the foreseeable future. But it also shows that blacks and
white do not have to hold identical views of the racial situation
in order to succeed together. That's why we don't care about
attitudes. We care about behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion would, no doubt, cause jitters among liberals
since many of their favored ideas, like producing minority role
models and diversity training, focus on influencing racial
attitudes rather than discriminatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the military, especially the Army,
is far and away the most racially integrated institution in
American society. Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American men
and women make up 32 percent of the armed forces, although as in
civilian society they are more heavily clustered at the bottom
ranks than at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, the military's largest branch, blacks make up
nearly one-quarter of the staff sergeants, master sergeants and
first sergeants. More than 15 percent of all military officers are
members of a minority group.
</P>
<P>
   As Moskos and John Sibley Butler, co-authors of ``All That We
Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way,''
(Twentieth Century Fund) point out, at some point in virtually
every white soldier's career, his or her boss will be black; this
is something that few, if any, other institutions in the country
can claim.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of racial integration has flowed into other
areas. Studies indicate that the most racially integrated cities in
the country _ places like Fayetteville, N.C., Lawton, Okla., and
Jacksonville, N.C. _ are military towns. The armed forces also
devote a tremendous amount of time and effort to promoting good
race relations and equal opportunity. Incoming military personnel
undergo intensive training in race relations Military units have a
race relations adviser to make sure things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet widely different perceptions remain about the state of race
relations and the military's efforts to improve things. Such a
finding leads to questions over whether whites understate the
problem to shield themselves from guilt or the charge of racism and
minorities overstate it out of pressure not to be out of step with
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Cooper &AMP; Seacrest, an Alexandria, Va., polling
company, inquired into racial attitudes in Fayetteville, N.C. In
their survey, 53 percent of black respondents who were interviewed
individually by black questioners and told that their answers would
be confidential agreed with the statement that ``as a country we
focus too much on issues of race.''When African-Americans were
asked the same question in a focus group, nearly everyone
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   But before Pentagon officials take comfort in a notion that the
study merely reflects the grousing that normally goes on in the
ranks they should contemplate one other finding. About 85 percent
of white, Hispanic and Asian respondents, and 79 percent of blacks,
said they did not officially report a bothersome racial incident in
the previous 12 months. The leading cause was that they didn't
think anything would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at such a finding, Pentagon officials might well recall
the words of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin L. Powell, the most successful African-American ever in the
military. ``The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is
the day you have stopped leading them,'' Powell wrote. ``They have
either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded you do
not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.''

SEARCHING FOR THE SEARCH ENGINES OF MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't remember what I was looking for; it was something easy
to find on the World Wide Web, a fact or a song lyric or a recipe.
The original search topic was quickly forgotten when the search
engine replied with a non sequitur: ``Altavista knows the answer to
this question: What is the meaning of life?''
</P>
<P>
   When had the search for Web sites turned into the search for
meaning? How many clicks away was the meaning of life? And what
else did Altavista know?
</P>
<P>
   I selected the answer. A message appeared: ``Unable to connect
to the site. The site is down, overloaded, or unreachable. Try
connecting again later.''
</P>
<P>
   Overloaded, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone had figured out the meaning of life and posted it
on the Web, and Altavista had found it for me. Maybe users had
generated the question. Surfers in the throes of inner questioning
could have asked it. Readers of the ``Hitchhikers' Guide to the
Galaxy'' could have asked it, remembering the supercomputer in the
book that spends years pondering the meaning of life and finally
says the answer is: 42.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Internet search sites served as helpful road maps. With
advances in artificial intelligence, one day they might be
brilliant secretaries. But today, they are in a state of
transition, slouching toward the human, growing more philosophical.
Mixing mechanical and personal elements, they have turned into
accidental wisefolk, spiritual advisers and drive-by
psychoanalysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Renaissance, poets drew parallels between geographical
maps of newly discovered lands and the landscapes of the human body
and soul. Today, the newly discovered lands are virtual places
where users may seek themselves. A spiritual pilgrimage used to
mean having to leave the house, but with the Web getting more
metaphysical, seekers can pursue truth right at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers began asking the major questions online five years ago,
when visionaries noticed the Web was a city built without a map and
launched Web directories like Yahoo and search engines like Lycos,
Infoseek and Altavista. In the beginning, the goal was clear: to
serve as tour guides in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines send a ``robot'' known as a ``spider'' or
``crawler'' to scan Web sites. The spider feeds data into an index.
Software then sorts and ranks indexed information. Yahoo uses human
indexing rather than mechanical indexing, with individuals mapping
out the territories of cyberspace. Such sites have spawned
imitators and ``metasearchers'' _ search engines that search other
search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Today more than 3,000 engines scan, search and ``spider'' other
sites, holding up virtual lanterns and giving directions, waiting
for the day they will have the technology to behave with real
intelligence. Meanwhile, they approximate intelligence and
sometimes end up sounding like a maddening cocktail party guest or
an idiot savant.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista has always had a stunning number of Web pages indexed
_ estimated today at more than 250 million. But that wasn't enough.
This spring, the folks behind the curtain decided that Altavista
should speak English. The Queen's English.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista had licensed the technology from the ``Ask Jeeves''
search engine (www.ask.com). That engine, of course, is modeled
after the ingenious, efficient butler from P.G. Wodehouse's
fiction, casting the user in the role of Bertie Wooster, the
cheerfully incompetent narrator who couldn't find socks already on
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Users would type questions in English _ ``What is the highest
mountain in Uzbekistan?'' _ and Jeeves would answer or raise a
related question: ``Jeeves knows the answer to these questions:
`Where can I go mountain-climbing?'; `Where can I ski in Aspen?';
`What is Uzbekistan?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Jeeves came off like an infuriating salesperson,
trying to sell you sandals when you specifically asked for rain
boots; sometimes he would surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities of these engines were clear: Jeeves spoke
English, Altavista spoke full-text search indexing. Jeeves liked
questions, Altavista liked phrases in quotation marks. Jeeves
seemed like an aging, avuncular know-it-all, Altavista seemed like
the woman who keeps winning Double Jeopardy. Their
technology-sharing agreement made for strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is unnerving when Altavista claims to know things _
using the same sentences that Jeeves did, without a helpful smiling
cartoon to suggest personhood. But it is comforting to think the
answers to the big questions are just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site _ answers.com _ attempts to indulge this fantasy.
Instead of referring to other sites as search engines do,
answers.com gives answers right there _ to such questions as ``Does
extraterrestrial life exist?'' ``Where do babies come from?'' and
``Can you kiss your own elbow?''
</P>
<P>
   When answers.com launched, the site charged for individual
answers depending on the difficulty of the question, starting at
$1.79 for an easy answer, and up to $11.99 for custom research.
``What is the meaning of life?'' was the site's most popular
question in 1997 and cost $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that people want the answers to the big questions
but they don't want to pay for them. So the site now answers
questions for free, as developers prepare for a re-launch in
December, when answers.com will license its technology to other
companies, using the interface to help weed through frequently
asked questions on corporate Web sites. Individuals will still be
able to ask the pressing questions at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for the complimentary answer to the meaning of life,
answers.com replied, ``When you find out, let us know!'' One hopes
that the $1.79 answer had more substance.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the most popular question has been ``Why is the sky
blue?'' The site deals with the topic deftly. It also handles the
classic, ``If a tree fell in a forest, and no one was around to
hear it, would it make a sound?'' The answer explains how
physicists and philosophers can have different definitions of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest free answer offered to me came one autumn day
when Altavista performed a search on some dry academic question and
then added, ``Altavista knows the answer to this question: Am I in
love?''
</P>
<P>
   This question only raised more questions. Who was Altavista,
anyway? Ideally, the engine was a mind-reader able to give
different answers to each emotionally conflicted user. Or was
Altavista itself in love, and sure of it?
</P>
<P>
   And who wrote the question? Had the programmers anticipated that
it might be asked? Or was the engine spitting out a question that
had originated with a user? If so, who was this poor soul who
yearned for romantic advice from a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Computers have already created poetry and art. Futurists say
that one day supercomputers will know loneliness, lobby for legal
rights, and learn how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   But if we teach computers how to know and how to feel, can we
teach them to know how they feel? That's an entirely different
lesson, one that human beings can barely process themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If Altavista is in love _ and I imagine Jeeves wouldn't be right
for her anyway _ and if she really knew it, artificial intelligence
will have reached a new high.

complained. ``Lawyers used to say, you may have a right to make
this argument but there's something offensive to making this
argument. Go get yourself another lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for clients, they're pretty happy with the lawyers they
have _ suggesting the limits of a legal charm offensive in a system
that is by its nature adversarial and often cutthroat. A recent
survey by the American Bar Association, for example, found that 75
percent of people expressed satisfaction with their own lawyer's
performance, regardless of what they thought about the profession
in general. ``People think about lawyers like they think about
congressmen,'' said Stephen Gillers, Vice Dean of New York
University Law School. ``Lawyers are a bad group, but my lawyer is
real good.''

SEARCHING FOR THE SEARCH ENGINES OF MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't remember what I was looking for; it was something easy
to find on the World Wide Web, a fact or a song lyric or a recipe.
The original search topic was quickly forgotten when the search
engine replied with a non sequitur: ``Altavista knows the answer to
this question: What is the meaning of life?''
</P>
<P>
   When had the search for Web sites turned into the search for
meaning? How many clicks away was the meaning of life? And what
else did Altavista know?
</P>
<P>
   I selected the answer. A message appeared: ``Unable to connect
to the site. The site is down, overloaded, or unreachable. Try
connecting again later.''
</P>
<P>
   Overloaded, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone had figured out the meaning of life and posted it
on the Web, and Altavista had found it for me. Maybe users had
generated the question. Surfers in the throes of inner questioning
could have asked it. Readers of the ``Hitchhikers' Guide to the
Galaxy'' could have asked it, remembering the supercomputer in the
book that spends years pondering the meaning of life and finally
says the answer is: 42.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Internet search sites served as helpful road maps. With
advances in artificial intelligence, one day they might be
brilliant secretaries. But today, they are in a state of
transition, slouching toward the human, growing more philosophical.
Mixing mechanical and personal elements, they have turned into
accidental wisefolk, spiritual advisers and drive-by
psychoanalysts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Renaissance, poets drew parallels between geographical
maps of newly discovered lands and the landscapes of the human body
and soul. Today, the newly discovered lands are virtual places
where users may seek themselves. A spiritual pilgrimage used to
mean having to leave the house, but with the Web getting more
metaphysical, seekers can pursue truth right at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers began asking the major questions online five years ago,
when visionaries noticed the Web was a city built without a map and
launched Web directories like Yahoo and search engines like Lycos,
Infoseek and Altavista. In the beginning, the goal was clear: to
serve as tour guides in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines send a ``robot'' known as a ``spider'' or
``crawler'' to scan Web sites. The spider feeds data into an index.
Software then sorts and ranks indexed information. Yahoo uses human
indexing rather than mechanical indexing, with individuals mapping
out the territories of cyberspace. Such sites have spawned
imitators and ``metasearchers'' _ search engines that search other
search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Today more than 3,000 engines scan, search and ``spider'' other
sites, holding up virtual lanterns and giving directions, waiting
for the day they will have the technology to behave with real
intelligence. Meanwhile, they approximate intelligence and
sometimes end up sounding like a maddening cocktail party guest or
an idiot savant.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista has always had a stunning number of Web pages indexed
_ estimated today at more than 250 million. But that wasn't enough.
This spring, the folks behind the curtain decided that Altavista
should speak English. The Queen's English.
</P>
<P>
   Altavista had licensed the technology from the ``Ask Jeeves''
search engine (www.ask.com). That engine, of course, is modeled
after the ingenious, efficient butler from P.G. Wodehouse's
fiction, casting the user in the role of Bertie Wooster, the
cheerfully incompetent narrator who couldn't find socks already on
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Users would type questions in English _ ``What is the highest
mountain in Uzbekistan?'' _ and Jeeves would answer or raise a
related question: ``Jeeves knows the answer to these questions:
`Where can I go mountain-climbing?'; `Where can I ski in Aspen?';
`What is Uzbekistan?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Jeeves came off like an infuriating salesperson,
trying to sell you sandals when you specifically asked for rain
boots; sometimes he would surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities of these engines were clear: Jeeves spoke
English, Altavista spoke full-text search indexing. Jeeves liked
questions, Altavista liked phrases in quotation marks. Jeeves
seemed like an aging, avuncular know-it-all, Altavista seemed like
the woman who keeps winning Double Jeopardy. Their
technology-sharing agreement made for strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is unnerving when Altavista claims to know things _
using the same sentences that Jeeves did, without a helpful smiling
cartoon to suggest personhood. But it is comforting to think the
answers to the big questions are just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site _ answers.com _ attempts to indulge this fantasy.
Instead of referring to other sites as search engines do,
answers.com gives answers right there _ to such questions as ``Does
extraterrestrial life exist?'' ``Where do babies come from?'' and
``Can you kiss your own elbow?''
</P>
<P>
   When answers.com launched, the site charged for individual
answers depending on the difficulty of the question, starting at
$1.79 for an easy answer, and up to $11.99 for custom research.
``What is the meaning of life?'' was the site's most popular
question in 1997 and cost $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that people want the answers to the big questions
but they don't want to pay for them. So the site now answers
questions for free, as developers prepare for a re-launch in
December, when answers.com will license its technology to other
companies, using the interface to help weed through frequently
asked questions on corporate Web sites. Individuals will still be
able to ask the pressing questions at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for the complimentary answer to the meaning of life,
answers.com replied, ``When you find out, let us know!'' One hopes
that the $1.79 answer had more substance.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the most popular question has been ``Why is the sky
blue?'' The site deals with the topic deftly. It also handles the
classic, ``If a tree fell in a forest, and no one was around to
hear it, would it make a sound?'' The answer explains how
physicists and philosophers can have different definitions of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest free answer offered to me came one autumn day
when Altavista performed a search on some dry academic question and
then added, ``Altavista knows the answer to this question: Am I in
love?''
</P>
<P>
   This question only raised more questions. Who was Altavista,
anyway? Ideally, the engine was a mind-reader able to give
different answers to each emotionally conflicted user. Or was
Altavista itself in love, and sure of it?
</P>
<P>
   And who wrote the question? Had the programmers anticipated that
it might be asked? Or was the engine spitting out a question that
had originated with a user? If so, who was this poor soul who
yearned for romantic advice from a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Computers have already created poetry and art. Futurists say
that one day supercomputers will know loneliness, lobby for legal
rights, and learn how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   But if we teach computers how to know and how to feel, can we
teach them to know how they feel? That's an entirely different
lesson, one that human beings can barely process themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If Altavista is in love _ and I imagine Jeeves wouldn't be right
for her anyway _ and if she really knew it, artificial intelligence
will have reached a new high.

<P>
   STIMLJE, Kosovo _ Valerie Petignat Wright, a 33-year-old Swiss
official, is a symbol of all that is wrong and right with the
United Nations effort to run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of 29 prefects appointed by the United Nations to run
Kosovo's municipalities and is in charge of the lives of more than
30,000 people around this battered town. She has intelligence,
verve and all the will in the world, but after more than two months
here, she has little money or staff to back up her titular
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In front of her office, the road that runs through town looks
like the surface of the moon _ cratered, pitted and
bone-shattering. It is constantly clogged with traffic, and Ms.
Wright would like to fix it. ``But there's no money,'' she said
darkly, hugging herself in the cold because the electricity is off
again. ``There's no money for anything.'' She sighed, then smiled.
``It's a bit of a strange status. Nothing is quite clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few yards away is the larger, warmer office of Ruzhdi
Jashari, 44, who was appointed mayor by the Kosovo Liberation Army
and its provisional government a day before NATO forces entered
Kosovo in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jashari, a kind of village ideologue, worked in education and
joined the guerrillas relatively early, and by October 1998 he was
in charge of public relations for civil order in areas that they
controlled. He spent the war in the mountains within a few miles of
here.
</P>
<P>
   He says he respects the United Nations and is happy to work with
Ms. Wright, but he makes it clear that he believes he exercises
what passes for official control here. He sits at the head of a
long conference table. He runs education and has people's respect
as a fighter, but he has no money to fix the road, either.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kosovo Liberation Army, which has supposedly
transformed itself into a civilian force with no military or police
responsibilities, is not the only challenge to the authority of the
U.N. Mission in Kosovo, known as Unmik; the mission is also
undermined by the international civilian agencies that are supposed
to serve it, and by the sheer size and resources of the NATO-led
force here _ 42,000 troops _ whose role tends to be defined only as
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian agencies have large organizations and budgets. They
rely on many of the same donor countries for their own financing as
the U.N. Mission here. And in many cases, they are struggling with
the mission and its director, Bernard Kouchner of France, over
responsibilities and even glory. Each of those other agencies has
its own massive office building in Pristina, its own vehicles, even
its own identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is in
charge of the return of the 850,000 refugees, their temporary
housing and their food. It coordinates the many aid agencies that
bustle (in so far as anyone bustles) around Stimlje. The European
Union is responsible for more permanent reconstruction, but all of
that, European bureaucrats have decided, will have to wait until
next year. And the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe is supposed to help build Kosovo's future society along
democratic lines. Effectively, that means training police and
judges, preparing elections, developing education, media and
human-rights programs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and Kouchner have two tasks that are hard to
reconcile: while running Kosovo's civil administration until
self-governing institutions can be put in place, they are also
supposed to be in overall charge of everyone, including the
better-financed agencies that are planning those new institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This adds up to a lot of agencies competing with each other at
the expense of accomplishing tasks they might be dividing up more
efficiently. For example, the Europeans are emphasizing planning
for the future rather than fulfiling commitments to help address
housing needs, even as a hard winter sets in. And while the OSCE is
planning how to democratize a multi-thnic Kosovo, a more urgent
requirement might be to work harder now with the peacekeepers to
stem the wave of hatred, killings and arson designed to drive out
Kosovo's remaining Serbs and Gypsies, further poisoning chances for
real democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There is significant overlap and conflict. In particular,
officials of both organizations say, the head of the OSCE in
Kosovo, Daan Everts, has been working successfully to take control
from the United Nations over the key human-rights portfolio, the
job of media oversight and development, including the licensing and
running of new media outlets, and the election schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Everts' success _ like the bureaucratic
infighting _ is not surprising. The United States and Britain
wanted the OSCE, an organization of more than 50 nations, to run
Kosovo, rather than the United Nations. The OSCE's members
represent the richest members of the United Nations, and the
organization easily has twice as many foreign officials here as
does Kouchner's office.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, as the United Nations begins to be blamed for
foreseeable problems of organization and inefficiency, its main
member governments, which have been slow to provide funds and
manpower, prefer to evade responsibility. And senior OSCE officials
are relieved to be responsible ``for the future'' rather than the
present morass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is one of Kouchner's volunteers. Trained in
psychology and women's studies, she had run an aid agency in
Guatemala giving vocational training to street children. She was
working on vocational training for the Swiss government when she
heard that ``people were wanted for Kosovo.'' She volunteered
without a job description.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself the mayor and more for thousands of people
whose language she doesn't speak and whose history she is only
beginning to understand.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO-led force known as KFOR patrols the center of
Stimlje, there are as yet no United Nations police because
governments have not yet met their manpower pledges. Nor is there
any fire brigade. Of the 2,000 Serbs in Stimlje last year, she
says, ``there are now 24 Serbs, and I know them all.'' They are
elderly and come from a few families, and KFOR is here to protect
them. A lot of her job is to mediate quarrels over vacant
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   She and an assistant from Cameroon, Gilbert Nantsa, are
preparing a local newsletter, to be published in English, Albanian
and Serbian. ``Well, there will be 24 copies in Serbian,'' Ms.
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multi-ethnicity isn't going to happen,'' she said bluntly.
``At best people will live side-by-side without killing each other.
They never really lived together before. Why should they start
now?'' The largest number of Serbs in her area, 180 of them, along
with some Gypsies, are actually in the mental hospital nearby,
which is run by the Norwegian Red Cross. She laughed ironically.
``It's the only multi-ethnic institution in the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem? ``Money. It's supposed to be coming, but
with no funds it's hard to make a budget or have an impact. I can't
pay city workers, teachers or health-care workers.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Jashari meet every week, she said. Ms. Wright, a
problem-solver, will work with anyone who can help. She has noticed
that initial KLA hostility to the United Nations has ebbed lately,
in part because the former guerrillas understand that people's
frustration at the mess and inactivity hurts them too.
</P>
<P>
   Jashari pulls on a cigarette and says: ``We are facing a lot of
problems here.'' Some 15 percent of the Albanian population have
not yet returned from abroad, and some are bound to be dead, he
said. ``And the people who are back lack housing,'' he said. He
says there is a desperate need for personal documentation, identity
cards and passports. ``While we were ready to do a lot of things,
because of our respect for Unmik, we handicapped ourselves and
didn't do anything,'' he said with a straight face. So even the
KLA, which resisted U.N. authority, is blaming the United Nations
now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is amused, but in a somber way. ``Everyone is more or
less panicky, because nothing much has been done before the
winter,'' she said. ``The ex-fighters promised a lot but didn't
deliver. Of course, neither has Unmik.''

SHE'S NOT THE FIRST LADY TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, with 132 rooms of grandeur and its
aura of power, has often seemed confining to the wives of the men
who lived there. Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did
not have to exercise through her husband, announced last week that
she was moving to an 11-room house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to find the White
House stifling and to leave a husband rattling around in the
whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Louisa Adams, wife of
John Quincy Adams, appears to have been the first, but not the
last, to refer to the White House as a gilded prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of
first ladyship, from the wretched heat of Washington summers, from
painful marriages. They fled to the seaside oasis of Oyster Bay,
N.Y., to family homes in Independence, Mo., and Hyde Park, N.Y., to
an artists' colony at Cornish, N.H., and a peanut farm in Plains,
Ga. They left the White House seeking solace, solitude or personal
fulfillment. Ellen Axson Wilson, Woodrow Wilson's first wife, went
away for months at a time to practice art in New Hampshire. Louisa
Adams spent summers apart from her husband because their
relationship had soured and she despised the political atmosphere
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these first ladies called a news conference to
announce a move out of the White House to live in another city.
Mrs. Clinton said Chappaqua, a suburb of New York, would be her
permanent residence as she campaigns for the Senate. She plans to
return to Washington ``from time to time,'' to attend to social
affairs such as state dinners and the New Year's Eve millennial
celebration. ``It does sound weird,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony,
an authority on first ladies, ``because it's unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is, at least in this sense: While all the others may have
felt personally hemmed in, even frustrated, by White House life,
Mrs. Clinton is the first to declare that she has a political life
distinct from her husband's, one that requires her to leave his
house.
</P>
<P>
   The job of first lady is nowhere defined in law or Constitution;
it has evolved over the years into a combination of national social
secretary and sometime presidential adviser. While some first
ladies, like Nancy Reagan, gloried in their hostess roles, others
discharged their duties sporadically, said Anthony, author of the
two-volume ``First Ladies'' (William Morrow and Company, 1990).
Jacqueline Kennedy spent dozens of weekends with her children at
country homes near Middleburg, Va., and commuted to Washington for
state functions; Bess Truman, who hated the White House and
decamped for her family home in Missouri every chance she got,
would often miss them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt used her fieldstone cottage, Val-Kill, on the
Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, and an apartment on
Washington Square in Manhattan as places to write her newspaper
columns and to socialize with her tight circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Truman, who referred to the White House as the ``Great
White Jail,'' left Washington as often as she could, according to a
biography written by her daughter, Margaret. She claimed she had to
return to Independence to care for her aging mother or look after
the family house, but ``these reasons were essentially
rationalizations for Bess' retreat from the White House, the
presidency, the whole rigamarole of playing first lady,'' Margaret
Truman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of this long-distance relationship between the
Clintons, two congenital pols, one at the dawn of an electoral
career, the other in its twilight?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want answers right away,'' said Anthony. ``But
we don't have any idea how it's going to work, we don't know how
it's going to play out. It is just a unique circumstance.''

 STIMLJE: new institutions.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This adds up to a lot of agencies competing with each other at
the expense of accomplishing tasks they might be dividing up more
efficiently. For example, the Europeans are emphasizing planning
for the future rather than fulfiling commitments to help address
housing needs, even as a hard winter sets in. And while the OSCE is
planning how to democratize a multi-thnic Kosovo, a more urgent
requirement might be to work harder now with the peacekeepers to
stem the wave of hatred, killings and arson designed to drive out
Kosovo's remaining Serbs and Gypsies, further poisoning chances for
real democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There is significant overlap and conflict. In particular,
officials of both organizations say, the head of the OSCE in
Kosovo, Daan Everts, has been working successfully to take control
from the United Nations over the key human-rights portfolio, the
job of media oversight and development, including the licensing and
running of new media outlets, and the election schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Everts' success _ like the bureaucratic
infighting _ is not surprising. The United States and Britain
wanted the OSCE, an organization of more than 50 nations, to run
Kosovo, rather than the United Nations. The OSCE's members
represent the richest members of the United Nations, and the
organization easily has twice as many foreign officials here as
does Kouchner's office.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, as the United Nations begins to be blamed for
foreseeable problems of organization and inefficiency, its main
member governments, which have been slow to provide funds and
manpower, prefer to evade responsibility. And senior OSCE officials
are relieved to be responsible ``for the future'' rather than the
present morass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is one of Kouchner's volunteers. Trained in
psychology and women's studies, she had run an aid agency in
Guatemala giving vocational training to street children. She was
working on vocational training for the Swiss government when she
heard that ``people were wanted for Kosovo.'' She volunteered
without a job description.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself the mayor and more for thousands of people
whose language she doesn't speak and whose history she is only
beginning to understand.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO-led force known as KFOR patrols the center of
Stimlje, there are as yet no United Nations police because
governments have not yet met their manpower pledges. Nor is there
any fire brigade. Of the 2,000 Serbs in Stimlje last year, she
says, ``there are now 24 Serbs, and I know them all.'' They are
elderly and come from a few families, and KFOR is here to protect
them. A lot of her job is to mediate quarrels over vacant
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   She and an assistant from Cameroon, Gilbert Nantsa, are
preparing a local newsletter, to be published in English, Albanian
and Serbian. ``Well, there will be 24 copies in Serbian,'' Ms.
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multi-ethnicity isn't going to happen,'' she said bluntly.
``At best people will live side-by-side without killing each other.
They never really lived together before. Why should they start
now?'' The largest number of Serbs in her area, 180 of them, along
with some Gypsies, are actually in the mental hospital nearby,
which is run by the Norwegian Red Cross. She laughed ironically.
``It's the only multi-ethnic institution in the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem? ``Money. It's supposed to be coming, but
with no funds it's hard to make a budget or have an impact. I can't
pay city workers, teachers or health-care workers.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Jashari meet every week, she said. Ms. Wright, a
problem-solver, will work with anyone who can help. She has noticed
that initial KLA hostility to the United Nations has ebbed lately,
in part because the former guerrillas understand that people's
frustration at the mess and inactivity hurts them too.
</P>
<P>
   Jashari pulls on a cigarette and says: ``We are facing a lot of
problems here.'' Some 15 percent of the Albanian population have
not yet returned from abroad, and some are bound to be dead, he
said. ``And the people who are back lack housing,'' he said. He
says there is a desperate need for personal documentation, identity
cards and passports. ``While we were ready to do a lot of things,
because of our respect for Unmik, we handicapped ourselves and
didn't do anything,'' he said with a straight face. So even the
KLA, which resisted U.N. authority, is blaming the United Nations
now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is amused, but in a somber way. ``Everyone is more or
less panicky, because nothing much has been done before the
winter,'' she said. ``The ex-fighters promised a lot but didn't
deliver. Of course, neither has Unmik.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ As a greeting, it seems peculiarly unsuited to the
themes of life in modern urban China. Imagine this: ``Comrade, do
you like Starbucks' caffe latte?'' Or this: ``Comrade, how did you
do on the GRE's?'' Or even this: ``Comrade, did your stocks go up
today?''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was perhaps no surprise that the latest edition of
China's dictionary of record, Cihai (The Sea of Words), narrowed
the definition of the word tongzhi _ or comrade _ out of everyday
life, concluding that it could no longer be regarded as  &UR; the
 &LR; greeting among China's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 ``Sea of Words,'' ``comrade'' was ``a general form
of address among the citizens of our country.'' At the time,
comrade was China's universal salutation. In the 1989 revision of
the dictionary, ``comrade'' was ``a general form of address among
the citizens of socialist countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newest edition, published last month, drops all such
descriptions, noting: ``In the era of reform and opening up,
`comrade' is no longer the only form of address among ordinary
people. The Chinese words for Mister, Ma'am, Master and Miss have
returned as terms of respect and cordiality.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is very rare to hear the word ``comrade'' today in
ordinary conversations; when it appears, it sounds like a blast
from the past, like those Little Red Books of Mao's sayings that
are sold as curiosities in street markets. Even among the Communist
elite, the term appears to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everyday use, I've basically stopped using the term,''
said Dong Yuyu, a editor at the Communist Party-run newspaper,
Guangming Daily. ``But, of course, on official documents and
official meetings it's still employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when they were last referred to as ``comrade,'' many
people can only think of only one recent example: when they saw
President Jiang Zemin on TV last month, wearing a Mao suit and
addressing his countrymen to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking sphere of the word has, of course, directly
paralleled the shrinking relevance of ideology to everyday life in
this still nominally Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was hard to find any ``tongzhi's'' around. Bring
up the word `comrade'' with young people and you are likely to get
a bemused smile, as if you were suggesting the use of an ancient
greeting like ``squire'' or ``goody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrade?'' said a 17-year-old with the surname Nie. ``No I've
never thought of calling anyone that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the Communist Party has intermittently
struggled against the waning use of ``comrade,'' endeavoring to
insure at least its partial preservation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, in the wake of the crackdown on student pro-democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square, the Standing Committee of the
Politburo decried the emergence of terms like Mister and Miss,
saying that ``comrade'' was the best salutation for use among
ordinary people, according to one scholar. ``Miss'' was too
reminiscent of prostitutes in pre-revolutionary China, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, an essay in the People's Daily, the Communist
Party newspaper, said that ``comrade'' should be preserved as the
greeting at least among party members. And it bemoaned the fact the
some party members were addressing others with decidedly
un-socialist greetings, for example referring to their immediate
supervisors at work as the ``lao ban,'' or boss.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, usage has declined steadily, although there remains
a bit of a generational divide regarding the term. Older Chinese
still sometimes fall back on ``comrade'' to greet peers with good
Communist histories, and in formal situations at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In social situations I just use and Mrs., but at the
university we still use `comrade' for official documents or
meetings,'' said a senior philosophy professor and Communist Party
member.
</P>
<P>
   The word now translated as comrade originated some 2,200 years
ago in the early Qin Dynasty, when it was defined as pertaining to
people who have the same ethics and ideals. In the years before the
Communists took power in 1949, it took on a more modern cast: The
version of ``Sea of Words'' published in 1936, when ``tovarich''
was well established in Moscow, defined ``comrade'' as ``a mutual
form of address among people with the same ideological
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   It soon became the principal salutation of the rigidly
egalitarian Communist state, where even soldiers were forbidden
from acknowledging their rank, calling each other ``comrade.''
</P>
<P>
   How to address a friend or stranger is an issue that looms large
in China, where first names are rarely used and polite sentences
often start with a surname and an identifying salutation.
</P>
<P>
   And the gradual loss of the all-purpose ``comrade'' has created
something of a void, now filled by a large variety of options that
emphasize the stratification and many social distinctions of
today's China. Comrade Zhang of 1976 has become General Manager
Zhang, or teacher Zhang, or Miss Zhang or Classmate Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call people comrade,'' said Wang Bing, a salesman, who
was strolling on Beijing's Jian Guo Men Wai Street, under a large
array of billboards advertising Internet sites and computers. ``I
call young girls Miss. And men I call Mister. Or other times I use
their titles, like Director or Manager. Why? Because everybody
does.''

SHE'S NOT THE FIRST LADY TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, with 132 rooms of grandeur and its
aura of power, has often seemed confining to the wives of the men
who lived there. Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did
not have to exercise through her husband, announced last week that
she was moving to an 11-room house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to find the White
House stifling and to leave a husband rattling around in the
whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Louisa Adams, wife of
John Quincy Adams, appears to have been the first, but not the
last, to refer to the White House as a gilded prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of
first ladyship, from the wretched heat of Washington summers, from
painful marriages. They fled to the seaside oasis of Oyster Bay,
N.Y., to family homes in Independence, Mo., and Hyde Park, N.Y., to
an artists' colony at Cornish, N.H., and a peanut farm in Plains,
Ga. They left the White House seeking solace, solitude or personal
fulfillment. Ellen Axson Wilson, Woodrow Wilson's first wife, went
away for months at a time to practice art in New Hampshire. Louisa
Adams spent summers apart from her husband because their
relationship had soured and she despised the political atmosphere
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these first ladies called a news conference to
announce a move out of the White House to live in another city.
Mrs. Clinton said Chappaqua, a suburb of New York, would be her
permanent residence as she campaigns for the Senate. She plans to
return to Washington ``from time to time,'' to attend to social
affairs such as state dinners and the New Year's Eve millennial
celebration. ``It does sound weird,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony,
an authority on first ladies, ``because it's unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is, at least in this sense: While all the others may have
felt personally hemmed in, even frustrated, by White House life,
Mrs. Clinton is the first to declare that she has a political life
distinct from her husband's, one that requires her to leave his
house.
</P>
<P>
   The job of first lady is nowhere defined in law or Constitution;
it has evolved over the years into a combination of national social
secretary and sometime presidential adviser. While some first
ladies, like Nancy Reagan, gloried in their hostess roles, others
discharged their duties sporadically, said Anthony, author of the
two-volume ``First Ladies'' (William Morrow and Company, 1990).
Jacqueline Kennedy spent dozens of weekends with her children at
country homes near Middleburg, Va., and commuted to Washington for
state functions; Bess Truman, who hated the White House and
decamped for her family home in Missouri every chance she got,
would often miss them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt used her fieldstone cottage, Val-Kill, on the
Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, and an apartment on
Washington Square in Manhattan as places to write her newspaper
columns and to socialize with her tight circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Truman, who referred to the White House as the ``Great
White Jail,'' left Washington as often as she could, according to a
biography written by her daughter, Margaret. She claimed she had to
return to Independence to care for her aging mother or look after
the family house, but ``these reasons were essentially
rationalizations for Bess' retreat from the White House, the
presidency, the whole rigamarole of playing first lady,'' Margaret
Truman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of this long-distance relationship between the
Clintons, two congenital pols, one at the dawn of an electoral
career, the other in its twilight?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want answers right away,'' said Anthony. ``But
we don't have any idea how it's going to work, we don't know how
it's going to play out. It is just a unique circumstance.''

A MIDDLE EAST CHOICE: PEACE OR DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last several months, even as a final peace
between Israel and the Palestinians has come to seem more
plausible, a new element of uncertainty has been creeping into the
Middle East. The static pantheon of Arab leaders is beginning to
crumble, and generational change has started to sweep through the
region as aging and entrenched leaders give way to sons or
designate heirs. So these are anxious times, as iron men begin to
fade and courtiers plot their futures. Within five years, say
experts on the region, the current lineup of Arab leaders is likely
to be totally transformed.
</P>
<P>
   And so a new question has entered the calculations of those who
plan for peace or war in the region: Would democracies or
dictatorships make the best neighbors and partners in the emerging
peace with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   In the West, it is common to assume that the answer is simple:
democracies. But the Arab Middle East is a vast area where
Western-style democracy exists only in its infancy, if at all. Its
countries are riven with tribal, religious and ethnic fault lines,
and in many places extremes of wealth and poverty have left the
mass of people young, ill-educated and disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not a simple question whether opening the floodgates to
free expression of the tensions in these societies would provide
the quickest way to regional peace. These are places where
anti-Israeli sentiment is sometimes a passionate rallying cry for
all kinds of opposition groups, and where a monarch or dictator can
take a lead that a president who depends on consensus might not. On
the other hand, any regime maintained through repression risks,
over the years, lapsing into tyranny and instability, which are
among the worst of long-run risks to peace.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of how to think about balancing the goals of
democracy and peace is increasingly being wrestled with in
Washington as well as in Israel _ a democracy itself, but one that
has long made deals with whatever regimes would accept it, even as
it pointed out the absence of democracy in its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region is coming to the end of the postwar era, where
countries were ruled by a king or a military personality,'' said
Stephen P. Cohen, vice president of the center for Middle East
Studies in New York. But as the era ends, the style of rule is
unlikely to evolve much, he said. ``We're in a very sensitive time
concerning the self image of the Arab world. The idea that the
fundamentalist threat can only be controlled by hard military
rulers prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   One common thread runs through the process: the new leaders are
likely to emerge for reasons of bloodline rather than merit, and it
gives some analysts pause, no matter how pro-Western or pro-peace
these leaders are.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not being chosen for competence in modern
society but for loyalty and kinship,'' said Lisa Anderson, the dean
of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
University. ``There is not a layer of technocrats who appear to be
poised to take the reins of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries where change has occurred this year _ Jordan
and Morocco _ are monarchies that managed smooth transitions: King
Abdullah succeeded his father, King Hussein of Jordan, and Mohammed
VI succeeded his father, King Hassan of Morocco. Both sons are in
their 30s and have experienced life in Western democracies: King
Abdullah in Britain and America, King Mohammed in France.
</P>
<P>
   Both of their fathers were partners of Israel in making peace,
and the sons both see the need for economic reform to alleviate
poverty. So they may turn out to be the most open and forward
leaning of the new rulers in the region. Jordan, notably, has an
active Parliament and its new king sees the peace with Israel as a
lynchpin for his country's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, by contrast, the dynastic impulse in a tightly run
dictatorship is literally impeding peace. President Hafez Assad is
so busy organizing the succession of his son Bashar, who faces
challenges from other pretenders, that he has put any negotiations
for peace with Israel on hold. And a driving motivation for the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, as he negotiates on final
status issues with Yasser Arafat is the belief that the ailing
Palestinian leader may well be a more reliable partner than anyone
who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, the most immediate question is what will happen in
Syria, where Assad, who is from the minority Alawite tribe, has
fashioned the army, the Ba'ath party and other institutions around
fealty to him. Now 69, Assad is reported to be suffering from
memory loss. He looks haggard and is no longer able to sustain the
marathon negotiating sessions of the past, a recent American
visitor said.
</P>

   Assad has also resisted reform, and this will not help his
successor establish a peaceful transition. ``Assad knows if he
opens the door, the wind will carry him off,'' said Fouad Ajami, a
scholar of the region. ``He doesn't want to be the Gorbachev of
Syria. I don't know if he can hold it together.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades now, Egypt has played a pivotal position in the
Middle East's peacemaking, and Americans often identify with it as
if it were a like-minded democracy. In reality, despite the
trappings of elections and a parliament, the system is tightly
controlled by one party and the military; corruption is endemic, as
is tension over Islamic activism and the repression of it. A new
class of businessmen has emerged in recent years, providing an
elite interested in keeping the peace with Israel. But it is not
much interested in basic reforms, preferring to use state and crony
contacts to maintain its income, experts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, President Hosni Mubarak, who is 71, declared that his
son Gamal, a banker, would not succeed him, drawing a distinction
between Egypt and its neighbors. But that doesn't mean a democratic
succession. Ajami thinks the army will designate a successor if
Mubarak dies in office, which has become the standard way of giving
up power in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson gives credit to Israeli leaders for placing value
on democracy as they think about their neighbors' futures, even as
they recognize that Israel is probably the last country that could
promote democracy in them. ``The Israelis are quite aware of the
dilemma they are in,'' she said. ``They think democracy is a good
thing but if they make it known, they run the risk of being a
political football in the domestic politics of these countries. So
there is a temptation to say: `Let's sign on with this person, even
if he's unpopular at home.'''

A MIDDLE EAST CHOICE: PEACE OR DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last several months, even as a final peace
between Israel and the Palestinians has come to seem more
plausible, a new element of uncertainty has been creeping into the
Middle East. The static pantheon of Arab leaders is beginning to
crumble, and generational change has started to sweep through the
region as aging and entrenched leaders give way to sons or
designate heirs. So these are anxious times, as iron men begin to
fade and courtiers plot their futures. Within five years, say
experts on the region, the current lineup of Arab leaders is likely
to be totally transformed.
</P>
<P>
   And so a new question has entered the calculations of those who
plan for peace or war in the region: Would democracies or
dictatorships make the best neighbors and partners in the emerging
peace with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   In the West, it is common to assume that the answer is simple:
democracies. But the Arab Middle East is a vast area where
Western-style democracy exists only in its infancy, if at all. Its
countries are riven with tribal, religious and ethnic fault lines,
and in many places extremes of wealth and poverty have left the
mass of people young, ill-educated and disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not a simple question whether opening the floodgates to
free expression of the tensions in these societies would provide
the quickest way to regional peace. These are places where
anti-Israeli sentiment is sometimes a passionate rallying cry for
all kinds of opposition groups, and where a monarch or dictator can
take a lead that a president who depends on consensus might not. On
the other hand, any regime maintained through repression risks,
over the years, lapsing into tyranny and instability, which are
among the worst of long-run risks to peace.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of how to think about balancing the goals of
democracy and peace is increasingly being wrestled with in
Washington as well as in Israel _ a democracy itself, but one that
has long made deals with whatever regimes would accept it, even as
it pointed out the absence of democracy in its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region is coming to the end of the postwar era, where
countries were ruled by a king or a military personality,'' said
Stephen P. Cohen, vice president of the center for Middle East
Studies in New York. But as the era ends, the style of rule is
unlikely to evolve much, he said. ``We're in a very sensitive time
concerning the self image of the Arab world. The idea that the
fundamentalist threat can only be controlled by hard military
rulers prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   One common thread runs through the process: the new leaders are
likely to emerge for reasons of bloodline rather than merit, and it
gives some analysts pause, no matter how pro-Western or pro-peace
these leaders are.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not being chosen for competence in modern
society but for loyalty and kinship,'' said Lisa Anderson, the dean
of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
University. ``There is not a layer of technocrats who appear to be
poised to take the reins of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries where change has occurred this year _ Jordan
and Morocco _ are monarchies that managed smooth transitions: King
Abdullah succeeded his father, King Hussein of Jordan, and Mohammed
VI succeeded his father, King Hassan of Morocco. Both sons are in
their 30s and have experienced life in Western democracies: King
Abdullah in Britain and America, King Mohammed in France.
</P>
<P>
   Both of their fathers were partners of Israel in making peace,
and the sons both see the need for economic reform to alleviate
poverty. So they may turn out to be the most open and forward
leaning of the new rulers in the region. Jordan, notably, has an
active Parliament and its new king sees the peace with Israel as a
lynchpin for his country's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, by contrast, the dynastic impulse in a tightly run
dictatorship is literally impeding peace. President Hafez Assad is
so busy organizing the succession of his son Bashar, who faces
challenges from other pretenders, that he has put any negotiations
for peace with Israel on hold. And a driving motivation for the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, as he negotiates on final
status issues with Yasser Arafat is the belief that the ailing
Palestinian leader may well be a more reliable partner than anyone
who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, the most immediate question is what will happen in
Syria, where Assad, who is from the minority Alawite tribe, has
fashioned the army, the Ba'ath party and other institutions around
fealty to him. Now 69, Assad is reported to be suffering from
memory loss. He looks haggard and is no longer able to sustain the
marathon negotiating sessions of the past, a recent American
visitor said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has also resisted reform, and this will not help his
successor establish a peaceful transition. ``Assad knows if he
opens the door, the wind will carry him off,'' said Fouad Ajami, a
scholar of the region. ``He doesn't want to be the Gorbachev of
Syria. I don't know if he can hold it together.''
</P>

   Microsoft Faces Flurry Of Class-Action Suits
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's antitrust troubles are attracting a growing number
of class-action lawyers. Three long-time class-action lawyers filed
a suit on behalf of millions of computer users in California,
alleging that the users were overcharged for Microsoft's Windows
operating system. Those lawyers were soon followed by Stanley
Chesley, a longtime opponent of the tobacco industry who filed suit
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The suits came in the wake of a federal judge's findings of fact
earlier this month in the Justice Department's case against
Microsoft. The judge concluded that Microsoft was a monopoly that
had harmed consumers. The class-action lawyers, however, must prove
their cases largely on their own, against a company with deep
pockets and skilled lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq Cuts Oil Sales
</P>
<P>
   Iraq cut off the oil it is allowed to export in exchange for
food, medicine and other supplies, protesting a two-week stop-gap
extension of the U.N. Nations program, which is normally rolled
over for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The goods will continue to arrive, however, because many orders
were in the works when the Security Council deadlocked over whether
to alter the terms of the program, which allows President Saddam
Hussein to sell limited quantities of oil to mitigate the effects
of stringent international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members hope to renew the program this week,
unchanged, for another six months.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia Extradites 2
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian accused of running a major heroin ring was sent from
Bogota to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Orlando Lara, who is wanted in New York on federal drug
charges, became the first Colombian extradited to the United States
by his government in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Colombian government extradited another
major drug suspect to the United States. The suspect, Fernando Jose
Flores, is a Venezuelan who faces an indictment for shipping
cocaine to Florida on behalf of the Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has hailed Colombia's decision to
resume the extraditions, even though it means more turmoil for the
South American nation. Colombian drug cartels have threatened
terrorist attacks if the extraditions continue.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry Disaster in China
</P>
<P>
   The ferry boat, with more than 300 passengers and crew on board,
set out from China's northeastern port of Yantai for the journey
north to Dalian. In a blinding snowstorm with high winds and waves,
the ferry somehow caught fire and the extreme conditions prevented
rescue ships from approaching.
</P>
<P>
   When the burning vessel began to sink, lifeboats were swamped
and most of the passengers who donned life jackets and jumped into
the icy waters perished.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 people were confirmed as surviving one of China's worst
ship disasters in decades, and the government immediately opened an
inquiry into the cause.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Economy Steams Ahead
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest snapshot of the nation's $8.9 trillion
economy revealed even more momentum than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   With employment, incomes, consumer optimism and stock market
indexes all at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its
estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to an annual rate
of 5.5 percent, from 4.8. percent.
</P>
<P>
   That pace surpassed nearly all predictions. ``How can you not be
thankful?'' asked James Glassman, chief U.S. economist at Chase
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts warned that unless the growth slows sharply,
the Federal Reserve could feel compelled to raise interest rates
again and threaten the long-running expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic Abuse by Women
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom among sociologists who study domestic abuse
holds that 95 percent of batterers are men. But in certain spots,
from Concord, N.H. to Boulder County, Colo., 25 percent or more of
recent arrests for domestic assault have been of women.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the arrest rates are an unexpected
consequence of tougher laws and procedures introduced in recent
years mainly to help women by forcing police and courts to crack
down on brutal men.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts disagree on the root cause: many say most of the
women arrested are acting in self-defense. Others say women are
more violent in their homes than usually thought. All concur that
the phenomenon is complex and worth further study.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News for Boxing Group
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old International Boxing Federation, staggered by
the Nov. 4 indictment of its top officials for allegedly extorting
money from fighters for preferred rankings and shots at lucrative
championship bouts, received more bad news. The U.S. attorney for
New Jersey asked a federal judge to appoint a monitor to take over
the organization and its ranking functions.
</P>
<P>
   In making the request under the civil provisions of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, prosecutors
labeled the boxing group a corrupt enterprise in need of immediate
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, with headquarters in East Orange, N.J., is the
only one of the three sanctioning groups for boxing based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the request is granted, the group would become the first
sports organization to come under federal court supervision amid
racketeering allegations.

THE NFL SLASHES NONCONFORMITY

   Quiz time: Which of these football infractions carries with it
the biggest penalty: a) a defensive lineman driving his helmet into
a quarterback's chin, resulting in a concussion, b) a special-teams
player blocking low and blowing out an opponent's knee, sidelining
him for the rest of the season, or c) a wide receiver making a
throat-slashing gesture after he scores a touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   Give up? It's a trick question. In the National Football
League's standard of justice, these offenses all merit equal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the NFL informed its teams that the new vogue in
celebration after scoring _ players have begun drawing a finger
across their throats, ``Sleepy Hollow'' style _ would henceforth be
flagged with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and the
possibility of a fine. In a memo, George Young, a league vice
president, said the gesture ``appears to depict an unacceptable act
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue had simmered early in the season, amid whispers that
the gesture was gang related. But it reached critical mass shortly
after the New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson did it this
month on Monday Night Football, and a Boston radio station dubbed
it the ``O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which actual violence, from concussions to
fractures, is an integral part of the game, the NFL's sensitivity
on this subject strikes some observers as curious. ``I personally
think it's an overreaction on the part of the league,'' says
Michael Lev, senior editor at Pro Football Weekly. ``The NFL should
have greater concerns than how players celebrate a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging violence with such bans is one thing, but the NFL's
style police have a long history of clamping down on
extracurricular matters. In 1997, pro football's powers-that-be
passed the so-called Emmitt Smith rule, which imposed that same
15-yard penalty for removing a helmet on the field _ effectively
eliminating the face-in-the-camera TD celebration originated by the
Dallas Cowboys' star running back. In seasons past the league
banned ``sack dances'' after the quarterback is tackled, and
``excessive celebration,'' which put the kibosh on choreographed
end-zone rituals like the Ickey Shuffle, named for the Cincinnati
Bengals running back Ickey Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The league's rule book also includes a lengthy section
addressing uniform issues, covering everything from the kind of
towel a quarterback can use, to how a player must wear his socks.
Last season, Minnesota's John Randle was fined a total of $15,000
for wearing too much eye black on two separate occasions, while
last year San Diego cornerback Rodney Harrison was fined $7,500 for
leaving his knees uncovered during a game. (By comparison, Denver's
Bill Romanowski was fined the same amount for spitting on J.J.
Stokes of the 49ers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's the NFL's hidden agenda in keeping its players on such a
tight leash? ome have discerned a racial thread, noting that the
majority of the running backs and receivers who score touchdowns,
and thus are affected by the no-celebration rules, are black.
Others see the issue in economic terms. ``They have a product to
promote and want to market it in an attractive way,'' says Andrew
Zimbalist, an expert on sports economics at Smith College. ``Some
fans think it's obnoxious _ and there might be some racism in that
_ but the NFL doesn't want to turn white fans off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which careers are short, the team salary limit
forces players to move from team to team and only the biggest stars
have guaranteed contracts, the NFL finds it is better for business
to build allegiance to the uniform rather than to individual
players. ``They want players to look the same, to act the same and
be robotic,'' says Lev. Is it any wonder that Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp calls it the No Fun League?
</P>
<P>
   So as the league's skill position players wonder what they  &UR; can &LR; 
do in the end zone, they might try thinking like an NFL owner.
Perhaps the next time Keyshawn Johnson crosses the goal line he'll
spike the ball, smile through his face mask and trace a dollar sign
on his chest.

president, said the gesture ``appears to depict an unacceptable act
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue had simmered early in the season, amid whispers that
the gesture was gang related. But it reached critical mass shortly
after the New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson did it this
month on Monday Night Football, and a Boston radio station dubbed
it the ``O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which actual violence, from concussions to
fractures, is an integral part of the game, the NFL's sensitivity
on this subject strikes some observers as curious. ``I personally
think it's an overreaction on the part of the league,'' says
Michael Lev, senior editor at Pro Football Weekly. ``The NFL should
have greater concerns than how players celebrate a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging violence with such bans is one thing, but the NFL's
style police have a long history of clamping down on
extracurricular matters. In 1997, pro football's powers-that-be
passed the so-called Emmitt Smith rule, which imposed that same
15-yard penalty for removing a helmet on the field _ effectively
eliminating the face-in-the-camera TD celebration originated by the
Dallas Cowboys' star running back. In seasons past the league
banned ``sack dances'' after the quarterback is tackled, and
``excessive celebration,'' which put the kibosh on choreographed
end-zone rituals like the Ickey Shuffle, named for the Cincinnati
Bengals running back Ickey Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The league's rule book also includes a lengthy section
addressing uniform issues, covering everything from the kind of
towel a quarterback can use, to how a player must wear his socks.
Last season, Minnesota's John Randle was fined a total of $15,000
for wearing too much eye black on two separate occasions, while
last year San Diego cornerback Rodney Harrison was fined $7,500 for
leaving his knees uncovered during a game. (By comparison, Denver's
Bill Romanowski was fined the same amount for spitting on J.J.
Stokes of the 49ers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's the NFL's hidden agenda in keeping its players on such a
tight leash? ome have discerned a racial thread, noting that the
majority of the running backs and receivers who score touchdowns,
and thus are affected by the no-celebration rules, are black.
Others see the issue in economic terms. ``They have a product to
promote and want to market it in an attractive way,'' says Andrew
Zimbalist, an expert on sports economics at Smith College. ``Some
fans think it's obnoxious _ and there might be some racism in that
_ but the NFL doesn't want to turn white fans off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league in which careers are short, the team salary limit
forces players to move from team to team and only the biggest stars
have guaranteed contracts, the NFL finds it is better for business
to build allegiance to the uniform rather than to individual
players. ``They want players to look the same, to act the same and
be robotic,'' says Lev. Is it any wonder that Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp calls it the No Fun League?
</P>
<P>
   So as the league's skill position players wonder what they  &UR; can &LR; 
do in the end zone, they might try thinking like an NFL owner.
Perhaps the next time Keyshawn Johnson crosses the goal line he'll
spike the ball, smile through his face mask and trace a dollar sign
on his chest.

   LONDON _ Before I moved to London, I took a deep breath and read
``Clarissa,'' Samuel Richardson's classic 18th-century novel about
the seduction and ruin of a virtuous young girl. From an
anthropological point of view, what is interesting about
``Clarissa'' is not only that it is more than one million words
long and that reading it demands a peculiarly British form of
stoicism, but also that it is an epistolary novel _ that is, it is
written entirely in the form of letters between its characters.
</P>
<P>
   This is a blizzard of letter-writing _ and at first I thought it
had to do with the habits of the British gentry during the
pre-technology era, or simply with a literary conceit that, while
unusual, is not unknown. (Laclos, of course, used it to great
effect in ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' another cautionary tale
about compromised virtue). But what I didn't realize is that, as
far as letter-writing goes, Britons might well still be living in
the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, my husband and I have carried on a
purely epistolary relationship with our neighbors, Sir and Lady
T----. (They really do have titles; he is a former tobacco
executive who was knighted, as far as I can tell, for the good job
he did in getting people to smoke). These are people with whom we
share a wall and a bit of sidewalk and with whom, in all this time,
we have had perhaps three actual conversations. If you count
``Hello,'' answered by ``Hello,'' as an actual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs to converse? The relationship, like any, has had
its ups and downs. When we moved in, we got a friendly letter
welcoming us to the neighborhood. When they planned to paint the
front of their house, they sent an apologetic letter alerting us.
</P>
<P>
   When we did some work on our house (having notified them, of
course, in writing), they sent an alarmed letter asking about, if I
remember correctly, the common dry wall and the potentially
creeping damp _ issues that apparently haunt the imaginations of
British homeowners. We replied, soothingly, by letter, and then
sent them a copy of the letter our surveyor sent us, and then they
sent us a letter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps their conversational reserve had to do with latent
anti-Americanism, I thought. But that couldn't be all of it,
because my husband is as English as they come (although, alas,
without a title). The truth, as I found when I began to make
British friends, is that the British love to write letters.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I had lunch with an English friend. It was a
typical lunch in an inexpensive cafe. We discussed our husbands,
our jobs and our hair, as one does, and then split the check and
went happily on our ways.
</P>
<P>
   When the mail came the next day, I was shocked to discover that
she had sent me a note.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a note thanking me for lunch. What's more, my
friend had apparently gone out and bought an expensive card with a
picture that would mean something specifically to me. She had
mailed it off that very afternoon, at a time of day when all I had
been thinking was: Should I eat this candy bar now, or later?
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing threatens to get out of hand when it comes to
thank-you notes, as much a part of my life here as feeling
compelled to say, ``Sorry,'' instead of ``Excuse me,'' when someone
knocks into me on the tube. It's hard to keep up. Last year, I
celebrated my birthday with my husband and four other couples. All
the couples brought presents, but the dinner was at our house. So
what to do? Who should thank whom? Inevitably, we all thanked each
other. I sent out four letters, and received four letters. The only
person I didn't send a thank-you note to was my husband, but then
all he did was set the table.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he thought I was rude, anyway. He comes from a family
where, when you have lunch with your parents, your mother writes
you the next day to thank you for coming. Sometimes your father
thanks you in a separate letter. (You write them at the same time,
to thank them for having you). All the important family business is
conveyed by letter _ news of major illness, the first salvo in what
is going to be a drawn-out feud, or even bits of sisterly advice _
and then, in a way I have come to think of as quintessentially
English, it is never discussed face to face.
</P>
<P>
   This has been difficult to get used to. I know I have received
moving letters from my own mother _ most memorably, when the dog
died in 1980 _ but never a thank-you note. My brother and I
sometimes exchange e-mails. But at heart, we're a telephoning kind
of family.
</P>
<P>
   My husband's family is not partial to the telephone,
particularly in the older generation, whose habits are informed by
the shortages and deprivations of World War II. ``Happy Birthday,
darling,'' my mother-in-law once said to my answering machine in
New York, where her son was visiting, speaking as if noxious,
expensive gases were seeping out of the telephone. ``I'm calling
long distance so I have to hang up now.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons can afford to like the mail; they have a first-rate
postal service.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattanites like me are used to a mail service where the
couriers are stayed from the swift completion of their appointed
rounds not by rain or sleet, but by the apparently overwhelming
task of transporting a letter 20 city blocks. Here, 92 percent of
first-class letters _ which are expensive, at 42 cents _ arrive the
day after they are mailed, no matter where in the country they're
going.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does e-mail appear to have yet replaced snail mail. Ten
years ago, the Royal Mail handled 53 million pieces of first- and
second-class mail every day. Today, this has increased to 77
million pieces of mail, with ``social mail'' _ that is, for
non-business purposes _ holding steady at 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Mail takes great offense at suggestions that its
service is not exemplary. It was not amused, for instance, at
recent newspaper reports describing how a postcard saying, ``We
have arrived safely and are having a lovely time'' turned up at its
destination some 75 years after it had been sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most irritating things that come up in my
job,'' said Patrick O'Neill, a Royal Mail spokesman, saying that in
most of these cases, the piece of mail in question was never lost,
but had turned up at a yard sale of ancient items and then
re-mailed as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what the postal service would do back home. But
here where the fate of the letter is paramount, the outdated card
was duly delivered. ``We have a legal obligation to deliver any
letter that is put in the mail, even if it doesn't have the right
postage,'' O'Neill said.

 &HT;    How schools can get straight with gay students
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family-values and religious right groups are up in alarms over a
pamphlet about gay and lesbian youths recently sent to school
administrators around the country. Their distress is
understandable. The booklet's appeal to reason has little place in
the narrow cosmography of the sexually repressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry for the tedious list, but it really is necessary to string
out the sponsors here of ``Sexual Orientation and Youth,'' which
deals with developmental, psychological and legal questions:
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling
Association, American Association of School Administrators,
American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological
Association, American School Health Association, The Interfaith
Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists,
National Association of Social Workers and the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A more sober bunch would be hard to find. Their message is the
simple one that some young men and women are gay, lesbian or
bisexual, that that's all there is to it and efforts to force them
to change do far more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the various agitated societies for the suppression
of homosexuality are promoting ``reparative'' or ``conversion''
therapies, which claim, depending upon the bent of the promoter,
that heavy counseling, intense peer pressure or prayer can make
heterosexuals out of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual converts are mustered to witness for the therapies, but
while there is no reason to contest their individual testimony,
such claimed successes are rare, usually fragile and often are
bought at the cost of emotional damage to patients led or coerced
to perform sexually in a manner supposedly normal but in fact still
unnatural to them. Most folks, of any orientation, including the
stoutest heterosexuals, can be yelled into contrary sexual
behavior, but what has really changed? A change in mechanics is not
a change in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual youths suffer more emotional distress, try suicide
more often and engage in riskier sexual and drug behaviors than
heterosexual kids, not, as the pamphlet points out, because of
their homosexuality but because of the isolation they live in as a
result of bigotry and misunderstanding. And they shun counseling
out of fear they will be harassed and ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly an irrational fear, nor is the isolation imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the booklet was published, the Southern Baptist
Convention took the unprecedented step of, in effect,
excommunicating two Atlanta churches for accepting gays and
lesbians as full congregants. And GOP presidential forgone
conclusion George W. Bush made a show of refusing to meet with gay
Republicans, theatrically modeling prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Moves like those are meant to keep gays and lesbians
anathematized and marginalized, their humanity denied and dignity
forbidden. That's a lot for 12-page pamphlet to go up against.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: More Middle East cacophony
 &HT;    For release Dec. 1, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the feverish religious fervor that has set people against
each other, the present one between Israelis, Muslims and Catholics
is among the most aberrant.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a scorecard, you can't tell the lineups.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Israelis gave permission for Muslims to erect a
mosque in Nazareth, immediately alongside the Basilica of the
Annunciation. Nazareth was the boyhood home of Jesus Christ.
Muslims see Nazareth as the burial site of Shihab el-Din, a fierce
anti-Crusader cleric of the 12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Vatican reacted with outrage to the concept that a
mosque would be built so close to the venerated church. The Vatican
strongly hinted that future relations with Israel would be in
question and said that by Israel allowing the unveiling of a Muslim
cornerstone on the site, it was ``creating a basis for instigating
division'' between Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis responded with muffled words about anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   And so the battle is joined. But not without further muddling.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat and his Palestine Authority are supporting the
Christian side of the issue, while more dogmatic Muslims are
cheering the laying of the cornerstone; a division within a
division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwile, Christian shopkeepers in Nazareth closed their shops
in protest, just as Muslim shopkeepers close theirs when they don't
like what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that anyone will go to war over this, but it is just
another example of how religion often gets caught up in _ or
creates _ a vortex of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, discord broke out in Jerusalem about the opening of an
ancient tunnel by Israelis in the vicinity of prime Muslim sites,
including Al-Aksa mosque. Muslims screamed in outrage,
hypothesizing that the tunnel would undermine the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I don't know what the outcome of the debate was _ the
mosque is still standing _ and what's more, I don't care. This
manner of religious acrimony has been going on for centuries. It's
better to be a disinterested bystander than get swallowed in the
rancor.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just in the Middle East, either. Earlier this year,
under protest by Jews, Poland's Roman Catholic Church removed 300
crosses that bordered on the former Auschwitz death camp. One large
cross remains, hopefully uncontested. This is a continuation of the
long-held competition for the soul of Auschwitz, claimed by Jews as
a result of their monumental losses, but also claimed by the church
for the many non-Jews who died there.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, at that same site, there was a Jewish-Catholic verbal
brawl, along with some sit-ins, over the restoration of a convent
just outside the site. I believe the Catholics backed down.
</P>
<P>
   By its rabid religious reality, theological antagonism is an
uncurable muddle and will continue to be so as long as there still
are Christians, Jews and Muslims. The Middle East quandary is
analoguous to the malice there is between Hindus and Sikhs in
India, between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland and
between Christians and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For all the beauty and serenity preached in the Christian Bible,
the Jewish Holy Scriptures and the Muslim Koran _ liberally
interspersed with God-inspired mayhem _ the surviving religious
zealots do not practice it.
</P>
<P>
   With all these fires either burning brightly, or simmering _
none ever are extinguished _ the issue of Jerusalem lies just
ahead. If you think religious division was sharp in the past, wait
until this one.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, while watching young Israeli men graduate tank
school, I ran into a baker from Jerusalem whose son _ later killed
in the Yom Kippur War _ was among the graduates. He told me then
that he did not believe any solution could be found to the impasse
of the Middle East ``in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   A new century begins a month (or a year and a month) from now.
If I asked him today, the old baker probably would tell me a
solution won't be found in the next century, either.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Trains, planes and Paris porters
 &HT;    Sixth in a series
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sitting in a railroad station, got a ticket for my
destination ... I was humming an old Simon and Garfunkel tune and
wishing I could remember the words.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Gare de Lyon, which, as best as I can figure,
roughly translates as ``Look out for Leon.''
</P>
<P>
   And who is this Leon I should guard against? I wasn't sure until
I was getting out of the taxi.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, a little guy, all smiles, with a buggy for our
luggage already in place at the trunk of the taxi.
</P>
<P>
   My wife thought it was good service. I thought it a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I had my pocket picked was at a train station.
That was 10 years ago in Warsaw. Luckily, I was carrying only $40
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   I always wondered who the pickpocket was. I always wondered what
happened to him. Right now, I was wondering about Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the name I gave him, my personal porter, as he led us
through the crowds and directly to the ticket counter.
</P>
<P>
   We were taking the TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse), which can
travel upwards of 200 mph, to Marseille and then switching over to
a local train to Aix-en-Provence for a few days stay.
</P>
<P>
   For all I knew, we were taking Leon with us. Indeed, he was
sticking with us.
</P>
<P>
   We had an hour or so before train time. Leon directed us to a
cafe, positioned our luggage so that we could watch it and then
promised to be watching out for us as well, which he illustrated by
pulling down the lower lid of one of his rheumy eyes. Somehow I was
not reassured.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to pay him, offering 50 francs, almost $10, generous to
my way of thinking. Leon, refusing the money, indicated that there
would be time enough to settle up later.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like train stations: Too much noise, too many people,
too much coming and going, and too little security.
</P>
<P>
   I like security. That's what I like about airports: Lots of
metal detectors, lots of dope-sniffing dogs, lots of armed guards
keeping an sharp eye out for suspicious characters.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the only person looking out for me was a suspicious
character.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all of a sudden, right at the appointed time, he was
there, just as he had promised, gathering up our luggage and
hurrying us along to the platform where the train for Marseille was
loading.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the car. Here were our seats. Our luggage was stowed.
We were all ready to saddle up and ride.
</P>
<P>
   And Leon was finally ready to settle up.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else I'm generous to a fault. What the heck, I
thought. I'll give him 100 francs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Leon said, shaking his head at the single bill I had
offered. For a brief moment I misunderstood. Was Leon simply a good
Samaritan?
</P>
<P>
   No way. Leon was a good-for-nothing. He purposely had waited
until this last minute to establish price.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred francs for EACH!'' he insisted, pointing to me and
my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Too late to haggle, I shoved the money in his hand just as the
train was about to shove off. I'll always remember him waving me
goodbye, a little guy, all smiles, the world's most expensive
porter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Two hundred francs is something less than $40. It's a
better deal than I got in Warsaw.
</P>

IN A VIOLENT TIME, A LITTLE LIGHT DISPELS MUCH DARKNESS

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A friend commented on some of the recent highly publicized
shootings: ``There is really nothing we can do. My kids go to
school and are exposed to random searches for weapons. The Post
Office is not a safe place. Shootings occur in the work areas. Even
the churches, synagogues and day care centers are subject to
shootings.''
 &HT;    His remarks made me wonder. What is happening to our great
country? What can I do about the situation? How depressing this is.
 &HT;    Then I thought of the good things that may take place because of
the bad things. Let me quote the famous psychiatrist, Viktor
Frankl:
 &HT;    ``I can see beyond the misery of the situation to the potential
for discovering a meaning behind it, and thus to turn an apparently
meaningless suffering into a genuine human achievement.
 &HT;    ``I am convinced that, in the final analysis, there is no
situation that does not contain within it the seed of a meaning.''
 &HT;    My family is no stranger to acts of senseless violence. When my
cousin's son was shot dead in a drugstore some years ago I was
devastated.
 &HT;    Soon after, in 1994, another relative, 16-year-old Ari
Halberstam, was shot dead as he traveled in a van with other young
divinity students.
 &HT;    His assailant, a Lebanese immigrant, claimed to have suffered
war trauma while being attacked in a Lebanese refugee camp. He had
purchased a gun through the mail. His act of savage violence and
mayhem on the Jewish students earned him a sentence of 141 years in
prison.
 &HT;    Recently, Mrs. Devorah Halberstam introduced a bill, nicknamed
``Ari's Bill,'' into the Assembly of the State of New York. The
bill states that no gun kit can be sold through the mail and it
would put teeth into gun-trafficking laws between states.
 &HT;    Devorah is my first cousin and the mother of Ari, who was killed
in that senseless attack.
 &HT;    She took her tragedy, a real meaningless suffering, to try to
accomplish something for the rest of our citizens. How much misery
could be averted if guns were not so readily available?
 &HT;    Devorah has now embarked on a second venture, a new museum for
Jewish children. It will promote harmony, cultural awareness and
tolerance. Ari's life will continue through the children visiting
the museum. His memory will be celebrated through other living
children.
 &HT;    There are others who have risen above misery to find ways to
celebrate the good. For example, take my take good friend Yaakov, a
veteran of wars between the Israelis and Arabs.
 &HT;    He is proud that all through his military duty he was always
able to find the bright side of things. Once, he and his company
were grounded for a long period at the Suez Canal. Almost every day
the Egyptians launched howitzer attacks. The Israeli soldiers,
situated on the Israeli side, either fired back or retreated into
their bunkers for safety.
 &HT;    After a few months of this give and take, the soldiers were at
their wits' end. The holiday of Chanukah was approaching and the
men missed their families.
 &HT;    At Chanukah a candelabra -- menorah -- was needed but none of
the men had one. Not one menorah could be found. It was a very
depressing evening. Suddenly Yaakov came up with a brilliant idea.
Why not take the spent shells and set them up as menorahs for the
holiday. The men passed their novel ideal around.
 &HT;    Menorahs of shell casings were filled with gasoline and rag
wicks were soon burning brightly throughout the military area.
Menorahs everywhere! Imagine turning objects of destruction into
symbols of peace.
 &HT;    None of us look for suffering. However, if we are exposed to it,
then, we need to turn suffering into human achievement.
 &HT;    Our response to the shootings should be to make this world a
safer and better place.
 &HT;    Chanukah celebrates the miracle of the Jewish revolution against
the Greek occupation and religious persecution. This took place in
Israel 165 B.C.E.
 &HT;    A handful of Jewish freedom fighters, called Maccabees, waged a
successful war for religious freedom. When the temple was
reclaimed, services were reinstituted. The main menorah, a seven
stick candelabra, was kindled. Miraculously, the flames burned for
eight days without being replenished with oil, hence the festival
became known as the Festival of Lights.
 &HT;    During Chanukah we give thanks to God for the miraculous time.
This year the first night of Chanukah will be Friday, December 3.
 &HT;    Remember the message of Chanukah and the Chanukah lights turning
misery into miraculous times. A little light dispels much darkness.

ROCKETTES GET A LEG UP ON CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The performances
</P>
<P>
   ``The Radio City Christmas Spectacular'' starring the Radio City
Rockettes continues Tuesdays through Sundays, through Dec. 12 at
the Grand Palace in Branson. Tickets cost $17 to $41 for adults and
$10 to $41 for children age 11 and younger; call (800) 572-5223.
</P>
<P>
   You can't keep a good gam down.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it moves in high-kicking unison with the Radio
City Rockettes. The world-famous precision dance troupe is back in
``The Radio City Christmas Spectacular,'' running through Dec. 12
at the Grand Palace in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   It's the popular attraction's sixth season in the Ozarks, the
first place outside of New York's Radio City Music Hall where
audiences could behold the traditional holiday extravaganza. Since
1994 the show has expanded to include productions in Los Angeles;
Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Chicago; Detroit; and Mexico City. The total
effort requires the talents of more than 200 Rockettes.
</P>
<P>
   To get the word out about all those legs on all those stages,
Rockettes Corrinna Lindholm and Kim Fletcher recently visited The
Kansas City Star. After having their photograph snapped in
obligatory tandem _ Rockettes never do anything alone _ the two sat
down, crossed their respective famous appendages and amiably
chatted with this reporter. (A tough job, to be sure, but somebody
had to do it.)
</P>
<P>
   They smiled virtually nonstop and were decked out in full
``Christmas Spectacular'' regalia, from their mandatory red
lipstick to the fluffy white fur that trimmed their matching
Santa-style minidresses. And they were ready to reveal some truly
behind-the-seams stories.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: When the Rockettes form their signature 18-woman
kick line, ``you would think that we're holding on, tugging on each
other's costumes for our balance,'' Lindholm said. ``Actually, we
have specific areas to place our hands _ our right hand is high,
our left hand is low _ and we are not allowed to touch one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our choreographers actually walk behind us to make sure. If
you cannot do eye-high kicks standing by yourself, on your own with
your arms out, you shouldn't be doing them hooked up to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Another illusion is that the Rockettes are the same height. In
fact, they range between 5 feet 51/2 inches and 5 feet 91/2 inches
tall. By placing the tallest Rockettes in the middle of the line
and the shortest on the ends, all appear to be of identical
stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're onstage kicking and dancing with everyone, it's a
unity thing,'' Fletcher said.``It's like everyone's a star, and
that's how you become a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming part of the Rockettes' collective means knowing how to
do more than dance and sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just learn the show, and we don't just learn the
steps,'' Lindholm said. ``We learn how to be a Rockette.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have training for everything we do. Part of our audition
process is to go in and be scrutinized for every aspect of
ourselves _ what you look like, how tall you are, how big you are,
how you dance, how you can talk, how you present yourself. A Radio
City Rockette is just a little package.''
</P>
<P>
   That package was first wrapped in 1925, when St. Louisan Russell
Markert created the Missouri Rockets chorus line, made up of taller
and leggier female dancers who could do more than standard
waist-high kicks. For their New York debut, S.L. ``Roxy'' Rothafel
introduced the troupe at his Roxy Theater as the Roxyettes. After
Rothafel opened Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, the
Roxyettes became the Radio City Rockettes and an essential
ingredient to the historic Art Deco entertainment hall's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradition behind it, and that's where the glamour
comes in,'' Fletcher said. ``All of a sudden you're a part of
history. And that's an incredible feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockettes' annual ``Christmas Spectacular'' is the
highest-profile reminder of that storied tradition. It includes
such familiar Rockettes production numbers as the ``Parade of
Wooden Soldiers'' and the ``Living Nativity,'' both dating back to
1933. But the show doesn't stay pat, either. A new scene this year
is ``Santa's Candy Castle,'' featuring the Rockettes in peppermint
twist outfits, entertaining Old Saint Nick as they dance with
5-foot candy canes.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all the Rockettes must remain on friendly terms. Not
that it's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Lindholm said. ``During rehearsals we have so
little time to even get to know each other, we wouldn't have time
to fight even if we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get closer with some girls than others,'' Fletcher said.
``But some friends, I feel like I'll probably have them for the
rest of my life. Like me and Corrinna. We didn't even know each
other, and within the first half-hour we were like soul mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Who better than a soul mate to catch you when you fall?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rely on all of the people around us,'' Lindholm
said. ``Like in `Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,' when we all rock
back and fall like dominoes. If one person doesn't do their job,
the whole thing is going to come crashing down. So the more we
trust one another and the closer we are to each other, the more we
can feel comfortable about our job.''

 &HT;    Bully box teaches kindness, respect in schools
 &HT;    By Mara Lee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ In middle school, it's all about fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the right clothes, using the right slang. Not being too
smart or too slow. Not being too large or too small.
</P>
<P>
   For those who refuse to toe the line or who can't camouflage
their differences, there are penalties.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 12 years old, on trial in the court of your peers,
there is no mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah knows. Her best friend doesn't wear the preppy uniform
common in the south suburbs. She dresses with humor and irony, a
T-shirt with a toy from 10 years ago, baggy pants, lots of
necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's sort of like a freak'' in the popular boys' eyes, Hannah
said. Those boys started messing with her. ``Calling her a lesbian
and everything, during classes and after school, at football games.
She was so stressed out. She didn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah (not her real name) is an eighth-grader at Van Buren
Middle School, and this year, Assistant Principal Matt Rugh decided
to try to teach preteens about kindness and respect in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the school has been trying to convince
students not to put each other down. They talk about empathy and
about how being different is OK.
</P>
<P>
   But at the beginning of puberty, when physical and social
differences are at their most awkward and most pronounced, that
message is a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who have studied bullying, including psychologist
Paula Fried, who co-authored ``Bullies and Victims: Helping Your
Child Through the Schoolyard Battlefield'' (M. Evans and Co. Inc;
$19.95), say it's natural for preteens to try to influence their
peers and to want more personal power. It's getting that sense of
power through hurting others that worries adults who work with this
age group.
</P>
<P>
   Rugh decided to go beyond lectures and bulletin boards with the
Bully Box.
</P>
<P>
   That box, which is in the guidance counselor's office, is a way
for students to let adults know what's going on outside their
earshot. Most of it is taunting, though there are a few reports of
shoving in the halls.
</P>
<P>
   At Van Buren, more than 75 percent of bullies whose names end up
in the box are boys, and most of their victims are boys who are the
same age or younger, and always smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Rugh thinks the box has helped sixth-graders come forward about
abuse they've seen or experienced. Seventh- and eighth-graders seem
to be more comfortable about directly approaching guidance
counselors or other adults.
</P>
<P>
   Half the complaints in the box come from witnesses, not victims.
Getting witnesses involved is crucial, researchers say. ``Bullies
are skilled at finding those situations where adults aren't
around,'' Rugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have told him several times about special-education
students who become scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing just sickens me. I think it sickens most
kids,'' Rugh said. ``Most kids are not about making other kids feel
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah said her friend was afraid to put a note in the box
because she was afraid they'd find out she was the one who told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said I have to do it because I don't want my friends to
be hurt,'' Hannah said. ``People call each other names every single
day. They just take it as normal. Sometimes it just gets out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugh said he's gotten more information about taunting since he
started this box. Once alerted, he talks to other witnesses, the
victim, the accused bully's friends, and finally the accused bully.
With that kind of evidence, he almost always gets a confession.
</P>
<P>
   He avoids casting it as, ``Johnny says you're picking on him all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paybacks are a possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hannah and her friend are pleased with how those boys behave
now. Rugh said he's talked to about 40 kids (30 were warned) and he
hasn't had the same kids in twice once he's talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not dying to give suspensions. I'm not dying to give
detentions. I'm interested in getting a change in behavior,'' Rugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the middle school disciplinarians in this region face these
issues, but a sample of 11 schools found only three use written
notes, like Van Buren.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Eyler, eighth-grade principal at Northmont Middle School,
said two years ago that school began a two-week curriculum on
bullying. In those talks, teachers encourage students to tell
adults about incidents, or to leave a note in the mailbox if that's
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, complaints have more than doubled. Eyler said he
gets at least one every day. The school has 1,050 seventh- and
eighth-graders. ``It's time to say no,'' he said. ``No more `boys
will be boys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mescher, assistant principal at West Carrollton Middle
School, said a peer mediation form helped convince students this
was important enough to tell administrators, not just their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were reluctant to (tell) in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most assistant principals had not heard of this idea, even at
Kettering Middle School in the same district as Van Buren. But many
said it sounded like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Fried said the option of writing a note helps kids get over
their fears about retaliation, and also is a good outlet for
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to have schools acknowledge this
is really important,'' she said. ``These words and feelings don't
evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
   She said teens who are constantly victimized can become
depressed, even to the point of suicide, or can become filled with
rage. Students often skip school because they fear other students,
researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
   Rugh also works with the bullies' targets. Some have irritating
habits and seem to bring it on themselves, and he tells them that
although they didn't deserve it, they can prevent taunting by being
more mature.
</P>
<P>
   Others, he tries to pump up, saying, ``Do you really care what
that kid thinks? Your parents love you, teachers love you, you have
lots of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugh doesn't know if it's reduced teasing, and said it would be
arrogant to claim that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely can't hurt,'' he said. But he has heard boys in
the hall say to each other: ``You better watch it, you're going to
end up in the Bully Box!''

 &HT;    Keeping bullies at bay
 &HT;    By Mara Lee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Parents can help their children deal with
bullying, whether they're witnesses, like the majority, bullies
(about 7 percent) or victims.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buren Middle School Assistant Principal Matt Rugh says:
``Listen, listen, listen. (Don't say) 'What's wrong with you?!'
It's got to be more than, `What'd you do in school today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Fried, co-author of ``Bullies and Victims: Helping Your
Child Through the Schoolyard Battlefield'' (M. Evans and Co. Inc;
$19.95), says: ``Oftentimes parents don't know their kids are
bullies. Talk to them without shaming them. Help them to develop
empathy. Help (victimized kids) not to take the bullying
personally. This says more about the bully than the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims can develop strategies, using a sense of humor to
deflate the bully with a one-liner, or just showing it's not
bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Mullin-Rindler, associate director of a bullying project
at the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, says: Even
if your child is only a witness, remember they are touched by
bullying incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them feel scared and anxious as well,'' she said.
``When bullying is unchecked, bystanders tend to lose a sense of
empathy for the victim and are more likely to join in the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests the school's parent-teacher organization send
volunteers to watch at lunchtime and on the playground.

 &HT;    Payoff time for backyard citrus growers
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The orange crop is coming in early. The
fruit that survived summer's scorching heat, the winds of two
hurricanes, marauding middle-schoolers and a back yard rife with
destructive mutant insect life are glowing, yellow and bulging with
juice. It looks like a good crop this year.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a gardener by inclination. I am proud of the azaleas
because they take care of themselves, bloom madly in spring, and
don't bother anybody with a lot of demands the way roses and other
picky plants do. I extend this low-maintenance, laissez-faire
philosophy to my work as a gentleman citrus farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I forgot to do anything to the tree so I touted that
year's crop
</P>
<P>
   as organically grown. This year, however, I threw some
fertilizer on the ground during the summer, so I can make no such
claims. I will ertify that the tree is insecticide-free. I was too
cheap and pressed for time to extend insect-poisoning to the back
yard. Some call it laziness. I call it living in harmony with
nature.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty of this year's harvest runs contrary to the trend in
backyard citrus here. A series of freezes has killed back trees far
older and better tended than mine. Trees that once gave
juice-worthy fruit have been killed back to their sour and thorny
root-stock. They produce pretty oranges fit only for marmalade,
which involves arcane canning processes I do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   My backyard tree, although cut back substantially, was spared
such a fate by mere inches. Even if it hadn't, though,
fruit-quality has little to do with the backyard citrus ethos. It
has to do with living The Great Florida Myth and a little bit with
real-estate value.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us tend these trees because our friends, family and
acquaintances Up North consider orange trees outside the window to
be unspeakably exotic. They ooh and ahh and act surprised if you
allude to the matter. This may be
</P>
<P>
   helped along if you introduce the subject casually, as though
the
</P>
<P>
   things fall from the tree all year around and it's getting to be
real a
</P>
<P>
   hassle gathering them up all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate pros sometimes advise homesellers to plant banana
trees, orange trees and palms that don't naturally occur this far
north. That way, frost-belt homebuyers feel they are buying a piece
of a lush Caribbean land of fable and television travelogue. Their
very own bit of the Great Florida Myth, just like in the postcards.
Proof they are relocating to an exotic place.
</P>
<P>
   For the effort involved, it's far, far better than putting new
wallpaper on the bathroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   As easy as it is to impress out-of-town relatives with the tree,
there does come a time when you must face the practicalities of its
yield.
</P>
<P>
   More conscientious backyard citrus growers than myself take
every lost
</P>
<P>
   orange personally. Every one lying split on the ground in late
summer and early fall is a personal failing, a bad omen. They worry
for months over the vulnerable little green oranges as they ripen.
Then the first cool nights come and there's more fruit than you can
deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution is to spread the bounty and give them to
friends. But you are not alone. Up and down the street, all through
the office, proud growers are pushing their citrus off on their
acquaintances and recipients dare not refuse. To turn down oranges
because you already have too many is like insulting somebody's dog.
Deep-seated feelings are exposed in these
</P>
<P>
   transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On receiving a home-grown orange, you must always act amazed and
grateful, as though the supermarket variety does not exist or is
too inferior to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And never, never, never compare them to your own. Comparing
oranges to oranges is acceptable only in elementary-school math
class.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to admire mine for another week before picking them
and attempting to pass them off on my kids as a major treat.
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't play along, I've been saving the stickers from
the
</P>
<P>
   store-bought kind. If I stick the ``product of California''
labels on the
</P>
<P>
   backyard oranges, they may just eat them.

 &HT;    Companionship has its rewards
 &HT;    (EDS: Note italics in second graf.)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Although I've been traveling alone most of my
life, nothing leaves me with a more solitary feeling than the drive
from airport to empty house. Once I'm past the hassle of claiming
luggage and remembering where I parked the car, it's the same old
lonesome, long ride home.
</P>
<P>
   This trip it's late afternoon when I slide through the turnpike
toll booth, snatch a ticket from the maw of a machine that neither
welcomes me back nor wishes me safe journey, and meld into the flow
of traffic. I set the cruise control for three miles above the
speed limit, punch in the tape I'd been listening to on the way to
the airport, and think about why Jimmy Buffett's, ``Wish I Had a
Pencil-Thin Moustache'' always sounds so much better on my way
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL) out (END ITAL) of town.
</P>
<P>
   Along the south side of the highway is a string of pricey,
cookie-cutter condos. It's cocktail hour and I imagine couples
sitting down together, comfortable in their late afternoon ritual.
As I glance from one cubicle to the next, I can't help wondering if
all of the folks who live there are the same too. Do they buy the
same booze? Wear clothes with identical labels? Belong to the same
clubs, and maybe even go on the same cruises?
</P>
<P>
   Probably.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of life I would choose, but that doesn't stop
me from envying the participants their twosomeness. Rather like the
couple sitting across from me earlier this afternoon in the Boston
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a tangerine, Patrick?'' the lady asks the white-haired
gent slumped in the seat next to her. She gives him a minute but
when he just keeps fiddling with his bow tie instead of answering,
she repeats the question closer to his ear. ``Want a tangerine?''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick stirs and appears to be thinking up a response. Finally
he asks, ``Do I want a what?''
</P>
<P>
   His wife hollers back, ``A TANGERINE!'' Then she adds in a
normal voice, ``You couldn't hear if your pants were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick takes a minute before he asks, ``What kind of a
tangerine you got?''
</P>
<P>
   His wife stares blankly out the window at a tiny commuter plane
pulling into the gate and then yells, ``SO HOW MANY KINDS OF
TANGERINES ARE THERE? YOU WANT ONE OR NOT?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, okay,'' Patrick says, ``I'll eat a tangerine. You got a
paper towel?'' The couple settles down to what I suspect is
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Patrick peels and sections the fruit, handing her husband
one
</P>
<P>
   segment at a time and watching carefully as he chews. ``SPIT THE
SEEDS,'' she reminds him. Patrick nods and zings one off his shoe.
She smiles and pats his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and his wife aren't paying any attention to me but I'm
smiling too. Somewhere, way down inside, there's a part of me that
envies Mrs. Patrick. Hers is a life I understand.
</P>
<P>
   Smile sweetly, I was taught. Learn to cook if you can, and never
put starch in your husband's shorts. If you play nice, you'll live
happily ever after with a man who will smooth life's rough edges
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the rules for millions of women my age now
functioning in a limbo land of semi-liberated females who, though
quite capable of fixing toilets and paying taxes, still miss
marriage. We feel sad driving expressways alone and knowing that if
we make a wrong turn, no one will notice when we're late for
supper. Or if we never show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   But we get over it and get on with it _ kind of like the
grey-haired lady on the shuttle bus this afternoon. Her ankles were
swollen over the tops of her shoes and she moved slowly, carefully
planting her cane to ensure each step. When a gentleman offered to
help with her suitcase she flashed him a broad smile and declined.
``I'm doing just fine,'' she said. ``I'm a little slow but I'm
</P>
<P>
   making it.'' On the last step she turned and added, ``But thanks
for asking.''
</P>
<P>
   I can identify with that and so can the millions of others like
me. Whether we need the help or not, it's still nice to be asked.

 &HT;    Pirating music files problematic for record companies, schools
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Record stores haven't gotten much business from
one 23-year-old University of Dayton senior lately _ and he may
never give them a penny more.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his music free from the Internet. Using the university's
high-speed computer lines, he and his friends download songs known
as MP3 files from web sites that post them illegally. He says his
roommate has built a trove of 2,000 songs, and that he has created
his own compact discs from Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everyone I know does it,'' says the senior. ``I know
people who are filling up their hard drives (with pirated music).''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a 21st century headache for college administrators.
Schools have invested millions to create cutting-edge computer
infrastructures, opening new frontiers of research and learning.
However, those same networks have made it easy for students to
trample copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Untold thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating
across the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who
hope to spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But
many are copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and
record companies of money that, according to the Recording Industry
Association of America, is probably exponentially greater than the
$1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an Internet connection can download these files, but
cyber-swiping appears to be especially rampant on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got young people with free time, lots of access, and
they're curious,'' says Barbara Deschapelles, a network
administrator at UD. ``It's kind of a climb the mountain thing:
`What can I get away with?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitories and computer labs at UD, Wright State University,
Sinclair Community College and Antioch use network connections that
are up to 200 times faster than the 56k modems standard on home
computers. That means instead of taking a half hour to download a
5-minute MP3 song, students can do it in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Once they store a song on their computers, they can play it
whenever they like. They also can put it on their personal Web
sites for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually how students are caught with pirated music.
Recording industry agents constantly search for web sites that
illegally post copyrighted songs, notifying colleges when such
material is on their networks. That has happened four times at UD
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those nabbed with bootlegged music can lose network access and
suffer other penalties, such as fines or community service. But
such busts, rare to begin with, may soon become nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they rarely put MP3s on their Web pages these days.
They usually store the music on their computers' hard drives, which
cannot be accessed by Internet snoopers.
</P>
<P>
   They swap tunes using e-mail and Zip disks, or, in the case of
students at Wright State, through private networks accessible to a
limited number of people. One 18-year-old freshman says that has
allowed him to quickly build a huge collection of MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost 1 gigabyte, and that's probably over 10 hours,
probably around a couple of hundred songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators say they're aware of the vast MP3
exchanges on campus, but maintain there's little they can do about
it. They don't know what students have on their computers unless
they spot a guilty Web site or get tipped off by a foolish action
(one UD student was caught when he tried to send an e-mail
containing a whopping 100MB of MP3s; the transmission failed,
giving technicians a copy of the message).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to spread the word that this is illegal and
people are being caught,'' said UD's Deschapelles. `` ... Most
people probably aren't thinking. I think if they did, it would
occur to them that it was illegal and immoral. It's theft of ideas
and theft of property.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as news to one 20-year-old UD junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal?'' he says. ``That definitely changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his housemates have hooked a computer loaded with 1,500
MP3 files to a sound system, using it to supply the music during
parties. They also burn songs onto recordable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The junior says MP3 search engines and television commercials
for products such as CD burners made him think downloading bootleg
music was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's such a new thing that people haven't gotten used
to it being illegal,'' he says. ``It's like, `I never have to go to
Best Buy again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, well aware that they are stealing music, have
mixed feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, I think we should be able to do it, because
it's our freedom,'' says an 18-year-old Wright State freshman.
``But I'm in a band. I think, `What if we eventually put out a CD
and everyone copied it?' That thought is there, and to be honest,
it probably is hurting the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   UD and Wright State are rewriting their computer ethics
guidelines to be more specific about copyright violations, and both
vow to increase their educational efforts and punish those they
find with illegal files. Meanwhile, the recording industry is
trying to establish a new standard for digital music that will
ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s, however, are not the final frontier of piracy. Bootleg
software programs and digitized, full-length movies are showing up
on some university networks. UD administrators recently caught one
student offering several downloadable films on his computer,
including one that is still in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the huge movie files download slowly, even
on super-fast networks, and don't run smoothly. That discourages
many students from pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it,'' says the UD senior. ``Not yet anyway.''

 &HT;    CD kit removes scratches
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``We get calls from people all the time who are
surprised that Wipe Out actually works,'' said Marc Guest, CEO of
the company that manufactures the Wipe Out! CD Repair Kit. ``It's
pretty sad, but people aren't used to products that do exactly what
they claim to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out, a product of the Esprit Development Corp. in
Flemington, N.J., promises to remove scratches from compact discs
and CD-ROMs. The company offers a money-back guarantee if Wipe Out
fails to permanently repair discs as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Guest supplied Cox Newspapers with a Wipe Out sample, and it
worked quite well. It corrected the performance of one consistently
balky CD-ROM and removed a scratch from an intentionally damaged
music CD.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Wipe Out a kit is a bit of a stretch. What actually
comes in the box are instructions, a soft cloth and a bottle of
polishing liquid.
</P>
<P>
   To repair a CD, the user shakes up the polishing liquid and
applies a drop or two to the damaged CD. The user then places the
CD on a hard, flat surface and rubs the liquid into the surface for
a few seconds until the scratch disappears.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wipe Out Web site, the damage CDs suffer is
usually in the plastic surface of the disc. The data is stored on a
metallic wafer under the plastic where it is protected.
</P>
<P>
   CDs fail when the laser in the CD player or CD-ROM drive
encounters a scratch in the plastic that makes it lose its place in
tracking the data on the metallic wafer underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out is like a liquid sandpaper that removes the scratch and
returns the plastic to its original smooth condition.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out! CD Repair Kit won an Innovation Award at the 1999
Consumer Electronics Show. Guest said nearly 40,000 kits have been
sold so far with only 19 customers asking for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out sells for about $15, and Guest said it can be found at
Sam Goody and Tower Record stores. It also can be ordered online
from the Web site at www.cdrepair.com.

 &HT;    Great game gifts
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Deck the halls, light the menorah, jingle the
bells and have a happy Kwanzaa. It's holiday time, and that means
two things: 1) a temporal joy and peace in the world and 2) rampant
consumerism. While we can't help on the first item, we're all about
the second one. And here is the ultimate wish list for your tiny
anklebyter.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ultimate object of his or her desire _ anything
Pokemon. The cards and stuffed animals are sure to be popular, but
think of the look on that little tyke's face when you bust out
Hasbro's interactive Pokemon Pikachu Plush ($10, www. pokemon.com).
The Pikachu is interactive in that you squeeze its hands and it
says the word that drives the kids wild, Pikachu! Also, its cheeks
glow red.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the list is Barbie. We know. Barbie used to be a WASPY,
disproportionate sex symbol who made little girls feel inadequate
if they didn't have a tiny waist and huge breasts and date a guy
named Ken. But Barbie has changed. Granted, she's still most of
those things. The difference can be found in Mattel's Working Woman
Barbie ($30, www. mattel.com). That's right, Barbie has gone to
work and she wants to talk all about it. With a touch of a button,
the day-job Barbie says lots of cool things like: ``I have
e-mail!'' ``I love going to work!'' and ``I can't wait to go
dancing with Ken tonight!'' Working Woman Barbie comes equipped
with a laptop, cell phone and a CD-ROM that enables you to design
your own stationery and do lots of other cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done playing your own holiday games and checking
your e-mail for electronic greetings, install Michelle Kwan Figure
Skating ($30, www.ea.com, for PC) for her. In this game, would-be
figure skaters can create their own skaters (they can even use
their own photo and paste it on the character), design a routine,
land triple lutzes and take snapshots of the results. It scores
about a 5.7.
</P>
<P>
   While she's playing with Barbie and spinning Michelle Kwan, he
should be playing with his pal, 2000. Toy Biz's My Pal 2000 ($40,
1-800-634-7539) will surely be a hit this holiday season. This
14-inch handy robot and trusting pal pitches tiny foam balls for a
mini baseball game, plays interactive games with its owner and acts
as a sentry ``guarding'' a child's room from nosey siblings. Along
those lines is Tiger Electronics' new Furby Baby ($25, www.tiger
toys.com). You've met the parents, now meet a chattering younger
generation of Furbies. The Furby babies have 25 percent more
vocabulary and the programmers have added more games and the
ability to insert a pacifier when the Furby gets fussy (and it will
get fussy).
</P>
<P>
   Back on the PC, it's time for Disney's Villains' Revenge _ an
inspired set of games that works on both PCs and Macs. Run the
two-disc CD-ROM and let the kids go to town. The game, in which
Jiminy Cricket guides you through fixing seven classic Disney
stories including Dumbo and Peter Pan, is an animated treat that's
fun, gorgeously animated and easy to play.($30, www.
disneyinteractive.com)
</P>
<P>
   If your little one is more into the console side of things, you
shouldn't miss getting him or her either Universal's Spyro the
Dragon: Ripto's Rage ($50, www.universal.com, for the Playstation)
or Sony's Umjammer Lammy ($50, www.playstation. com, for the
Playstation). This is the second Spyro and he is better than ever.
This game looks better, plays faster and will keep your child more
mesmerized than the last one. And then there's Umjammer Lammy. What
can you say about Umjammer? This game is from the same bent minds
that brought you Parappa the Rapper. Only this time you're trying
to get Umjammer and her band MilkCan to the gig on time. Trust us.
It's great.
</P>
<P>
   Though we can't guarantee your children will have a merry
whatever, we can assure you that, with all these gifts in front of
them, they'll be so busy playing that they won't have time to
complain until the next holiday.

 &HT;    Ergonomic keyboard odd, may be useful
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called Goldtouch has sent me its new
``advanced ergonomic system,'' which includes a keyboard, a mouse,
a mousepad, two wrist rests and a separate numeric keypad.
</P>
<P>
   It's making me seasick.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is hinged in the middle. You can splay the two
sides out. You can also raise the middle of it. Once you have it
just the way you want it, you can lock the whole thing down
securely.
</P>
<P>
   My problem is that I never learned to type properly. I taught
myself, and my technique often involves a little cross-handed work.
Try that on a split keyboard and see what it gets you. I commonly
go for the B key with my right forefinger, and with this keyboard I
keep sticking it into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   To make the keyboard smaller, Goldtouch dispensed with the
right-side keypad and uses a function key to turn the letter keys
on the right half into numeric ones. If that bothers you, you can
get the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   They've also moved the delete key clear to the left corner of
the keyboard, which really flummoxes me.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is a two-button affair shaped like a buffalo with a
bad list to starboard. It is rather light, but works fine, although
I was never able to properly install its software.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is quite heavy and has a good touch. The mousepad
sticks to the desktop, has a slight slope to the right and has the
distinction of being the only mousepad I've seen that comes with a
user's manual.
</P>
<P>
   The manual goes on about things like splay, ulnar deviation,
lateral inclination and pronation. It also warns that the keyboard
is not intended for purposes such as controlling nuclear facilities
or weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't do things like that, and you have problems with
your ergs, take a look at it. It seems reasonably priced at $219.
More info:www.goldtouch.com.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYFUL MOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Logitech's new Wingman Gaming Mouse, so far as I know, is the
first mouse oriented toward game-playing. Just what makes it a
gaming mouse, other than advertising and the inclusion of a
Japanese game of no particular distinction, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sturdy, handsome mouse, gray in color, and of course,
being from Logitech, it has three buttons. It has a shape
distinctly different from two-button Microsoft mice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the functions of the device are adjustable through
software. One, however, is not, and that is the sensitivity of the
buttons. Perhaps they are so hair-trigger because this is a Gaming
Mouse, or perhaps I'm just heavy-handed. When I sweep the cursor
across the screen, I leave a trail of menus and dialog boxes
flashing along behind.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the buttons are too easily depressed, both in and out of
games. Otherwise, it's dandy.

 &HT;    Educational Web sites worth bookmarking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.learn2.com _ The current Encyclopedia Brown of the Web,
learn2.com can help you with just about anything you'd want to
learn about, from roasting a turkey to serving as someone's best
man at a wedding. The guides on the site are clear, informative and
fun to read. Check it out and learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   www.dummies.com _ The folks behind the popular ``Dummies'' books
have cobbled together a site that takes the mystery out of not only
the high-tech world but also cooking, gardening, exercise and a
host of other subjects. Adding a daily comic strip to the mix,
dummies.com is for smarties like you.
</P>
<P>
   www.howto.yahoo.com _ If anybody knows how to find stuff on the
Internet, it's Yahoo, the most-used directory of sites on the
Internet. Yahoo's how-to guide covers the basics of Web surfing. It
starts with the reassuring message: ``Welcome to the Web. We're
glad you're here.'' A good place to start if you're new to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   www.ask.com _ Ask Jeeves is supposed to be a kind of Internet
butler _ you ask a question and without hesitation Jeeves brings
you the answer. While the site doesn't always bring back exactly
what you're looking for, Ask Jeeves is the place to go when you
want to learn something basic, such as ``Where can I find a map of
Antarctica?'' A slightly different approach to the search engine,
you might get lucky and learn a thing or two from old Jeeves.

 &HT;    Atlanta steps up chase for tech capital
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta is not Silicon Valley when it comes to finding
venture capital for start-up computer and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is doing much better at attracting high-tech
investors than several years ago. Or so says the latest issue of
Digital South magazine. It features a cover story on the South's
new ``holy rollers'' _ the so-called angel investors helping
start-up Internet and computer companies in Atlanta and the rest of
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Meet some of the companies leading the way in harnessing digital
technologies to cut costs and streamline operations. They are
featured in the cover story of the December issue of PC Computing.
The results of the magazine's survey may surprise you, for many of
the companies mentioned are neither involved with the Internet nor
computers. Among the entities featured are REI, McKesson HBOC,
Catalog.com, Webcor Builders and the Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If the rate of the new games being released for it is an
indicator, Sega's Dreamcast video console must be doing well.
There's a new title announced almost every week. The latest is
``Touring Car Challenge.'' The game is a simulation of British
touring-car racing. There are seven modes of play, eight teams to
drive for and a network play option for those with an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Dreamcast game is ``Sega Sports NBA 2K.'' Developed
by Visual Concepts for Sega, this professional basketball game has
realistic-looking players and fans. Graphics are so detailed you
can even see players' eyes blink. The game includes replicas of all
current National Basketball Association teams, their arenas and
playbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Keep up with college basketball at the official site of the
NCAA. The site offers information on all the teams and ways for you
to customize a page to track your favorite team. Merchandise for
sale and a page for kids are also featured. You'll find this site
at www.ncaabasketball.net.

 &HT;    Online buying is out of line for some products, services
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All the talk about the online revolution is still
mostly that ... talk. It might be nice to know you can buy a car
from a Web site. But most people still like to do it the old way.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Yahoo Internet Life has a recurring feature called
Old Way/Net Way that puts the Internet to the test. The idea is to
take a task _ like buying a book _ and determine if it is easier to
do on the Internet or the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue's version of the feature takes a look at
three things: securing a home loan, finding Pokemon stuff and
buying dog food.
</P>
<P>
   The home loan search was a wash. Both methods were relatively
simple. But it took the author a while longer to qualify for the
loan Internet-style.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to find Pokemon is online, where the price and
selection are better than in stores, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Dog food is best hunted the old way. The author saved more than
$10 on a 40-pound bag. The shipping costs for heavy items negated
any online cost or time savings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also asks people what the future holds for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, ever-present attorney Alan Dershowitz offers
his thoughts on the future of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today every handful of haters is integrally linked to every
other handful,'' Dershowitz wrote. ``Together they form a dangerous
network of potential terrorists capable not only of inspiring one
another but also of working in a coordinated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Roger Ebert weighs in on what the next millennium's
censorship might include, which is, apparently, very little: ``Is
the regulation of the Internet possible? The practical answer is
`no.'''
</P>
<P>
   BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling amount of customer service in the real world
apparently is alive and well on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A study from Jupiter Communications said more Web sites are not
responding to their customers' e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly study sends e-mails requesting simple support to
125 Web sites in five categories _ content, consumer brands,
travel, retail and financial services. Of those, 46 percent took at
least five days to respond, never responded or didn't have an
e-mail address available on the site. In the same period last year,
38 percent of the sites failed to respond in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping sites were a bit better. More than half the sites
tested responded within one day. But 40 percent took at least five
days, up from 28 percent in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Web ventures' claims last year that they were going to
focus on customer service as a primary investment and implement
major advances in automated assistance packages, the state of
online customer service continues to decline,'' said Cormac Foster,
a Jupiter analyst. ``Many Web ventures are ignoring the opportunity
to communicate with existing and potential customers, discouraging
brand loyalty and opting out of a user-initiated, one-to-one
relationship by delaying, eliminating or not offering responses to
e-mail. ``
</P>
<P>
   SCORE ONE FOR JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs finally beat Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Upside magazine lists ``the people who
really matter most,'' a ranking of the 100 most influential people
in the digital world. Jobs, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, heads the list, followed by Microsoft
Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 is rounded out by AT&AMP;T Chairman and Chief Executive
Michael Armstrong; Masayoshi Son, founder, president and chief
executive of Softbank; John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco
Systems; Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who now heads Vulcan
Ventures, an increasingly influential venture capital fund; John
Doerr, a partner in the granddaddy of all venture firms, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers; Lou Gerstner, head of IBM; David
Wetherell, who runs CMGI, which owns search engines Lycos and
AltaVista; and Scott McNealy, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Betty, president and chief executive of EarthLink, which is
set to merge with Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises, ranked
36th.

 &HT;    E-cards perfect for the forgetful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It never fails on a holiday. There were people _
people you care about _ whom you forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the turkey reduced to sandwiches, it's time to make
amends.
</P>
<P>
   That's where electronic greeting cards come in.
</P>
<P>
   They are out of the ordinary and clever, but _ better yet _ they
arrive instantly. After all, you don't have any time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site called Blue Mountain at www
</P>
<P>
   .bluemountain.com/. It's probably the largest electronic
greeting card site on the Web and has plenty of cards to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to add music (there's a good selection) and pick
from sentiments that range from sticky sweet to downright
businesslike. Of course, as with most of these sites, you can also
customize your message.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neat features of this site is the ability to send
cards in severallanguages, including Japanese. Now that the world _
largely thanks to the Internet _ is a smaller family, the ability
to send messages tailored to other cultures is a real plus.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're really international, you should check out
the Digital Postcard at www.all-yours.net/program
</P>
<P>
   /start20?write. If you thought it was neat to be able to send a
card in Japanese, just wait until you see the language selection
there. Maybe if you send your card saying in Arabic or Turkish,
they'll be so distracted that they will forget all about your
social lapse.
</P>
<P>
   The cards at this site can really be customized, and there's
also a database of more than 1,000 photos if you want to get fancy.
You can also include a link to a Web page with your card. If you
have your own Web site, you'll be able to add personal photos. You
can also upload a music or voice file.
</P>
<P>
   One site that is gaining in popularity is called Regard.Com at
www.regards.com/. Like some of the other sites, you can use your
own photos and images here. But one of the real pluses is the
unique animated cards that are available on this site.
</P>
<P>
   Some are so elaborate that they're very much like sending a tiny
cartoon to your friends.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the card categories here is based on the seasons of
the year, perhaps you can send your friends a card celebrating fall
and forget about Thanksgiving altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow trends on the Internet and the Web know that
Amazon.com wants to become the one stop for almost everything on
the Web _ with its new hardware section, literally including the
kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   So you won't be surprised to learn that you can also find
electronic greeting cards there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be surprised to learn that these are some of the
best cards on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about animation earlier, but some of these cards have
animated photos, not cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   It's well worth a visit over to cards.amazon.com to see what is
available.
</P>
<P>
   A site called Digital Greetings hangs its hat on the ability to
make a custom card. This Web page is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .digitalgreetings.com/create
</P>
<P>
   .html. Creating a card is a step-by-step process, and even for
slow learners, it's pretty simple. You pick out illustrations,
headlines and colors, and finally you end up with a card that you
created yourself.

 &HT;    There'll always be an England, a fine place to snag unique gifts
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The British are coming! The British are coming!
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, the British are here, selling everything from
books to breakfast tea on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered the wonders of British shopping at the most
American of Web retailers, Amazon.com. I was hoping to buy several
copies of the new Bridget Jones novel for gifts, only to find the
book hadn't been published in the United States. However, Amazon,
superstore that it is, always adds related music, video or auction
categories that complement whatever product you are looking up.
Scrolling down the page, I saw that the Bridget Jones book was
available on Amazon's auction site. Fifty copies of ``Bridget
Jones: The Edge of Reason'' were available from a San Diego seller
with a top bid of $32. ``Just published abroad!'' the description
trumpeted, ``but you can get it now!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm ready to bid online for vintage Madame Alexander dolls
and Kentucky Derby memorabilia, but there is absolutely no way I'm
going to bid on a book that was published just last month. Then it
hit me: Why not go straight to the source?
</P>
<P>
   Among the many offerings Amazon has is a British branch at
www.amazon.co.uk. Before you could say ``Buckingham Palace,'' I was
on Amazon's British site, and guess what? It had plenty of copies
of ``The Edge of Reason'' in stock. In fact, it was Amazon.co.uk's
best-selling book that week. Another quick click, and I found the
book was available immediately. The cost to U.S. shoppers including
shipping was about $20, less than the asking price from the
California auctioneer. Needless to say, several copies are now
winging their way to my home in plenty of time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I was also hoping to order several paperback volumes of the
popular Harry Potter children's books not yet available in the
United States, but Amazon.co.uk only permits one copy of any Harry
Potter book per U.S. address _ lest they turn up on some online
American auction block, one would imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Smug from my initial success in the international Internet
shopping arena, I've been surfing and browsing some of England's
best-known merchants in search of offbeat holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   For unusual and classy gifts, make an online visit to Harrods
(www.Harrods.com), England's most famous department store. Harrods
knows that American shoppers still make up the bulk of online
shoppers and has done a lot to make them feel at home. This
includes everything from the ``.com'' address instead of the
unfamiliar ``.co.uk'' address to pricing items and shipping costs
in U.S. dollars. The range of items is limited but well-chosen and
gives American shoppers the flavor of what the British store is all
about. Shoppers can order everything from cashmere cardigans to
elaborate food baskets, a Harrods' millennium watch, and teddy
bears and other gifts for the kids.

<P>
   Hamley's, Britain's answer to FAO Schwarz, has a delightful Web
site (www.hamleys.com) that captures the magic of a really, really
big, wonderful toy store, with amusing toys and games for kids and
families. A shopping guide helps select toys by age, price range
and other factors, with surprisingly good results. Pricing is
available in U.S. dollars for American customers.
</P>
<P>
   For home design and accessories and maybe a gift for yourself,
there's no place like Liberty of London
(www.liberty-of-london.com). Known for centuries for its
distinctive patterns that cover everything from wallpaper to
scarves, stationery and umbrellas, the company makes just looking a
treat. Prices are in British currency, with American prices listed
``for comparison only.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some things to keep in mind if you do decide to shop
from international merchants, aside from the usual privacy and
security requirements. Not all merchants provide prices in U.S.
dollars. So to make sure you know just how much you're spending,
use an online currency converter such as J.B.'s Currency Converter
(www.yi.com/home
</P>
<P>
   /BerensJean-Claude/currency
</P>
<P>
   .htm).
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to forget the ``world'' in the phrase ``World
Wide Web.'' However, an international online shopping trip can
yield wonderful surprises.

 &HT;    Failures are possible Jan. 1 _ just like on any other day
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have a basement, but it is not filled with bottled
water (one gallon per person per day); nor is there any
freeze-dried food (I favor the beef stroganoff); and the only thing
down there that resembles a firearm is an old soldering gun.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should feel guilty. Or at least get with the program.
Lately I've watched serious-sounding people on TV advise me on what
I should store to be safe when the world ends because of the Y2K
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   All these shows seem to operate with the same script. First, I
am assured that it is foolish to worry. The public relations folks
_ all with nice hair _ from the electric, phone and water companies
tell me that all will be fine. Then these same people start talking
about pouring water into old plastic Coke bottles. It brings back
memories of fallout shelters and the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there will be a disaster in the United States from
Y2K. But like the experts I see on television, I can't write out an
ironclad guarantee that I'm correct. Some smart people agree with
me; some smart people disagree. So you'll have to decide for
yourself how much to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Today I think I can serve you best by telling you what does
worry me about the Y2K hysteria. Unlike my opinion on how serious
the problem is, I can look you in the eye and tell you that what
you're about to hear is both important and true.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the fact that almost everyone has heard of Y2K.
And there are movies and books that paint apocalyptic pictures of
what it will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the serious attempts on television and in print
to explain Y2K in a fair and honorable way. That means that _ even
in these fair reports _ all the possibilities, including worst-case
scenarios, are explained.
</P>
<P>
   So you have a population that has at least heard about some of
the things that can go wrong. Some of them are like you _ smart,
informed and calm. And there are some idiots, too, the folks who
have been storing guns in the basement along with the basmati rice
and Coke bottles full of water.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you will the panic that will result if the power goes
out on New Year's Eve, or the day before. Or if one of these people
picks up the telephone to order a pizza and is met by silence. My
gosh a'mercy, it's the end of the world. Grab the Colt and feed in
a clip, lock the doors, and watch the neighbor a few houses down
closely ... he's always seemed odd.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's what scares me.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that somewhere in Atlanta, somewhere in most
major cities, there will be lights that are out on New Year's Eve;
there will be phones that don't work, gas service that is
interrupted and water that doesn't flow.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you try to provide these essential services to a few
million people every hour of every day, there will be outages.
Stuff breaks. Cars hit utility poles. Switches fail. Humans make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens on a typical day, people get annoyed. But when
it happens on New Year's Eve or the next day _ and, like I said, it
will happen somewhere, maybe to you _ I worry that the result could
make the hysteria from the ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast
seem mild.
</P>
<P>
   So _ and I'm kidding, but just a little _ maybe you should spend
New Year's Eve in your basement with the doors locked. I think
you'll be completely safe from glitches caused by the utilities
(besides, even if I'm wrong, it's a fact that humans can live for
hours on end without running water, electricity or telephones). But
I do think that _ given the hysteria _ the basement would be a
terrific place to see in the New Year.

 &HT;    E-cards perfect for the forgetful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It never fails on a holiday. There were people _
people you care about _ whom you forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the turkey reduced to sandwiches, it's time to make
amends.
</P>
<P>
   That's where electronic greeting cards come in.
</P>
<P>
   They are out of the ordinary and clever, but _ better yet _ they
arrive instantly. After all, you don't have any time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site called Blue Mountain at www
</P>
<P>
   .bluemountain.com/. It's probably the largest electronic
greeting card site on the Web and has plenty of cards to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to add music (there's a good selection) and pick
from sentiments that range from sticky sweet to downright
businesslike. Of course, as with most of these sites, you can also
customize your message.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neat features of this site is the ability to send
cards in severallanguages, including Japanese. Now that the world _
largely thanks to the Internet _ is a smaller family, the ability
to send messages tailored to other cultures is a real plus.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're really international, you should check out
the Digital Postcard at www.all-yours.net/program
</P>
<P>
   /start20?write. If you thought it was neat to be able to send a
card in Japanese, just wait until you see the language selection
there. Maybe if you send your card saying in Arabic or Turkish,
they'll be so distracted that they will forget all about your
social lapse.
</P>
<P>
   The cards at this site can really be customized, and there's
also a database of more than 1,000 photos if you want to get fancy.
You can also include a link to a Web page with your card. If you
have your own Web site, you'll be able to add personal photos. You
can also upload a music or voice file.
</P>
<P>
   One site that is gaining in popularity is called Regard.Com at
www.regards.com/. Like some of the other sites, you can use your
own photos and images here. But one of the real pluses is the
unique animated cards that are available on this site.
</P>
<P>
   Some are so elaborate that they're very much like sending a tiny
cartoon to your friends.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the card categories here is based on the seasons of
the year, perhaps you can send your friends a card celebrating fall
and forget about Thanksgiving altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow trends on the Internet and the Web know that
Amazon.com wants to become the one stop for almost everything on
the Web _ with its new hardware section, literally including the
kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   So you won't be surprised to learn that you can also find
electronic greeting cards there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be surprised to learn that these are some of the
best cards on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about animation earlier, but some of these cards have
animated photos, not cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   It's well worth a visit over to cards.amazon.com to see what is
available.
</P>
<P>
   A site called Digital Greetings hangs its hat on the ability to
make a custom card. This Web page is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .digitalgreetings.com/create
</P>
<P>
   .html. Creating a card is a step-by-step process, and even for
slow learners, it's pretty simple. You pick out illustrations,
headlines and colors, and finally you end up with a card that you
created yourself.

 &HT;    There'll always be an England, a fine place to snag unique gifts
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The British are coming! The British are coming!
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, the British are here, selling everything from
books to breakfast tea on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered the wonders of British shopping at the most
American of Web retailers, Amazon.com. I was hoping to buy several
copies of the new Bridget Jones novel for gifts, only to find the
book hadn't been published in the United States. However, Amazon,
superstore that it is, always adds related music, video or auction
categories that complement whatever product you are looking up.
Scrolling down the page, I saw that the Bridget Jones book was
available on Amazon's auction site. Fifty copies of ``Bridget
Jones: The Edge of Reason'' were available from a San Diego seller
with a top bid of $32. ``Just published abroad!'' the description
trumpeted, ``but you can get it now!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm ready to bid online for vintage Madame Alexander dolls
and Kentucky Derby memorabilia, but there is absolutely no way I'm
going to bid on a book that was published just last month. Then it
hit me: Why not go straight to the source?
</P>
<P>
   Among the many offerings Amazon has is a British branch at
www.amazon.co.uk. Before you could say ``Buckingham Palace,'' I was
on Amazon's British site, and guess what? It had plenty of copies
of ``The Edge of Reason'' in stock. In fact, it was Amazon.co.uk's
best-selling book that week. Another quick click, and I found the
book was available immediately. The cost to U.S. shoppers including
shipping was about $20, less than the asking price from the
California auctioneer. Needless to say, several copies are now
winging their way to my home in plenty of time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I was also hoping to order several paperback volumes of the
popular Harry Potter children's books not yet available in the
United States, but Amazon.co.uk only permits one copy of any Harry
Potter book per U.S. address _ lest they turn up on some online
American auction block, one would imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Smug from my initial success in the international Internet
shopping arena, I've been surfing and browsing some of England's
best-known merchants in search of offbeat holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   For unusual and classy gifts, make an online visit to Harrods
(www.Harrods.com), England's most famous department store. Harrods
knows that American shoppers still make up the bulk of online
shoppers and has done a lot to make them feel at home. This
includes everything from the ``.com'' address instead of the
unfamiliar ``.co.uk'' address to pricing items and shipping costs
in U.S. dollars. The range of items is limited but well-chosen and
gives American shoppers the flavor of what the British store is all
about. Shoppers can order everything from cashmere cardigans to
elaborate food baskets, a Harrods' millennium watch, and teddy
bears and other gifts for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Hamley's, Britain's answer to FAO Schwarz, has a delightful Web
site (www.hamleys.com) that captures the magic of a really, really
big, wonderful toy store, with amusing toys and games for kids and
families. A shopping guide helps select toys by age, price range
and other factors, with surprisingly good results. Pricing is

(www.liberty-of-london.com). Known for centuries for its
distinctive patterns that cover everything from wallpaper to
scarves, stationery and umbrellas, the company makes just looking a
treat. Prices are in British currency, with American prices listed
``for comparison only.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some things to keep in mind if you do decide to shop
from international merchants, aside from the usual privacy and
security requirements. Not all merchants provide prices in U.S.
dollars. So to make sure you know just how much you're spending,
use an online currency converter such as J.B.'s Currency Converter

 &HT;    Atlanta steps up chase for tech capital
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta is not Silicon Valley when it comes to finding
venture capital for start-up computer and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is doing much better at attracting high-tech
investors than several years ago. Or so says the latest issue of
Digital South magazine. It features a cover story on the South's
new ``holy rollers'' _ the so-called angel investors helping
start-up Internet and computer companies in Atlanta and the rest of
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Meet some of the companies leading the way in harnessing digital
technologies to cut costs and streamline operations. They are
featured in the cover story of the December issue of PC Computing.
The results of the magazine's survey may surprise you, for many of
the companies mentioned are neither involved with the Internet nor
computers. Among the entities featured are REI, McKesson HBOC,
Catalog.com, Webcor Builders and the Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If the rate of the new games being released for it is an
indicator, Sega's Dreamcast video console must be doing well.
There's a new title announced almost every week. The latest is
``Touring Car Challenge.'' The game is a simulation of British
touring-car racing. There are seven modes of play, eight teams to
drive for and a network play option for those with an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Dreamcast game is ``Sega Sports NBA 2K.'' Developed
by Visual Concepts for Sega, this professional basketball game has
realistic-looking players and fans. Graphics are so detailed you
can even see players' eyes blink. The game includes replicas of all
current National Basketball Association teams, their arenas and
playbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Keep up with college basketball at the official site of the
NCAA. The site offers information on all the teams and ways for you
to customize a page to track your favorite team. Merchandise for
sale and a page for kids are also featured. You'll find this site
at www.ncaabasketball.net.

 &HT;    Pirating music files problematic for record companies, schools
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Record stores haven't gotten much business from
one 23-year-old University of Dayton senior lately _ and he may
never give them a penny more.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his music free from the Internet. Using the university's
high-speed computer lines, he and his friends download songs known
as MP3 files from web sites that post them illegally. He says his
roommate has built a trove of 2,000 songs, and that he has created
his own compact discs from Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everyone I know does it,'' says the senior. ``I know
people who are filling up their hard drives (with pirated music).''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a 21st century headache for college administrators.
Schools have invested millions to create cutting-edge computer
infrastructures, opening new frontiers of research and learning.
However, those same networks have made it easy for students to
trample copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Untold thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating
across the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who
hope to spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But
many are copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and
record companies of money that, according to the Recording Industry
Association of America, is probably exponentially greater than the
$1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an Internet connection can download these files, but
cyber-swiping appears to be especially rampant on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got young people with free time, lots of access, and
they're curious,'' says Barbara Deschapelles, a network
administrator at UD. ``It's kind of a climb the mountain thing:
`What can I get away with?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitories and computer labs at UD, Wright State University,
Sinclair Community College and Antioch use network connections that
are up to 200 times faster than the 56k modems standard on home
computers. That means instead of taking a half hour to download a
5-minute MP3 song, students can do it in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Once they store a song on their computers, they can play it
whenever they like. They also can put it on their personal Web
sites for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually how students are caught with pirated music.
Recording industry agents constantly search for web sites that
illegally post copyrighted songs, notifying colleges when such
material is on their networks. That has happened four times at UD
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those nabbed with bootlegged music can lose network access and
suffer other penalties, such as fines or community service. But
such busts, rare to begin with, may soon become nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they rarely put MP3s on their Web pages these days.
They usually store the music on their computers' hard drives, which
cannot be accessed by Internet snoopers.
</P>
<P>
   They swap tunes using e-mail and Zip disks, or, in the case of
students at Wright State, through private networks accessible to a
limited number of people. One 18-year-old freshman says that has
allowed him to quickly build a huge collection of MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost 1 gigabyte, and that's probably over 10 hours,
probably around a couple of hundred songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators say they're aware of the vast MP3
exchanges on campus, but maintain there's little they can do about
it. They don't know what students have on their computers unless
they spot a guilty Web site or get tipped off by a foolish action
(one UD student was caught when he tried to send an e-mail
containing a whopping 100MB of MP3s; the transmission failed,
giving technicians a copy of the message).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to spread the word that this is illegal and
people are being caught,'' said UD's Deschapelles. `` ... Most
people probably aren't thinking. I think if they did, it would
occur to them that it was illegal and immoral. It's theft of ideas
and theft of property.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as news to one 20-year-old UD junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal?'' he says. ``That definitely changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his housemates have hooked a computer loaded with 1,500
MP3 files to a sound system, using it to supply the music during
parties. They also burn songs onto recordable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The junior says MP3 search engines and television commercials
for products such as CD burners made him think downloading bootleg
music was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's such a new thing that people haven't gotten used
to it being illegal,'' he says. ``It's like, `I never have to go to
Best Buy again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, well aware that they are stealing music, have
mixed feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, I think we should be able to do it, because
it's our freedom,'' says an 18-year-old Wright State freshman.
``But I'm in a band. I think, `What if we eventually put out a CD
and everyone copied it?' That thought is there, and to be honest,
it probably is hurting the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   UD and Wright State are rewriting their computer ethics
guidelines to be more specific about copyright violations, and both
vow to increase their educational efforts and punish those they
find with illegal files. Meanwhile, the recording industry is
trying to establish a new standard for digital music that will
ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s, however, are not the final frontier of piracy. Bootleg
software programs and digitized, full-length movies are showing up
on some university networks. UD administrators recently caught one
student offering several downloadable films on his computer,
including one that is still in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the huge movie files download slowly, even
on super-fast networks, and don't run smoothly. That discourages
many students from pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it,'' says the UD senior. ``Not yet anyway.''

 &HT;    Great game gifts
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Deck the halls, light the menorah, jingle the
bells and have a happy Kwanzaa. It's holiday time, and that means
two things: 1) a temporal joy and peace in the world and 2) rampant
consumerism. While we can't help on the first item, we're all about
the second one. And here is the ultimate wish list for your tiny
anklebyter.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ultimate object of his or her desire _ anything
Pokemon. The cards and stuffed animals are sure to be popular, but
think of the look on that little tyke's face when you bust out
Hasbro's interactive Pokemon Pikachu Plush ($10, www. pokemon.com).
The Pikachu is interactive in that you squeeze its hands and it
says the word that drives the kids wild, Pikachu! Also, its cheeks
glow red.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the list is Barbie. We know. Barbie used to be a WASPY,
disproportionate sex symbol who made little girls feel inadequate
if they didn't have a tiny waist and huge breasts and date a guy
named Ken. But Barbie has changed. Granted, she's still most of
those things. The difference can be found in Mattel's Working Woman
Barbie ($30, www. mattel.com). That's right, Barbie has gone to
work and she wants to talk all about it. With a touch of a button,
the day-job Barbie says lots of cool things like: ``I have
e-mail!'' ``I love going to work!'' and ``I can't wait to go
dancing with Ken tonight!'' Working Woman Barbie comes equipped
with a laptop, cell phone and a CD-ROM that enables you to design
your own stationery and do lots of other cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done playing your own holiday games and checking
your e-mail for electronic greetings, install Michelle Kwan Figure
Skating ($30, www.ea.com, for PC) for her. In this game, would-be
figure skaters can create their own skaters (they can even use
their own photo and paste it on the character), design a routine,
land triple lutzes and take snapshots of the results. It scores
about a 5.7.
</P>
<P>
   While she's playing with Barbie and spinning Michelle Kwan, he
should be playing with his pal, 2000. Toy Biz's My Pal 2000 ($40,
1-800-634-7539) will surely be a hit this holiday season. This
14-inch handy robot and trusting pal pitches tiny foam balls for a
mini baseball game, plays interactive games with its owner and acts
as a sentry ``guarding'' a child's room from nosey siblings. Along
those lines is Tiger Electronics' new Furby Baby ($25, www.tiger
toys.com). You've met the parents, now meet a chattering younger
generation of Furbies. The Furby babies have 25 percent more
vocabulary and the programmers have added more games and the
ability to insert a pacifier when the Furby gets fussy (and it will
get fussy).
</P>
<P>
   Back on the PC, it's time for Disney's Villains' Revenge _ an
inspired set of games that works on both PCs and Macs. Run the
two-disc CD-ROM and let the kids go to town. The game, in which
Jiminy Cricket guides you through fixing seven classic Disney
stories including Dumbo and Peter Pan, is an animated treat that's
fun, gorgeously animated and easy to play.($30, www.
disneyinteractive.com)
</P>
<P>
   If your little one is more into the console side of things, you
shouldn't miss getting him or her either Universal's Spyro the
Dragon: Ripto's Rage ($50, www.universal.com, for the Playstation)
or Sony's Umjammer Lammy ($50, www.playstation. com, for the
Playstation). This is the second Spyro and he is better than ever.
This game looks better, plays faster and will keep your child more
mesmerized than the last one. And then there's Umjammer Lammy. What
can you say about Umjammer? This game is from the same bent minds
that brought you Parappa the Rapper. Only this time you're trying
to get Umjammer and her band MilkCan to the gig on time. Trust us.
It's great.
</P>
<P>
   Though we can't guarantee your children will have a merry
whatever, we can assure you that, with all these gifts in front of
them, they'll be so busy playing that they won't have time to
complain until the next holiday.

 &HT;    Online buying is out of line for some products, services
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All the talk about the online revolution is still
mostly that ... talk. It might be nice to know you can buy a car
from a Web site. But most people still like to do it the old way.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Yahoo Internet Life has a recurring feature called
Old Way/Net Way that puts the Internet to the test. The idea is to
take a task _ like buying a book _ and determine if it is easier to
do on the Internet or the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue's version of the feature takes a look at
three things: securing a home loan, finding Pokemon stuff and
buying dog food.
</P>
<P>
   The home loan search was a wash. Both methods were relatively
simple. But it took the author a while longer to qualify for the
loan Internet-style.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to find Pokemon is online, where the price and
selection are better than in stores, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Dog food is best hunted the old way. The author saved more than
$10 on a 40-pound bag. The shipping costs for heavy items negated
any online cost or time savings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also asks people what the future holds for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, ever-present attorney Alan Dershowitz offers
his thoughts on the future of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today every handful of haters is integrally linked to every
other handful,'' Dershowitz wrote. ``Together they form a dangerous
network of potential terrorists capable not only of inspiring one
another but also of working in a coordinated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Roger Ebert weighs in on what the next millennium's
censorship might include, which is, apparently, very little: ``Is
the regulation of the Internet possible? The practical answer is
`no.'''
</P>
<P>
   BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling amount of customer service in the real world
apparently is alive and well on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A study from Jupiter Communications said more Web sites are not
responding to their customers' e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly study sends e-mails requesting simple support to
125 Web sites in five categories _ content, consumer brands,
travel, retail and financial services. Of those, 46 percent took at
least five days to respond, never responded or didn't have an
e-mail address available on the site. In the same period last year,
38 percent of the sites failed to respond in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping sites were a bit better. More than half the sites
tested responded within one day. But 40 percent took at least five
days, up from 28 percent in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Web ventures' claims last year that they were going to
focus on customer service as a primary investment and implement
major advances in automated assistance packages, the state of
online customer service continues to decline,'' said Cormac Foster,
a Jupiter analyst. ``Many Web ventures are ignoring the opportunity
to communicate with existing and potential customers, discouraging
brand loyalty and opting out of a user-initiated, one-to-one
relationship by delaying, eliminating or not offering responses to
e-mail. ``
</P>
<P>
   SCORE ONE FOR JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs finally beat Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Upside magazine lists ``the people who
really matter most,'' a ranking of the 100 most influential people
in the digital world. Jobs, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, heads the list, followed by Microsoft
Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 is rounded out by AT&AMP;T Chairman and Chief Executive
Michael Armstrong; Masayoshi Son, founder, president and chief
executive of Softbank; John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco
Systems; Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who now heads Vulcan
Ventures, an increasingly influential venture capital fund; John
Doerr, a partner in the granddaddy of all venture firms, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers; Lou Gerstner, head of IBM; David
Wetherell, who runs CMGI, which owns search engines Lycos and
AltaVista; and Scott McNealy, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Betty, president and chief executive of EarthLink, which is
set to merge with Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises, ranked
36th.

 &HT;    Ergonomic keyboard odd, may be useful
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called Goldtouch has sent me its new
``advanced ergonomic system,'' which includes a keyboard, a mouse,
a mousepad, two wrist rests and a separate numeric keypad.
</P>
<P>
   It's making me seasick.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is hinged in the middle. You can splay the two
sides out. You can also raise the middle of it. Once you have it
just the way you want it, you can lock the whole thing down
securely.
</P>
<P>
   My problem is that I never learned to type properly. I taught
myself, and my technique often involves a little cross-handed work.
Try that on a split keyboard and see what it gets you. I commonly
go for the B key with my right forefinger, and with this keyboard I
keep sticking it into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   To make the keyboard smaller, Goldtouch dispensed with the
right-side keypad and uses a function key to turn the letter keys
on the right half into numeric ones. If that bothers you, you can
get the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   They've also moved the delete key clear to the left corner of
the keyboard, which really flummoxes me.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is a two-button affair shaped like a buffalo with a
bad list to starboard. It is rather light, but works fine, although
I was never able to properly install its software.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is quite heavy and has a good touch. The mousepad
sticks to the desktop, has a slight slope to the right and has the
distinction of being the only mousepad I've seen that comes with a
user's manual.
</P>
<P>
   The manual goes on about things like splay, ulnar deviation,
lateral inclination and pronation. It also warns that the keyboard
is not intended for purposes such as controlling nuclear facilities
or weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't do things like that, and you have problems with
your ergs, take a look at it. It seems reasonably priced at $219.
More info:www.goldtouch.com.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYFUL MOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Logitech's new Wingman Gaming Mouse, so far as I know, is the
first mouse oriented toward game-playing. Just what makes it a
gaming mouse, other than advertising and the inclusion of a
Japanese game of no particular distinction, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sturdy, handsome mouse, gray in color, and of course,
being from Logitech, it has three buttons. It has a shape
distinctly different from two-button Microsoft mice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the functions of the device are adjustable through
software. One, however, is not, and that is the sensitivity of the
buttons. Perhaps they are so hair-trigger because this is a Gaming
Mouse, or perhaps I'm just heavy-handed. When I sweep the cursor
across the screen, I leave a trail of menus and dialog boxes
flashing along behind.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the buttons are too easily depressed, both in and out of
games. Otherwise, it's dandy.

 &HT;    Educational Web sites worth bookmarking

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.learn2.com _ The current Encyclopedia Brown of the Web,
learn2.com can help you with just about anything you'd want to
learn about, from roasting a turkey to serving as someone's best
man at a wedding. The guides on the site are clear, informative and
fun to read. Check it out and learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   www.dummies.com _ The folks behind the popular ``Dummies'' books
have cobbled together a site that takes the mystery out of not only
the high-tech world but also cooking, gardening, exercise and a
host of other subjects. Adding a daily comic strip to the mix,
dummies.com is for smarties like you.
</P>
<P>
   www.howto.yahoo.com _ If anybody knows how to find stuff on the
Internet, it's Yahoo, the most-used directory of sites on the
Internet. Yahoo's how-to guide covers the basics of Web surfing. It
starts with the reassuring message: ``Welcome to the Web. We're
glad you're here.'' A good place to start if you're new to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   www.ask.com _ Ask Jeeves is supposed to be a kind of Internet
butler _ you ask a question and without hesitation Jeeves brings
you the answer. While the site doesn't always bring back exactly
what you're looking for, Ask Jeeves is the place to go when you
want to learn something basic, such as ``Where can I find a map of
Antarctica?'' A slightly different approach to the search engine,
you might get lucky and learn a thing or two from old Jeeves.

 &HT;    Pondering panda facts
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The giant pandas are finally on exhibit at Zoo
Atlanta. More than 10,000 visitors flocked to see them during their
opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lines are long, we didn't want you to have to wait
to meet them. In honor of our panda friends, NFK presents this very
special super creature feature!
</P>
<P>
   YANG YANG (pronounced yahng yahng)
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm the boy: I was born Sept. 9, 1997, at the Chengdu Research
Base in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents: My mother is Ya Ya, a panda at the Chengdu base. My
father is unknown. I remained with my mom for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the scales: I weigh 180 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm a daredevil: As a young cub, I spent several days trying
to learn to climb a tree. When I finally conquered the canopy, I
didn't know how to get down, and I ended up falling on my head. I
wasn't really hurt. I just kept playing!
</P>
<P>
   LUN LUN (pronounced loon-loon)
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm the girl: I was born Aug. 25, 1997, at the Chengdu
Research Base in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents: My mother is Bing Bing. My father is Lin Lan. I was
separated from my mom when I was 4 months old.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rock 'n' roll girl: I was named by a Taiwanese rock star, Su
Huilun, who ``adopted'' me in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proud of her size: I weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel pretty: I'm considered very beautiful, because my
cheeks are round and fluffy. The Chinese people see round faces as
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   PANDA FACTS
</P>
<P>
   Scientific name: Ailaropada melanoleuca.
</P>
<P>
   We've been around for years: Our species has existed since the
Pleistocene Era, about 600,000 years ago. But now we're dying out:
We don't breed well in captivity. There are about 110 to 120 of us
in captivity, mostly in China. Only three zoos in the United States
exhibit giant pandas: the San Diego Zoo; the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.; and, of course, Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get bigger: As adults, our species grows to be 4 to 6 feet
long and may weigh up to 350 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Growing old together: In the wild, pandas usually live 16 to 18
years. In captivity, the average life expectancy is about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Where you'll find our friends: In the wild, we are found only in
the mountains of central China. We live in dense bamboo and
coniferous forests at altitudes of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The
mountains are shrouded in thick clouds, with rain throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   We like fiber in our diets: We live almost completely on bamboo,
and eat up to 40 pounds of it a day. We also eat irises, crocuses,
fish and occasionally small rodents. We can eat for as much as 16
hours of our day.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown bamboo: We didn't like the bamboo grown in Savannah,
Ga., so now we're munching on bamboo grown in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Very hard to have babies: We reach sexual maturity between 4 and
6 years of age. Female pandas are in heat for only one to three
weeks of the year, usually between March and May.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky to survive: Our litters range from one to three cubs, but
usually only one survives.
</P>
<P>
   We're not like Yogi Bear: Unlike other bears, we do not
hibernate and cannot walk on our hind legs.
</P>
<P>
   Source: Zoo Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, we asked you to call us with questions you
wanted answered about the pandas. Here are some of those questions
and the answers we learned from the zoo experts:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are giant pandas black and white?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows. Perhaps their coloration provides camouflage in
their forest habitats. There is a Chinese fable about a young girl
who loved pandas. When hunters came to shoot the pandas, she jumped
in front of them and was killed. The pandas expressed their grief
by rubbing their arms and legs with ashes. Their eyes became black
when they wiped away their tears, and their shoulders became black
as they hugged to console each other.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could scientists clone them?
</P>
<P>
   A: It might be possible to clone pandas, but because essential
social skills are acquired during the time infants spend with their
mothers, it would not be a very successful way of saving the
species.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do they mate for life?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, bears do not mate for life. Both females and males may
have several mates during their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will people speak to them in Chinese even though they're in
Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like other animals, they learn certain words and gestures
from their human keepers. Lun Lun and Yang Yang will have to get
used to hearing American voices speaking English. Fortunately, they
are very young and they seem to be very smart. They also have two
of their familiar human friends from China who will stay with them
for six months to help them make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do they have the same organs as humans?
</P>
<P>
   A: All mammals, including humans and bears, have the same basic
organs, such as hearts, lungs, stomachs, livers and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are pandas gentle or would they maul a person if they could?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pandas have big sharp teeth and claws. They could hurt a
person if they felt threatened, but they are very gentle most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are they bears or raccoons?
</P>
<P>
   A: For many years, scientists have debated whether pandas should
be classified as bears, raccoons, or a separate family all their
own. This debate is because the giant panda and its cousin, the
lesser or red panda, share many characteristics with both bears and
raccoons. Recent DNA analysis indicates that giant pandas are more
closely related to bears, and red pandas are more closely related
to raccoons. Accordingly, giant pandas are now categorized in the
bear family while red pandas are categorized in the raccoon family.
You can visit both giant pandas and red pandas at Zoo Atlanta.

 &HT;    Retired UGA mascot dies
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Uga V, retired bulldog mascot of the University of
Georgia football team, died last week. He was buried with his
ancestors at the university's football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Uga V was the UGA mascot from 1990 until this fall, when he was
succeeded by his son, Uga VI. High points in his career came in
1996, when he went after an Auburn football player who came too
close, and in 1997, when Sports Illustrated named him the best
college football mascot.
</P>
<P>
   The Uga bulldogs are owned by the family of Frank ``Sonny''
Seiler of Savannah, Ga. ``It's a very significant loss,'' Seiler
said of Uga V's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably the most active of all the dogs and was a
great mascot for the university and its athletic teams. But he was
also a family pet, and it's always very traumatic to lose one.''
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE COURSES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS?
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgia public schools have discussed adding courses on
Bible history, and the state school superintendent supports the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, the chief lawyer
for the state government, warned last week that such courses might
not be legal.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: The Constitution says government, which includes
public schools, can't establish a religion. Baker said any Bible
courses would have to serve a nonreligious purpose, and they
couldn't be used to promote any religion.
</P>
<P>
   The state School Board will discuss Bible courses more when it
meets on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS GETS 29,000 MESSAGES
</P>
<P>
   The results are in for the fifth-graders at Douglasville's Bill
Arp Elementary School who began a global e-mail campaign as a
geography project in September.
</P>
<P>
   In just two weeks, the kids received nearly 27,500 e-mails. Then
Yahoo closed their e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 1,589 letters and postcards had come by snail mail
when the project ended Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the coolest things to come from this project is the pen
pals we have gotten,'' said teacher Robert Blevins. ``Many of the
kids now have individual e-mail pen pals, but the class as a whole
is also writing to a class at the International School in
Austria.'' The students' next project is to find out what those
kids think about the United States.

 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News ServiceQ: I'm in charge of putting together a
<TEXT>
special ceremony honoring three Eagle Scouts, one of whom is my
son. I've heard that you can hire someone to bring in a live eagle
and then talk about why the eagle is used as the symbol of Boy
Scouting's highest award. Any ideas on how to find such a person? _
Sue Leininger
<P>
   A: Contact Last Chance Forever, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to the rehabilitation and release of injured birds of
prey in San Antonio, Texas. A Golden Eagle and his handler will
make an appearance in exchange for a donation, says executive
director John Karger. Sounds like a good deal all around. Call
(210) 499-4080. For details click onwww.lastchanceforever.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a leather jacket, fairly new, that's just dusty from
hanging in the closet. No stains, no cracks or anything like that.
Checked with the cleaners on the charge and YIKES!, didn't realize
it was that high. Is there anything I can do at home to spruce it
up without taking it to the cleaners? As I said, it's not really
dirty, just dusty. But because of what the jacket cost, I don't
want to take a chance and mess it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Schoener
</P>
<P>
   A: Pick up some Aristocrat All Purpose Leather Cleaner and
Conditioner. Use a sponge with a little warm water to clean the
jacket and then wipe with a damp rag, advises Tenderfoot's Sharon
Howell. Then condition the jacket with Kiwi Mink Oil. Q: I wonder
why some waiters and waitresses at some restaurants are able to
work with their order book stuck down the back of their pants. It
seems that it should be violating some sort of health law. It
grosses me out. Am I the only person who thinks there is something
wrong with this? _ Pat S.
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It is ``an unhygienic practice,'' says retail foods
sanitarian Mike Rouff of the Texas Department of Health. Reporting
such behavior to the local health authority may not prove
productive, as the inspector would have to witness such behavior in
order to do something about it. Tell the manager what you have seen
the server do. If management does not respond, take your business
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please ask your readers for help to get the Kombucha mushroom
for an old lady who needs it desperately as a medicinal aid. I have
taken it for years and cannot find it.
</P>
<P>
   _ E. Guzzardo
</P>
<P>
   A: Will you settle for the extract, tea or capsules? All are in
stock at Whole Foods Market. According to the Food and Drug
Administration, this tea contains acids commonly found in foods
such as vinegar. The tea should be stored only in glass or metal
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to go see manta rays. They are huge, beautiful sea
creatures. I am wondering if there is a fairly reliable place to go
see them. _ Jane L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Stake out their food. The largest member of the ray family
(Stevie, Sugar and Manta), manta rays can reach 19 feet long and
weigh 2,300 pounds on a diet of plankton. Manta rays gather around
reliable feeding and cleaning areas in tropical waters like Kona,
Hawaii and the Cayman Islands. Download manta ray images from
www.mantaray.com, where you also will find information on the Manta
Ray Bay Hotel in Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a moon plant and have no instructions on what to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ L.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the moon plant, a vine with white blooms similar to the
morning glory, is potted, place it in a sunny window until spring,
advises James Owens of Sledd's Nursery. Then plant the perennial in
your garden in full sun where it will receive adequate water. If
the moon plant is already in the ground, cut it back, mulch the
area to protect it from winter cold, and hope the plant returns in
the spring. Q: Here's an interesting millennial question: At what
place on our planet does each new day officially start? In other
words, where on Earth will the year 2000 begin?
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris R. Glenn
</P>
<P>
   A: The first spot you can find west of the international date
line is where the new year starts (near the 180th meridian). The
line is rather jagged, an attempt to keep countries on the same
day. Until recently Kiribati, for example, was a country split by
the date line. The line now jogs east to include Caroline Island.
It claims to be a great place to welcome 2000. Other sites include
Fiji, where the line passes through places such as Udu Point, Rabi
Island and Taveuni, and Gisborne, New Zealand, which bills itself
as the first city in the world to see the dawn of the new year.
Feel like going all out? Put your name on the waiting list for the
``Around the World Millennium Expedition by Private Jet'' offered
by Seattle's TCS Expeditions. Having paid about $45,000 each,
passengers are whisked to the Polynesian island of Tonga to be one
of the first to see the dawn of the new year and then fly on to
Western Samoa, one of the last places to welcome 2000. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Purists argue the only place to start a day, New Year's or
otherwise, is in Greenwich, England, home of the prime meridian,
the degree line from which longitude east and west is measured.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You gave us advice on how to preserve a Lance Armstrong
Wheaties cereal box. What about a collectible model or toy with a
battery inside of it? Keep it or not? Will it affect its
collectibility?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wayne Z.
</P>
<P>
   A: Remove the battery before acid leaks out and ruins the toy,
says Chris Noah of Hog Wild Toys. Store collectible toys in a cool,
dry place. Q: Please tell me and others how to prune rosebushes and
when to fertilize them. _ Charles Kaase
</P>
<P>
   A: Minor pruning is done every time you cut a rose from the
bush, notes rose show judge and member of the American Rose Society
Don Freeman. Cuts should be made just above a set of leaves or you
risk causing disease in the plant. Major pruning (2/3 reduction in
the size of the bush) is done annually in February. However, if the
bush seems too tall to weather winter winds, Freemen advises taking
about 1/3 off the height of the bush now.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting ready to carol in the Lone Star State, newcomers?
Don't leave home without the words to the ``Twelve Days of
Christmas, Texas Style'': ``On the 12th day of Christmas, my true
love gave to me ... 12 bulls-a-snorting, 11 tumbleweeds
(weeds-a-tumblin'?), 10 politicians, 9 horned toads, 8 Dallas
Cowboys, 7 buckin' broncos, 6 bluebonnets, 5 mockingbirds, 4
prickly pears, 3 oil wells, 2 pairs of spurs and an armadillo in an
oak tree.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Time for gift-giving games, readers. For a copy of the Night
before Christmas game, send me a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
Each participant brings an inexpensive gift. Players stand in a
circle while a moderator reads a text in which ``right'' and
``left'' often appear. Gifts are passed accordingly until the story
ends. Here is a snippet (Clement Moore, forgive us): ``He spoke not
a word but went RIGHT to his work, and filled all the stockings;
then turned with a jerk; and laying his finger to the LEFT of his
nose, and giving a nod....'' No one, of course, leaves with the
gift he brought.

   MURRAY30-COLUMN _ PARIS _ Sitting in a railroad station, got a
ticket for my destination ... I was humming an old Simon and
Garfunkel tune and wishing I could remember the words. This is the
Gare de Lyon, which, as best as I can figure, roughly translates as
``Look out for Leon.'' And who is this Leon I should guard against?
I wasn't sure until I was getting out of the taxi. There he was, a
little guy, all smiles, with a buggy for our luggage already in
place at the trunk of the taxi. (Murray, Cox Newspapers). MOVED.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Smile sweetly, I was taught.
Learn to cook if you can, and never put starch in your husband's
shorts. If you play nice, you'll live happily ever after with a man
who will smooth life's rough edges for you. Those were the rules
for millions of women my age now functioning in a limbo land of
semi-liberated females who, though quite capable of fixing toilets
and paying taxes, still miss marriage. We feel sad driving
expressways alone and knowing that if we make a wrong turn, no one
will notice when we're late for supper. Or if we never show up at
all. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

with juice. It looks like a good crop this year. (Lane, Daytona

   MURRAY30-COLUMN _ PARIS _ Sitting in a railroad station, got a
ticket for my destination ... I was humming an old Simon and
Garfunkel tune and wishing I could remember the words. This is the
Gare de Lyon, which, as best as I can figure, roughly translates as
``Look out for Leon.'' And who is this Leon I should guard against?
I wasn't sure until I was getting out of the taxi. There he was, a
little guy, all smiles, with a buggy for our luggage already in
place at the trunk of the taxi. (Murray, Cox Newspapers). MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Smile sweetly, I was taught.
Learn to cook if you can, and never put starch in your husband's
shorts. If you play nice, you'll live happily ever after with a man
who will smooth life's rough edges for you. Those were the rules
for millions of women my age now functioning in a limbo land of
semi-liberated females who, though quite capable of fixing toilets
and paying taxes, still miss marriage. We feel sad driving
expressways alone and knowing that if we make a wrong turn, no one
will notice when we're late for supper. Or if we never show up at
all. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The orange crop is coming in
early. The fruit that survived summer's scorching heat, the winds
of two hurricanes, marauding middle-schoolers and a back yard rife
with destructive mutant insect life are glowing, yellow and bulging
with juice. It looks like a good crop this year. (Lane, Daytona
Beach News-Journal) MOVED

 &HT;    Broadcasters can rerun, but they can't hide
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the Peacock crows, if you haven't seen it,
it's new to you. Conversely, if you have seen it, it's a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast networks want to keep you guessing.
</P>
<P>
   In January they say they'll drop the (R) designation they now
supply to TV listing services and publications like TV Guide.
Network executives argue that cable channels don't flag reruns, so
why should they? With viewers abandoning the networks in
ever-increasing numbers, executives don't want to put an exit sign
over their own doors.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Swanson, president of the watchdog group Viewers for
Quality Television, calls this ``a disservice to the viewer.'' In
an age of ever-expanding information, less information does seem
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have been talking about axing the (R) for years,
but they reached the breaking point this fall when USA Network
began airing repeats of NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit''
less than two weeks after the original airdate without an (R).
Ditto Lifetime's same-week repeats of ABC's ``Once and Again.'' The
networks, which cut deals with the cable networks for the reruns to
offset production costs, felt the cable channels should have
designated the episodes as repeats. But the cable networks said the
programs were new to their channels and therefore new to their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do cable channels, which came to life on the strength of
network reruns, alert viewers to multiple repeats of original
series such as ``The Sopranos'' and ``South Park.'' Syndicated
series such as ``Baywatch Hawaii'' keep their reruns secret, too.
</P>
<P>
   So the networks feel disadvantaged and plan to change. They
haven't agreed on a uniform plan, but one network executive favors
an (O) instead of an (R).
</P>
<P>
   ``My solution is to designate originals. Everything else would
not have a designation,'' says David Poltrack, senior vice
president of research and marketing at CBS. ``That way cable people
wouldn't have to label everything R. They'd just need to apply it
(an (O)) to their first-run originals.''
</P>
<P>
   If the other networks decide to drop all designations, the
viewers most affected will be ``appointment viewers,'' people who
rush home to catch an episode of ``Law &AMP; Order'' or religiously set
their VCRs for certain programs. They don't want to rush home for a
rerun. But most people aren't appointment viewers. They just plop
down and start flipping. They watch something new and sometimes
something old.
</P>
<P>
   Sitcoms do well in reruns, retaining 70 percent to 80 percent of
their original audience. Last summer, ``Friends'' finished at the
top of the Nielsens, just as it has this fall. Dramas don't do as
well, sometimes retaining little more than half their audience.
Repeats of TV movies and miniseries fare even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Reruns, of course, are a fact of life and an economic necessity.
Even in the earliest days of TV, series never aired year-round.
Some shows, like ``Playhouse 90,'' had 30 episodes a year and then
were replaced by another show. ``Gunsmoke'' had 39 originals and 13
repeats, always designated as reruns.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, when production costs began to rise and the
all-important ``sweeps'' months were instituted, it became
necessary to insert reruns during the regular season to have enough
originals for the May sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Skyrocketing costs in the early '80s whittled the number of
originals from 28 or 30 down to the current 22. That means lots of
reruns long before summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the networks decide to drop all designations or use an
(O), viewers may still get the (R) from listings services and TV
Guide. That's because these services have their own databases and
can tell from episode titles and descriptions if a program is a
rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would serve the viewers better by going with the
`Original,''' Poltrack says. ``That would allow the viewer to know
if the shows are ones they've seen or ones they just might have
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing research indicating viewers don't see as many first-run
episodes a year as they think they do _ probably less than half the
typical 22-episode run each season _ Poltrack figures ``the
probability is equal that the repeat is one they haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the networks adopt CBS's plan and switch from (R) to (O),
this whole flap will have been much ado about absolutely nothing.
Only the truly dull will not realize that a title without the (O)
is a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   But if the (R) is dropped and the (O) isn't added, listings
publications will add the (R) anyway _ thus leaving the networks
with a big (F) for fool on their faces.

 &HT;    MOST MAJOR RIVERS SAID TO BE SERIOUSLY DEGRADED
 &HT;    With RIVERS. Repeating a story first moved in advance last
Wednesday.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than half of the world's major rivers are
seriously depleted and polluted, contributing substantially to the
world's rising population of ``environmental refugees,'' an
international commission reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From China's huge Yellow River, so overused that it dried up for
226 days in 1997, to America's Colorado, major rivers are being
drained and polluted to an unprecedented degree, the World
Commission on Water for the 21st Century said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will issue a full report in March. It is funded
by the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World
Bank, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the Organization
of American States.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary news is good for only four major rivers,
according to the commission. Classified as ``healthy'' are the
Amazon in South America, the Congo in Africa, the St. Lawrence in
North America and the Mekong in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Unless ``drip irrigation'' and other more efficient ways of
using water are employed and pollution reduced, the world will have
trouble meeting the needs of farming, economic development and
drinking water needs when 2 billion people are added to the current
population of 6 billion by the middle of the next century, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has to significantly increase water productivity
while at the same time restoring the world's damaged rivers if we
are to have any hope of meeting the water needs of 8 billion
people, while protecting the environment,'' said Ismail Serageldin,
a World Bank vice president who serves as chairman of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Other river systems singled out in the preliminary report
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Amu Darya and Syr Darya in Russia and Kazakhstan. Overused
for irrigation and polluted by fertilizer runoff, the two rivers'
flow into the Aral Sea has been reduced by three-fourths. This led
to a catastrophic, 53-foot drop in the sea's level between 1962 and
1994 and can be directly related to the increase in infant
mortality, now the highest of all regions of the former Soviet
Union. The two rivers were judged ``very unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The small but historic Jordan River. Crucial to desert
economies of the Middle East, the river can no longer meet the
needs of people and environment. Just one-third of its natural flow
now reaches the Dead Sea, which is slowly disappearing. It is an
unhealthy river, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   - The Nile. More than 90 percent of the Nile's natural flow is
used by irrigation or lost due to evaporation in reservoirs. What
reaches the Mediterranean Sea is heavily polluted by irrigation
drainage and industrial and municipal waste. It is deemed
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   - The St. Lawrence. Cooperation by the United States and Canada
have done much to restore the river, but even though it now is
classified as healthy, problems remain. Airborne pollutants and
accumulated toxic substances mean that when beluga whales die and
wash ashore, their poisonous carcasses must be disposed of in
hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   - The Murray-Darling River in Australia. Heavy irrigation and
pollution by agricultural runoff led in the 1970s to severe
pollution problems that threatened domestic water supplies for much
of southern Australia. A national commission was established to
manage the river and work for its restoration. Although still
classified as an unhealthy waterway, the Murray-Darling is coming
back.

A TAXING TALE OF A DISABLED VETERAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Susan Fitzpatrick thought her tax problem
was settled.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service told Fitzpatrick, a former Marine,
that she shouldn't be paying taxes on her disability income from
the Department of Defense. The IRS then said it was going to cut
her a check for $11,000 for taxes she paid the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed, right? Not in the least.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Finance and Accounting Service, which issues
retirement checks for military retirees, didn't fall in line with
the IRS. Instead, the defense agency maintains that, as far as it's
concerned, Fitzpatrick's income is taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Her nearly yearlong odyssey through the cubicles of the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service, the Pentagon and the IRS is replete
with contradictions, confusions and obscure subsections of federal
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never dreamed it would have been this tough,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   By most everyone's account, if Fitzpatrick has been paying taxes
when the IRS says she shouldn't, there are doubtless other veterans
in the same boat who may not know it. No one knows how many that
could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the possibility this could affect others,'' said
Zanell Osowski, a spokeswoman for the defense finance agency in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts early this year when Fitzpatrick, a Marine of
14 years who retired on disability, read the fine print on her
10-99R tax form.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``disability retirement'' as nontaxable leaped out at
Fitzpatrick, a former Marine liaison at Bell Helicopter and now a
stay-at-home mom in far north Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick was retired in 1995 by a team of doctors who
believed that her migraines and her myasthenia gravis, which causes
progressive muscular weakness, made her unfit for duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called DFAS immediately,'' she said, hoping the matter would
be cleared up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick said she was given a variety of explanations by the
defense finance agency as to why her disability pay was taxable.
Regardless of the reason, she was told, she did not fit the
criteria for nontaxable status.
</P>
<P>
   The defense finance agency wasn't swayed when she received a
letter from the IRS telling her that she was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter reflects an IRS determination concerning Ms.
Fitzpatrick's personal tax liability,'' Osowski said. ``The letter
does not indicate any change in DFAS' responsibility to report the
disability retired pay as income.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement is caused by the agencies' use of different
regulations to determine taxability. The defense finance agency
cites the Defense Department Financial Management Regulation; the
Pentagon cites the U.S. Federal Code; and the IRS uses the Internal
Revenue Code. The wording, while similar, differs in each.
</P>
<P>
   Until Fitzpatrick receives a rating from the Department of
Veterans Affairs designating how disabled she is, the Pentagon says
her income is taxable. She has applied for VA benefits this year in
order to get that rating.
</P>
<P>
   But Richie Heidenreich, a spokesman for the IRS in Dallas,
seemed troubled that his agency's determination could not help
Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me is that she has a letter that says
it is not taxable, so I don't understand the reason for the
argument,'' Heidenreich said. ``But I know of no way we can force
the Department of Defense or Department of Energy or any other
government agency to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Van Riper, the Tarrant County Veterans Service Officer,
also seemed incredulous that Fitzpatrick, and probably others, are
paying taxes needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever run across a situation like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm has stepped in on behalf of Fitzpatrick and two
other Texans who have similar questions, asking the IRS and defense
finance lawyers to provide him an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense finance agency, Osowski said, is ``now looking
at the big picture'' and has referred the issue to the Armed Forces
Tax Council for a review of current procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS asked Fitzpatrick to submit amended tax returns for
1995, 1996 and 1997 and 1998, and refunded her taxes. And until the
situation is resolved, the IRS says she needs to send a copy of the
IRS letter with any future tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick is in perhaps the rare position of praising the IRS,
which she said was ``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say the same for DFAS,'' she said. ``My
frustration with DFAS is that all I need really to make the system
work is a corrected 10-99. But they report to the IRS that every
penny I receive is taxable income.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who wants an IRS opinion on whether his military
disability income is nontaxable, write to the Internal Revenue
Service Taxpayer Advocate's Office, 1100 Commerce St., Mail Code
1005, Dallas, TX 75242.

MANY PROTESTANTS IN ULSTER ACCEPT A SHARING OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ While the party that represents most
Protestants in Northern Ireland was approving a deal to share power
with people who once used bombs and bullets to make the place
ungovernable, its hard-line rivals were gathering on the outskirts
of this old Victorian city to denounce what they call treachery.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of venues Saturday was telling.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists gathered at the Waterfront Hall, a
glistening, modern concert hall on the River Lagan that has so much
glass it would have been considered folly to construct it before
the peace process blossomed with the paramilitary cease-fires of
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Rev. Ian Paisley's smaller, more hard-line
Democratic Unionists gathered at La Mon House Hotel, where 12
Protestants were killed by an IRA bomb in 1978. Paisley, a
fundamentalist preacher, invoked God's wrath on David Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist leader, describing him as a liar and a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants who want to retain Northern Ireland's union with
Britain are at a crossroads. But as the choice of venues on
Saturday showed, while some want to focus on the promise of the
future, others find it impossible to let go of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Saturday by the Ulster Unionists to drop their
insistence that the Irish Republican Army begin disarming before
they share power with Irish Catholic nationalists, including
members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, marked a sea change
in unionist thinking. It was a political manifestation of a growing
confidence among Protestants here.
</P>
<P>
   When it was created by fiat in 1920 by a British government that
drew a border to ensure a population of 1.5 million that was loyal
to the British crown, Northern Ireland was what one of its leaders
once proclaimed ``a Protestant state for a Protestant people.''
</P>
<P>
   But demographic changes, a growing Catholic middle class, a
British government that acknowledges there was institutional
discrimination against Catholics, and an increasingly secular
society make that an empty claim today. Catholic nationalists, even
republicans who supported violence to overthrow British rule,
realized that some years ago, and adopted a more moderate,
conciliatory stance.
</P>
<P>
   Now a growing number of Protestant unionists are doing the same,
accepting that the old days are lost and gone forever, that their
future is best served by creating a Northern Ireland that
accommodates Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 80 years, accommodating Catholic nationalists and
maintaining the union with Britain were considered mutually
exclusive goals by the vast majority of Protestants. But a growing
number of unionists are becoming, like Trimble's political tactics,
increasingly pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of marginalizing nationalists who aspire to unity with
the Irish Republic, many unionists now seek to convince them that
their rights and aspirations will be respected, and their living
standard higher, if Northern Ireland remains part of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Power-sharing, long considered the most effective way to address
the grievances of Catholics, is to begin in earnest this week as 10
people are nominated for seats in the Cabinet that will administer
local government for the first time since 1972. Among them will be
two members of Sinn Fein, including Martin McGuinness, once the
IRA's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   It galls most Protestants that the man who once directed what
they saw as a terrorist campaign aimed at driving them from the
island will now help run a democratically elected government. The
IRA had a different view of what it considered a war of
self-determination against British rule.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Protestants, such as Michael and Heather
Bambrick, accept power-sharing as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bambrick, an accountant, and his wife are about to
launch a new business together. They have four children between the
ages of 4 and 11 and live in Holywood, a comfortable Belfast
suburb. They heartily supported the decision to let Sinn Fein into
government, and believe that political stability will change
everything in Northern Ireland for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the changes in attitude you see among the Protestant
and unionist people are about confidence,'' said Bambrick. ``It
takes bravery and confidence to put on a different set of
spectacles and try to understand what different people aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Lee, 37, who drives a breakdown assistance car for the
Royal Automobile Club, spent his life in a middle-class section of
East Belfast, which is staunchly unionist and entirely Protestant.
He said the Troubles never really touched him, although it was only
because he got delayed that he was not at the nearby La Mon House
Hotel attending the function that was bombed 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lee voted for the Good Friday Agreement that calls for power
sharing and for cross-border authorities that will oversee areas of
mutual interest on the island. He is not threatened by closer links
to the Irish Republic, and believes enough Catholics can be
reassured to retain the link with Britain indefinitely. He also
supports the compromise that lets Sinn Fein into government on the
promise that the IRA will turn in weapons later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' he said, ``but we've got to move forward.
We can't go back to the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   By sheer demographics, there is no going back to the old days,
said Tim Pat Coogan, who came to Belfast this month to write a new
epilogue to his book ``The IRA.'' Coogan argued that Catholics, who
now make up about 43 percent of the population, will overtake
Protestants as a majority in Northern Ireland within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many unionists dispute the demographic changes Coogan and others
claim will change the balance of power here over the next
generation. But even they acknowledge that as the percentage of the
Catholic population rises, their task is to convince enough
nationalists that, like the 6 million Irish people living in
England, they can be Irish and live happily in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said his party ``recognizes and accepts that it is
legitimate for nationalists to pursue their political objective of
a united Ireland by consent through exclusively peaceful and
democratic methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Consent is the critical word. For most of this century, Irish
republicans refused to accept that they needed to seek that
consent, and unionists considered it treasonous to give such a
prospect legitimacy. But that has all changed.
</P>
<P>
   For all the doomsaying by the likes of Paisley, who says
Northern Ireland is being destroyed by concessions to the IRA, the
place has never looked better. New hotels, pubs, and restaurants
have sprung up in Belfast and beyond. At 7 percent, unemployment
has been almost halved in the past 15 years and is at its lowest
levels ever.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of traditional industries like textiles and
shipbuilding have been more than made up for by the emergence of
software, pharmaceuticals, and telephone-based service industries,
according to Jill Heron of the Department for Economic Development.
Heron said some investors have hung back, waiting to see where the
peace process was going. If the political stability promised last
week is realized, new investment, especially in tourism, will
follow, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many problems remain. The segregation of Catholics and
Protestants in housing and education remains almost total. But
there is a growing sense that they are all in it together, Trimble
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Lamont, head of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce,
agreed, and is backing Trimble's attempt to make official the
pledge ``to promote mutual respect and tolerance rather than
division and alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   If unionists once derided the Republic of Ireland as a
priest-ridden economic basket case, they now want to emulate its
``Celtic Tiger'' economy, the most vibrant in Europe in the 1990s.
Like other business leaders here, Lamont believes political
stability will bring enormous investment.
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, he said, expressing the newfound confidence,
``Northern Ireland can make the Celtic Tiger look like a kitten.''

WOUNDED SOLDIERS TELL OF RUSSIAN INEPTITUDE

<P>
   ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia _ The 10 men in Sergeant Alexander
Levenkov's unit, draftees near the very end of their two-year hitch
in the Russian Army, had almost made it safely through the war in
Chechnya when everything went very badly wrong last week.
</P>
<P>
   First, their armored personnel carrier broke down on a steep
hill near the frontier with the southern Russian region of
Dagestan, forcing them to call for a slower moving, defenseless
truck to get them out. Then, Chechen guerrillas attacked from
somewhere nearby. Levenkov never saw them; he just knew they were
not supposed to be there. And then the explosions hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, the guys
were lying everywhere,'' Levenkov, 21, recalled Wednesday. ``Some
were stuck in the truck. Someone was saying on the radio we were
under mortar attack. Then I lost sense of time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of story many Russian soldiers tell after
returning from combat in Chechnya: a tale of faulty equipment and
outdated weapons, confusion on the ground, and an unseen enemy that
launches deadly surprise attacks, seemingly whenever and wherever
it chooses. While soldiers in all armies grumble, these stories
sound remarkably like the ones that Russian soldiers told after the
failed campaign in Chechnya in 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after launching a withering artillery and air assault
in Chechnya, Russia says it is winning its campaign to wipe out
separatist militants it calls ``terrorists.'' The offensive has
flattened villages, killed hundreds of civilians, and forced more
than 200,000 to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders confidently predict victory by the end of
the year, and jubilant politicians speak about the ``revival of the
Russian Army.'' The Russian public seems glad to have something to
celebrate after years of post-Soviet setbacks. And most people say
they believe their soldiers are fighting the good fight by wiping
out Islamic rebels who twice invaded neighboring Dagestan this
summer and whom Russian leaders blame for bombings that killed 300
people in Russia in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the stories that Russian soldiers themselves tell contrast
sharply with the heroic images and upbeat reports of Russia's main
television stations, where most of the country gets its
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they are telling you on TV is a children's
cartoon,'' Levenkov said from his hospital bed in the southern
Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, where he is recovering from wounds
to his legs and arms suffered in the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the lead Chechnya story on the television news was
the daring escape and dramatic rescue of a Russian aviator whose
Su-24 jet was shot down by a shoulder-fired missle on Oct. 4. At a
press conference in the Russian military's main staging center in
Mozdok, Russian air force Lieutenant Sergei Smyslov described how
he ejected from the plane, then evaded rebel fighters hunting him
for several weeks. Although he was captured and threatened by
execution by a rebel commander, Smyslov was eventually freed and
escorted out by local villagers. The report finished by saying
Smyslov was awarded a medal for heroism.
</P>
<P>
   But for each Smyslov, there are dozens like Yury Toichkin, a
sniper from Kursk region in southern Russia, who made a recruit's
mistake _ he said he forgot to turn off his night-vision goggles
while on a reconnaisance mission _ and paid for it with a bullet in
his right hip.
</P>
<P>
   As he rested in the Rostov hospital, in a cast from his right
toe to his chest, Toichkin said Russia is right to be in Chechnya,
but wrong about the way the war is being fought.
</P>
<P>
   The generals ``said that if the army goes into Chechnya, they'll
give us the latest weapons, but what they gave us was old and
falling apart,'' Toichkin said. He said he carried three grenades
in order to be sure at least one would work when he needed it. One
tank in his unit had to be towed into battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd drag it in, then drag it back out again, then they'd
put it there on the front line as a prop, for looks,'' Toichkin
said. ``This is how we go to war _ with tanks as props, to fight.
The Chechens have better weapons than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia makes the best weapons in the world. Where are they?''
Toichkin said. His conclusion: Someone in the Russian leadership is
dumping old weapons and making money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Toichkin described a moment when his unit, the 245th Motor-Rifle
Brigade, had a group of Chechen guerrillas surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we never got the order to shoot, and so they got away,''
he said. ``That happens a lot. . . . I wish'' the Russian press
``would write what we are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years after withdrawing from Chechnya in humiliation,
Russian forces have claimed success after success since returning
to the breakaway region in September. The military has advanced
quickly to the outskirts of the capital, Grozny, and taken large
chunks of territory without serious resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But the military has lost over 2,000 men dead and wounded, and
has yet to engage in a major battle with the rebels. The Russian
generals say they have learned their lessons from the last war, and
are bombarding the lightly armed Chechens from a distance rather
than engaging them in close combat. Unable to respond, the rebels
have retreated without offering major resistance. Some towns have
surrendered without a fight. But the conflict does not end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we clean out a village, but the next day the fighters
are back dressed as refugees,'' Levenkov said. ``They shoot us in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the attacks come in places the soldiers have already
cleared of guerrillas. Private Nikolai Zolotaryov, 20, was standing
on a ridge near Chechnya's western frontier, which had been long
under Russian control, when a sniper shot him and two comrades in
the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving our position. We sat on our troop carrier and
then there was a report and someone yelled, `Who is shooting? Who
is shooting?' '' said Zolotaryov. ``But who there ever knows who is
shooting?''
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts are increasingly raising the possibility
that Russia will suffer heavy losses in a protracted guerrilla war
as the rebels retreat to the mountains in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the poorly equipped Russian units will suffer
in the winter weather.
</P>
<P>
   If the casualties continue to mount, public support for the war
may turn sour. It already has for Ludmila Saveleyeva, whose son
Vadim, 19, had both legs amputated at the knee after suffering
shrapnel wounds on a ridge overlooking Grozny. A Chechen guerrilla
sneaked past two Russian lookouts who had fallen asleep and managed
to drop a grenade in Vadin's trench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have to kill off young men? How long can this go
on?'' Savelyeva said. ``They told him he was going on a monthlong
tour. They didn't say he would be serving three months. Why do they
need to fool people? Why do they need to take our children there?''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six of them, all attorneys, gathered around a
conference table strewn with brownbag lunches and store-bought
salads. They spanned a wide spiritual divide _ a Methodist
minister, a traditional Buddhist, a Zen practitioner, a mystical
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Their monthly luncheon followed a familiar pattern: warm
greetings and casual chat flowed into a free-ranging discussion on
a chosen topic. One fall Friday afternoon, the issue was
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Facial expressions grew thoughtful as Douglas Reynolds, a senior
partner at a leading Boston law firm, offered a quote he heard not
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, he said to the five attorneys seated with him in a
meeting room at Suffolk Law School, is ``giving up all hope of a
better past.''
</P>
<P>
   From this, a question arose. How can lawyers teach their clients
forgiveness in a legal system that encourages aggrieved parties to
settle their differences in court?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trained in law school to disregard any human problem
that can't be litigated,'' said Edmund Robinson, a lawyer and
ordained Methodist minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at clients in the context of their whole lives
and mindsets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves holistic lawyers, a description that would
strike the more cynical as the ultimate oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to bring deeper meaning to a profession widely
derided as morally bankrupt, they meet once a month over
plastic-wrapped sandwiches and take-out meals, discussing ways to
bring healing and humanism to the legal world.
</P>
<P>
   They range from academics to solo practitioners to attorneys at
big corporate firms, but they share common traits: a spirituality
they long to bring to their professional lives, and both a passion
for and quiet disillusionment with the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some within our group would probably call us preventative
lawyers,'' said group cofounder Cheryl Conner, a former federal
prosecutor who now teaches law at Suffolk. ``Lawyers who want to
understand the root causes of conflict and legal
misunderstandings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mentality out there that lawyers are sharks out to
hurt people and get their money,'' said attorney Rita Pollak, a
family law practitioner and the group's other cofounder. ``This
group is a counterbalance to that view.''
</P>
<P>
   That there is a crisis of the heart within the legal profession
is well documented. Study upon study and poll after poll have found
that growing numbers of lawyers are profoundly troubled by the
changing practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   Their discontent has many sources: the competitive ruthlessness
that has accompanied the bar's growing ranks; the toll lawyering
can take on the personal lives of attorneys; and the industry's
``billable hour mania,'' as Reynolds puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But among the members of this group, concern runs deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a crisis of the soul'' in the legal profession, said
Marisa Pizzuto, an Andover family law practitioner. ``People
practicing for years and years are getting trapped by golden
handcuffs . . . finding themselves very empty inside.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``a lot of lawyers have come to the conclusion that
it's painful to practice if you're a spiritual person,'' Pizzuto
said. ``And there's a presumption that if you're a lawyer you don't
have any spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers are suffering,'' said Conner. ``They're suffering, and
we should ask if how we're practicing law is part of the reason for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The group grew out of a conference last year on whether lawyers
could be guided by spiritual values. The outpouring of interest was
so strong, Conner said, that a ``holistic lawyers'' group was born.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which has met monthly for more than a year, has
become a seedbed for other reform-minded programs, including a
seminar on the role of judges in encouraging civility, and a
conference on restorative justice.
</P>
<P>
   At their gatherings, where attendance can range from a handful
to more than a dozen, group members explore ways to avoid needless
confrontation: mediating rather than litigating or, in the case of
warring spouses, encouraging clients to listen without becoming
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   They also urge one another to try to understand the emotions
motivating their clients' actions and reactions. Could, for
example, a divorcing client's desire to lash out at her husband
stem from her fear that divorce will leave her destitute?
</P>
<P>
   Membership is informal, although some participants worry that
the word ``holistic'' may make potential recruits wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply for public relations purposes, I have reservations
about the name,'' said Robinson. ``The word holistic has a new-agey
connotation that makes people skeptical, and lawyers are some of
the most skeptical people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A better description of the group, he suggested, is ``lawyering
with a heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the state's 42,000 lawyers take a more hard-headed
approach. After all, only six of them showed up for this month's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we're going to change the structure of the legal
profession overnight,'' said Robinson. Still, for Reynolds, 52, who
left Peabody &AMP; Arnold last week without a new job to go to, the
group has offered reassurance that his decision to step away from
lawyering is the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten validation that what I think is missing, there are
others who also think it's missing,'' he said.

BIG TOBACCO CHANGES TUNE TO STOP FDA 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of downplaying smoking's dangers,
cigarette makers plan to argue before the Supreme Court this week
that the Food and Drug Administration has no right to police the
industry because tobacco products are too deadly for the FDA to
regulate.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case with sweeping public health implications, the
$50 billion industry is keeping its Marlboro Man image out of the
courtroom and expressing a new corporate motto that is emblazoned
on Philip Morris's Web site: ``There is no `safe' cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout is pivotal to the industry's attempt to thwart the
FDA, which claimed jurisdiction over tobacco products in 1996 after
concluding that nicotine is a drug and cigarettes are drug-delivery
devices.
</P>
<P>
   With the FDA poised to alter the way cigarettes are marketed and
sold in the 21st century, the court is weighing the industry's
complaint that the Clinton administration exceeded its legal
authority in permitting the FDA to assert control over tobacco
products. Both sides are scheduled to present oral arguments
Wednesday, and the court is expected to issue a ruling early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers plan to argue that if the FDA prevails in court
the agency will have no choice but to ban the sale of cigarettes
because the law requires the FDA to regulate only drugs that are
``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back to whether we are safe and effective,'' an
industry official said last week in a briefing with reporters on
the condition that he not be identified. ``We are not safe and
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry contends that only Congress has the power to
abridge the rights of adults to buy dangerous tobacco products and
has chosen instead to require safety warnings and other
restrictions short of FDA intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant issue, whether an unelected bureaucrat
of the federal government can ban a legal product of a major
American industry,'' said Scott Williams, a spokesman for the five
largest tobacco manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the industry's disdain for the FDA's proposed
regulations, Williams derided the agency's finding that cigarettes
are drug-delivery devices. ``Saying a cigarette is a delivery
device is like saying ketchup is a vegetable,'' he said. ``It
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the FDA argues that the law provides exceptions
for the agency to regulate unsafe products such as tobacco rather
than ban them if it is in the public interest. And the FDA says it
has no intention of outlawing tobacco because ``the sudden
withdrawal from the market of products to which so many millions of
people are addicted would be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed regulations that President Clinton announced in
1996, the FDA has chiefly targeted the marketing and sales of
tobacco products to minors. Studies have shown that more than 90
percent of adult smokers started as minors, and more than 400,000
adults die each year of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Antitobacco advocates said the FDA's proposed campaign against
youth smoking is crucial to stemming what John R. Seffrin, head of
the American Cancer Society, called ``the 20th century's single
largest public health disaster.'' He and other advocates portrayed
the industry's talk of a possible ban on cigarettes as a scare
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's argument is designed to frighten the court into
saying the FDA can't act,'' said Matthew Myers, executive vice
president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``Without
FDA jurisdiction, we will still not have a nationwide set of rules
to make it difficult for children to purchase and obtain tobacco
products illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   The only FDA tobacco regulation that has taken effect requires
retailers to ask cigarette buyers who appear to be 27 or younger to
show identification proving they are at least 18.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's other proposed rules would ban cigarette vending
machines and self-service displays except in adults-only locations.
In addition, the FDA has proposed broad advertising, marketing, and
promotional restrictions on tobacco products, such as bans on
outdoor ads near schools and on sponsorship of sports events.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court in Greensboro, N.C., ruled in 1997 that
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 empowered the FDA to
regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco because nicotine is
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond
reversed the finding last year in a 2-1 decision. ``We do not
dispute that Congress has charged the FDA with protecting the
public health and that tobacco products present serious health
risks for the public,'' the court wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court accepted the industry's argument that
Congress effectively has reserved the right to oversee cigarette
makers and did not intend for the FDA to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the FDA has appropriated Congress's constitutional
authority to make major national policy,'' tobacco lawyers argued
in their written brief to the Supreme Court, citing the appeals
court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court challenge will take place a year after
cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states more than $200 billion
over 25 years to cover smoking-related health costs. The industry
also faces a $20 billion civil lawsuit by the Justice Department
and numerous class-action cases across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court upholds the Fourth Circuit ruling, ``the
case is over and there is nothing the FDA can do,'' an industry
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides expect to take their cases to Congress if
they lose in the Supreme Court, antitobacco groups said a defeat
for the FDA could be crushing, particularly with little chance of
major action on Capitol Hill in the 2000 election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Myers said, ``you will not have seen the type
of fundamental change that will dramatically reduce the number of
Americans who die from tobacco.''

TEENS AND PURSUIT OF THE IDEAL BODY
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color graphic and a photo of some teenagers) 
 By MARILYN McMAHON 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swimsuit portion of the Miss America pageant may have become
a ''fitness'' contest, and Barbie dolls may be getting new, more
realistic proportions, but the body image that teens idealize
hasn't changed a whit.
</P>
<P>
   Most girls still want to be ''pretty and skinny,'' while most
boys want to be ''tall and strong,'' says Pamela Shires Sneddon,
author of ''Body Image: A Reality Check'' (Enslow Publishers, Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   With nine children of her own, Sneddon can claim a certain
amount of savvy about the younger generation. She and her husband,
Tom Sneddon, a district attorney in Santa Barbara, Calif., are the
parents of six boys and three girls, ranging in age from 11 to 30.
They have three grandchildren, with two more expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even she was surprised by the intensity of pressure on
today's teens to look good at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sneddon attributes this to a continuing emphasis on body image
in movies, television and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not surprising that eating disorders are the major
problem for teen-age girls,'' Sneddon said. ''Generally, the
articles that appear in magazines for girls project the same
message: Thin is beautiful, sexy is beautiful and appearance must
be beautiful. Still, it's genetically impossible for 90 percent of
American women to have the same bodies, no matter how much they
diet or exercise or how much plastic surgery they have.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pervasive media images of sleek, sexy women and strong,
powerful men, both boys and girls have a hard time with body image,
says Sneddon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned to appreciate what they have to deal with. In my
generation, we admired Audrey Hepburn, but we never tried to look
like her,'' she said. ''Today, the girls want to look like Cindy
Crawford, and the boys want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching the book, she had 100 students in family health
classes at Santa Barbara Junior High School fill out questionnaires
about physical appearance _ theirs and others. Students were asked
to list external and internal traits of an attractive boy and an
attractive girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to find out what the kids thought,'' Sneddon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to rate what was most important in personal appearance,
''pretty'' received the most votes among girls, followed closely by
''skinny or thin'' and ''somewhat thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys admire ''tall'' males, who are ''muscular,'' ''strong'' and
''somewhat thin.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe what an attractive person looks like,
comments included:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''A tall female with blond hair and blue or green
eyes,'' said Adam, 13.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Christy Turlington _ not too fat, but not too skinny.
Full figured,'' said Ophelia, 13.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''A strong, athletic person who likes to do things, not
sit around,'' said Grant, 12.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Tall, skinny, cute,'' said Anna, 12.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Strong, tall, athletic,'' said James, 12.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Has curves (not skinny and flat like girls in
magazines), somewhat thin, how their eyes, lips, etc. flow with
their body and face,'' said Alyssa, 12.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Boy teen-ager with good abs and muscles; girl, thin
teen-ager,'' said Manual, 12.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ''Female, nice, funny, voluptuous, not very short hair,
not that thin, not that big, not too tall, not too short. FINE!''
said Josh, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sneddon, who also wrote ''Brothers and Sisters: Born to
Bicker?'', researched her latest book by surfing the Internet,
interviewing experts around the country via telephone, watching
videos and scouring books, magazines and scholarly publications.
</P>
<P>
   She paid particular attention to magazines that appealed to
teens _ Glamour, Seventeen, Elle, Surfing, Sports Illustrated _ and
found that those for females focused on appearance while magazines
for males were action-oriented, focusing on sports and other
activities and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sneddon quotes syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman:
''A generation ago, the average model weighed 8 percent less than
the average woman. Now, she weighs 23 percent less.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially pervasive are television messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see all these people on TV, and they look so happy and
thin, and they make you feel like you should be that way _ not just
to feel good, but to get men or women,'' said a 17-year-old
Wisconsin high school student Sneddon quotes in her book.
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of celebrities like talk show host Rosie
O'Donnell and actress Camryn Manheim, Sneddon does detect some
hopeful signs for the future. Large-size models are in demand for
clothing catalogs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope attitudes are changing, but I know my 11-year-old
daughter and her friends are concerned about their weight,''
Sneddon said. ''Some girls think of anorexia and bulimia as
positive behavior. One of my daughters told me she would have tried
them, but she didn't have the willpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Sneddon found that the pressure to be thin is
something girls place upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think boys want them to be thin, but this isn't so,'' she
said. ''African-American women don't have the same issue about
weight, and African-American men appreciate larger women.''
</P>
<P>
   If teen-age girls have hang-ups about weight, the boys have
their own problem _ a desire to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or
Sylvester Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The modern cultural emphasis on bodybuilding has produced more
men and boys with a negative body image,'' writes Sneddon in her
book.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to girls, however, boys want to put on more weight
rather than take it off. This can lead to steroid abuse.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Gary Wadler, one of the experts Sneddon
interviewed, steroid users are similar to victims of eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''One is the relentless pursuit of bigness, the other is the
relentless pursuit of thinness,'' he said. ''They're polar aspects
of the same problem. One result of this male pursuit of bigness may
be reverse anorexia, as men become compulsive exercisers or abusers
of steroids in trying to attain an otherwise unattainable ideal
body type.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has Sneddon wondering ''if our culture is going to
be as hard on boys as it has been on girls.''

PARENTS TURN TO TUTORS TO HELP KIDS WITH SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ RUSCH 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guerin Harris was a star pupil in kindergarten. But in first
grade his grades were all Bs and the teacher told his mother,
Rebecca, that Guerin wasn't reading well.
</P>
<P>
   After trying out extra sessions with a teacher and an
after-school study program, Harris, who lives in Evansville, Ind.,
found a solution that works: a tutor who helps Guerin with reading
at home once a week. The $100 a month is worth it Harris says.
''Diane is really attuned to my child and teaches in ways that
allow him to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Guerin brought home his first A+ on a reading test
''He was so proud of it,'' says his mother. ''Reading is still not
easy for him, but it's easier than it was before. He's even
starting to read things on his own now.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of parents around the country are turning
to tutors to guide children over bumps they may encounter in their
journey through school. Some students, like Guerin, meet with a
tutor at home, at the local library, or at school, while others
flock to commercial tutoring programs so they can get up to speed _
or get ahead _ academically.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is hiring a tutor,'' says Toks Fashola, Ph.D., an
associate research scientist at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore who studies after-school programs. ''A few years ago, the
families sending kids to tutors were those that had extra income.
Now families of all income levels and children of all skill levels
_ ahead, behind, and average _ see tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of kids tutored run in the low millions.
Sylvan Learning Systems, with 700 ''learning centers'' in all
states but Vermont serves more than 125,000 students each year.
Kumon Math &AMP; Reading Centers has 1,300 locations in 46 states and
tutors about 74,000 annually. Huntington Learning Center, with 195
branches in 33 states, reaches 45,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other kids meet with peer, volunteer, or private
tutors who charge up to $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Why the trend? There is a sense among parents that American
education is in crisis because of budget cuts and crowded
classrooms, Dr. Fashola says. ''Parents believe their children
aren't getting enough individual attention in school.''
</P>
<P>
   When sixth-grader Max Kramer sat down with tutor Anita Sande at
a Portland, Ore., library one Thursday afternoon, they worked on
long division. ''Anita works just with me, and that's what really
helps,'' says Max. ''In class the teacher can't spend an hour with
you when you don't get something.''
 &UR; More Practice Leads to More Learning &LR;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is after-school tutoring worth the millions of dollars and
hundreds of thousands of hours that families invest in it? In a
word, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tutoring works largely because of the intense focus that
one-on-one attention brings,'' says Timothy Shanahan, Ph.D.,
professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago,
who has reviewed more than 100 studies on tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Glass, Ph.D., associate dean of the college of education at
Arizona State University in Tempe, didn't think tutoring would make
such a difference when he set out with an economist at Stanford
University to find the most cost-effective way to boost learning.
''But tutoring rose to the top, above reducing class size and
lengthening the school year,'' says Dr. Glass. ''After a month of
daily 20-minute sessions, the average student gained two-and-a-half
months in reading grade levels and four-and-a-half months in math
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   A learning disability, dropping grades, or expressions of
concern from your child's teacher that he is falling behind in
specific skills might indicate the need for a tutor. If so, don't
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has this idea that kids will outgrow problems,'' Dr.
Shanahan says. ''That's not true for 70 percent of children. The
earlier you can catch an academic problem, the greater the chance
that you can do something about it.''
 &UR; Before Your Child Gets Help &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrange a meeting with your child and her teacher to define
concrete goals, suggests Nathan Naparstek, Ph.D., a psychologist
for the public schools in Schenectady, New York, and author of
''The Learning Solution: What to Do if Your Child Has Trouble With
Schoolwork.'' Involving your child can help her feel more in
control and engaged in the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Find out what your school has to offer. In a 1997 Public Agenda
poll, 87 percent of teachers said their schools can provide extra
help or tutoring. Some schools match children with peer tutors, a
practice that can be remarkably effective if the tutors are trained
and supervised. Or your school's principal may assign your child a
volunteer adult tutor, who also should be trained.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule a break between school and tutoring because kids need a
chance to relax and unwind after a day of classwork. Or try
scheduling early morning or weekend sessions.
</P>
<P>
   More parents than ever are turning to tutoring businesses to do
the job. They usually charge up to $45 an hour and claim rapid
learning results and high parental satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to tell if they deliver because no independent
research has been conducted on commercial programs. Before you
decide to sign on with a for-profit operation, ask to observe its
tutors at work. ''Some places just give kids worksheets that they
correct,'' says Dr. Naparstek. ''That is not tutoring.''
</P>
<P>
   A tutoring session in reading may include reading aloud,
discussion of what was read, and writing. Math tutoring may include
computation, discussion of methods, and hands-on activities that
help a child understand the underlying concepts
</P>
<P>
   ''For an hour-long session, you should see activities change
three to five times,'' says Dr. Shanahan. In several tutoring
businesses, like Sylvan and Huntington, one tutor generally works
with two or three students at once. 'Three-to-one is not as good as
one-on-one,'' says Dr. Naparstek. 'With three children in a
45-minute tutoring session, each child may get only 10 minutes of
real assistance.''
 &UR; What Makes a Tutor Top-Notch? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good tutor does not tell students directly how to improve.
Mark Lepper, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Stanford
University in California, discovered this after observing dozens of
experienced tutors of elementary school students. Rather, when a
child gets stuck, the tutor poses questions. For example, when one
child added 36 and 36 and got 126, the tutor asked, ''Now, how did
you get that 6?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Good tutors draw information and learning out of students,''
explains Dr. Lepper. ''Students who are more actively involved in
figuring things out are more likely to remember what they learn.''
Even when it takes six or seven questions before a child grasps a
point, an effective tutor keeps posing more specific, leading
questions rather than telling the student the answer. Look for a
tutor who encourages your child to think.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled tutors spend more time building rapport with students,
Dr. Lepper observes. They use this information to design activities
a child will enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Tutoring is about much more than boosting grades. The best
tutors inspire a love of learning and build kids' self-confidence,
parents say.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, developing a child's sense of play and
excitement about doing academic work may yield the best
improvements in a child's skills and confidence. ''School has been
more fun now that I know I can do anything'' says Max Kramer. 'When
the teacher comes up with something I've never done before, I know
I can figure it out by using things I learned from Anita.''

SIAM 
Or the Woman Who Shot  a Man 
By Lily Tuck. The Overlook Press. 192 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The image of the displaced Westerner, suffering or bumbling
through foreign lands, is one of the great quick-trick themes of
modern English literature. Adrift in an exotic culture, the Lone
Ranger protagonist _ think of Conrad, Graham Greene, John le Carre
_ must rely on the familiar mercies and tyrannies of the West to
see him through. Our recognition of imperialism's failings has
taken this school to a new level of irony, where the trappings of
wealth or religion can be as cheap and lethal as bad food from a
street vendor. For narrative purposes, the alien backdrop ensures
the immediate interplay of certain elements crucial to a dynamic
plot, from dramatic tension to the enhanced character traits of an
emigre abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Tuck's spare, frightening little novel takes advantage of
these traditions, hovering around the compromised borders of
Thailand during the acceleration of the Vietnam War in 1967. The
author of two previous novels, including ``Interviewing Matisse, or
The Woman Who Died Standing Up,'' Tuck has a penchant for the
understated and the strange, both of which apply to ``Siam.'' Her
American at sea is a 25-year-old New Englander named Claire whose
new husband, James, is a US military adviser rebuilding Thailand's
infrastructure in preparation for the bombing of Vietnam. The
innocent daughter of a Harvard classics professor, Claire lands in
Bangkok in the first days of her marriage _ finding a shockingly
new world where the language of military secrets is no more
comprehensible than Thai intonations and verb forms. ``Falang
falang!'' cry the women on the taxi boats in Bangkok's canals as
Claire tries to join them; they are identifying her as a foreigner,
but the phrase carries with it a barbed-wire remove that Claire
won't dare to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to this cold milieu is Jim Thompson, an
entrepreneur in the silk industry whose disappearance early in
``Siam'' becomes the spectral presence around which Claire's
transformation takes place. Thompson's character is drawn from real
life, and this insinuation of history into fiction suggests the
creepy crossover reality of the novel _ where truth is no more
reliable than the imagination, where failures of communication have
as much to do with the heart as the tongue. Thompson is a
charismatic man who is kind to Claire when she and James attend a
dinner party at his home; he vanishes in Malaysia a few weeks
later, and his fate becomes Claire's obsession, as though his
absence itself is the black hole into which all losses and gains
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Learning her tenses and sing-song rhythms from her Thai language
instructor, Claire also holes up at the library, reading the
newspaper accounts of the search for Thompson along with
revisionist Thai history and US press reports of military bombings.
As Claire's fixation with Thompson grows, so does the spooky
ambience of ``Siam'' _ a Thai soldier fires a gun into a luncheon
crowd; a woman who was supposed to be Thompson's friend seems
complicit in his disappearance. The Bay of Siam, where Claire and
James go to swim, turns out to be a breeding ground for sharks;
when they see a native woman being raped on the beach, James drags
Claire away.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stark, white-walled environs of ``Siam,'' such
symbols begin to seem heavy-handed; searching for its identity, the
novel too often feels like bad Joan Didion trying to be Graham
Greene. It is most successful, of course, when it stays away from
both antecedents. What Tuck does with chilling finesse is create an
ominous world of disintegration, where Claire's
outsider-observations of an alien culture are eclipsed by what may
be her own personal fragmentation. In a Thailand overrun by
military advisers playing Truth or Dare, reality itself is up for
grabs; in Claire's increasingly solitary, alienated frame of
reference, time and space are malleable constructs. The achievement
of ``Siam'' is to mirror this dissolution in narrative form, so
that what contaminates Claire's fallen innocence finds its way into
the reader's world as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siam'' is an ominous, unsettling novel that is more
intellectually enticing than emotionally resonant; like Jim
Thompson's disappearance, it makes a great deal out of what isn't
there. This is often frustrating: In such a sparsely crafted
narrative world, Tuck must rely on external devices such as
newspaper accounts to further her plot, and such ploys often bear
the creak of off-stage contrivance. Her continual use of Claire's
efforts to master a foreign language, too, quickly reach their
finite potential as a metaphor of estrangement. As for why she
decided to take the denouement of her story and sling it into the
novel's subtitle, I am clueless; perhaps she wanted to underscore
what was always sure to be a less-than-happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   The American involvement in Southeast Asia was full of wounds
and crimes and mysterious legends, and ``Siam'' draws its shadow
territory from that treacherous past _ including a horrid incident
involving a monkey that I'd heard before, but could have done
without. That's the nature of this novel: Tuck's narrative gifts
are sort of creepily admirable. Containing all the consequences of
a cowboy war, her subtitle finale even has an anti-Gatsby twist to
it _ suggesting that innocence itself was a dangerous illusion of
the American myth. But maybe even that myth is too many thousands
of miles away to be of use in ``Siam'' country, where old points of
reference are merely antiquated tools. When Claire begins learning
a board game, her teacher, Priya, announces that she, Priya, will
be called East.
</P>
<P>
   ``East?'' Claire asks her. ``Does that mean I'm West?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Priya answers, shaking her head. ``In mah-jongg there is
only East.''

   Q. I am 67 and retired. I receive a total of $2,300 a month from
Social Security, a pension, and a deferred compensation plan. I
have two IRA accounts worth a total of $100,000. The more
diversified of these is a $50,000 account at Fidelity with 50
percent invested in Dividend Growth fund, 15 percent in High Income
fund, 10 percent in Capital Income fund, and 25 percent in Growth
Company fund. With Vanguard, the other $50,000 is 50 percent
invested in Index 500, 30 percent in Index Growth, and 20 percent
in Health Care. You recommend the Vanguard GNMA fund to many of
your readers as a fixed-income source. My year-to-date and one-year
returns on all of my accounts are 12 percent and 15 percent
respectively. My question: If the GNMA fund yields 6.5 percent,
then why is the year-to-date and one-year total return about 1.4
percent? Since I will start taking a distribution from my IRAs in
three years, I am trying to build up the total value before I reach
70. The deferred compensation income will dry up in five years, and
I will then need income from my IRAs to live on. Should I transfer
some of my Vanguard money now, or wait until I am 70? Why should I
move money into the GNMA account or bonds?
</P>
<P>
   C.D., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there's certainly no debate that this has been a pretty
rotten year for GNMAs and other bond funds. Higher interest rates
and fears of still more rate hikes to come have driven down their
prices to the point that many are in the red, and the best, such as
Vanguard GNMA, have had only token total returns.
</P>
<P>
   But the point of bond funds is to deliver an income stream, and
the reason most people buy a fund such as Vanguard GNMA is its 6.66
percent yield. They reason, and with good cause, that the share
price will fluctuate fairly dramatically from time to time, but
that over the long haul, it will go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That can be illustrated fairly dramatically by the net asset
value as this is written _ a flat $10 per share, which was
precisely the fund's net asset value when it was launched in
mid-1980.
</P>
<P>
   The reason people invest in bond funds despite their predictably
lower long-term total returns is their lower risk level _ only the
most affluent people who count on their investments as a source of
income can afford to invest their all in the stock market,
calculating that their fortune is large enough to ride through the
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the potential shock that a series of bad stock
market years could cause to an equity portfolio is too great to
face comfortably. So they look for a bond fund that will deliver
their income checks through good markets and bad, and presume that
eventually all of those fluctuations in the net asset value will
balance out.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, you can expect funds such as the Vanguard
GNMA to suffer about two bad years in every decade _ a statistic
that has been born out during the 90s, with 1994 and 1999 being the
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   This long-term viewpoint is, of course, easier to accept with
equanimity when things are going well than when you're in the
middle of one of those years that turn out to be stinkers, but
that's the nature of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   Console yourself by looking at the longer-term returns, such as
the average 8.06 percent total return for the fund over five years,
and 7.93 percent over 10.
</P>
<P>
   In your situation, you're at about the perfect point to begin
making changes, which is five years before you will need to begin
relying on the savings to produce an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention how much income you will need to replace at
age 72, and the answer to that question would dictate how
aggressively you might move toward building the fixed-income side
of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you would need $5,000 a year in five years to augment
your pension and Social Security. You might calculate that you
would need a $77,000 fixed-income portfolio to provide that income
stream.
</P>
<P>
   If your IRAs achieved total returns of 8 percent during the next
five years _ a figure I chose both in the presumption that you will
be gradually moving to fixed-income investments, and because I
think the years of double-digit stock market gains are numbered _
your IRAs would be worth a total of $146,935 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to build that $77,000 fixed-income account over
the course of those 60 months, moving $1,094 a month from the stock
funds to fixed-income holdings would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are retired and in our mid-70s and are
withdrawing from our IRA accounts, which are all in mutual funds,
with the breakdown being approximately 60 percent in stock funds,
30 percent GNMA, and 10 percent in US Treasury funds. I would like
a better diversification for our ages. Do you recommend moving some
of our stock funds into convertible bonds or bond funds?
</P>
<P>
   L.C., Malden, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you certainly have a greater percentage of your money
in stocks than do most people of your age.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether to spread more of the money into
bonds involves your overall financial situation. If you rely on the
IRAs to produce some of your income stream, and if you would be
uncomfortable if the turns of the market were to reduce your
principal, then, yes, I would suggest moving more of the money into
bond funds. Since convertibles tend to follow the swings of the
stock market as much as those of the bond market, Id suggest you
focus on straight bond funds, such as the GNMA you already have _
and take a look at the letter above and dont worry about the
horrible year GNMAs are currently having.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if your IRAs simply represent extra money
which is likely to eventually end up in your estate, and if the
withdrawals you are taking are made only because the tax rules
require them, I see no need to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply feel nervous about the stock markets _ and to my
way of thinking, thats a sign you are thinking rationally _ you
might decide to hedge your bets by moving about half of the money
in the stock funds into balanced funds. If the balanced funds you
chose divided their portfolios evenly between stocks and bonds,
this would give you 45 percent stocks and 55 percent fixed-income
holdings. If the mix was a more typical 60/40 division, with stocks
on the heavy end, it would give you 48 percent stocks and 52
percent bonds. Both positions are a little more aggressive than
most people your age prefer, but are not wildly out of line unless
you will need to rely on this portfolio for income.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 65 and 68 years old respectively and both
retired.
</P>
<P>
   I consider myself a cautious investor with a little risk taking.
I would rather preserve my principal than take a big chance. Our
present income totals from pensions and Social Security totals
$47,000, and we have $130,000 in IRAs spread among 13 funds with
Invesco, Fidelity and Vanguard. I am concerned about the number of
funds and about the time when I must start taking my required
minimum descriptions. I want to consolidate my holdings into one or
maybe two mutual funds to make it easy when I start taking
withdrawals. When I do take the withdrawals, where is the best
place to invest the money? I do not feel I will be needing a lot of
it to live on, so I want to safely put it away for my surviving
children.
</P>
<P>
   R.R., Quakertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. Heck _ it may be a lot of funds, but thats a carefully built
portfolio, and I hate to see it broken up. I hope you realize that
when it comes to the time of mandatory distributions, you simply
total all of your IRA holdings, calculate the required distribution
based on the ages of yourself and your beneficiary, and then you
can take the withdrawals from wherever you like. You could take it
from any one of the 13 accounts, or any combination you like.
</P>
<P>
   But if you simply dont want to keep track of all these funds,
you can view the portfolio as having three major segments: A total
of 44 percent is in money market funds; there is 22.9 percent in
fixed-income holdings (a category in which I included your
utilities fund position, since its mostly geared to income, and
half of your balanced fund balances) and 33.1 percent in stock
funds, generally weighted toward value holdings.
</P>
<P>
   So will you let me advise three funds to replace the thirteen?
If you would, and if you go with Vanguard, you might put 44 percent
in its Prime Money Market fund, 22.9 percent in its GNMA fund, and
the final 33.1 percent in its Index Value fund. If you went with
Fidelity, you could use the same percentages with its Cash
Reserves, GNMA, and Value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you re happy with such a portfolio, you could
reinvest the distributions in taxable accounts in the same funds.

<P>
   Sportsmen who need to be more aggressive may perform better if
they have sex before they play, say researchers. This turns on its
head the widely held belief in sporting circles that players should
abstain from sex before an important game.
</P>
<P>
   The key is a player's level of testosterone, the hormone related
to both sex and aggression. Testosterone levels are known to be
higher in men who are sexually active. Researchers have often
assumed that a low sex drive is a consequence of low levels of
testosterone, but studies by Emmanuele Jannini of the University of
L'Aquila in Italy show that testosterone levels rise after an
increase in sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Jannini measured testosterone in the blood of more than 80
patients with long-term impotence. He found that while the impotent
men's testosterone levels were about two-thirds those of sexually
active men their age, they were not low enough to cause impotence.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of psychological, mechanical or medical
therapy, which did not include hormone treatment, Jannini and his
colleagues found a dramatic rise in testosterone levels in the men
who were treated successfully. Those who made a partial recovery
had a smaller rise in testosterone. But men whose treatment wasn't
successful continued to produce low amounts of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Because the testosterone level rose with the amount of sexual
activity, and was not related to the source of the impotence or the
type of treatment, Jannini believes he can sort cause from effect.
''It didn't matter which type of therapy we used, as long as the
therapy worked,'' he says. ''It's the restoration of sexual
activity that raises testosterone to normal levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Jannini thinks that in men the body adjusts testosterone levels
to match sexual drive to the level of sexual activity, and the same
may be true for women. ''It's an adaptive mechanism,'' he says.
''If a man has sexual intercourse, testosterone causes him to
desire the next sexual intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson that sportsmen can draw from the research is that the
decision whether to abstain from sex before a game depends partly
on whether the sport requires aggression and partly on the player's
character. ''We discuss this each Sunday before the games,'' says
Jannini. ''Some athletes think it's important not to have it. It's
a matter of the character of the athlete. If he needs to be more
aggressive, it's better to have sex,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   David Handelsman, a doctor who studies reproductive medicine at
the University of Sydney, says the research is thought-provoking
and sheds new light on what testosterone does. ''This is the first
clear evidence in the vexed relationship between male sexuality and
testosterone,'' he says. ''There've only been three good,
large-scale, placebo-controlled treatment studies.'' He says none
of these studies provided data about testosterone levels before and
after treatment.  &QL;

   The universe may contain regions where milk would stir itself
out of coffee and eggs would unbreak, according to a physicist in
New York state. The idea that there may be regions where time runs
backwards could explain invisible dark matter. This kind of matter,
invoked by cosmologists to explain the movement of galaxies, could
originate in a future contracting phase of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   For coffee to unstir or an egg to unbreak requires monumental
coordination _ all the pieces of egg shell would need to follow the
exact trajectories to reform into the egg, for instance. This is
why theorists thought that the slightest interaction with a region
having normal time would destroy the opposite arrow of time.
</P>
<P>
   But calculations by Lawrence Schulman of Clarkson University in
Potsdam, N.Y., suggest that this might not be the case. ``The
problem in thinking about opposite arrows of time is to define the
question sensibly,'' he says. ``Once you have the right context,
statistical physics shows that opposing arrows are actually
compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   So how would a reverse-time region arise? Schulman suggests that
they may be relics from the far future. This possibility requires
that the expanding universe eventually starts to contract into a
``big crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, the so-called ``thermodynamic arrow of
time'' may reverse during the contraction, creating order out of
chaos _ an idea first proposed by Thomas Gold of Cornell
University. ``Because of the opposite-running time, anyone around
in this phase would actually see the contraction as an expansion,''
says Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre consequence of this is that reverse-time regions from
the contracting phase could be around us today, perhaps as close as
a few tens of light years. Since they are from the far future, any
stars would have long burnt out, but not yet reignited under the
reverse-time effect. ``But we would still feel their gravity,''
says Schulman. ``Such matter would have all the attributes of dark
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, dark matter could be normal-time matter that has
already collided with reverse-time matter from the future,
resulting in matter that has no time direction. ``Once again, it
would appear exactly like dark matter,'' says Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schulman has shown that a reverse-time region is not
destroyed by interactions with a region of normal time, there are
still paradoxes to grapple with. For instance, normal-time Alice
could see rain wetting a carpet through reverse-time Bob's window.
She could then wait until before the rain started and shout to Bob
to close his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``So did Bob's floor get wet or not?'' says Schulman. ``My guess
is that the paradox goes away if the problem is well posed _ but I
haven't yet shown it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman's calculations will appear in a forthcoming issue of
Physical Review Letters. Except, of course, in a reverse-time
region, where, having been published, they are now being unwritten.

   It's not quite Jurassic Park, but it's getting there. Engineers
on a Europe-wide project are developing life-size robotic dinosaurs
that will walk around museums, chew on plants and interact with
visitors as if they had just stepped off the prehistoric plains.
</P>
<P>
   The designers want each 35-meter-long, 80-kilogram robotic
iguanodon to be autonomous, making its own decisions about where to
go and what to do. It will approach inquisitive visitors, stare at
them, and even rear up on its back legs to browse on the nearest
potted palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually you have to walk to museum exhibits. In this case the
exhibit walks to you,'' says designer Vassilios Papantoniou, who
works for the European Association for Research in Legged Robots in
Lamia, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The robot will be built from composite resins and aviation-grade
aluminum. Its movements are based on what is known from iguanodon
fossils and studies of modern animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''A real dinosaur has hundreds of muscles,'' says zoologist R.
McNeill Alexander of Leeds University, a scientific adviser to the
project. ''So we've had to compromise.'' The major muscles are
replicated using battery-powered actuators. ''We've got three in
each leg,'' he says. The actuators are controlled by their own
microprocessors, which are linked to the central processor that
controls the beast.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-meter-long prototype has already been completed. ''It's not
walking as fast as we'd like,'' says McNeill Alexander. The
designers want the full-size version to be able to roam for two
hours at speeds of up to one meter per second before its batteries
need recharging.
</P>
<P>
   The robot iguanodon will detect ultrasound echoes from obstacles
in its way, just as bats do. Cameras will give it a crude sense of
vision, says Papantoniou, while infrared sensors will pick up the
body heat of people. The beast will simulate breathing, blinking,
grasping and chewing.
</P>
<P>
   For safety _ no museum wants 80 kilograms of metal and plastic
falling on its visitors _ a ceiling-mounted camera will track the
robot's movements. If it moves outside a designated area, a radio
signal will shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to be in contact with its master,'' says Papantoniou.
</P>
<P>
   The robot is being funded by the European Union as part of a
project to liven up museums. The designers hope to complete a
full-size version by 2001.  &QL;

<P>
   Contraceptive pills can damage women's gums, a study by dental
researchers in Britain and Sri Lanka has shown. One manufacturer
shown the study by New Scientist says it is considering sponsoring
research to gauge the extent of the problem among users.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from the study, presented on November 8 at a
meeting of the British Society for Endocrinology in London, suggest
that gingivitis, an inflammation of the gums, is unusually common
in women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could be quite obvious gum inflammation in pill takers
who neglect dental hygiene,'' warns Mena Soory, a periodontology
expert at the Guy's, King's and St. Thomas Dental Institute in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women are known to suffer unusually high levels of gum
disease. This is probably due to raised levels of the hormones
progesterone and estrogen during pregnancy. The hormones dilate
blood vessels and alter cells in the lining of the gums. This
aggravates and inflames the gum tissue. The symptoms usually
disappear as hormone levels subside after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Soory wondered if contraceptives containing the hormones would
produce similar or worse effects. To find out, she collaborated
with Aruni Tilakaratne, a doctoral student at the University of
Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. Tilakaratne recorded the amount of gum
disease in 49 Sri Lankan women who had taken the pill for between 2
and 4 years. Most of the women took a modern, low-dose combined
pill containing both hormones, and a few took a higher dose
preparation containing progesterone alone.
</P>
<P>
   Gingivitis was 32 percent more common in these women than in the
control group of 39 women who did not take the pill. The symptoms
were worst in women who had most bacterial plaque on their teeth.
''The plaque may be the trigger that magnifies the inflammation,''
says Soory.
</P>
<P>
   Other measurements showed that gaps between the teeth and gums
of the pill takers were on average 2 to 4 times as large as in
nonusers. But the differences only amounted to fractions of a
millimeter _ far smaller than the 3-millimeter gap that requires
surgical cleaning of roots. ''It would take a very long time to get
appreciable disease,'' says Soory.
</P>
<P>
   Tilakaratne also found that pregnant women do not have the
abnormally wide gaps between teeth and gums seen in pill takers.
Soory speculates that this extra damage occurs in pill takers
because they are exposed to the hormones for years.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends strict dental hygiene for pill users. ''Maintain
regular dental check-ups and increase hygiene at home,'' she says.
''Brush twice a day and floss before bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Organon, a major manufacturer of oral contraceptive pills in
Oss, the Netherlands, has held internal meetings to discuss the
issue. ''This area really is starting now,'' says Bjorn Oddens of
Organon. ''We're still wondering what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts reacted with surprise to the findings. ''I've
never heard that reported anywhere else,'' says Michael Harper, a
contraceptives researcher at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in
Norfolk, Va. But if it's true, he adds, the damage should get worse
with time.

   WASHINGTON _ Now that another national shouting match is looming
over trade, smack in the middle of a presidential campaign season
no less, the combatants should pause long enough to think about two
of the most important, bridging figures of the post-World War II
era _ John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping the country and world grow, and shrinking
the obstacles to international commerce, Kennedy and Reagan shared
a devout refusal to play either/or games with a subject so
obviously central to America's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at this week's pivotal discussions of the
still-fledgling World Trade Organization, or the effort to
implement the Clinton administration's agreement with China over
the terms of its watershed entry into the WTO, the either/or,
yes/no shouting match misses many important points that address the
key element of most Americans' attitude toward what is now called
globalization _ ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, without losing his credentials with a labor movement
that in the early 1960s was far more powerful and
manufacturing-based than it is today, led his party into
responsible internationalism. The negotiating round that he won
authority to conduct after a tough struggle was the first major
effort to begin dismantling then-huge barriers to the flow of goods
and services around the world and was the ice-breaker after more
than a decade of inaction. But it was also Kennedy who first
advanced the concept, and then an actual program, of what became
called ``adjustment assistance'' to help workers and communities
severely impacted by outside forces cope and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, whom no one could ever accuse of being a
protectionist, was equally at home on the tightrope. Like Kennedy,
however, Reagan was not content to simply conserve his base, among
free-traders in the conservative movement and the business
comnmunity. Not only did he get the most recent rounds of
trade-expansion going _ this was the round that ended up producing
the WTO under Bill Clinton _ Reagan was no slouch when it came to
granting relief to US industries hit by suddent surges of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In cars, in steel, and other important sectors, Reagan took heat
from his free-trade purists in negotiating _ under threat of more
formal actions _ agreements with major trading partners that
limited their exports here while domestic businesses used the grace
periods to become more fit for genuine competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and the 1980s, there was no question of the basic
direction toward more of a global economy, but there was also no
question that the government was widely (if far from universally)
perceived as prepared to step in and smooth out the bumps along the
way, particularly those that stemmed from sharp surges in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the political atmosphere is much different. President
Clinton has earned broad support for his economic policies, and the
conventional wisdom around here is that he starts out in a strong
position in the wake of the successful conclusion of the WTO
negotiations with China. At a minimum, to implement the deal,
Congress will have to pass a basically clean bill granting
permanent, normal trade relations status for China, ending the
ridiculous process of recent years that require annual votes _ and
therefore annual shouting matches.
</P>
<P>
   There is also broad support _ again, stemming from the
unprecedented, broad-based prosperity _ for a new round of trade
talks under WTO auspices that will get underway this week in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But there continue to be loud cries of dissent from those who
believe that globalization is a benefit for corporations more than
people, that it promotes the export of US manfacturing jobs more
than goods and services, that it winks at harmful environmental
practices, and that it compromises basic human rights values.
</P>
<P>
   I don't share the dissent, but the basis for much of it is
legitimate and the Clinton administration should pay it more than
lip service in the interests of broadening the support for trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent example has just emerged from the Center for
National Policy here _ a study by trade expert Greg Mastel urging
much more vigorous use of a basic provision in US law designed to
guard against unexpected surges in imports as well as dumping.
</P>
<P>
   The legal provision _ Section 201 of the law _ has a poor
history, Mastel argues, under presidents easily dissuaded by
foreign policy as well as domestic political considerations. But by
loosening the standards for action, requiring quicker responses to
reported import surges, and limiting presidential discretion,
Section 201 could become a much more useful tool. It would also
more credibly buttress strong safeguards against surges in specific
imports from China that were negotiated as part of the WTO deal.
</P>
<P>
   Open markets and open trading systems are clearly in the
ascendancy politically in ways they have not been in the past. But
the future will be a lot more politically secure if safeguards are
made even stronger. This isn't protectionist, as Kennedy and Reagan
found out, it's the glue that keeps the nation more united as
inevitable globalization proceeds.

KILLER TOLD ALL ON THE WEB, AND NO ONE LISTENED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ In the days before he emptied a semiautomatic
handgun into 20-year-old Amy Boyer, whom he had developed a crush
on when they were both in junior high, Liam Youens ran his options
by an Internet audience.
</P>
<P>
   Should he go forward with ``Plan Amy,'' the slaying of Boyer,
then working as a dental assistant, or opt for ``Plan Owen,'' the
assassination of another former classmate who, like Boyer, could
barely have picked him out of a police lineup?
</P>
<P>
   Or would it make a bigger splash to storm into Nashua High
School at lunchtime, Columbine-style, and kill as many students as
he could?
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks that led up to Boyer's slaying on Oct. 15 and
Youens' suicide that day, the 21-year-old loosed all his thoughts
on his Internet site. A recently released 489-page police report,
drawing on that site, supplies a finely drawn portrait of a young
man preparing to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that preparation, Youens told an imagined audience,
consisted of developing the ``courage'' to open fire on an unarmed
former classmate. And part of it consisted of on-line investigation
services that charged him hundreds of dollars to find Boyer's birth
date, Social Security number, address, and finally, the location of
the Main Street dentist's office where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, weeks later, that he pulled up alongside her car
and let loose a barrage of bullets that exploded into the side of
her face and broke both of her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually obsene (sic) what you can find out about people
on the Internet,'' he wrote on his Web page, beside the subject
headings ``Youth group people,'' and ``Mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the day Boyer died, when he learned of two Web sites
devoted to stalking her, her stepfather, Tim Remsburg, has focused
publicly on the role the Internet played in her death. Remsburg saw
the police report _ a haunting unfolding of Liam Youens' on-line
life _ for the first time on Nov. 19, and read through the thick
stack of papers until early the next morning, weeping. Remsburg,
42, had pressed hard for police to release the material, which he
said could be useful in a civil suit he is considering against
Geocities and Tripod, the two on-line communities where Youens
maintained Web sites announcing his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Tripod official said almost no one visited Youens'
site, Remsburg said the threats were made publicly and should have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing if this kid had written this in a
diary,'' Remsburg said. ``But he wrote this on the Internet. Now
don't you think he expected someone to read this?''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Strawbridge, director of membership services at Tripod,
destroyed the site in the early morning hours on the night Boyer
died, minutes after a police detective called him. He said Tripod
would certainly have notified authorities if anyone had seen the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a site like that before, and I've seen
millions of sites,'' Strawbridge said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether threats on Web pages should be monitored
emerged this spring after the shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had stated
their intentions on a Web page. Strawbridge said his company does
its best to monitor both pornography and on-line threats, but that
the technology to weed out threatening pages does not exist yet.
Ordinary searches for words like ``hate'' and ``kill'' would turn
up an unfathomable volume of material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months when Youens maintained the Tripod site,
the number of visitors to the site was in the ``single digits,''
said Strawbridge. He added that many of those hits may have been
Youens himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he was the only visitor to his own site,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Geocities spokesman refused to comment on Youens' second site.
</P>
<P>
   According to Remsburg, an unrelated grievance concerns the ease
with which Youens tracked down Boyer using the Internet. Reading
through the paper trail of Youens' month-and-a-half-long search for
Boyer's workplace address, Remsburg said, he was enraged that
on-line investigation agencies such as Docusearch and Infoseekers
had made money revealing his daughter's whereabouts to her killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was back at square one,'' Remsburg said. ``I felt almost as
violated as I did when I found out that Web site had been up for
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for one on-line agency says it uses public sources
such as court or motor vehicle records for its research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that we're providing is public information,
and it's accessible through other means,'' the spokeswoman said.
``The only thing we're doing is saving people time.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked that her firm not be identified because no officer was
available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Youens' journal, which was posted on the Tripod site, recounts
the history of a one-way relationship: the humiliating day she
brushed past him in the lunchroom, the painful Valentine's Day when
he realized she had received a rose from a new boyfriend. He pasted
several purloined pictures of Boyer to his page, airbrushing one
which he felt was not flattering. He also recalled a day in 10th
grade when Boyer turned around on the school bus to yell back at a
friend and Youens realized he was in love with her. Shortly after
that he decided to kill her and himself. ``That was the basic plan
for the next half decade,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and acquaintances of Liam Youens who were interviewed
after the killing described him as withdrawn and occasionally
violent. His mother, Clarissa London, recalled a 1996 incident in
which Youens had thrown her china cabinet down the staircase when
she dismissed as ``silly'' his desire to get plastic surgery for a
``sunken chest.'' London called the police, who arrested Youens. He
was convicted on domestic violence charges and later attended anger
management classes at Nashua District Court, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Youens left Nashua for a miserable year at
the Rochester Institute of Technology, after which he returned home
and began taking steps to track Boyer down. But he found himself
stymied, in part because she was constantly surrounded by family.
The challenge was to find her workplace and her license plate
number without arousing suspicion. On the Web site, he railed
against New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen for legislation that
made it impossible to obtain license plate numbers from a Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in mid-September, he had more luck with Internet
services like Docusearch, whose sitepromises to help ``track down
debtors and deadbeats.'' One investigator from Infoseekers
apologetically e-mailed back, ``I couldn't find much on Amy, I
guess she's relatively young, she may not have a very long paper
trail yet. . . . Good luck!!!'' Finally, late in September,
Docusearch provided him with the address of the Main Street
dentist's office.
</P>
<P>
   He found her there, and by Oct. 7, he was chastising himself for
``making excuses.'' On Oct. 12, he had no spot to shoot from. On
Oct. 15, he found his spot. The killing took place at 4:30 in the
afternoon. Youens had last updated the ``Amy Boyer'' Web site at
3:49.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most disturbing passages in Youens' journal
described the things he did not do. Youens wrote admiringly of the
shootings at Columbine High School, and wrote of plans to carry out
his own ``rampage'' at Nashua High School. (Original spelling
preserved):
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to start shooting in the courtyard as fast as I can.
reload, I am told that two Nashua Police officers will be in the
school (this is why I need a vest). If those cops don't blow my
brains out, I figure I'll have one minute before the cavalry comes
. . . ill go for head shots head shots head shots! they are a
MUST.''
</P>
<P>
   He also apparently considered another random killing of an
acquaintance: Owen Banks, a 20-year-old college student who had
attended Nashua High School with Youens. On his Web page, Youens
relates several attempts to ``snipe him from his backyard'' and one
occasion when he ``drove to (Banks's) house and coincidentally saw
him taking out the trash. As I drove by we looked at each other
square in the eye. I was stuned.''
</P>
<P>
   But when police visited Banks four days after Boyer's death,
Banks drew a blank when asked about Youens.
</P>
<P>
   Banks ``states that he . . . does not know who Liam Youens is,''
reported a Nashua detective that day. ``He states that he cannot
recall any in-depth conversation that he has ever had with Liam. .
. . He cannot find a single, solitary reason why Liam would want to
harm him, and is very puzzled by Liam's desire to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, reached at his parents' home in Nashua last week, said he
did not want to talk about the killing. Remsburg said he believed
Youens had focused on Banks because Banks once told him that Boyer
had a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Remsburg said it would be hard to guard against such a bizarre
crime. Still, he wishes that somehow, three days before her death _
on an evening when she spent three hours surfing the Internet _ Amy
Boyer had run a search for her own name.

PUERTO RICAN SPLIT: MUSIC STOPS AS BASEBALL STAR FOULS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ It was a Hollywood relationship from the start,
complete with lies, infidelity, and even DNA testing. Now it's over
_ and it's on the mind of everyone in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The island's most celebrated couple _ merengue queen Olga Tanon
and Detroit Tigers baseball player Juan ``Igor'' Gonzalez _
announced last week they are splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Their divorce will dissolve a union that entwined two of Puerto
Rico's most prized treasures: music and baseball. Separately, Tanon
and Gonzalez are international icons, the premier ambassadors of
Puerto Rican culture. Together, they embodied a passion taken
straight from a Univision soap opera, a romance of two superstar
millionaires that was not meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Though the news didn't shock many people _ most Puerto Ricans
say they saw it coming _ it is the talk of the island. For four
days, it was on the front page of every major Puerto Rican
newspaper, with tabloid-style headlines such as ``Olga puncho a
Igor,'' or ``Olga struck out Igor.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio DJs are playing Tanon's music with even greater frequency,
making innunendoes with the titles of such songs as ``Muchacho
Malo'' (``Bad Boy''). And all over, from nightclubs in Old San Juan
to health clubs in Ponce, people talk about the couple as if they
are intimate friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell from the beginning it wasn't going to work,''
said Nitza Gonzalez, a 32-year-old accountant from Humacao. ``He's
always had problems with women.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's appetite for each twist and turn of the
relationship has everything to do with the couple's star status.
</P>
<P>
   Tanon is easily the most popular female merengue singer in all
of Latin America, a woman who pushed open the door to others in the
male-dominated genre. Her face is splashed on billboards and
magazine covers across Latin America. She's known as ``mujer de
fuego,'' or ``woman of fire,'' because of her energy.
</P>
<P>
   Her music employs the catchy, hip-twitching rhythm that is the
trademark of merengue, though her lyrics don't fall into the
typical why-did-he-leave-me mode. Her modern-day woman lyrics speak
of taking charge. ``If he tells you, `I love you.' If he says
`Without you I die.' . . . He's a liar. He's a liar, that man,''
she sings on ``Es Mentiroso,'' or ``He's a Liar.'' Yet, she sings
as if she's having the time of her life.
</P>
<P>
   People know her songs by heart. That's because many lives
revolve around music. Mothers sway to it while they cook dinner. It
blares from jukeboxes in restaurants. And on plazas on weekends,
bands draw crowds that are always ready to groove.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that comes close to many Puerto Ricans' love of
music is their love of baseball. And their number one man is
Gonzalez, the island's greatest gift to the Major Leagues since
Roberto Clemente. Gonzalez has twice won the American League's Most
Valuable Player award, in 1996 and 1998, when he was with the Texas
Rangers. Among sports lovers here, he's known as ``el bateador de
bateadores.'' (The batter of batters.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, he's tall and handsome. Women swoon for him. Men
and little boys alike wish they could trade places with him, even
for just a day.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, when the two wed last December, it was as if
Madonna had married Babe Ruth. It captured the attention of Puerto
Ricans here and on the mainland. News photographers acted like
snipers, hiding to get revealing, intimate shots. Many had hoped
that if anyone could, Tanon would straighten out Gonzalez, who had
a revolving door of women in his life. But that proved to be a vain
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez secretly began dating Tanon five years ago while he was
married to Elaine Lopez, a Puerto Rican volleyball champ and sister
of Atlanta Braves catcher Javier Lopez. Gonzalez left Lopez, his
second wife, for Tanon. Two years later, Tanon was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, a woman named Liza Ferrer Garcia said
she also was pregnant with Gonzalez's child. Gonzalez rebuffed
Ferrer publicly, saying, ``The only baby I'm expecting is from
Olga.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanon gave birth to a girl, Gabriela. And Ferrer had a boy, whom
she named Igorcito, or ``little Igor.'' When his mother dressed him
in Texas Rangers jerseys for the TV cameras he looked like a
mini-Igor.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after a court-mandated DNA test proved the the
child is his, Gonzalez said he would make child-support payments,
but would not recognize him as his son. Last month, however,
Gonzalez conceded and said he would accept Igorcito.
</P>
<P>
   Most Puerto Ricans think that was the last straw for Tanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was with so many women and now he has no one,'' said Hanzel
Arroyo, 72, a Korean War veteran. ``As we say in Puerto Rico,
`Perdio la soga y la cabra' _ He lost the rope and the goat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone seems to side with Tanon. People see her as a
good woman who was wronged by a womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got tired of his scandals,'' said Alfonso Cordero, owner
of Islander Feeling Crafts in Old San Juan. Cordero said though he
condemns Gonzalez's actions, he's not surprised that men admire
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of men think he's got it all. He's like James Bond. He's
got a ton of women and all this money,'' Cordero said. ``Nothing
happens to him. He comes out unscratched.''

GORE HITS ROAD WITH NEW LOOK, MESSAGE

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore is feeling it now,
letting loose with the rhythm of a preacher. ``Babies addicted to
crack cocaine,'' he cries out. ``It's not supposed to be this
way!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 300 at the Jackie Robinson Center in the shadow of
the San Gabriel Mountains responds with a wave of murmurs and
``Amens!'' Gore, fairly growling out the cadence now in the midday
sun, continues: Schools are crumbling, children don't have health
insurance. ``It's not supposed to be this way!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen!'' comes the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore jumps into the crowd, shaking hundreds of hands, soaking up
the affection of the audience, even insisting that three young boys
sing the National Anthem for him. As the rally ends, he surrounds
himself with children _ as if seeking their protection _ while he
conducts a series of television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Then the local reporters ask the zinger: Mr. Vice President, if
it's not supposed to be this way, what have you been doing for the
last seven years?
</P>
<P>
   Gore barely flinches at the question, but his answer has as many
winding trails as the nearby mountains. He wants to build on the
foundation of the Clinton administration's successes. He wants to
set his own path, finding ways to help those left behind
economically during the last seven years. He implies that his
Democratic opponent, former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, is
too moderate. Finally, he sums up his campaign in six words: ``I
want to fight for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in interviews conducted aboard Air Force Two and in his
limousine, Gore reiterates his declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the internal decision that running for president is a
lot more important than being the best vice president I can
possibly be,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a man who, literally and figuratively, is trying to get
comfortable in his new suit of earth-tone clothes. Having shed the
Clinton mantle, Gore is trying the trickiest of political tasks,
trying to re-introduce himself to the nation that may already have
made up its mind about him. Bradley, by contrast, is viewed as a
man quite comfortable with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been largely background noise in the national
conversation during the Clinton era, the butt of countless jokes on
the late-night television shows, a man who for years good-naturedly
fed the impression that he was stiff and robotic. But he knows he
can't run on those laugh lines, or on the Clinton record, or even
on the prosperity of the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore at every turn is portraying himself as a recharged
candidate who has pulled the plug on his ties with President
Clinton. And no wonder: He is battling Bradley to win the
nomination in a primary fight he never anticipated, and he trails
GOP front-runner George W. Bush by more than 15 points in some
national polls. He is channeling the separate-from-Clinton advice
dished out by his campaign consultants, including feminist author
Naomi Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   He is striving to melt away his stiffness with a newly relaxed
style and a wardrobe of khakis and open-neck, earth-tone shirts.
Tanned and toned, he could step out of the pages of GQ, right down
to the Palm Pilot he wears on his belt and a gut-busting ``ab''
machine he uses in his Air Force Two cabin.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's jet begins its descent, Gore surveys the countryside
outside the window as if it were his own, insisting in an interview
that he is not concerned about problems in his campaign that led to
a recent reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this campaign were a book,'' Gore says, ``we'd just be
completing the introduction. Chapter 1 is beginning right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a glorious Sunday morning in Southern California as Gore's
motorcade rolls northward along one of the nation's most stunning
roadways, a stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway that runs through
Malibu, the ocean teeming with surfers on the left and the Santa
Monica Mountains plunging to the coast on the right.
</P>
<P>
   At a gate marked ``Private,'' the motorcade turns toward the
mountains and enters one of the most remarkable compounds in
California. It is the home of Grammy-winning music producer David
Foster, whose successes include the singer Celine Dion. Ringed by
towering peaks, swept with ocean breezes, the Foster home clings to
a hillside like a miniature Mediterranean town. There is no need to
ascend the hill by foot. A funicular, a cable-mounted train similar
to the Cog Railway that goes up New Hampshire's Mount Washington,
whisks visitors up the incline and to Foster's front door.
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign is a book, as Gore says, then this chapter might
be called: Find the Money.
</P>
<P>
   Gore never expected to be spending so much time at this late
date seeking contributions. The original Gore plan was to collect
more than $30 million this year, putting a huge financial gap
between himself and Bradley. But Bradley has defied the plan by
collecting nearly as much money as Gore and spending it more
carefully, leaving both candidates with about $10 million in cash
on hand as of Sept. 30. Gore has cut his campaign staff and their
salaries and begun planning for government-paid ``official'' trips
early next year to curtail costs.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a four-day trip to the West Coast, Gore spends
significant time raising funds, from an opulent home on a Pasadena
mountainside, to the 51st floor of a San Francisco office tower, to
a hilltop country club overlooking Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this parcel of paradise in Malibu, the glitterati of
Hollywood have taken their seats in white wooden chairs spread
around a lawn the size of a football field to witness the vice
president receiving an award for his environmental achievements.
Among them: actors Harry Hamlin, Angie Dickinson, Tom Arnold, and
Daniel Stern; the president's brother, Roger Clinton; singer Barry
Manilow; and boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. The priest of the local
Chumash Indian tribe delivers his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   After a musical performance and a quiche lunch, California
Governor Gray Davis delivers an introduction that does not gloss
over Gore's political troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his national charisma adviser,'' says Davis, who is
famously bland. The governor, perhaps unaware that Gore finally has
stopped joking about his stiffness, goes on to say he could give
the vice president plenty of advice on how to overcome being a
dull, boring candidate behind in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, the Canadian-born host of the affair, says he is so
impressed with Gore that he plans to become a US citizen so he can
vote for the vice president. In all, it was a day of good
vibrations in Malibu, and it brought another $250,000 into Gore's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But it could hardly compare to what Bradley was doing on the
same day. While Gore's event was attended by 250 donors and about a
dozen reporters, Bradley was in Madison Square Garden, reliving his
days as a New York Knick before a huge media entourage and 7,000
people, who contributed $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview, Gore seems unaware that Bradley has done
so well. ``7,000?'' Gore asks, when told of the number of people at
the Bradley event. ``Where's that?''

BIG TOBACCO CHANGES TUNE TO STOP FDA 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of downplaying smoking's dangers,
cigarette makers plan to argue before the Supreme Court this week
that the Food and Drug Administration has no right to police the
industry because tobacco products are too deadly for the FDA to
regulate.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case with sweeping public health implications, the
$50 billion industry is keeping its Marlboro Man image out of the
courtroom and expressing a new corporate motto that is emblazoned
on Philip Morris's Web site: ``There is no `safe' cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout is pivotal to the industry's attempt to thwart the
FDA, which claimed jurisdiction over tobacco products in 1996 after
concluding that nicotine is a drug and cigarettes are drug-delivery
devices.
</P>
<P>
   With the FDA poised to alter the way cigarettes are marketed and
sold in the 21st century, the court is weighing the industry's
complaint that the Clinton administration exceeded its legal
authority in permitting the FDA to assert control over tobacco
products. Both sides are scheduled to present oral arguments
Wednesday, and the court is expected to issue a ruling early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers plan to argue that if the FDA prevails in court
the agency will have no choice but to ban the sale of cigarettes
because the law requires the FDA to regulate only drugs that are
``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back to whether we are safe and effective,'' an
industry official said last week in a briefing with reporters on
the condition that he not be identified. ``We are not safe and
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry contends that only Congress has the power to
abridge the rights of adults to buy dangerous tobacco products and
has chosen instead to require safety warnings and other
restrictions short of FDA intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant issue, whether an unelected bureaucrat
of the federal government can ban a legal product of a major
American industry,'' said Scott Williams, a spokesman for the five
largest tobacco manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the industry's disdain for the FDA's proposed
regulations, Williams derided the agency's finding that cigarettes
are drug-delivery devices. ``Saying a cigarette is a delivery
device is like saying ketchup is a vegetable,'' he said. ``It
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the FDA argues that the law provides exceptions
for the agency to regulate unsafe products such as tobacco rather
than ban them if it is in the public interest. And the FDA says it
has no intention of outlawing tobacco because ``the sudden
withdrawal from the market of products to which so many millions of
people are addicted would be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed regulations that President Clinton announced in
1996, the FDA has chiefly targeted the marketing and sales of
tobacco products to minors. Studies have shown that more than 90
percent of adult smokers started as minors, and more than 400,000
adults die each year of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Antitobacco advocates said the FDA's proposed campaign against
youth smoking is crucial to stemming what John R. Seffrin, head of
the American Cancer Society, called ``the 20th century's single
largest public health disaster.'' He and other advocates portrayed
the industry's talk of a possible ban on cigarettes as a scare
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's argument is designed to frighten the court into
saying the FDA can't act,'' said Matthew Myers, executive vice
president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``Without
FDA jurisdiction, we will still not have a nationwide set of rules
to make it difficult for children to purchase and obtain tobacco
products illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   The only FDA tobacco regulation that has taken effect requires
retailers to ask cigarette buyers who appear to be 27 or younger to
show identification proving they are at least 18.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's other proposed rules would ban cigarette vending
machines and self-service displays except in adults-only locations.
In addition, the FDA has proposed broad advertising, marketing, and
promotional restrictions on tobacco products, such as bans on
outdoor ads near schools and on sponsorship of sports events.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court in Greensboro, N.C., ruled in 1997 that
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 empowered the FDA to
regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco because nicotine is
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond
reversed the finding last year in a 2-1 decision. ``We do not
dispute that Congress has charged the FDA with protecting the
public health and that tobacco products present serious health
risks for the public,'' the court wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court accepted the industry's argument that
Congress effectively has reserved the right to oversee cigarette
makers and did not intend for the FDA to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the FDA has appropriated Congress's constitutional
authority to make major national policy,'' tobacco lawyers argued
in their written brief to the Supreme Court, citing the appeals
court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court challenge will take place a year after
cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states more than $200 billion
over 25 years to cover smoking-related health costs. The industry
also faces a $20 billion civil lawsuit by the Justice Department
and numerous class-action cases across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court upholds the Fourth Circuit ruling, ``the
case is over and there is nothing the FDA can do,'' an industry
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides expect to take their cases to Congress if
they lose in the Supreme Court, antitobacco groups said a defeat
for the FDA could be crushing, particularly with little chance of
major action on Capitol Hill in the 2000 election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Myers said, ``you will not have seen the type
of fundamental change that will dramatically reduce the number of
Americans who die from tobacco.''

INEVITABLE GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that another national shouting match is looming
over trade, smack in the middle of a presidential campaign season
no less, the combatants should pause long enough to think about two
of the most important, bridging figures of the post-World War II
era _ John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping the country and world grow, and shrinking
the obstacles to international commerce, Kennedy and Reagan shared
a devout refusal to play either/or games with a subject so
obviously central to America's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at this week's pivotal discussions of the
still-fledgling World Trade Organization, or the effort to
implement the Clinton administration's agreement with China over
the terms of its watershed entry into the WTO, the either/or,
yes/no shouting match misses many important points that address the
key element of most Americans' attitude toward what is now called
globalization _ ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, without losing his credentials with a labor movement
that in the early 1960s was far more powerful and
manufacturing-based than it is today, led his party into
responsible internationalism. The negotiating round that he won
authority to conduct after a tough struggle was the first major
effort to begin dismantling then-huge barriers to the flow of goods
and services around the world and was the ice-breaker after more
than a decade of inaction. But it was also Kennedy who first
advanced the concept, and then an actual program, of what became
called ``adjustment assistance'' to help workers and communities
severely impacted by outside forces cope and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, whom no one could ever accuse of being a
protectionist, was equally at home on the tightrope. Like Kennedy,
however, Reagan was not content to simply conserve his base, among
free-traders in the conservative movement and the business
comnmunity. Not only did he get the most recent rounds of
trade-expansion going _ this was the round that ended up producing
the WTO under Bill Clinton _ Reagan was no slouch when it came to
granting relief to US industries hit by suddent surges of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In cars, in steel, and other important sectors, Reagan took heat
from his free-trade purists in negotiating _ under threat of more
formal actions _ agreements with major trading partners that
limited their exports here while domestic businesses used the grace
periods to become more fit for genuine competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and the 1980s, there was no question of the basic
direction toward more of a global economy, but there was also no
question that the government was widely (if far from universally)
perceived as prepared to step in and smooth out the bumps along the
way, particularly those that stemmed from sharp surges in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the political atmosphere is much different. President
Clinton has earned broad support for his economic policies, and the
conventional wisdom around here is that he starts out in a strong
position in the wake of the successful conclusion of the WTO
negotiations with China. At a minimum, to implement the deal,
Congress will have to pass a basically clean bill granting
permanent, normal trade relations status for China, ending the
ridiculous process of recent years that require annual votes _ and
therefore annual shouting matches.
</P>
<P>
   There is also broad support _ again, stemming from the
unprecedented, broad-based prosperity _ for a new round of trade
talks under WTO auspices that will get underway this week in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But there continue to be loud cries of dissent from those who
believe that globalization is a benefit for corporations more than
people, that it promotes the export of US manfacturing jobs more
than goods and services, that it winks at harmful environmental
practices, and that it compromises basic human rights values.
</P>
<P>
   I don't share the dissent, but the basis for much of it is
legitimate and the Clinton administration should pay it more than
lip service in the interests of broadening the support for trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent example has just emerged from the Center for
National Policy here _ a study by trade expert Greg Mastel urging
much more vigorous use of a basic provision in US law designed to
guard against unexpected surges in imports as well as dumping.
</P>
<P>
   The legal provision _ Section 201 of the law _ has a poor
history, Mastel argues, under presidents easily dissuaded by
foreign policy as well as domestic political considerations. But by
loosening the standards for action, requiring quicker responses to
reported import surges, and limiting presidential discretion,
Section 201 could become a much more useful tool. It would also
more credibly buttress strong safeguards against surges in specific
imports from China that were negotiated as part of the WTO deal.
</P>
<P>
   Open markets and open trading systems are clearly in the
ascendancy politically in ways they have not been in the past. But
the future will be a lot more politically secure if safeguards are
made even stronger. This isn't protectionist, as Kennedy and Reagan
found out, it's the glue that keeps the nation more united as
inevitable globalization proceeds.

   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ For years on this tiny island where names and
loyalties go back centuries, it was called ``the secret'': the
harrowing but true story of how members of a local whaling crew
survived for 90 days adrift on the open sea after losing their ship
in the Pacific and running out of food.
</P>
<P>
   The disastrous voyage of the Essex, which was rammed and
eventually sent to the ocean's bottom by a great bull whale,
inspired Herman Melville to write ``Moby-Dick.'' But the real story
of the Essex, and its grim coda, never truly reached the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with lurid stories of ocean tragedies like ``The
Perfect Storm'' begetting a lucrative publishing phenomenon, the
dark past of this island better known for its wealthy tourists is
being packaged as a literary smash.
</P>
<P>
   Viking books paid Nantucket author Nat Philbrick a reported $1.2
million advance to write an account of the tragedy, which is
expected to be released in six months. For the past year Philbrick
has written from the dim basement of his quaint Nantucket home.
Filed in his makeshift office are neatly labeled folders: Whaling,
Starvation and Dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   And one more: Cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a reticent, always been a closed
community,'' explained David Wood, a Nantucket native and retired
schoolteacher. ``The secret is out of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret dates back to the island's heyday, the early 1800s,
when Nantucket was the world's greatest whaling port. The roofs at
the top of shingled houses were used as lookouts for incoming
ships. For a Nantucketer, the whale's oil, so precious that it was
used to anoint the pope, provided unimagined riches.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many sources of wealth, it came with a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody whale trade claimed many casualties _ the lookouts
atop the whalers' homes became known as ``widows' walks'' _ but the
Essex tragedy was the one that would rock the Quaker town through
the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the tragedy unravels from Philbrick's research
and the memoirs of the ship's first mate.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, 1819, Captain George Pollard and his crew of 20
boarded the Essex and began their voyage to the rich whaling
grounds of the Pacific. The officers on the ship were all
Nantucketers. Many crew members were from Cape Cod. One came from
England, and five whalers _ all African-Americans _ arrived from
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The tour went well for more than a year. By October 1820, the
crew had gathered 900 barrels of sperm oil before reaching the
Galapagos Islands. But a month later, on Nov. 20, the voyage took a
deadly turn.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Chase, the first mate, was repairing his smaller whaleboat
on deck when he turned and saw a giant sperm whale lying quietly on
the sea surface. As he gazed at the huge mammal, it suddenly rushed
the boat, thrusting and parting the waters like a locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was stunned. Whales usually were either docile or playful.
With a shudder, Chase realized that the pursuers of whales were
about to become the pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The giant animal struck the boat with a terrifying heave,
sending crew members sprawling across the deck. Then it turned and
attacked again. Within minutes, the Essex was taking on water. Soon
it was a crumpled, listing wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a supposedly dumb beast to deliberately sink a ship _ that
is horrifying,'' said Renny Stackpole, a Nantucket native and
maritime scholar. ``Melville locked on to this modus for the
conclusion of ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Captain Ahab, Melville's doomed protagonist, the crew of
the Essex seemed to be led by supernatural forces of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Their ship beyond repair, the men retreated to three smaller
whaleboats, with some provisions, and headed south. For one month,
they floated at sea on the 28-foot skiffs before landing on a
barren island. The portents were bad: They found little food, very
little water, and, ominously, the skeletal remains of six men who
apparently had been shipwrecked there decades in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the crew members elected to remain on the island while
Pollard and the other 17 crew members returned to the sea. The
three boats, leaking and ragged, took to the sea with one commanded
by the captain; another headed by First Mate Chase, and a third
under the command of another officer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their efforts to stay together, a severe storm soon
separated the boats. With provisions running out, three crew
members starved to death.
</P>
<P>
   It was after one sailor became delirious and died on Chase's
boat that the first mate suggested using the body for food. His
crew of three men agreed _ grimly separating the limbs and
``devouring'' the heart, according to his later account.
</P>
<P>
   The three men removed the flesh from the body, roasted it, and
ate for nine days before being rescued off the coast of South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew not whose lot it would fall next, either die or be
shot,'' wrote Chase, explaining that the starving men were prepared
to resort to murder to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an even grimmer story was unfolding on the boat
commanded by Pollard. The captain's boat had briefly reunited with
the third boat, only to be swept apart again by another violent
storm. The third boat was never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Pollard's crew members began starving. On Feb. 1, 1821,
the last four survivors, all Nantucketers, picked straws. They
apparently agreed that the loser of the lottery would be killed and
then consumed by the remaining crew. The shortest lot went to the
captain's teenage cousin, who agreed to be shot and then eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lad, my lad,'' exclaimed the captain. ``If you don't like
your lot I will shoot the first man who touches you.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, uncertain whether to choose death or continued
suffering, said he would accept his fate like a man.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot and eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Another man died naturally and was used for food before the
captain and another teenage crew member were rescued off the
Chilean coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all three men who chose to stay on the barren island
were rescued months later by a vessel sent from Nantucket to search
for the crew of the Essex. But only five men _ all Nantucketers _
made it off the whaleboats alive.
</P>
<P>
   News of the shipwreck had already reached the island newspapers
by the time of the rescues. Rumors of cannibalism, the worst
abomination in the eyes of Quakers, blew through the town like a
tempest.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the survivors' return to Nantucket, dozens of
islanders stood by the bay not uttering a word as the weary men
walked to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother of the youngster that pulled the unlucky lot
couldn't stand the sight of the captain after he told her of her
son's fate,'' said Philbrick.
</P>
<P>
   But, Philbrick said, many Nantucketers felt sorry for the
captain and supported him by giving him another job as commander of
a ship. But when that was shipwrecked, too, near the Hawaiian
Islands, the 34-year-old captain was deemed unlucky, and never went
to sea again. He spent the rest of his years walking the
cobblestone streets as the town's night watchman.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there are aspects of the Essex disaster that puzzle
Nantucket scholars.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery, say Stackpole and Philbrick, is why the four black
men on the captain's boat were the first to die. It may have been
mere coincidence, since there is no evidence to show that the men
were killed. But their unexplained deaths have always haunted the
abolitionist community that knew too well of the sometimes brutal
treatment of black whalers.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the story of the Essex became an international
scandal, with reporters from as far away as Australia covering it.
Melville and Ralph Waldo Emerson would visit the captain, said
Philbrick, and pepper him with questions.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Essex shipwreck, Melville was known mainly as
the author of pulp adventure novels, drawing on his youthful
experience as a whaler. ``Moby-Dick,'' punctuated by the dramatic
whale attack drawn from the Essex tragedy, became the greatest
American novel in the eyes of many scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after its publication, as the fame of ``Moby-Dick'' grew,
memories of the Essex disaster waned: It was no longer a legendary
story of survival but the backdrop for a great novel. Soon the
stories that once scandalized the island quieted into a delicate
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nantucketers wouldn't talk about it for the better part of the
century,'' said Stackpole.
</P>
<P>
   But when the whaling industry was replaced by tourism and all
the blood relatives of the victims had died, locals began to accept
the tragedy as part of their history, said Jim Patrick, a local
writer and house painter.
</P>
<P>
   Philbrick, 43, moved to Nantucket to become an author 14 years
ago, carrying memories of childhood tales of the Essex disaster. As
a little boy in Pittsburgh, Philbrick's uncle and father, both
maritime scholars, would tell him stories of the whale that
destroyed the Nantucket vessel.
</P>
<P>
   So two years ago, when Philbrick, who heads an institute on
maritime tradition in Nantucket, was trying to get Sebastian
Junger, author of ``The Perfect Storm,'' to speak on the island, he
mentioned the idea of writing a book about the Essex to the
author's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy it was a story about a whale, but as an adult who
moved to Nantucket, I began to relate to these men,'' Philbrick
said. ``I began to see what living this tragedy must have been
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in Nantucket, discussions of the Essex and the impending
book can be heard in local coffee houses, and even in a senior
community center.
</P>
<P>
   Sarcasm about cannibalism is common on the island: ``You mean
the story about our ancestors eating our other ancestors,'' quipped
a local waitress as she served lunch to her customers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Atlantic Cafe, a popular tavern, Peter Eldridge, a
burly carpenter, sipped a beer and defended the actions of the
Essex survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time ago,'' he said. ``If you strip off our
clothes and put us out there _ we are all animals. It would be no
different if the people had been from anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Eldridge, the survivors, especially the doomed
captain, are heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that the survivors saw it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The first mate, Chase, went on to become a successful seaman,
one of the wealthier captains on Nantucket. But in his twilight
years, memories of cannibalism began to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   The feeble old man, still living on the island, would order
twice the amount of groceries needed for his prosperous household _
enough food for an entire ship's crew _ and hoard it in the attic,
so he would never grow hungry.
</P>
<P>
   He died insane.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PASADENA, Calif.: ... ``Where's that?''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The questions come at nearly every campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vice President, when was the last time you talked to
President Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, three or four days ago,'' responds Gore, who once boasted
of his daily conversations. He can't recall what they talked about.
He says he has not had lunch with the president in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When a voter vaguely asks about the ``mess'' in Washington, Gore
interprets the question as a reference to Clinton's sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment that you feel. I've felt it
myself,'' Gore says, as he frequently does in response to questions
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a White House deal on world trade that has upset
advocates of abortion rights, Gore says he doesn't know what
``they'' have been doing, as if he had nothing to do with the White
House actions.
</P>
<P>
   Distancing himself from Clinton is a most uncomfortable act for
this man who has boasted that he is among the most involved vice
presidents in history and who says Clinton will be remembered as
one of the greatest presidents. Asked in an interview to name four
or five things he will do differently than Clinton, Gore is
reluctant to answer directly. Instead, he mentions that he has put
out his own plans on health care, education, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's pitch seems effective in his favorite setting, the
town hall meeting. After Gore has spent two hours answering
questions from undecided voters at one such event in Nashua, N.H.,
many citizens say afterward that they like what they hear and see.
Gore is sympathetic, kneeling on one knee when a particularly
thoughtful question is posed by a child. Nothing seems to stump
him; everything seems to intrigue him.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, those who have seen Gore in person say he is little
like the caricature they had expected. ``He's not like they say on
the David Letterman show,'' one voter says after the Nashua
meeting. ``Or Jay Leno,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1988, and the 39-year-old upstart from Tennessee
declared that he was ready to be president. Gore proclaimed himself
a ``screaming moderate.'' During his first eight years in Congress,
he had vowed to fight federal funding for abortions and often was
portrayed as being antiabortion.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire Senate career, the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action gave him a modest 66 percent rating. By
comparison, the ADA said Bradley voted ``correctly'' 85 percent of
the time during his 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may no longer be a screaming moderate, and he now is
unmistakably in favor of abortion rights, Bradley has thrived by
running to Gore's left _ where many of the votes are in the early,
activist-heavy primaries. It is remarkably similar to the strategy
that former governor Michael S. Dukakis used against Gore in
winning the 1988 Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore participated in primary debates in 1988, he was
desperate. It was Gore, not then-Vice President George Bush, who
first brought up the issue of Dukakis's program of weekend
furloughs for a convicted murderer. It was an accusation that,
months later, would resurface in the bluntly effective ``revolving
prison door'' Bush campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Gore eventually ceded Iowa and New Hampshire to Dukakis. The
Tennessee senator expected to win by sweeping the South, but he
lost Texas and Florida, and soon afterward dropped out of the race.
As he left, more than a few critics said he had failed to
articulate what a Gore presidency would accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Gore has devoted huge resources in Iowa and
New Hampshire, and has begun a concerted effort to win the liberal
vote. The vice president has switched from rarely mentioning
Bradley to making daily charges against him. Gore, who in 1992 said
he would be Clinton's ``attack dog,'' now is adopting that role for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, Gore makes his most serious charge yet against
Bradley, by saying the former New Jersey senator's health insurance
plan ``has a disproportionate impact on African-Americans and
Latinos.'' Gore, noting that Bradley's plan would replace Medicaid
with a health care voucher system, charged that the proposal would
cap certain benefits and especially hurt minorities because they
depend more on Medicaid than others.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack is part of an effort to turn the tables on Bradley
and convince activists that Gore has a greater natural claim to the
liberal base.
</P>
<P>
   But this strategy has upset some party moderates, who believe it
could be disastrous in the general election. The moderate
Democratic Leadership Council, which Gore helped found, said in a
memo last week that Gore's emphasis on attracting liberal voters
will lead to a repeat of the Dukakis loss of 1988. The memo said
Gore's strategy ignores ``young voters, wired workers, upwardly
mobile suburbanites, and political independents.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day last August, Gore arrived secretly in Seattle with his
son, Albert III, 17, who nearly died in an auto accident as a
6-year-old. Gore wanted to fulfill a lifelong ambition to climb
14,411-foot Mount Rainier, an arduous climb that requires a full
complement of technical gear, including crampons, ropes, helmets,
ice axes, and belays. Gore climbed incognito, wearing a baseball
cap and sunglasses, chatting briefly with climbers who didn't
realize who he was.
</P>
<P>
   The climb was far more difficult than reported. Gore was tied to
his son and other partners by a rope as ice, hail, and snow pelted
the mountain, which was buffeted by high winds and 20-degree
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   There were two climbing teams. The larger advance team, composed
of Secret Service agents, park rangers, and a military aide, felt
conditions were too dangerous and turned around at Disappointment
Cleaver, well below the summit.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if the climb would end. But Gore, now left with a
much smaller group, told his climbing partner, Seattle lawyer James
Frush, that he wanted to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do anything stupid, but I'd like to get to the
top,'' Gore told Frush.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore, carrying 65 pounds of gear on his back, struggled
onward with the small team. After crawling into a crevasse for
shelter, the group made it to the peak. A jubilant Gore slapped his
son on the back and then radioed his family that he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to overemphasize the danger, but I didn't have
any spare brain capacity other than to get up and down the
mountain,'' Gore says now.
</P>
<P>
   Frush, the president of the American Alpine Climb and a Gore
campaign volunteer, said the journey was not only dangerous, but
also transforming for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climbing is a crucible,'' Frush said. ``It gives you a
perspective on your life and your goals. It either makes people or
it breaks them. If more people could see that side of him, this
would not even be a close race.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore reached the bottom, word had spread about his climb,
and a group of hikers began chanting, ``Gore for president, Gore
for president!'' The vice president lifted his ice ax into the air.
``This,'' Gore said, ``is the hardest way I ever saw to get a
vote.''

THEATER OF DREAMS, THEATER OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longer one looks at the list of great 20th-century
playwrights, the clearer it becomes who the father of modern
theater is.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Ibsen preceded him, but it's Freud who unlocked the door
to the unconscious, and every major playwright of the 20th century
walked right in to explore our dreams, our identity (or lack of
same), our family dysfunctions, our concept of civilization and its
discontents, even our belief that there will be a Godot to answer
our prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century drama can be divided into two camps that
aren't as mutually exclusive as their strictest adherents like to
believe: The theater of dreams and the theater of reality. Freud's
influence is most apparent in the theater of dreams, from August
Strindberg's ``The Dream Play'' to Robert Wilson's multimedia,
nonlinear epics like ``the CIVIL warS: a tree is best measured when
it's down.'' As Robert Brustein _ the artistic director of the
American Repertory Theatre and one of the foremost champions of a
less naturalistic theater _ said in a Globe interview, ``My
aesthetic has to do with plays that do touch on the dream life in
some way and that don't leave us alone after they're over. They
follow us home and invade our dreams, invade our sleep and haunt
us, and I don't think the more intellectual, witty dramatists do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century dreamscapes would take any number of forms _
expressionism, absurdism, surrealism. Italy's Luigi Pirandello
would question the very nature of reality in 1921's ``Six
Characters in Search of an Author,'' while France's Eugene Ionesco
would turn reality on its head in ``The Chairs'' (1921) and
``Rhinoceros'' (1960). In all these plays the audience is asked to
watch characters whose ego is stripped bare. The more the nature of
identity is explored the less there is of it. But it was Samuel
Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot'' in 1955, set in a postnuclear
anytime, that raised the most depressing question: What if we are
here alone in a universe without meaning, every quest we undertake
a fool's errand, every hope we have an illusion? Beckett's
influence would be pervasive: Variants of Vladimir and Estragon
from ``Godot'' could be found in the works of such disparate
playwrights as Harold Pinter, Athol Fugard, David Mamet, and Tom
Stoppard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, Beckett (like many other playwrights like
him) doesn't work unless the director captures his almost slapstick
humor. Otherwise he can be as boring as someone holding a placard
warning that the end is nigh. If Beckett took language in the
theater as far as it could go before becoming meaningless, schools
of directors arose who believed the language was not necessarily
the most important element of a theater production. Set design,
movement, lighting, costumes, music, were equally and _ in the case
of the ultimate auteur director, Robert Wilson _ even more
important. Narrative broke down altogether in a deconstructed world
where an individual's experience of, say, Wilson's adaptation of
``When We Dead Awaken'' was just as valid as Wilson's and far more
valid than Ibsen's. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Equally Freudian &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of circumstances, Beckett and his fellow
surrealists aren't exactly boffo box office, which raises the
question of whether they should be. Were the days when serious
plays _ like those by Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee
Williams _ appeared on Broadway an aberration?
</P>
<P>
   These playwrights followed in the more naturalistic traditions
of Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw, and Anton Chekhov. But are these
playwrights any less Freudian than their expressionistic brethren?
The secrets that people within and without families suppress are
bursting off their pages, with often tragic results. Ibsen, Shaw,
and Miller were more interested than Strindberg, Chekhov, and
Williams in the political world around them, but if they were not
so adept at finding psychological dimensions to their political
revolt their work would not be any better than the agitprop that
limits lesser political playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was actually after a less naturalistic mode of theater
himself, but not one that left the theatergoer scratching his or
her head. He wrote a blistering attack on abstractionism and its
critical champions in Harper's magazine last year. While noting how
tough it is to mount a serious play of any kind on Broadway, he
railed against the trend of dismissing any work that is accessible
to audiences. ``Realism is now a put-down; poetic is praise.
Experimental is attractive; traditional is not. Metaphorical is
intriguing, though perhaps not so much as lyrical, non-linear,
dreamlike, and surreal. It is almost as if realism can hardly be
poetic, or as if the poetic is not, at its best, more real then the
merely realistic and, at its worst, more conventional beneath its
elusive or unfathomable skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturalism and accessibility, certainly, are no barrier to a
searing theatrical experience, as evidenced by last year's revivals
of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' and Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman.'' O'Neill actually predates Beckett's concerns about
living one's life in an illusion of meaningfulness. It may be
stretching things to call ``The Iceman Cometh'' accessible, but
audiences don't need a road map to see where O'Neill was going.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was the godfather of American drama, and one can see the
distorted family dynamics, the Freudian rebellion against parents,
informing the plays of Miller, Williams, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard,
August Wilson, and Christopher Durang. They would have stumbled
across family dysfunction with or without O'Neill, or Freud for
that matter, but O'Neill _ himself reaching back to Strindberg _
set the standards for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, similarly, has been the gold standard in England and
Ireland, both for the theater of ideas (Stoppard, John Osborne) and
for the comedy of manners (Noel Coward, Alan Ayckbourn). He and
Anton Chekhov are the most-often-produced serious playwrights in
England and the United States because they still manage to startle
us with the psychological acuity of their characters, along with a
profound parsing of the social situations in which they find
themselves. In the right hands their plays are as modern as
Stoppard's. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An alternative reality &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We analyze our dreams, of course, to better appreciate our
waking consciousness. To enter the theater in the first place is to
seek an altered consciousness. The difference between the two
schools, then, is not as great as it might seem. The protagonists
of ``Death of a Salesman'' and Williams's ``The Glass Menagerie''
are lost in their dreams, or memories, which are almost the same
thing in their cases. O'Neill's experiments in expressionism, like
``The Hairy Ape,'' are produced so rarely that one might forget
them were it not for troupes like the Wooster Group. He tended not
to mix the two, but Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka is known for
doing just that, as is Bertolt Brecht.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some of the most memorable productions at the
ART have mixed the naturalism of Shaw, Chekhov, O'Neill, and Ibsen
with an attempt at bringing their psychological interiors to the
surface through expressionistic and other means. And a good part of
the allure of musical theater is the strange mix of naturalistic
action interrupted by breaking out into song, although that form is
at a crossroads. Developed by Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, and the
Gershwins, and fine-tuned by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
II, it has devolved into a situation of outright commercialism on
the one hand and overartiness on the other. A tune-challenged
legion of Stephen Sondheim wannabes have been unable to match his
quasi-operatic successes; in general, Sondheim's influence has
probably been a negative, despite his brilliance. There is still
something special about a great musical, though, and perhaps
``Ragtime'' and Julie Taymor's contributions to ``The Lion King''
point a way to giving voice to both our dreams and reality.
Considering, however, that Livent, the company that made
``Ragtime,'' went bankrupt, we may never see as good a musical
again anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   As for the straight play, at the end of the century there still
seems to be a split between the verbal pyrotechnics of August
Wilson and Tom Stoppard (playwrights not so coincidentally
championed by the Huntington Theatre Company) and the more kinetic
theater of auteur directors like Robert Wilson and Andrei Serban.
It seems less important to declare a winner than to hope for a
vigorous competition.

<P>
   ! 1/2 ``End of Days'' Crude and stupid, even for an Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie, this one sends him up against Gabriel Byrne's
devil, who has all the fun, setting off explosions with a smirk.
Think of it as Hollywood's very own Y2K bug. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Flawless'' A down-and-dirty winner, this updated throwback to
gritty NYC crime melodramas rides the high-voltage duet of Robert
De Niro's bank guard and Philip Seymour Hoffman's tough and
street-smart drag queen. They live in the same seedy residential
hotel, and form an unlikely bond when De Niro turns to Hoffman for
voice lessons as part of his therapy in recovering from a stroke.
(R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FD) !!! ``Mansfield Park'' Jane Austen's winning streak at the
movies continues. This adaptation takes more liberties than usual,
but emerges sparklingly and intelligently as it tells the usual
Austen story of a war between love and money. It's glory is
Australian actress Frances O'Connor's diamond-bright performance as
discerning, steadfast Austen stand-in and poor relation Fanny
Price. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Rosetta'' Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne compassionately
and restlessly track a desperate Belgian teen who lives in a
trailer park with an alcoholic mom and craves a job so she can
start putting her life on track. Emilie Duquenne is compelling as
the fierce Rosetta in a film that touches us because it allows us
to feel her internal struggle to stay connected to her essential
goodness as she fights to rise out of the socio-economic muck. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Toy Story 2'' Everything you could want in a sequel. This
revisiting of the landmark 1995 computer-animated hit reunites
nice-guy cowboy Woody (voice: Tom Hanks) and gung-ho space hero
Buzz (voice: Tim Allen). It goes more places and does more things,
thanks to enhanced computer capability, as Buzz and the toys from
Andy's room try to rescue Woody. Stolen because he's a valuable
collectible, Woody's conflicted when he meets up with his puppet
pals from his old TV show. (G)

THE POLITICAL, THE PERSONAL AND THE FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1900, on the cusp of the 20th century, the philosopher Henri
Bergson published ``Laughter,'' an essay in which he proposed the
idea that comedy makes us human in the midst of the dehumanizing
effects of a mechanized society.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century later, comedy is threatened by the dehumanizing
effects of network television, particularly situation comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Television comedy is the comedy of commercials, compromise, and
celebrity where seven digit salaries are the pay-off for smoothing
the edges and straightening the curves.
</P>
<P>
   Live stand-up is the antidote to television. A comic. A stage. A
microphone. No big production. Just a single voice, speaking from
experience, and going for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and George Carlin stand as the triple
threat of American stand-up. Questioning the culture and attacking
sacred cows while putting their careers on the line, this trio
symbolizes cultural comedy at its best. They played for laughs, and
for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lenny Bruce, comics told jokes. Mother-in-law jokes.
Farmer's daughter's jokes. Wife and husband jokes. It's a long
tradition that found its modern roots in vaudeville. When Bruce
came along, comedy, for the first time in American popular culture,
became dangerous. When Bruce pointed out religious and political
hypocrisy, people laughed but it left an aftertaste. The same sort
of spicy flavor left by his successors Pryor and Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, before audiences ranging from 15 to 2,000,
I've heard black comics poke fun at white people, female comics
deride their male counterparts, Catholics poke fun at Jews, and
Jews poke fun at Protestants, and they all poke fun at Muslims. Fat
comics poke fun at skinny comics. The Irish poke fun of the
Italians and the Italians poke fun at the Poles and the Poles poke
fun at themselves. There's a lot of poking. And a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only enemy we have is political correctness,'' says Jackie
Mason, now preparing his latest Broadway show. ``Censorship is the
enemy of comedy. Let me decide what's funny and let the audience
decide whether they think it's funny. Let them vote with silence or
laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedy has always been intertwined with politics and culture. In
his thoughtful book on comedy, ``Subversive Laughter,''
Cambridge-based Ron Jenkins, who holds a master's degree in
Clowning from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Clown
College, writes, ``The cultural dynamics that have contributed to
the increasing detachment of American comedy can be seen in the
evolution of Afro-American humor.'' Jenkins goes on to describe the
evolution of Richard Pryor's career from the safety of appearing
with Merv Griffin to his breakthrough 1976 album, ``Bicentennial
Nigger.'' On that recording, Pryor presents an American history
lesson that's simultaneously uproarious and appalling, particularly
with his monologue of a slave coming to America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past half century, comedy's greatest cash cow has also
become its greatest enemy _ network television.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Ed Sullivan was television's kingmaker. His
Sunday night show was aimed directly at the heart of middle
America. A regular Sullivan guest was Mason _ a Borscht Belt comic
delivering humor to the Bread Belt. When Mason, who was getting big
laughs, went over time, Sullivan cut him off. The story goes that
Sullivan believed Mason flipped him the bird and Mason watched his
career, as he put it, ``go down the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   That singular image _ when TV's demands defeated stand-up's art
_ became a defining moment in American comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy wasn't king. TV was.
</P>
<P>
   The situation comedy popularized laugh tracks, phony
pre-recorded laughs injected by engineers and used to bolster
comics who weren't getting big enough laughs by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Roseanne's career. Remember when she was funny? As a
stand-up, her material was organic _ nurtured by her life as a
put-upon, but tough, housewife. When they made her a TV star,
playing a put-upon, tough, housewife, she got further and further
away from the inner creativity that initially drove her and more
dependent on writers. Her personality became a persona. Bill Cosby
and Bob Newhart made the transition because the characters they
played on television were extensions of their stand-up personae _
essentially, the situation comedy audience in their living rooms
was just an expansion of the crowds that made their summer stock
shows sell out each year. Neither Newhart nor Cosby had to make
much of an accommodation to television.
</P>
<P>
   The economic, psychological, and cultural tension occurs when a
comic such as Richard Jeni, pound for pound one of the great
stand-ups, is offered TV money. In exchange for the salary and time
spent off the road, Jeni allowed his unique edge to be sanded down
and smoothed over when he starred in the woeful series ``Platypus
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's (television) the difference between being rich
and having to work for a living,'' says Jeni. But the price is
high.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Jimmy Tingle. Those of us who have seen Tingle perform
live in both his stand-up and one-man shows know that he filters
his ``60 Minutes II'' routines through CBS management. His
razor-sharp comedy has been dulled by the requirements of TV. His
commentaries have been criticized as soft, something fans of
Tingle's know he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, as television _ with the exception of cable,
particularly HBO, which fosters stand-up with its specials _
becomes more homogenized, stand-up becomes more artistically
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up comedy is one of the last vestiges of free
expression,'' says Carlin. ``We need it. Now, more than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrice O'Neal, one of the best stand-ups, resists playing TV
because ``they want me to play a fat, black guy and do fat, black
guy material.'' And while O'Neal could use the dough, he resists,
content to follow his own more dangerous, insecure path. Unlike so
many comics, his goal isn't to have a sit-com deal.
</P>
<P>
   In his afterward to a recent edition of Bergson's ``Laughter,''
the late Simmons College scholar, Wylie Sypher, notes, ``we have
lived amid the dust and crashes of the twentieth century and have
learned how the direst calamities that befall man seem to prove
that human life at its depths is inherently absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy is one of the few arenas where individual expression is
pure,'' he says. ``It may not be funny. It may not be provocative.
But it should be personal. There's something wonderfully simple
about a voice, a body, and a microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next century, we'll see if stand-up comedy can survive
in an over-televised society.

MTV'S ATTEMPT AT HARMONIC CONVERGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four contestants are suspended on spherical chairs that hang
like miniature meteors on a futuristic set. Their eyes are glued on
host Ahmet Zappa, who is projected on a gigantic screen.
Fashionably bald with a polished pate and aerodynamic glasses, the
animated Zappa pushes his face right up to the camera and does a
shout-out for the folks at home. ``Log on. Do it now,'' he says,
with a kind of ironic urgency. This is, he announces, ``the only
game show where you get to play naked.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-air contenders, who go by such cyber nicknames as
VidKitten, D'Lite, and Flirtz a Lot, are suitably clothed for the
MTV universe, but the folks playing along at home could, in fact,
be competing in the buff. That's part of the zany appeal of
``webRIOT,'' the first interactive game show that allows viewers to
play along on the Internet at MTV.com. The weekday music trivia
show, which debuts on MTV  &UR; today &LR;  at 5 p.m., allows some 50,000
at-home viewers to compete for prizes as they answer the same
questions as the on-air contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, game-show enthusiasts have been playing along at home
for years, screaming answers like ``Who is John Galt?'' and advice
like ``Buy a vowel!'' at their television sets. But with
``webRIOT,'' the answers at home actually count.
</P>
<P>
   The program is an experiment in convergence, the term for the
merging of television and Web programming. As more and more
television viewers go on line, entertainment executives are racing
to find ways to bring the two mediums together. An estimated 23
percent of American households have a computer and television in
the same room, according to a recent study by Paul Kagan Associates
and Showtime Networks, and that number is sure to grow. But past
attempts at convergence have delivered lots of hype and little
substance, doing nothing more than combining taped sitcoms with
live, on-line chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV effort pushes the interactivity a bit further while also
attempting to bring together the enthusiasm for such on-line games
as ``You Don't Know Jack'' with the attitude and swagger of hip-hop
and rap. Zappa, a live wire who admits a fondness for caffeine,
courts the viewers at home with his irreverent patter. Yet he knows
there is something contrived about conducting a conversation with
the cyber audience; the show is taped, so the at-home contestants
are playing ``live'' against a taped broadcast. ``When I do a
shoutout like, `Hey, all you gamers in Cincinnati!' I know it's not
the lamest thing, but it's pretty close,'' Zappa says during a
telephone interview from the ``webRIOT'' studio in Los Angeles. ``I
try to make it entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which will air Monday through Friday, is produced and
taped like most other game shows, although MTV is showing two
different versions on the East and West coasts, which will go on at
different times. ``That's to minimize cheating,'' says Rick
Holzman, vice president of MTV Online. ``We don't want you to be
able to call your friend in Sheboygan for the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is set up to accommodate 25,000 on-line competitors
each for both the East and West coast segments; it also
accommodates players at any connection speed. The top 10 players at
home are announced in a graphic at the end of the show, which
includes other ``live'' graphics recognizing what's happening in
the on-line game. Bright-colored windows pop up on the television
screen to report the on-line activity: In the pilot, these
informational boxes included tidbits like ``USC Grl had two perfect
games in a row. Higher education pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is designed to look like a computer screen with
multiple windows. On the television screen, music videos by such
artists as TLC and the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in one window
while the contestants answer trivia questions about the featured
artists. Factoids pop up in separate windows at appropriate times;
during a Beastie Boys video, the screen flashed this gem: ``The
Supreme Court has never officially recognized the right to party.''
</P>
<P>
   The show tries to blend geek humor and youth culture. The grand
prize for the on-line players is a 2000 Volkswagen Beetle _ or as
Zappa says, a Y2K Bug. On ``webRIOT,'' it's cool to be a nerd.
``I'm a total loser,'' says Zappa, 25. ``I love e-mail, and I love
the Internet.'' He also loves playing the role of cyberhost, both
on and off camera. ``I'm a robot from the future programmed to make
`webRIOT' the most infectious show on the planet,'' he says.
``People are going to catch it like a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a pitch. The host goes on to say that his father,
the late rocker Frank Zappa, landed on another planet and beamed
him back to Earth. The young Zappa will tell you a lot of things,
but he'll also tell you he is ``totally making all this stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   He is claiming to be an android because the show is aiming for a
futuristic feel. At the same time, it is exploiting the
old-fashioned game-show genre that is so popular this season with
the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would mistake Zappa for ``Millionaire'' host Regis
Philbin, but he does admit an affection for old quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child I watched them all the time, and I'm peachy pleased
with the whole scenario,'' he says. ``I'm a huge fan of `Press Your
Luck,' `The Price Is Right,' `Let's Make a Deal.' `Tic Tac Dough'
was the best _ and `The Joker's Wild.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``WebRIOT'' is a kind of retro-futuristic-musical hybrid _ ``The
Jetsons'' meet ``Jeopardy.'' But it's still unclear if the on-line
part will work. In January, when ABC tried to synchronize a
televised college bowl game with a Web program, the experiment was
an exercise in frustration because most viewers couldn't access the
Web site. That's why MTV capped the number of contestants _ to
avoid logjams, says Holzman.
</P>
<P>
   MTV has been working up to ``webRIOT'' with experiments in
convergent programming, such as an on-line auction of items from
the ``Real World'' set and a discontinued show called ``Yak Live,''
which let viewers chat on line as they watched music videos on
television. The network faces increasing competition for young
viewers, as on-line entertainment companies like Den.net and
Pseudo.com offer Web programming. Everybody in Hollywood, in fact,
is trying to figure out how to bring their existing products into
the virtual world. But Den, in particular, is aggressively trying
to become ``the MTV of the Y Generation.'' So far, most attempts at
on-line entertainment have simply mimicked television, and it's not
clear yet if ``webRIOT'' is any different. Naturally, Holzman
thinks it is. ``Everyone else wants to be the MTV of the Internet,
but MTV is the MTV of the Internet,'' he says.

`WILD WILD WEST' BAD, BAD; `LIMBO' IS GOOD SAYLES

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Wild Wild West'' (DVD) _ For fans of the Robert
Conrad-Ross Martin TV show, this feature was especially annoying.
While the show used oxymoronic inventions, it was basically a
character-driven drama. The overloaded special effects in this dud
can't be saved _ even by Will Smith. Some of the TV episodes are
out on video. Rent them instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' _ Director John Sayles was heavily criticized for his
enigmatic ending to this two-souls-in-the-wilderness story, but
that's precisely what makes this film one of his best. David
Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are a pair of lost souls
whose inner journey is more dangerous than being lost in Alaska.

   STRAIGHT-TO-VIDEO: Usually, a film released directly to video is
scarred for life, branded as second-rate by consumers. That's
usually justified. But not in the case of ``Bartok the
Magnificent,'' a semi-sequel to the animated ``Anastasia'' (1997).
Bartok is a sharply drawn, witty bat whose vocals are performed by
longtime ``Simpsons'' voicesmith Hank Azaria. The voice of Zozi the
Bear is done by Kelsey Grammer. Fox wisely retained ``Anastasia''
director Don Bluth, and the animation is first-rate. It's so well
crafted, Fox might try releasing it to theaters after its home
video run. That would be a switch.

THE UGLY `AMERICAN BEAUTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reviewers have lavished some of their highest praise this year
on ``American Beauty,'' the Sam Mendes film anchored by two of the
screen's most intelligent actors, Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.
Its subject _ the profound dysfunction of the American family _ is
always timely, if not particularly original. So the package will no
doubt be a contender for statues on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something went very wrong here. The performances of Spacey
and Bening, which unfold with perfect pitch, mutate into the
grotesque. The film implodes into a parody of itself and collapses
under the weight of overwriting and overacting. It tries to be both
a comedy and a profound look at suburbia. Because it reached for
both, it failed at each.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Spacey's brains are plastered al dente on his
kitchen wall _ an unneccessary display of organ tissue _ every
character in the movie has lost his or her shape. They end up
resembling distorted faces in a fun house mirror, initially amusing
but ultimately revolting. If this was Mendes's intention, he could
have achieved it with a discipline and a spareness utterly lacking
in this film. What we are left with is an intriguing,
self-indulgent mess.
</P>
<P>
   Why the raves from serious critics? Perhaps because of the
paucity of quality films this year. Quick, what are the class acts
of 1999? Where is the ``Saving Private Ryan'' or ``Shakespeare In
Love''? ``American Beauty'' was a brave project that descended into
bathos as it progressed. Still, how many efforts have there been
recently that even attempted to scale such heights? Critics are
suckers for such stabs, and this film is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is referred to as a comedy, but it ceases to be funny
long before it ends. Its emotional and physical violence is coarse,
and there is too much of it: marital disintegration, homophobia,
homosexuality, teenage and adult drug use, adultery, promiscuity,
all-purpose anomie. Is there anything I missed here?
</P>
<P>
   Some womhave seen the film complain that it is
misogynist, that all of the women in it are portrayed in an
unflattering way. Yet most of the men fare no better. The only
happy people appear to be the two gay neighbors who bring a welcome
basket to the door of the twisted Marine colonel, overplayed by the
fine actor Chris Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Truly harrowing screen relationships are powerful. Witness the
torque of Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' The
entire cast, Richard Burton in particular, reduces us to aspic.
Really good movies like that don't need to spell out every shard of
dysfunction presented in ``American Beauty'' to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have its moments. The home movie footage taken by
the colonel's son, played by Wes Bentley, of an empty pastic bag
blowing in a vacant wind is mesmerizing. Bening's contributions to
the motel sex she has with Peter Gallagher, a fellow realtor in the
film whose license plate reads ``R.E. KING,'' are heroic. Spacey,
as always, is droll and distant. We accept that he is in on a
cosmic joke he will never share with us. He has earned that
latitude. And Thora Birch, who plays his daughter, Jane, is often
excellent as a tortured, untethered teen.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't need Spacey to give up his career for a fast-food
job, trade his Camry for a vintage red Firebird, start pumping iron
and smoking dope to grasp that he craves to rekindle his lost
youth. Any two of those would have done fine. Bening need not
clutch a pistol while listening to a motivational tape about power
and control in her Mercedes SUV to convince us that she is
contemplating something extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper truly did not need to blow Spacey's head off at
point-blank range, and his kid could have toned down his addictive
filming of Spacey's daughter, Jane, with his hand-held camera. The
unmasking of Jane's friend, Angela, from man-eating vixen to
insecure virgin had nothing much to do with anything. All in all,
this is a stew that gives heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps superior actors like Spacey and Bening will continue to
seduce us against our better instincts when they work in such
flawed productions. They are, after all, such joys to watch. But we
should resist such laxity. We can adore them without losing our
bead on the movies they make. ``American Beauty'' is no American
beauty.

JOHN ADAMS LISTENS TO HIS OWN PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon made headlines when he went to China in 1972,
and John Adams and Alice Goodman made headlines 15 years later when
they made an opera about that historic journey. The production of
``Nixon in China'' Peter Sellars created for the Houston Grand
Opera went round the world, and it made its composer famous in some
quarters, notorious in others.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically there has not been a complete performance of
``Nixon in China'' in New York since its debut season. This week
Robert Spano leads concert performances of the opera with the
Brooklyn Philharmonic and two members of the original cast, James
Maddalena (Nixon) and Thomas Hammons (Henry Kissinger).
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn performances coincide with Nonesuch's release of
``The John Adams Earbox,'' a 10-CD celebration of the composer's
unparalleled 14-year association with the label. The box collects
most of Nonesuch's Adams recordings, along with a new recording of
``Harmonium,'' and two previously unrecorded works, ``Slonimsky's
Earbox'' and ``Lollapalooza.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Adams came onto the phone from the Nonesuch offices to
talk about his career as a ``California composer'' who was born in
Worcester (Feb. 15, 1947) and whose education included six years at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Harvard from 1965 to 1971, the turbulent years, in
the thick of it all,'' Adams says. ``The month before I graduated
as an undergraduate was when Harvard Yard was invaded by the Boston
Police. I didn't occupy University Hall, but I did march, and I was
once chased down Mass Ave. by a cop from Brockton. It was like a
duck shoot for the police. I was bonked on the backside and I lost
my glasses, but I have no real stripes to show for the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams describes his academic experiences with some care. ``There
were key people who were very meaningful to me, above and beyond
all, Luise Vosgerchian. I met her before I went to Harvard, when I
was still a high school kid, at a summer course up at Darmouth. She
discovered me. I had a lot of weaknesses. I was not really a
pianist, not really a clarinetist, but she was able to see whatever
was there in its embryonic form, and she encouraged me. That's why
I still feel an enormous affection and gratitude towards her.
Later, during my time at Harvard, I came into contact with Leon
Kirchner, and he is so strong a figure that it was impossible not
to be influenced by him in one way or another. We still stay in
touch today.''
</P>
<P>
   During his Harvard period, Adams says he was more active as a
conductor than as a composer. ``One of my events there was a
production of `The Marriage of Figaro' in Leverett House that I
conducted. It was directed by John Lithgow, and one of the sopranos
was Lucy Shelton. I also conducted the Bach Society Orchestra,
which provided an opportunity which no other university or
conservatory in the country offers; I could do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams says he began composing ``in earnest'' during his senior
year. ``This was the period of high modernism. The faculty was torn
between Schoenberg and Stravinsky; that was the big issue. Webern,
if not consciously, at least obliquely, was held up to us as a
model of what a composer should be. I was experiencing severe
cognitive dissonance between Paine Hall and Harvard Square. This
was a time, between 1968 and '71, when I could encounter some of
the greatest pop music ever produced. I even wrote rock criticism
for The Crimson, and I realized, `Now wait a moment, there's a
major split going on here.' On the one hand, I was being a good boy
and writing what was expected of me; on the other hand, what I
really loved was far looser, more in touch with American culture,
and more expressive of what it means to be an American living at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was inevitable. ``I fled in my Volkswagen bug. I went
to San Francisco, where the only person I knew was the late
composer Ivan Tcherepnin, who was teaching at the San Francisco
Conservatory. Ivan was one of the dearest people I have ever known.
I found a job on the waterfront, working in a warehouse in Oakland.
I had a year of being a blue-collar worker and then I realized I
was not going to be able to make an Ivesian career out of composing
on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually Adams began to discover his voice. He taught and
conducted new-music concerts at the San Francisco Conservatory; he
composed his first ``minimalist'' works, ``Phrygian Gates'' for
piano and ``Shaker Loops'' for string septet. He made a connection
with Edo de Waart, who appointed him new-music adviser for the San
Francisco Symphony, and in 1981 he composed ``Harmonium.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Recording relationship &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The connection with Nonesuch came in 1984, thanks to
``Harmonium.'' ``That's when I met Bob Hurwitz, who runs the
company. Back then he was working for ECM, which is mostly a jazz
label, the label of Keith Jarrett. But the company wanted to branch
out and do some new orchestral music. They sent Bob out to San
Francisco when the first performance of `Harmonium' was going on,
and we made the first recording. Within a year, Bob had moved over
to Nonesuch, and I was one of the first people he called. He
proposed a long-term relationship, on the model of what Stravinsky
had had at Columbia Records, but I think my relationship with
Nonesuch has been far better than either Stravinsky or Aaron
Copland enjoyed with Columbia. Nonesuch has been absolutely
faithful and devoted, and they have recorded the good, the bad, and
the ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording of ``Harmonium'' with de Waart and the San
Francisco Symphony was on ECM, never on Nonesuch, so there is a new
recording, with Adams himself conducting the San Francisco Symphony
and Chorus, in the ``Earbox.'' The set includes highlights from the
complete recordings of ``Nixon in China'' and ``The Death of
Klinghoffer,'' as well as the single disc of ``I Was Looking At The
Ceiling and Then I Saw The Sky,'' which was never recorded
complete.
</P>
<P>
   One controversial scene from ``The Death of Klinghoffer,'' the
Klinghoffer family gathered around the television console, was
never recorded, and Adams has dropped it from the score. ``I lopped
it off, not only because it was unnecessarily controversial and
misleading, but it also made the first act ridiculously long. And
it didn't add to the gravity of the work. My only fear is that one
day somebody like Roger Norrington will unearth it and peform it!
Pierre Boulez once said that the worst thing he could imagine would
be to recreate the premiere of his `Le Marteau sans Maitre.' ''
</P>
<P>
   All three Adams operas were first staged by Peter Sellars, and
Sellars has been involved in one of Adams's big, new upcoming
projects, an oratorio about the life of Christ that will be
premiered next December in Paris. ``It can be done as a fully
staged work or as an oratorio. With Peter there is some deep
chemistry that seems to work despite the fact we fight tooth and
nail every inch of the way, particularly once we get up on stage.
My past is as a lapsed Episcopalian, but one of the few rituals I
love is the Christmas season. I think this story is something I
have always wanted to do, and something he might like to stage, the
way he staged Stravinsky's `Oedipus Rex.' The texts are all by
Hispanic women _ Mexican, Nicaraguan, Chilean _ along with the King
James Version of the Bible. Alice Goodman was originaly involved
with this project too, but had to withdraw, but I want to say how
fervently I hope to work with her again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon'' is due for a new staging in London and later in San
Francisco. ``There will also be a new production of `Klinghoffer'
in Finland, so despite what you may read in The New York Times, the
opera is alive and healthy. My feeling about opera is that writing
one is a little like buying a long-term bond. There is so little
room in the repertory, that it takes time, often several
generations, for a new work to break in. Look at Leonard
Bernstein's `Candide' and how much ridicule that took before it
started being done. It was completely dormant at the time I was
growing up, but now of course it is recognized as an important part
of the American repertory.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Major minimalist &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adams was a key figure in the so-called ``minimalist school,''
although he wrote comparatively little purely minimalist music.
``We use handles to describe things, and they are very useful. If I
say `Victorian novel,' you know I am not talking about Joyce.
Minimalism has been a major force in my musical language, and I
don't have a problem with the term; people know what we're talking
about when you use the word, and it is threaded through my music.
Some pieces show more minimalist principles than others. `The Death
of Klinghoffer' was a kind of watershed for me, a very serious
story engaging very heavy issues. Much as I love the minimalist
classics, they operate on a certain level, not superficial _ but on
a narrow emotional band width. I felt absolutely prodded by the
story and by Alice Goodman's text to find a language that was
deeper and more complex, and I took a lot of criticism for that. My
language became less rigorous, more diffuse, more synthetic. I came
out of the opera with a larger, more volatile, compositional
palette, including dissonance, and a more mercurial formal
language. I have followed it with some kind of wacky results.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``wacky'' Adams probably means ``unpredictable.'' The Chamber
Symphony, for example, he describes as ``very good-natured.'' The
Violin Concerto, on the other hand, ``starts off in `Klinghoffer'
mode and then lights off into new territory. My most recent pieces
are `Century Rolls,'' for piano and orchestra, and a big orchestral
piece, `Naive and Sentimental Music.' I'm still so close to these
pieces that I can't tell you where the language has gone or is
going, except that it may be more emphatically tonal than ever.
I've been heartened to see composers of younger generations taking
what I did as a cue for a more embracing synthesis of languages
rather than pursuing any kind of purist or modernist path.''

A CRISP VIEW OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Quentin Crisp, Writer and Actor on Gay Themes, Dies at 90,''
read the headline on The New York Times obituary. He would have
enjoyed his obit's prominent placement _ at the top of the page _
although he might not have appreciated the characterization. True,
he was a writer and an actor, and he was openly and flamboyantly
gay long before it was acceptable, the self-described ``stately
homo of England.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any of these things, he was famous for being himself.
``I am what I am and that's that,'' he said in an interview with
Gyles Brandreth of the Sunday Telegraph a few days before he died.
</P>
<P>
   If style is wit, as he observed, Crisp was one of the most
stylish individuals of his era, the author of countless pointed
epigrams. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --``To know all is not to forgive all. It is to despise
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Live alone. The continued propinquity of another human being
cramps the style after a time, unless that person is someone you
think you love. Then the burden becomes intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Never try to keep up with the Joneses. Drag them down to
your level. It's cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He was often compared to Oscar Wilde, a comparison he did not
relish because he believed that Wilde was ashamed of his own
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp came to Boston in 1981 to promote one of his books, ``How
to Have a Lifestyle.'' In the muted light of the Ritz Bar, he
looked from a distance like a Boston dowager, wrapped in scarves
and flowing garments. His white hair was swept up under a soft
black hat. He wore eye shadow, lipstick, and too much foundation _
a mistake for a man, or a woman, of a certain age, but it was part
of the Crisp style to trowel on makeup. He acquired the habit when
he was young, in London before World War II, when he was developing
an effeminate look and manner that regularly got him beaten up by
strangers, fired from jobs, and thrown out of restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore very little (makeup) at first,'' he told one
interviewer, ``but exhibitionism becomes like a drug. Eventually
you can take a dose that would kill anyone just starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp was born Denis Pratt, the third son of a middle-class
English family. His father was a London solicitor and his mother a
former governess who, he once wrote, ``rightly regarded the
suburbia in which we were compelled to live as a sort of purgatory
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   He was effeminate as a child, ``an object of mild ridicule from
birth,'' a misfit at school. As a young man, he changed his name
and tried several artistic lines of work. For a few months he was a
prostitute. In 1942, he became an art school model, and for the
next 30 years he earned a living posing nude. During these years,
he became a familiar figure in London's bohemian circles. He lived
in a single room, which he never cleaned. ``The dust doesn't get
any worse after three years,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``The Naked Civil Servant,'' was made into a
television film starring John Hurt in 1975. At 66, Crisp became a
celebrity. He launched a career as an actor, in a one-man show
about his life. In 1977, he moved to New York, where he resided
until his death. In England, he said, ``the system is benign and
the people are hostile. In America, the people are friendly and the
system is brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp's life was a study in gay pride, although he insisted that
the term was an oxymoron. He resisted the idea that homosexuality
is ``normal.'' This did nothing to endear Crisp to many in the gay
community, but it was his style never to try to endear himself to
anyone.

atoms together. Ultimately, toward the end of the star's fuel
supply, these reactions can lead to a fantastic explosion called a
supernova. Brissenden says the explosion sends some of the star's
material outward, and some inward. If enough material is sent
inward, it can collapse into a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Some stars don't become supernovas when they die, they just
collapse, and they can produce black holes too.
</P>
<P>
   A non-stellar theory is that gravity starts to draw clouds of
interstellar gas together, ultimately drawing in enough matter so
the mass condenses into a black hole. Astrophysicists think there's
a black hole like this at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Though we can't see them, we can tell black holes are there
because we can see what their gravitational pull is doing to
objects nearby. For example, a black hole in what astronomers call
a binary system, a kind of celestial pas de deux with a normal
star, is pulling material away from the edge of that star and
toward the black hole. That material forms an accretion ring, kind
of like Saturn's rings, around the black hole, since there's too
much matter to be pulled into the black hole all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The material in the accretion ring is hot and gives off light
and X-rays that devices like the Chandra and Hubble telescopes can
detect. Brissenden says ``We can see it right at what we call the
event horizon of the black hole. That's the very edge of the black
hole itself. We can see X-rays from accretion ring material less
than one second before it disappears into the black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   To become a black hole, an object has to be really big. ``It has
to have enough material to be three times heavier than the sun in
order to condense that much,'' Brissenden explains.
</P>
<P>
   Brissenden says the formula for figuring out the size of black
holes is: 2 times G (the gravitational constant) times M (the mass
of the object) divided by C-squared (the speed of light, also a
constant). Applying the formula to determine the size of black
holes to the sun, you get an idea of how incredibly dense a black
hole really is. The entire mass of the sun, which is approximately
870,000 miles wide, would shrink down to 7.45 miles across.

will cede power to the new Northern Ireland government, the
Northern Ireland Assembly, which will run the province, chooses a
Cabinet today. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   NAMIBIA-ELECT (Windhoek) _ A decade after winning independence
from the apartheid regime of neighboring South Africa, Namibians
will go to the polls on Tuesday for a national election that will
be a measure of how far the young country has come in pursuit of
political diversity and how far it has to go. By Henri E. Cauvin.

   BUDGET-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton signs the budget
bill. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-BILL (Washington) _ The budget bill that President
Clinton signed is not the bill that Congress thought it passed.
About 80 percent of the legislative language is missing _ because
of an unusual parliamentary ploy devised by the Senate to shorten
the reading of the bill. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-BOYCOTTS (Washington) _ A roundup: The Supreme Court
agrees to hear the case of Massachusetts defending its law banning
the state from doing business with companies doing business with
Burma. New York City has a similar law. Other cases are also
accepted, including one challenging the sentencing provisions of
New Jersey's hate crime law. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CUBA-CHILD (Miami) _ A 5-year-old Cuban boy who survived a
Thanksgiving Day rafting tragedy by clinging to an inner tube for
two days has become the focus of an international tug-of-war. Cuba
blames the United States for the tragedy and says the child had
been kidnapped by his mother, who died during the voyage. The boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and Cuba's Foreign Ministry have
demanded his return. Gonzalez has filed a complaint with the United
Nations to draw international attention to the issue. By David
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNS-UNION (Undated) _ The National Labor Relations Board,
reversing itself, says that medical interns and residents at
private hospitals can form unions. Public hospital interns already
have unions but those at private hospitals have been banned because
of an earlier NLRB ruling that said interns are students not
employees. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BOOK (New York) _ A small Manhattan publishing house has
agreed to publish 25,000 copies of James Hatfield's controversial
book on George W. Bush, ``Making of an American President.'' The
author stands by the drug charges in the book but admits to his own
prison past. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-CALLS (Undated) _ For Ruth Smith, the telephone call from
prison was a way for her cousin to speak with his dying mother. For
Tulen Rivera, the calls from prison are an opportunity for her
three boys to speak with their father. For Ruby Jackson, speaking
by phone with her imprisoned husband was a chance to talk without
having to spend eight hours on an overnight bus. But for New York
state, like most other states, telephone calls from prison are
something else. They are a way to make money. Under current state
policy, the families of inmates are charged the highest possible
rates for calls from prisons, and most of the money is kept by the
state. By John Sullivan.
</P>

   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)

   BRADLEY-FOREIGN-POLICY (Manchester, N.H.) _ Bill Bradley
outlines his foreign policy ideas. By James Dao.

</P>
<P>

budget.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAROLINA-FLOODS (Undated) _ Scientists fear that the
post-hurricane flood of eastern North Carolina has created an
ecological time bomb, and they fear for the biologically rich
waters that separate the famous Outer Banks from the Carolina
mainland. This complex of sounds, bays and inlets comprises the
second largest estuary in the country, after Chesapeake Bay, and is
one of the nation's most important incubators of marine life.
Rarely have ecologists confronted such a striking example of what
can happen when a first-order natural disturbance is combined with
a first-order disturbance of the natural world by humans. By
William K. Stevens. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COSMOLOGY-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Continued evidence over the
last year that the expansion of the universe is accelerating has
provided fresh new evidence of the distressing finding that
something in the wastelands of space could be pushing against
gravity. So scientists are reluctantly accepting the notion that
something in the most fundamental theories of physics is terribly
wrong. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-POLIO (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: The provocative
theory that AIDS is a manufactured disaster arising from early
testing of the polio vaccine in Africa seemed farfetched when it
first came to public attention, in an article in Rolling Stone in
1992. Most scientists dismissed it after a scientific committee
reviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low. But that
panel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was
later shown to be in error. And now a remarkable new book, ``The
River'' by Edward Hooper, offers tantalizing clues to revive and
expand the polio vaccine theory. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1900
words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Beijing) _ The recent trade agreement between the
United States and China has prompted a flurry of activity among
small Chinese investors and would-be investors, who have flocked to
one of the country's many new brokerage firms for the masses. A
slice of urban China, they came filled with hopes and worries,
theories and predictions about the economic impact of the deal. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLAR-YEN (Undated) _ The Bank of Japan sells yen, its 10th
currency intervention in the last five months, but the currency is
little changed against the dollar and the euro in early trading.
Traders say they expect the yen to continue to strengthen in the
absence of any indication that either the United States or the
European Central Bank will join the Bank of Japan. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BANKS (London) _ Royal Bank of Scotland announces its
$42.4 billion hostile bid for National Westminster Bank, in an
attempt to trump the Bank of Scotland. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.

   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily marketplace column.

INTENSIFIED ATTACKS ON FREE PRESS DISTURBING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Tough hides are essential survival gear for
politicians and members of the news media who write about them, but
we all have chinks in our armor.
</P>
<P>
   People who criticize my work _ and there are folks out there who
think my thinking is muddled and my talents mostly invisible _ are
doing what I am doing, which is practicing the First Amendment. And
as biting as some of their letters and e-mail might be, I respect
their right to speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   But every time I see another public opinion survey doubting the
wisdom of allowing free expression by the media, my skin thins a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   The latest came across my desk just the other day, and it
included two media-related questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to this survey by the Scripps Howard Texas Poll, half
of Texans don't like the way the media have been covering the 2000
presidential campaign so far, while only 38 percent of Texans
approve. The rest either didn't know what they thought or refused
to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Those answers don't particularly bother me because some of our
coverage has been good and some hasn't. And even reporters involved
in the coverage may not necessarily agree with each other on which
has been which.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be helpful for pollsters to try to distinguish
between the public's opinions of the print and the electronic
media. There may not be a wide difference in public perception
between the two, but there often are significant differences
between how newspapers and most television or radio stations and
networks report and present stories.
</P>
<P>
   There also are major differences between commercial and
noncommercial radio and TV. The breathless, pseudo ``news'' shows
that compete with ``Bonanza'' reruns and ``Oprah'' on afternoon
television, for example, are an entirely different animal from what
one reads in most newspapers or hears on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The more disturbing part of the Texas Poll, though, were the
answers to the second question, which asked which of the following
statements best reflected the respondents' thinking:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``There are times when the press should not be allowed to
publish or broadcast certain things.'' Or ... .
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Freedom of the press should be protected under all
circumstances.``
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight percent said that freedom of the press should be
protected, and 54 percent said the press should be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown almost makes me wonder if we would have even had a
First Amendment if this group of Texans had been among our nation's
founding parents.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who answered in favor of press restrictions would
probably insist that they are strong supporters of free speech,
free press and other First Amendment guarantees. They just think
that there should be certain restrictions on, say, reporting
violence, the private lives of public officials or any other type
of coverage that periodically angers readers and viewers. I sense
that many Texans are still worn out from the media's zealous
coverage of the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But, except for imposing recourse for libel, government can't
restrict press freedom without, in essence, destroying it. Freedom
of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, all under the
First Amendment, mean just that _ freedom, not freedom with an
attached list of the latest politically correct exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Many people still want to shoot the messenger, blaming the
media's reporting for numerous social ills that government,
churches, the business community and everyone else have been unable
to solve.
</P>
<P>
   But we in the news business _ often in our competitive haste to
be the first with the latest development in a major story _ also
are guilty of mistakes, misjudgments and excesses that damage our
own credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes occur in both print and electronic media. But
such problems are magnified by 24-hour, televised news coverage,
which encourages correspondents involved in live coverage of a
disaster or political controversy to hurriedly broadcast the latest
rumor around the country, often without a shred of substantiation.
</P>
<P>
   And the problems of shoot-from-the-lip reporting will only
worsen with the arrival of the Internet, where thousands of
information disseminators with computer access can report just
about anything with absolutely no regard for veracity.
</P>
<P>
   So, it is not difficult to conclude that the First Amendment's
guarantees of press freedom will come under even more attacks in
the foreseeable future _ from people exercising their First
Amendment guarantees of free speech.
</P>

 GIFTS-LADN 
Holiday gifts that travel well 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By Eric  Noland 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already, t &LR; hree pencil points have given their all for those few
pesky souls on your holiday gift list. It's not that these people
have everything, they're just particularly hard to buy for.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. They take frequent journeys, whether to locales exotic
or familiar, for business or pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the solution: travel-related gifts. There is an abundance
on the market this year, with a few new items to pique curiosity.
They can be found at any number of travel stores, from one of the
Rand McNally Map &AMP; Travel outlets in Southern California to such
bold independents as California Map &AMP; Travel Center in Santa Monica
and Distant Lands Travel Bookstore &AMP; Outfitters in Old Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the catalogs, either _ Magellan's and TravelSmith
are two of the best. Or the electronic indulgences at the Sharper
Image. Or the expedition provisions at Sport Chalet.
</P>
<P>
   On this, the official kickoff weekend of the Christmas buying
season, here is a rundown on several gift ideas. The target price
range was $35 to $75, but a few items stray _ or soar _ over that
ceiling, while several others nestle into the $25-and-under
category.
</P>
<P>
   Make a list. No need to check it more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos and gadgetry
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to own stock in AA batteries or lithium cells.
</P>
<P>
   The market is glutted yet again with products for people who
simply can't get along without the latest in electronic wizardry.
Various hand-held devices will translate Arabic into English,
convert rupees to dollars, guide your wilderness hike using Global
Positioning System satellites and lull you to sleep with the
digitized sound of a babbling brook.
</P>
<P>
   Lingo's European Translator ($69.95), smaller than an eyeglass
case, features a tiny keyboard, a flip-up screen and gobs of
memory. Stored inside are 56,000 words and 17,000 phrases in 14
languages.
</P>
<P>
   As with published phrase books, everything is categorized by
situations. Unlike most published phrase books, however, a phonetic
version of a given phrase is not provided, so you're on your own
for pronunciation. Punch up ``Please refund me'' in Hungarian, for
example, and the screen will spit out: ``Kerem fizesse az arat
vissza.'' Good luck. At the very least, you could hold the device
up to a store clerk and point to the readout.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign-currency conversions, Travel Essentials makes a
credit-card-sized device ($14.95) that can remove the headache from
the mental math. Just punch in the conversion rate when you cross
the border. ``They're very easy to use,'' said Suzanne Snyder,
manager of the Rand McNally store in the Century City Shopping
Center. ``If you're a shopper going to Italy, you want to know
exactly what 10,000 lira is, so you don't have to be surprised when
you get your credit-card bill: `Oh, no! I thought it was $50; it
was $500!'''
</P>
<P>
   Have difficulty sleeping in hotels in noisy urban areas? At the
Sharper Image, you'll find the Travel Soother ($59), yet another
breast pocket-sized, battery-powered item that will emit comforting
bedside sounds in four categories: seaside, summer night (complete
with crickets), brook and rain.
</P>
<P>
   If cost is no object, another popular product is the Palm V
Connected Organizer ($399), which, if combined with a modem ($169),
enables a traveler to exchange e-mails from anywhere on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   For people who like to trek across uncharted expanses (or for
those who get turned around going out for a newspaper), there are
Global Positioning System receivers on the market for $99 and up,
according to Rob Gandel of the California Map &AMP; Travel Center. One
of the store's gift options for higher-end shoppers is the Garmin
GPS III Plus ($428), which has a built-in base map that includes
cities, towns, major highways, lakes, rivers and, in the U.S.,
information on gas, lodging and food options near exits of the
interstate highway system. If plugged into a personal computer,
other cartographic data can be downloaded into it from a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   For those traveling to countries where the tap water is a bit
risky to drink, there are several water purifiers available. At
Sport Chalet, the Guardian Plus Purifier ($69.99) is only 9 inches
tall and weighs just 14 ounces, but it combines a .2-micron filter
to remove bacteria, iodinated resin to knock down viruses, and a
carbon filter to kill the taste of the iodine and other odors.
</P>
<P>
   With this system, however, you have to fuss with hoses and a
pumping mechanism. A simpler purifier, made by Exstream and
featured in Magellan's catalog ($39.85), has the appearance of a
sport water bottle but has an elaborate internal filter and
promises to be just as vigilant in fighting off the microscopic bad
guys.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's also carries a device that might appeal to those of
us who seem to come down with a cold within a day of stepping off a
transcontinental flight. Air Supply ($99) _ no relation to the
helium-voiced singing group _ is a black box the size of a
cigarette pack and is worn on a strap around the neck. By employing
a corona discharge chamber, it pledges to clean up the air between
you and that guy having a sneezing fit in 12C.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that chamber,'' said Magellan's Jack Kotowski, ``air is
bombarded with more than 70 trillion ions per second. It causes
electron impact decomposition. By various methods, it destroys
bacteria, viruses, even pollen. And you just wear it as a pendant
around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   A gadget that doesn't feature liquid-crystal displays, lithium
cells or micron filters is no less indispensable for a frequent
traveler _ and is a comparative bargain. It is the Victorinox Swiss
Card ($30) _ basically a Swiss army knife broken into its component
parts and tucked into a holder the size of a credit card. It's all
there: scissors, tweezers, screwdriver, blade, pin, pen, ruler,
nail file. Also guaranteed to set off airport metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The incidental tourist
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has a trip abroad planned for 2000, consider
something from the shelf: a guide book, a coffee-table picture
book, a journal for the trip, an atlas, perhaps a travel-themed
photo album or memory book.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally's five area stores are featuring the widely
acclaimed Eyewitness Travel Guides bound in leather ($40). The
guides are to four major cities _ London, Paris, Rome and New York
_ that are as well-known for their sights as they are for their
pickpockets. One of the advantages of having a leather-bound guide
book is that when you carry it tucked under your arm, you're not
flashing a neon sign that says: ``Tourist. Not sure where to turn
at the next corner. Carrying a lot of that confusing money. Will
take a long time to consult the lingo translator keyboard for the
appropriate word for, `Police!'''
</P>
<P>
   Several books have been released to coincide with the holidays _
and, of course, with the dawn of 2000. DK Publishing has produced a
dazzling ``Millennium World Atlas'' ($125) that includes a CD-ROM
and a folding world map. Lonely Planet has just released ``Sacred
India'' ($29.95), a photo-essay book.
</P>
<P>
   For the ship-bound set, DK also has a new book out titled
``Voyages: The Romance of Cruising'' ($40), which boasts pictures
and information on ``the world's 100 most exciting ports of call.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, nostalgic road warriors might be intrigued by a
revision of a popular work on Route 66, ``The Illustrated Guidebook
to the Mother Road'' (Roadbook International; $19.95), which is
exhaustively detailed (including odometer readings and exit numbers
from the interstate), and examines the storied highway that once
stretched from Santa Monica to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While perusing the shelves, don't forget travel videos (Rick
Steves is masterful with Europe; Lonely Planet does good work with
adventure trips) and computer software, including Rand McNally's
TripMaker and StreetFinder ($49.95 each).
</P>
<P>
   Baggage checks
</P>
<P>
   Most seasoned fliers have come to the conclusion that for any
given flight, there are only two kinds of luggage: carry-on and
lost. But the airlines are cracking down on the limit of two
carry-ons per passenger, which creates a quandary for a business
traveler hauling a garment bag, a rolling bag and a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Tumi offers a solution: the Business Carryon ($595), a wheeled
bag that is two-thirds suitcase, one-third briefcase. The latter
compartment includes a heavily padded pocket for a laptop computer
and the requisite array of zippered pockets and compartments.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize space in that or any other bag, a number of
organizing products are available, including Eagle Creek packing
bags ($12 to $32 at Rand McNally) and hanging toiletry kits ($19
and $22 from TravelSmith, $39 and $49 from Magellan's).
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who have been reluctant to trade in their perfectly
good suitcases for the new generation of wheeled luggage might
appreciate the dTube ($49.95). It's a stylized, collapsible cart
with ``the world's worst name,'' said Distant Lands owner Adrian
Kalvinskas as he folded it down to the size of a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Travel togs
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more annoying on a trip than having packed
insufficiently _ whether for an unseasonable cold snap or a sign at
the restaurant that reads ``Business Attire Recommended.'' The
appropriate gift can spare a traveler distress on both fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Go-anywhere fabrics continue to dominate the pages of holiday
travel catalogs. TravelSmith is draped in layers of microfleece _
cardigans, pullovers, vests and shirts for men; turtlenecks, V-neck
tunics and pants for women. This stuff requires half the space of
wool and cotton in your suitcase but still provides a quick-drying
layer of insulation against the cold. (Men's garments range from
$40 to $70, women's from $42 to $60).
</P>
<P>
   In every catalog, you'll also find the simple black traveling
dress, which seems to be universally priced at about $80. Made of
low-wrinkle synthetic fibers, it's designed to pack and travel
well. ``It's our No. 1 product,'' TravelSmith spokesman Caleb Edell
said of a garment that the company none-too-subtly markets as ``The
Indispensable Black Travel Dress.'' ``Dress it up with pearls,
dress it down with flats,'' Edell added, ``you can scrunch it in
your suitcase for a week, and it's still wrinkle-free and ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids' stuff
</P>
<P>
   A while back, Jay Leno took a microphone and a ``Tonight Show''
camera crew to a college graduation ceremony and asked several
grads in robes and mortarboards to name any one of the seven
continents. It was appalling how many came up completely blank.
(One simpleton could only offer weakly, ``Our own?'')
</P>
<P>
   Do a child a favor _ give the gift of geographic curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Most travel stores carry puzzle maps and other games. The
California Map &AMP; Travel Center also carries an item that meets the
current requirement for all things interactive. It is the Geo
Safari talking globe ($49.95 for the portable model). It asks kids
geography quiz questions and gives them multiple-choice options for
response. Best of all, wrong answers can be looked up on the globe
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It's a constructive way to occupy youngsters on a driving trip
or during an airport delay. Other games that fall into the category
are Travel Scrabble ($24.95), which features square plastic slots
for the letter tiles, and Magnetic Travel Backgammon ($40), both
carried by Rand McNally. And, for the tykes, Magellan's has the
Children's Pack Rat Kit ($19.85), a treasure trove of crayons,
paper, scissors, alphabet stencils and a tic-tac-toe game all
packed into a compact nylon pouch.
</P>
<P>
   A world of options
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're buying for someone who has no immediate travel
plans, it's hard to go wrong with a globe, whether it's a simple
desk model (generally $50 and up) or a floor model ($130 and up).
When one is displayed in a prominent place in the home, it's
difficult to walk by without stopping to survey some far-flung
corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Globes are popular gift items at this time of year, several
store proprietors said. In fact, owner Sheldon Mars of the
California Map &AMP; Travel Center routinely converts a denlike sitting
area into a ``globe room'' over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   If none of the foregoing items struck your fancy, travel stores
can nonetheless be interesting places to browse for gifts _
something unexpected is bound catch your eye.
</P>
<P>
   Distant Lands in Old Pasadena, for example, has travel candles,
16 different travel alarm clocks and books that focus on the
literature of a region (``Agatha Christie's England,'' for
example). The store also has a seemingly boundless supply of guide
books _ 18 on Cuba alone. ``People have a fascination with Cuba,''
said Kalvinskas. ``Only 90 miles from the U.S _ that
forbidden-fruit syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsing through a travel store, even while searching for a gift
for someone else, can have an ancillary benefit:
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't have plans for an immediate journey, such a
shopping excursion can provide ample fodder for dreams of a distant
one.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it was just another sleepy forgotten town in
the green hills of Bosnia. Now, Srebrenica _ ``place of silver,''
known to the Romans as Argentaria _ stands as the ultimate symbol
of the horror that Serbian ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic has
unleashed in the Balkans in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a reminder that, as Europe enters the 21st century,
no nightmare is too horrifying to be real.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-century since 1945, politicians have repeatedly
chanted about ``learning the lessons of history.'' ``Never again,''
the history books told us.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, as Bosnia showed, none of the lessons had truly been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The world has rightly been shocked by the killings in Kosovo,
where maybe 5,000 Albanians died in the whole province in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   At Srebrenica, more than 7,000 were murdered _ mostly shot in
the head before being dumped in mass graves _ in just a few days in
July 1995. Even by the lethal standards set by Milosevic's
placemen, it is a daunting record.
</P>
<P>
   A film broadcast on Britain's BBC2 Saturday night exposed with
searing clarity the horror of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   It exposed, too, the responsibility of Western powers who
refused to help, repeatedly turning their faces away from a reality
that stared them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The TV program shows us events unfolding before our eyes, as
recorded by the Serbs themselves. ``A catastrophe witnessed by
camcorder,'' in the words of filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian Muslim is asked by an unseen questioner: ``Are you
afraid?'' He looks into the camera with the certainty of
approaching death, and asks quietly: ``How could I not be afraid?''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb cameraman never seems to leave Mladic's side; the
pictures, intended to provide heroic propaganda, bear witness to
preparations for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   We see the division of the civilians, where the men (from age 11
to 77) are separated from the women and young children. The men _
their eyes turn to the camera, freeze-framed before death.
</P>
<P>
   Zumra Shekhomerovic torments herself because of her failure to
do something _ anything _ to fight for her husband as he was
separated from her, after placing his trembling hand on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret so much that I didn't scream or shout for help. Maybe
it would be easier to live now. I just left silently. My tears were
flowing like a river _ and still do today.''
</P>
<P>
   A standard get-out clause for politicians is to claim that
things only become clear in retrospect. ``20-20 vision is easy with
hindsight, isn't it?'' they like to say.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no hindsight was needed. Every Muslim in Bosnia
understood what the Serb forces were capable of; only the Western
governments refused to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain played a key role in blocking U.N. military action that
might have stopped the Serbs. Politicians sneered at the
``naivete'' of anybody who suggested a more robust approach. And
yet, it was impossible to spend any time in the Balkans and fail to
understand. &QL;

<P>
   The pattern of threats was clear from the start. A snapshot
remains vivid in the memory from the earliest days of the Bosnian
war, more than three years before Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving a Muslim woman and two children out of Bosnia, at
the request of a Sarajevo friend. At a Serb checkpoint on a
mountain road, the gunman questioned my passengers, with a sadistic
enjoyment that would have seemed appropriate for an SS man
questioning a Jew in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and children were terrified of the gunman's absolute
power; he relished their fear. We all knew that if he and his
colleagues decided to bundle my passengers out of the car (kidnap,
kill, whatever) I could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I, with my cozy British passport, would have bleated
ineffectually, and eventually driven off _ with a gun at my head if
my complaints were too prolonged and foolhardy. &QL;

<P>
   As later became clear on a grand scale, good intentions count
for nothing, unless they are backed up by some kind of force.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was common sense, and the ability to keep
one's eyes and mind open, to understand that simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Paddy Ashdown (then leader of Britain's Liberal
Democrat Party) _ who was outspoken on the need for action _ wrote
to John Major, then Prime Minister, to ask for undertakings
regarding the safety of Muslims in the besieged enclave of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Major replied: ``Britain's concern for the safety of civilians
in the eastern enclaves is well known.'' In reality, the concern
was limited, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, The Independent revealed that the U.N. _ with
the encouragement of London _ had, in effect, given up on
Srebrenica back in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Bernard Janvier, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, was
blunt with his advice: ``We must be pragmatic _ but above all
honest with the men whose security is our hands: without lightning
rods, stay out of the storm!''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give up on the ``safe area.'' Britain played a
key role in formulating this policy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Ashdown wrote again to ministers, regarding Robert Block's
reports in the Independent, there was an indignant response. The
letters from Malcolm Rifkind, then foreign secretary, and from John
Major have been seen by the Independent; they are evasive and
threatening by turns.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind complained of ``absurd allegations''; Major complained
of a ``disgraceful'' line of questioning, and demanded that Ashdown
apologize. ``Our forces have worked valiantly to bring humanitarian
relief to the people of Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, as far as it went. But the aggressive bluster
from Downing Street sought to conceal the fact that Britain had
indeed been ready to let Bosnia be trampled _ so that the
``humanitarian relief'' would not be put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The British forces in Bosnia were hamstrung because, under their
political mandate, they could not take tough action that was
clearly needed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch in Srebrenica faced similar difficulties. The Dutch
battalion was supposed to protect the ``safe enclave'' of
Srebrenica, but could not do so alone.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Serbs were moving in on
Srebrenica, the Dutch commander, Col. Ton Karremans, asked U.N.
headquarters for Serb positions to be bombed. His requests were
repeatedly denied. One request was turned down because it had been
submitted on the wrong form.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch have been criticized _ and have criticized themselves
_ for their manifest failure to protect the Muslims of Srebrenica. &QL;

<P>
   Devastating testimony in Saturday night's film comes from Hasan
Nuhanovic, a Bosnian interpreter who was forced to let his father,
mother and sister be driven out of the relative safety of the Dutch
compound near Srebrenica; they were never seen again. He still
reproaches himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason at such moments, you have no brain, you are so
obedient that you just do what they tell you. Nobody even
complained when they walked towards the gate, knowing that they
were probably going to die.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are sickening scenes where Dutch soldiers celebrated with
a literal knees-up _ waving their cans of Heineken beer in the air
as they danced _ after they came out of Srebrenica to the safety of
U.N. headquarters in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the buck did not stop with the Dutch. It stopped
with the Western governments _ especially the U.K., which was
determined not to let the heat be turned up high.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself admitted two weeks ago that the insufficient
military response resulted from ``an inability to recognize the
scope of the evil confronting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate criminals were, of course, the Serb and the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Serbs bury themselves in denial about crimes
that their compatriots have committed. Say the word ``Srebrenica''
to the average Serb today, and you will hear a long and fluent
lecture about Western propaganda and Muslim lies. That must
eventually change.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the film _ whose importance is such that it will
be shown at the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague _
may one day be heard and understood in Serbia, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, denial of the Holocaust _ the Auschwitzluge _ is a
punishable crime. In Serbia, with luck, the ``Srebrenica lie''
might also one day be a crime; but that day is a long way off, even
if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic steps down tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``pragmatism,'' Britain played a key role in allowing
the nightmare of Srebrenica to take place. Understanding that
failure can help ensure that ``never again'' is no longer just a
hollow cry. &QL;

for nothing, unless they are backed up by some kind of force.

<P>
   All that was needed was common sense, and the ability to keep
one's eyes and mind open, to understand that simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Paddy Ashdown (then leader of Britain's Liberal
Democrat Party) _ who was outspoken on the need for action _ wrote
to John Major, then Prime Minister, to ask for undertakings
regarding the safety of Muslims in the besieged enclave of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Major replied: ``Britain's concern for the safety of civilians
in the eastern enclaves is well known.'' In reality, the concern
was limited, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, The Independent revealed that the U.N. _ with
the encouragement of London _ had, in effect, given up on
Srebrenica back in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Bernard Janvier, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, was
blunt with his advice: ``We must be pragmatic _ but above all
honest with the men whose security is our hands: without lightning
rods, stay out of the storm!''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give up on the ``safe area.'' Britain played a
key role in formulating this policy. &QL;

   When Ashdown wrote again to ministers, regarding Robert Block's
reports in the Independent, there was an indignant response. The
letters from Malcolm Rifkind, then foreign secretary, and from John
Major have been seen by the Independent; they are evasive and
threatening by turns.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind complained of ``absurd allegations''; Major complained
of a ``disgraceful'' line of questioning, and demanded that Ashdown
apologize. ``Our forces have worked valiantly to bring humanitarian
relief to the people of Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, as far as it went. But the aggressive bluster
from Downing Street sought to conceal the fact that Britain had
indeed been ready to let Bosnia be trampled _ so that the
``humanitarian relief'' would not be put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The British forces in Bosnia were hamstrung because, under their

   The Dutch in Srebrenica faced similar difficulties. The Dutch
battalion was supposed to protect the ``safe enclave'' of
Srebrenica, but could not do so alone.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Serbs were moving in on
Srebrenica, the Dutch commander, Col. Ton Karremans, asked U.N.
headquarters for Serb positions to be bombed. His requests were
repeatedly denied. One request was turned down because it had been
submitted on the wrong form.

reproaches himself.

   Nonetheless, the buck did not stop with the Dutch. It stopped

   The U.N. itself admitted two weeks ago that the insufficient
military response resulted from ``an inability to recognize the

</P>
<P>
   The ultimate criminals were, of course, the Serb and the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Serbs bury themselves in denial about crimes
that their compatriots have committed. Say the word ``Srebrenica''
to the average Serb today, and you will hear a long and fluent
lecture about Western propaganda and Muslim lies. That must
eventually change.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the film _ whose importance is such that it will
be shown at the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague _
may one day be heard and understood in Serbia, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, denial of the Holocaust _ the Auschwitzluge _ is a
punishable crime. In Serbia, with luck, the ``Srebrenica lie''
might also one day be a crime; but that day is a long way off, even
if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic steps down tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``pragmatism,'' Britain played a key role in allowing
the nightmare of Srebrenica to take place. Understanding that
failure can help ensure that ``never again'' is no longer just a
hollow cry. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it was just another sleepy forgotten town in
the green hills of Bosnia. Now, Srebrenica _ ``place of silver,''
known to the Romans as Argentaria _ stands as the ultimate symbol
of the horror that Serbian ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic has
unleashed in the Balkans in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a reminder that, as Europe enters the 21st century,
no nightmare is too horrifying to be real.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-century since 1945, politicians have repeatedly
chanted about ``learning the lessons of history.'' ``Never again,''
the history books told us.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, as Bosnia showed, none of the lessons had truly been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The world has rightly been shocked by the killings in Kosovo,
where maybe 5,000 Albanians died in the whole province in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   At Srebrenica, more than 7,000 were murdered _ mostly shot in
the head before being dumped in mass graves _ in just a few days in
July 1995. Even by the lethal standards set by Milosevic's
placemen, it is a daunting record.
</P>
<P>
   A film broadcast on Britain's BBC2 Saturday night exposed with
searing clarity the horror of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   It exposed, too, the responsibility of Western powers who
refused to help, repeatedly turning their faces away from a reality
that stared them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The TV program shows us events unfolding before our eyes, as
recorded by the Serbs themselves. ``A catastrophe witnessed by
camcorder,'' in the words of filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian Muslim is asked by an unseen questioner: ``Are you
afraid?'' He looks into the camera with the certainty of
approaching death, and asks quietly: ``How could I not be afraid?''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb cameraman never seems to leave Mladic's side; the
pictures, intended to provide heroic propaganda, bear witness to
preparations for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   We see the division of the civilians, where the men (from age 11
to 77) are separated from the women and young children. The men _
their eyes turn to the camera, freeze-framed before death.
</P>
<P>
   Zumra Shekhomerovic torments herself because of her failure to
do something _ anything _ to fight for her husband as he was
separated from her, after placing his trembling hand on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret so much that I didn't scream or shout for help. Maybe
it would be easier to live now. I just left silently. My tears were
flowing like a river _ and still do today.''
</P>
<P>
   A standard get-out clause for politicians is to claim that
things only become clear in retrospect. ``20-20 vision is easy with
hindsight, isn't it?'' they like to say.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no hindsight was needed. Every Muslim in Bosnia
understood what the Serb forces were capable of; only the Western
governments refused to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain played a key role in blocking U.N. military action that
might have stopped the Serbs. Politicians sneered at the
``naivete'' of anybody who suggested a more robust approach. And
yet, it was impossible to spend any time in the Balkans and fail to
understand. &QL;

<P>
   The pattern of threats was clear from the start. A snapshot
remains vivid in the memory from the earliest days of the Bosnian
war, more than three years before Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving a Muslim woman and two children out of Bosnia, at
the request of a Sarajevo friend. At a Serb checkpoint on a
mountain road, the gunman questioned my passengers, with a sadistic
enjoyment that would have seemed appropriate for an SS man
questioning a Jew in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and children were terrified of the gunman's absolute
power; he relished their fear. We all knew that if he and his
colleagues decided to bundle my passengers out of the car (kidnap,
kill, whatever) I could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I, with my cozy British passport, would have bleated
ineffectually, and eventually driven off _ with a gun at my head if
my complaints were too prolonged and foolhardy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn. In the next few days tens of
thousands of protesters will descend on Seattle in a bid to stop a
new round of trade negotiations by the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
   They see themselves as Luke Skywalkers to the WTO's Darth Vader,
fighting to save the world from the threat of increased poverty and
environmental destruction. Their ultimate ambition: to destroy the
WTO and the liberal trading system it represents.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barricades will be a small army of
corporate lobbyists, many of them linked to Western governments.
They see themselves _ and the WTO _ as defenders of a global free
trading system that enshrines the principles of multilateralism and
promises unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of protagonists pose a profound threat to a
constituency that will not be well represented in Seattle _ namely,
the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the arguments advanced by critics of the Seattle talks
would be laughable, were it not for the fact that they enjoy such
wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-WTO witch-hunter general in the U.K. is Teddy
Goldsmith, editor of the Ecologist magazine. His view is that the
only beneficiaries of trade are giant companies for whom ``free
trade'' means the freedom to exploit, plunder and pollute; it
follows that more trade is bad trade.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith could usefully spend some time discussing his views
with people in the developing world whose livelihoods depend on,
and have often been enhanced by, international trade.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of poor women in Bangladesh, textile exports have
created employment opportunities and the income needed to buy food
and send children to school.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania, desperately poor smallholder farmers can earn more
by selling coffee to the EU than by producing for the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   And trade has played a pivotal role in sustaining the economic
growth that has lifted 371 million people out of poverty in east
Asia over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, trade has the potential to inflict social and environmental
damage. But it can also act as a force for human development. For
many millions of poor people, access to markets in rich countries
is literally a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   According to those behind the barricades in Seattle, poor
countries should abandon the pursuit of prosperity through trade,
in favor of self-reliance. Yet the fact is that trade is now the
main engine of growth in the global economy, having grown at twice
the rate of world output for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   International trade gives poor countries access to rich
consumers, generating employment and investment in the process.
Such countries would be the main victims of any descent into
protectionism, not least because they lack the economic power and
retaliatory capacity to defend their interests.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they need a rules-based system to govern world trade
_ and it is why so many developing countries are lining up to join
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to suggest that what currently pass for
multilateral trade rules are even remotely tolerable. They are
rigged in favor of the rich, often with devastating implications
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Western protectionism costs the world's poorest countries about
$700 billion a year _ 14 times what they receive in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rich nations have failed to act on their pledges to phase out
trade barriers against textiles and clothing, the biggest
manufacturing export from the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The market for agricultural goods _ which are often all that
poor countries have to sell _ remains closed behind a bewildering
array of trade barriers, most of them designed to protect wealthy
farmers and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle, the United States will try to force developing
countries to open their markets further to the import of subsidized
farm exports from the West, destroying the livelihoods of local
farmers in the process. It must not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazen hypocrisy on the part of rich governments is not the only
problem. All too often, WTO rules provide a convenient smoke screen
for corporate self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of intellectual property. Under the WTO, the
patents protection enjoyed by multinational companies has already
been extended. Now the EU and the US are insisting, in flagrant
violation of the Biodiversity Convention, that patenting law be
applied to all plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   That is an act of bio-piracy, made worse by the fact that
companies are already patenting traditional medicines and plants
produced in countries such as India and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of the losers are in the south. The WTO is being
used by American companies as a battering ram to open up the
European market for genetically modified foods and growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes are needed if the WTO is to succeed in laying the
foundations for a trading system that contributes towards human
development and environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle talks should focus on improving market access for
poor countries and ending agricultural export dumping by rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As India has argued, the intellectual property rules should be
torn up and rewritten to reflect the interests of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative demanded by the Seattle protesters may be
unthinkable. But what we have now is unacceptable. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn. In the next few days tens of
thousands of protesters will descend on Seattle in a bid to stop a
new round of trade negotiations by the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
   They see themselves as Luke Skywalkers to the WTO's Darth Vader,
fighting to save the world from the threat of increased poverty and
environmental destruction. Their ultimate ambition: to destroy the
WTO and the liberal trading system it represents.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barricades will be a small army of
corporate lobbyists, many of them linked to Western governments.
They see themselves _ and the WTO _ as defenders of a global free
trading system that enshrines the principles of multilateralism and
promises unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of protagonists pose a profound threat to a
constituency that will not be well represented in Seattle _ namely,
the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the arguments advanced by critics of the Seattle talks
would be laughable, were it not for the fact that they enjoy such
wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-WTO witch-hunter general in the U.K. is Teddy
Goldsmith, editor of the Ecologist magazine. His view is that the
only beneficiaries of trade are giant companies for whom ``free
trade'' means the freedom to exploit, plunder and pollute; it
follows that more trade is bad trade.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith could usefully spend some time discussing his views
with people in the developing world whose livelihoods depend on,
and have often been enhanced by, international trade.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of poor women in Bangladesh, textile exports have
created employment opportunities and the income needed to buy food
and send children to school.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania, desperately poor smallholder farmers can earn more
by selling coffee to the EU than by producing for the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   And trade has played a pivotal role in sustaining the economic
growth that has lifted 371 million people out of poverty in east
Asia over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, trade has the potential to inflict social and environmental
damage. But it can also act as a force for human development. For
many millions of poor people, access to markets in rich countries
is literally a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   According to those behind the barricades in Seattle, poor
countries should abandon the pursuit of prosperity through trade,
in favor of self-reliance. Yet the fact is that trade is now the
main engine of growth in the global economy, having grown at twice
the rate of world output for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   International trade gives poor countries access to rich
consumers, generating employment and investment in the process.
Such countries would be the main victims of any descent into
protectionism, not least because they lack the economic power and
retaliatory capacity to defend their interests.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they need a rules-based system to govern world trade
_ and it is why so many developing countries are lining up to join
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to suggest that what currently pass for
multilateral trade rules are even remotely tolerable. They are
rigged in favor of the rich, often with devastating implications
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Western protectionism costs the world's poorest countries about
$700 billion a year _ 14 times what they receive in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rich nations have failed to act on their pledges to phase out
trade barriers against textiles and clothing, the biggest
manufacturing export from the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The market for agricultural goods _ which are often all that
poor countries have to sell _ remains closed behind a bewildering
array of trade barriers, most of them designed to protect wealthy
farmers and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle, the United States will try to force developing
countries to open their markets further to the import of subsidized
farm exports from the West, destroying the livelihoods of local
farmers in the process. It must not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazen hypocrisy on the part of rich governments is not the only
problem. All too often, WTO rules provide a convenient smoke screen
for corporate self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of intellectual property. Under the WTO, the
patents protection enjoyed by multinational companies has already
been extended. Now the EU and the US are insisting, in flagrant
violation of the Biodiversity Convention, that patenting law be
applied to all plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   That is an act of bio-piracy, made worse by the fact that
companies are already patenting traditional medicines and plants
produced in countries such as India and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of the losers are in the south. The WTO is being
used by American companies as a battering ram to open up the
European market for genetically modified foods and growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes are needed if the WTO is to succeed in laying the
foundations for a trading system that contributes towards human
development and environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle talks should focus on improving market access for
poor countries and ending agricultural export dumping by rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As India has argued, the intellectual property rules should be
torn up and rewritten to reflect the interests of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative demanded by the Seattle protesters may be
unthinkable. But what we have now is unacceptable. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he steps away from the Northern Ireland peace
process, George Mitchell will find that there is a nice warm office
waiting for him in McPherson Square, a few blocks from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand,
the most successful lobbying group in town, will be glad to have
back the full attention of one of its most lucrative, effective and
popular partners.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also another office, which is just as comfortable,
around the corner on K Street, should he want it, with the
International Crisis Group, a private-sector group specializing in
conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in the last few years, Mitchell has also had
discreet discussions over the elegant desks on C Street, at the
State Department; in the Supreme Court, at the other end of the
Mall; and in the neoclassical building in the center of the city,
as head of President Bill Clinton's legal team during impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has no shortage of options. Since he left elected
politics in 1994, the urbane former Democratic senator has passed
behind a veil and become one of a select few who possess real power
in Washington at the same time as holding no office.
</P>
<P>
   He is regarded as one of the ``Wise Men'' of the age, heir to a
tradition of power brokers, the true establishment of a city which
reveres influence above all else.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of three candidates for Secretary of State in 1996,
alongside Richard Holbrooke and Madeleine Albright, who won the
contest. He was offered a seat on the Supreme Court, but declined
it.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on a special investigation into baseball, and another
into the Olympic Games. He is Chancellor of Queen's University and
chairman of a reconciliation fund, but also on the board of Disney
and an adviser to Thames Water.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has displayed a talent for amassing influence but also
making money, which is the envy of many other retired politicians.
</P>
<P>
   At Verner, Liipfert, he brought in $10 million in 1998, helping
to make it the highest billing lobbyist in Washington. As part of a
team which includes former senator Robert Dole, and the venerable
Harry McPherson, one of the powerbroking giants of Washington,
Mitchell has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this, however, he has worked for the tobacco
industry, which has not endeared him to everyone in the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   There is, inevitably, speculation that he might hold office of
some sort if the Democrats regain the White House next year. He has
been mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate for Al Gore, but
Gore would gain little electorally by bringing in someone whose
home state, Maine, has so few electoral college votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also said to have preferred Holbrooke over Mitchell for
the State Department, implying that he is unlikely to get that
either in a new administration.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General is a possibility, and he may also still be
interested in the Supreme Court, though his lobbying work may
militate against both.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said he wants to spend more time with his second
wife, nearly 30 years his junior, and his young son, born during
the Irish negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. ambassadorial positions require not just political
weight and diplomatic skill but also money, and Mitchell is
eminently suited for the position.
</P>
<P>
   London or Dublin may suit him very nicely at some stage, though
perhaps _ with the money piling up so nicely _ that could wait a
few years. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The owners of the Saint Louis Gallery, a gleaming
shopping mall near the banks of the Mississippi River, have had a
vision. And it frightens them to death.
</P>
<P>
   In it, they see their beloved Galleria stripped of people.
Escalators that were once clogged with customers are empty and
switched off. Parking lots are deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Has the next recession hit? No. What they are fretting about in
St. Louis is the Internet and the notion _ exaggerated or otherwise
_ that the time will come soon when e-commerce will rule. When
nobody will bother to tramp around shops any more and will instead
buy almost everything online.
</P>
<P>
   Such is their anxiety that the Galleria owners have taken an
unprecedented step: they have barred all their tenants from
promoting their Web sites or anything to do with the Internet on
the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that might direct customers to the World Wide Web is to
go. No www. addresses on shopping bags, no stickers on windows, no
posters or signs guiding shoppers to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts are now watching to see whether other malls in
the United States will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, whether the Galleria can make the ban
stick. At least one of the shops, The Right Start, which
specializes in educational toys, has said it will sue to overturn
it. The Gap, which has no fewer than five shops in the Galleria,
said it might also take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Internet is a positive advertising tool that
actually drives traffic to the stores,'' a Gap spokeswoman
commented. ``We think it's an additional convenience for the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers can assume they will get the income either way,
whether it comes via the Internet or over the traditional counter.
For the mall businesses, however, the issue is understandably more
urgent. ``It is important we protect our interest while initiating
important dialogue,'' a spokesman for the Galleria said.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet shopping in the U.S. still represents only a
fraction of overall retail sales, it is growing rapidly. Jupiter
Communications, an Internet consultant, predicted this week that
Americans this November and December will spend $6 billion online,
compared with $3.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is often the wealthiest shoppers that turn to
online shopping, leaving the less prosperous in the malls.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, by the NPD group, offers mall owners some
consoling news, however. Americans are still loathe to buy clothes
via their computers. They want to try them on and touch them. In a
poll taken by NPD, nearly half of all Internet users in the U.S.
said they would never buy clothing online. &QL;

stick. At least one of the shops, The Right Start, which
specializes in educational toys, has said it will sue to overturn
it. The Gap, which has no fewer than five shops in the Galleria,
said it might also take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Internet is a positive advertising tool that
actually drives traffic to the stores,'' a Gap spokeswoman
commented. ``We think it's an additional convenience for the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers can assume they will get the income either way,
whether it comes via the Internet or over the traditional counter.
For the mall businesses, however, the issue is understandably more
urgent. ``It is important we protect our interest while initiating
important dialogue,'' a spokesman for the Galleria said.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet shopping in the U.S. still represents only a
fraction of overall retail sales, it is growing rapidly. Jupiter
Communications, an Internet consultant, predicted this week that
Americans this November and December will spend $6 billion online,
compared with $3.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is often the wealthiest shoppers that turn to
online shopping, leaving the less prosperous in the malls.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, by the NPD group, offers mall owners some
consoling news, however. Americans are still loathe to buy clothes
via their computers. They want to try them on and touch them. In a
poll taken by NPD, nearly half of all Internet users in the U.S.
said they would never buy clothing online. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   I know where and when it was supposed to have ended, because I
was there. Along with a hundred or so other journalists, jam-packed
into the assembly room of the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky, just
before lunch on Sunday, Dec. 3, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev had just wound up a bizarre superpower summit off the
island of Malta (in seas so rough that the two of them couldn't
even physically meet on the previous day) by hailing a new era in
relations between their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Yalta to Malta,'' cracked Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet
leader's unfailing scene-stealer of a spokesman, ``the Cold War
ended at 12.45pm today.''
</P>
<P>
   And, naive and impressionable as we were, we believed him. In
the two years that Gorbachev had left in the Kremlin, Washington
and Moscow signed a raft of arms-control agreements, Germany was
reunited, and the Soviet Union even gave us a small helping hand in
the war against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade later, however, Malta seems a millennium ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history may show I was also there at the moment when a
new Cold War is officially determined to have begun _ the recent
European security summit in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Current Russian President Boris Yeltsin had given the West a
thunderous lecture about intervening in the Chechnya crisis, and
spent a lordly seven minutes at a long-planned double summit with
the leaders of France and Germany before getting on an airplane and
returning to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that the past has returned exactly is, of course, a
nonsense. Russia is a far weaker power now, a cross between a
kleptocracy and a charity basket case.
</P>
<P>
   For all the vagaries of the Soviet system, it may safely be said
that one of its leading orchestras would never have been reduced to
busking outside a McDonald's burger restaurant in Swansea just to
keep body and soul together _ the fate that befell the touring
National Philharmonic Orchestra of Russia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Barring Belarus and the rump of Yugoslavia, Russia has no allies
through which to further a proxy war with the West. But Yeltsin's
performance in Istanbul rekindled a few memories.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite Khrushchev banging his desk with his shoe at the
United Nations, but ``Yeltsin was definitely untying the
shoelaces,'' as one diplomat put it.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia remains the one country that can wipe us all out with
the push of a nuclear button. Let's be honest. Even after Cold War
Mark I officially ended, Communism collapsed and our rockets were
detargeted from Russian cities, we still instinctively regarded
Russia, albeit apparently benign and increasingly ``like us,'' as
the closest thing left to a serious enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Russia is right now, it isn't benign. What strikes me
are the parallels between today and not so much 1989 but 1983, one
of the most fraught years of the old Cold War, when Soviet jets
shot down KAL flight 007, NATO deployed cruise and Pershing
missiles in Europe and, as is now known, the Kremlin came pretty
close to unleashing a hot war.
</P>
<P>
   We're not at that point yet, but even so, several of the old
ingredients are present.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Kremlin is fighting a dirty war of suppression
on the southern marches (then Afghanistan, now Chechnya, where some
of the Islamic radicals involved in the insurgency learned their
trade in Afghanistan).
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 a new generation of nuclear weapons was installed to
protect Western Europe. To strengthen the Caucasus and Central Asia
today, the name of the game played by the West is oil, carried in
new pipelines routed as far from Russia as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But if the means are different, the strategic objective is much
the same: to hem Russia in, and peg back its influence.
Unsurprisingly, the Russians don't like it one bit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the Star Wars parallel. Back in 1983,
then-President Ronald Reagan's public dream of a space-based
defense to destroy incoming ballistic missiles horrified the Soviet
leadership, which knew it could not compete.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the very real prospect that President Bill Clinton next
year will unilaterally breach the 1972 anti-ballistic missile
treaty and approve a national missile defense system elicits a
similar reaction in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The generals warn that the ABM treaty is sacrosanct, and that if
the Americans go ahead Russia will simply build new missiles to
swamp whatever system is put in place.
</P>
<P>
   As for ratification of the Start-2 agreement to cut weapon
stockpiles _ forget it. In other words, another Cold-War-style arms
race beckons.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblances should not be exaggerated. Russia's hostility
now reflects not a superpower's geostrategic calculations, but a
much-humiliated country's refusal to be lectured and kicked around,
its determination to show that it still counts for something.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to justify Chechnya. But it does help to explain
it, and show how hard old mind-sets die. And not only in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   We have found it no less difficult to change the way we think.
``Victory'' in the old Cold War made us assume that Russia would
take to the winner's economic and social system like a duck to
water. It was right for us, so it would be right for them.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the pseudo-capitalism foisted on a country that was
manifestly unequipped to receive it. But the West pressed ahead,
just as it pressed ahead with the eastward expansion of NATO. Dress
it up as you will, this was the ancient doctrine of ``containment''
resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   The hard truth is that entrenched adversaries do not become
close friends simply upon a wink to the press from George Bush, or
the snake-oil pronouncements of Gennady Gerasimov.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Eighties it seemed natural that we should be at odds
with Russia. For all the changes in Moscow since, the depressing
thing is that it seems just as natural now. Perhaps the Cold War
never ended at all. &QL;

NEIL SIMON HAS NO RESERVATIONS ABOUT `THE DINNER PARTY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Take six characters in search of some painful personal truths.
Season generously with comic banter. Add a dash of topical
references to e-mail, the Internet and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, stir in the reputation of Neil Simon, America's most
commercially successful playwright of the past four decades, and
bake 90 minutes. Serves approximately 700.
</P>
<P>
   That, in simple form, is the recipe for ``The Dinner Party,''
the Neil Simon comedy-drama that will have its world premiere
Wednesday night at the Mark Taper Forum in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of the Simon canon are sure to recognize familiar
elements in ``The Dinner Party,'' which its producers hope to
transfer to Broadway sometime next year. But there's at least one
significant new ingredient in the author's 31st stage concoction.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the playwright's usual Upper Manhattan milieu, ``The
Dinner Party'' is set in the private dining room of an exclusive
Paris restaurant. All six characters are French, as it happens, and
each is unaware of why he or she has been invited to this strange
repast or who the host is.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that's only the start of the surprises in store.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone connected with ``The Dinner Party'' is being mum about
the exact nature of those surprises and about the sharp turn the
play takes from farcical comedy to something much darker about
two-thirds of the way through. Still, from the details provided by
Simon and the cast, you might guess the play's continental
flavoring had some crucial bearing on its thematic substance.
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire, says the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be French, they could've been anything, but
I wanted to make it a universal play,'' says Simon. ``If I made it
a New York play, I would've had to have written it differently. It
would have to be set there, the locale would be there, the speech
would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have the feeling that this is something that happens
with all married people _ the sense of it, anyway. The play is
slightly abstract, I think, because it's part farce, and then it
gets into this very interesting action of the play. I've never
written anything quite like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon says parts of the new play are ``surreal,'' a description
that also fits the slightly incongruous makeup of the ensemble. It
includes three actors best-known (though by no means exclusively)
for their New York stage work _ Frances Conroy, Veanne Cox and
Edward Herrmann _ and two others, John Ritter and Henry Winkler,
more famous from TV and film roles.
</P>
<P>
   The cast's sixth member, Anette Michelle Sanders (``Diagnosis
Murder''), was named last Wednesday to replace Rita Wilson, who
left the show as a result of what Taper producing artistic director
Gordon Davidson described as ``mutual agreement based on creative
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and expect to work with Rita again on a future
project,'' Davidson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The production is being directed by John Rando, whose work in
Southern California includes the recent Geffen Playhouse
productions of ``All in the Timing'' and ``Merton of the Movies,''
and ``The Comedy of Errors'' and ``Sylvia'' at the Old Globe in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lid that's being kept on the show, a few salient
facts have emerged. Sex and haute cuisine are both involved (this
is France, after all). So are marriage and divorce, as you'd
probably expect from a playwright known as a kind of gourmet of
domestic discord.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members describe the dialogue as being like English
translated into French and then back into English, with Simon
employing longer, more complicated syntax than if the play were set
in, say, Yonkers or the author's native Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler says the play's structure is ``like an onion'' with ``a
really delightful skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts very much in a Neil Simon style, which is very
smart, very funny, very quick, and takes a left,'' he says. ``I've
watched it when I'm not in a scene, (and) you hear something new
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 72-year-old playwright has gone through at least
seven rewrites _ about normal for him. Gradually, the rewrite
process convinced him that the intermissionless work had to be
divided into two distinct moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried in different drafts of this thing ... to get into
the real characters of the people and see what they're really like
in a dramatic way. And it didn't work. Once you start the comedy,
you've got to go with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the comedy moves on and on in the piece, and then
slides into this other place, where then they really reveal
themselves. And that's why I try to present them in sort of comic
situations so that you don't see them coming. Because that's what I
think life is like. We're not necessarily in comic situations, but
we're not in a major dramatic situation all the time. And then at
some point in our life they do come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences who lost track of Simon's career sometime around the
Nixon administration may be surprised at what a serious playwright
he has become. Having learned his craft as a gag writer for TV
comic Sid Caesar, Simon has always been able to spin out one-liners
by the yard. But beginning in the late 1960s and early '70s, he has
increasingly bitten off tougher and more painful subject matter,
such as alcoholism and infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the first step I took in that direction was in `The
Gingerbread Lady,' and even in `Plaza Suite,''' says Simon. ``It
was around that time I said, you know, `It's got to be about
something, not just comedy for comedy's sake.'''
</P>
<P>
   That trajectory accelerated following the death of his first
wife, Joan Baim, in 1973 and on through his four subsequent
marriages, to actress Marsha Mason and, twice, Diane Lander. Simon
recently married actress Elaine Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Digging increasingly into his own youth and early manhood, Simon
has produced the most critically acclaimed work of his career,
including the Brighton Beach trilogy (``Brighton Beach Memoirs,''
``Biloxi Blues'' and ``Broadway Bound''), the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Lost in Yonkers'' and his 1993 autobiographical
memory play about working with Sid Caesar, ``Laughter on the 23rd
Floor'' (which Showtime is adapting into a movie starring Nathan
Lane).
</P>
<P>
   Simon insists, however, that there are no autobiographical
elements in ``The Dinner Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not a thought,'' he says quickly. ``I mean, you never know
that, because your own personality comes through in the plays. But
I can tell you if I'm any of those people, or any of the people I
was married to are those people: They aren't. I think also by
putting it in France, it excluded that from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by all accounts, ``The Dinner Party'' demonstrates Simon's
later-life willingness to grapple with painful emotions and awkward
experiences. Simon titled his first volume of memoirs ``Rewrites,''
and in a way he seems to be continually rewriting certain aspects
of his plays in search of broader truths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reaching out from the center of his creative life, which
is basically the Catskills and Sid Caesar, you know, and the
vaudeville tradition, to a wider sense of what human beings are all
about,'' Herrmann observes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like any good writer, he writes out of what he knows, like
`Brighton Beach Memoirs.' But in (``The Dinner Party''), it's like
a late Shakespeare play _ not to be too grandiose _ but he's
speculating on something the subject of which he knows a great deal
about: marriage and divorce and pain and the relationship between
men and women. I think he chose France because love is so
desperately important there. They define themselves largely by
their relationship to the opposite sex, where in the United States
we're fatuous enough to think that we define ourselves by other
things, not realizing of course that we're exactly the same. But we
define ourselves by our work, mainly.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves one mystery in this big `what if' of a play: What
will the actors actually eat during performances? No one seems to
know yet for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But as befits a story of food and relationships (however
flawed), cast and crew members regularly have been bringing in
goodies to pass around at rehearsal. Simon has treated the actors
to dinner, Winkler brings in suckers to share, and one night the
hairdresser stole the show with three boxes of Krispy Kreme
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   And ``John Ritter gave me a birthday gift, which was a gigantic
basket of fruit, which was then donated to the room,'' Winkler
says. ``So then we all fed on that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Breaking down barriers is controversial work. That will be clear
on Nov. 30, when as many as 100,000 demonstrators will march
through Seattle, ostensibly to protest at the launch, at a World
Trade Organization summit, of a new round of trade-liberalizing
talks. But their real target is globalization, broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
   This in a city that thrives on trade: a port, near Canada, home
to Microsoft and Boeing, two of America's biggest exporters, and
birthplace of such global crazes as the hit TV program,
``Frasier,'' and fancy coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, support for free trade is weak at best; and
the WTO is copping the blame for the perceived evils of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   It is under attack from trade unions, greens and even consumer
groups, all of whom say its rules advance big companies' global
ambitions at the expense of jobs and the environment. They also
attack the WTO for being secretive and unaccountable.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments will gain ground unless the case for
globalization is made with renewed vigor. The economic benefits of
the greater openness _ faster growth, cheaper imports, new
technologies, the spur of foreign competition _ that the world has
enjoyed in recent years are too easily taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Greater prosperity is also the best way to improve working
conditions and the environment. Yet for all the gains that
globalization brings, it can also create losers, who naturally
dislike change. Their concerns should not be dismissed. But
shutting out the rest of the world would make everyone worse off.
</P>
<P>
   For all the storm over globalization, too many trade barriers
remain _ one reason that a new round of trade talks is needed.
Despite huge strides towards open markets over the past 50 years,
big swathes of the world economy, such as agriculture, textiles and
shipping, remain highly protected. Many tariffs are still high.
</P>
<P>
   New trade barriers keep appearing too. Booming industries such
as computing and telecoms are vulnerable, notably through standards
that handicap foreign firms. Even e-commerce can be subject to
trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   All around the world, protectionist sentiment is alive and well.
There has been a surge in anti-dumping duties on imports deemed
``unfairly'' cheap. Such duties are rarely lifted, so their burden
grows each year. America now has around 300 in place.
</P>
<P>
   Even illegal ``voluntary export restraints'' are re-emerging:
Japan has privately agreed to limit steel exports to America.
</P>
<P>
   Merely to stand still, a new effort to open markets is needed.
It is also the surest way to deflect protectionist pressure,
because the prospect of greater access to foreign markets should
rally export lobbies to the free-trade cause.
</P>
<P>
   Depressingly, the WTO's 135 member governments have so far
failed to agree on an agenda for the round. But they are already
committed to negotiate on unfinished business from the previous
Uruguay round of trade talks, notably on farming and services.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best to broaden the new round to areas such as
industrial tariffs, investment and competition policy, to allow
more scope for the trade-offs on which a final deal depends.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, liberalization should be sweeping, especially in
agriculture. Europe and Japan should dismantle their farm
protection, which fleeces consumers, harms their exporters and
stunts poor countries' growth.
</P>
<P>
   In services, priorities include finance, computing, transport
and telecoms, as well as easing restrictions on the movement of
people, a bugbear for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, plus liberalizing textiles and limiting
anti-dumping abuse, would do much to help poorer countries, who
feel, with some justice, that they got a raw deal out of the
Uruguay round. It would also benefit consumers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other broad, thorny issue. A balance sometimes has
to be struck between free trade and such other legitimate aims as
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, countries should pursue these aims in ways that
disrupt trade least. But that can be tricky. So governments need to
find a way of agreeing when curbs on trade can be an acceptable way
to pursue a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, the WTO's credibility could be damaged, because
it will increasingly be called on to adjudicate on matters where it
lacks expertise and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is more crucial because another priority for the round must
be to shore up the WTO itself. Only five years old, it has been
looking increasingly fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has impressive dispute-settlement powers, it has
been battered not just by the lobbyists but also by the EU's
recalcitrance over bananas and hormone-treated beef, and by
America's growing disenchantment with curbs on its unilateralist
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Governments' trade policies are too often hijacked by narrow,
corporate interests, which veer in favor of protection. That is
precisely why the WTO is such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   It could certainly open up more. But to say it is unaccountable
is nonsense. Its rules are agreed by member governments which,
unlike anti-WTO lobbies, are mostly elected and accountable to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   A political stalemate in Seattle, which is possible, could
fatally undermine the WTO, especially if the critics claim credit

   A WTO framework for investment and competition rules would be

   America and Europe urgently need to show more genuine commitment
to free trade. Mike Moore, the WTO's pugnacious new boss, has
started the long fight to win over skeptics on globalization. But
he cannot succeed without governments' help. All too often, they
appease protectionists rather than confront them.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to force labor rights on to the agenda for the new
round, for instance, America and Europe are playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is not irreversible. Unless governments come out
fighting for free trade in Seattle and beyond, the huge gains it
has brought could be lost. &QL;

<P>
   Breaking down barriers is controversial work. That will be clear
on Nov. 30, when as many as 100,000 demonstrators will march
through Seattle, ostensibly to protest at the launch, at a World
Trade Organization summit, of a new round of trade-liberalizing
talks. But their real target is globalization, broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
   This in a city that thrives on trade: a port, near Canada, home
to Microsoft and Boeing, two of America's biggest exporters, and
birthplace of such global crazes as the hit TV program,
``Frasier,'' and fancy coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, support for free trade is weak at best; and
the WTO is copping the blame for the perceived evils of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   It is under attack from trade unions, greens and even consumer
groups, all of whom say its rules advance big companies' global
ambitions at the expense of jobs and the environment. They also
attack the WTO for being secretive and unaccountable.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments will gain ground unless the case for
globalization is made with renewed vigor. The economic benefits of
the greater openness _ faster growth, cheaper imports, new
technologies, the spur of foreign competition _ that the world has
enjoyed in recent years are too easily taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Greater prosperity is also the best way to improve working
conditions and the environment. Yet for all the gains that
globalization brings, it can also create losers, who naturally
dislike change. Their concerns should not be dismissed. But
shutting out the rest of the world would make everyone worse off.
</P>
<P>
   For all the storm over globalization, too many trade barriers
remain _ one reason that a new round of trade talks is needed.
Despite huge strides towards open markets over the past 50 years,
big swathes of the world economy, such as agriculture, textiles and
shipping, remain highly protected. Many tariffs are still high.
</P>
<P>
   New trade barriers keep appearing too. Booming industries such
as computing and telecoms are vulnerable, notably through standards
that handicap foreign firms. Even e-commerce can be subject to
trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   All around the world, protectionist sentiment is alive and well.
There has been a surge in anti-dumping duties on imports deemed
``unfairly'' cheap. Such duties are rarely lifted, so their burden
grows each year. America now has around 300 in place.
</P>
<P>
   Even illegal ``voluntary export restraints'' are re-emerging:
Japan has privately agreed to limit steel exports to America.
</P>
<P>
   Merely to stand still, a new effort to open markets is needed.
It is also the surest way to deflect protectionist pressure,
because the prospect of greater access to foreign markets should
rally export lobbies to the free-trade cause.
</P>
<P>
   Depressingly, the WTO's 135 member governments have so far
failed to agree on an agenda for the round. But they are already
committed to negotiate on unfinished business from the previous
Uruguay round of trade talks, notably on farming and services.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best to broaden the new round to areas such as
industrial tariffs, investment and competition policy, to allow
more scope for the trade-offs on which a final deal depends.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, liberalization should be sweeping, especially in
agriculture. Europe and Japan should dismantle their farm
protection, which fleeces consumers, harms their exporters and
stunts poor countries' growth.
</P>
<P>
   In services, priorities include finance, computing, transport
and telecoms, as well as easing restrictions on the movement of
people, a bugbear for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, plus liberalizing textiles and limiting
anti-dumping abuse, would do much to help poorer countries, who
feel, with some justice, that they got a raw deal out of the
Uruguay round. It would also benefit consumers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other broad, thorny issue. A balance sometimes has
to be struck between free trade and such other legitimate aims as
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, countries should pursue these aims in ways that
disrupt trade least. But that can be tricky. So governments need to
find a way of agreeing when curbs on trade can be an acceptable way
to pursue a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, the WTO's credibility could be damaged, because
it will increasingly be called on to adjudicate on matters where it
lacks expertise and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is more crucial because another priority for the round must
be to shore up the WTO itself. Only five years old, it has been
looking increasingly fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has impressive dispute-settlement powers, it has
been battered not just by the lobbyists but also by the EU's
recalcitrance over bananas and hormone-treated beef, and by
America's growing disenchantment with curbs on its unilateralist
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Governments' trade policies are too often hijacked by narrow,
corporate interests, which veer in favor of protection. That is
precisely why the WTO is such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   It could certainly open up more. But to say it is unaccountable
is nonsense. Its rules are agreed by member governments which,
unlike anti-WTO lobbies, are mostly elected and accountable to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   A political stalemate in Seattle, which is possible, could
fatally undermine the WTO, especially if the critics claim credit
for derailing the new round. Avoiding such a fiasco is the
immediate priority; if, for now, only a narrow, less ambitious
round can be agreed to, so be it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Could the bad old days of stagflation be about to return?
</P>
<P>
   Since OPEC agreed to supply cuts in March, the price of crude
oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last
December and its highest since the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This near-tripling of oil prices evokes scary memories of the
1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also
almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit
inflation and global recession.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
Their absence is even more striking given that, at the start of the
year, many commentators (including, rather prominently, this
newspaper) expected prices to fall, not rise.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's agreement to cut output has so far proved more durable
than many predicted. The oil price was given another nudge up this
week when Iraq suspended oil exports in a showdown with the U.N.
over sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips
the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the
short term. Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic
consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise in oil prices follows an equally sharp collapse
over the previous two years, when prices fell by more than half to
their lowest level in real terms since before the 1973 shock. Even
now, prices are not much higher than in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts
for a smaller share of the price of gas than it did in the 1970s.
In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price,
so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted
effect on pump prices than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were,
and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price.
</P>
<P>
   Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the
importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil
consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far
less oil than steel or car production.
</P>
<P>
   For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now
use nearly 50 percent less oil than in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil
prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in
1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by
only 0.25-0.5 percent of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the
income loss in 1974 or 1980.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies _ to which
heavy industry has shifted _ have become more energy-intensive, and
so could be more seriously squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the output of oil-importing countries also depends
on whether oil producers save or spend their windfalls. In 1973 and
1979 many OPEC countries already had current-account surpluses, and
most of their extra oil revenues were saved. Today, many have large
current-account deficits (Saudi Arabia's hit 10 percent of GDP last
year).
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped producers are more likely to spend their windfalls
on imports from rich countries. One more reason not to lose sleep
over the surge in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the
1970s, it has not occurred against the backdrop of general
commodity-price inflation and global excess demand.
</P>
<P>
   A sizeable chunk of the world is only just emerging from
recession. The Economist's commodity price index is broadly
unchanged from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70
percent, and in 1979 by almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the impact will be more modest than in the past, dearer
oil will still leave some mark. Inflation will be higher and output
lower than they would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD's rule of thumb is that a $10 increase, if sustained
for a year, would increase the inflation rate in rich economies by
about half a percentage point and knock about a quarter-point off
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of higher oil prices varies by country too. Perhaps
the biggest risk is in America, where rising oil prices may push
the inflation rate higher than is currently predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in oil prices in recent years was one of the main
factors that helped to hold down American inflation, so prolonging
the country's long economic expansion. That positive factor is now
going into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices have already helped to lift America's
inflation rate to 2.6 percent in October, up from 1.5 percent a
year ago; the latest rise in oil prices could well push it above 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The core inflation rate remains relatively subdued, but headline
inflation could still spill into wages and hence other prices. If
it does, the Fed might be forced to raise interest rates by more
than is now forecast. So OPEC could yet do more damage than most
people expect. &QL;

   CARLSBAD, CALIF. _ The scene is the epitome of country-club
Republicanism. On manicured greens and fairways, business lobbyists
schmooze with golfing politicians. At the spa, large successful men
loll in the sauna like seals, exchanging gossip. Thin wives parade
their cosmetic surgery and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But close your eyes, move inside the conference hall, and you
hear something that does not chime with these images of the rich at
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda isn't to cut welfare benefits,'' says the man from
Arkansas. ``We want teachers to get better pay for teaching well.''
</P>
<P>
   The man from Oklahoma boasts about ``the largest road-building
program ever seen in the state.'' And the fellow from Louisiana
insists that ``we can make ourselves the party of the public-school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   These men are Republican state governors. They are gathered in
their Southern California resort not only to celebrate their
particular branch of Republicanism, not only to get one of their
own elected president, but to transform their party and even
America's system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Bush is helping us create a new Republican
Party,'' says Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Republican governors this decade has been one of
America's biggest political shifts. In 1992, after President Bill
Clinton was elected, there were 18 Republicans in state capitols,
five fewer than in 1988. Democrats had the governorships of all the
big states except California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reverse applies. Republicans have all the big states
(except California), and run a total of 31 states, with 70 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   These states have 340 electoral-college votes (270 are needed to
choose the president next year).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the governors were elected in the Republican landslide
of 1994. But, while the congressional Republicans who swept to
power that year have descended through bitter partisanship to
public vilification, the governors have become the most popular
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of the population approves of the job the
leaders of Congress are doing. On a conservative measure, compiled
by Thad Beyle of the University of North Carolina, the governors
enjoy an average job-approval rating of 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A different measure, used by a Washington Post-ABC poll, puts
the figure at 73 percent. George W. Bush scores 86 percent. Soviet
dictators would have settled for this.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it has not been hard to be a governor lately. The
states are awash with tax dollars. And, since they did not have
vast deficits to swallow up the early windfalls of the boom (all
but Vermont have balanced-budget requirements), the governors have
been pulling off an impressive feat for years: cutting taxes while
increasing both spending and surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed governors (Democratic as well as Republican) have cut
taxes six years running, by a cumulative $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, this could be a problem. Governors are spending
what could be a cyclical upswing in tax revenues on entitlements _
such as increased education _ which will be hard to reduce in a
downswing.
</P>
<P>
   But that is for the future. Right now, the main result is to
create a distinctive and increasingly vocal brand of Republicanism:
tax-cutting, ``compassionate,'' non-ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors are not all clones, of course. Some (George
W., Mike Leavitt of Utah) have boosted spending more than they have
cut taxes. Others (Christine Whitman in New Jersey, Frank Keating
in Oklahoma) have slashed taxes more. But all are policy
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   They experimented with welfare reform in the early 1990s,
lobbied for it at national level and, once Congress had seen the
light, implemented the reforms that have moved half of welfare
recipients into jobs. Now some, led by Jeb Bush in Florida, are
pioneering education reforms _ school vouchers, stringent school
testing _ that could have the same impact.
</P>
<P>
   They are pragmatic. They have to be. Half of them are faced with
legislatures that are either run by the Democrats or split between
the parties. To get anything done they must compromise. And getting
things done is their raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to do the stuff that improves people's lives. I can't
tell you the difference _ intellectually, emotionally _ between
being a governor and being a legislator,'' says Pennsylvania's Tom
Ridge, who used to be a congressman before he was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above that, they are pragmatic because they have a
fundamentally different constituency from that of congressional
Republicans. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are elected by small districts, redrawn every
decade. This is often done in such a way as to lump together all
the Republican subdivisions, or all the Democratic ones, into
single, like-thinking units. This tends to create partisan
bastions.
</P>
<P>
   The governors are different. They are elected by the state and
are therefore accountable to all voters, Republican, Democratic and
independent. The result, as Keating puts it, is ``two different
parties.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are ideological, confrontational, preferring
clear-cut decisions. The governors preach consensus and
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they may share the conservative views of many
congressional Republicans, but they do not share their political
habits, so it may be better to describe them as soft and smooth on
the outside, with crunchy bits: the ``praline'' wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   They are now seeking to make the whole party more to their
taste. That means transferring the state-level habits of government
up to Washington and moving some powers exercised in Washington
back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the repository of both these aims. Nearly all
Republican governors have endorsed him (only the maverick Gary
Johnson of New Mexico has backed someone else, Steve Forbes). And
they are helping him in less obvious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a ``conference call'' with the governors every two
weeks to get their opinions. In nearly every case, they have handed
over their campaigning machinery to him: they are honorary chairmen
of the Bush 2000 campaign in their states and their supporters are
his foot soldiers. That does not mean their states will go
Republican, of course, but it helps, especially in the primary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides go in for mutual back-scratching. Bush, his wife and
his father all campaigned for the party in the recent legislative
election in Virginia, helping the Republicans take the statehouse
for the first time this century.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (a strong Bush state) moved its primary election up to
Feb. 29, which should give Bush an early victory in a big state _
and a safety-net should he stumble in New Hampshire or Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above the support of the candidate, the governors are
raising their profile within the party. Four have been appointed
national spokesmen: on education, health care, taxes and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, for the first time, governors will meet
Republican senators to talk about the balance of power within their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors,'' says Lance Tarrance, the doyen of Republican
opinion pollsters, ``now define the political image of the
Republican Party.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   And they are determined, says Keating, to use their influence
when it comes to drawing up the party's election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, this was dominated by social conservatives, and proved
a disaster. Luckily, party rules say that it is a governor's turn
to have the chairmanship of the committee that draws up the
manifesto this time (the job rotates).
</P>
<P>
   John Engler of Michigan says that, at a minimum, governors
should also screen the state delegates who serve on this committee.
The aim of all this is more ambitious than merely to get Bush
elected.
</P>
<P>
   The governors want one of their own in the White House to
reassert the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which says that
all power not explicitly given to the federal government resides
with the states and the people _ an idea, they reckon, compromised
by years of centralization.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Republican revolution of 1994,'' says Tommy Thompson
of Wisconsin, ``everybody talked about devolution.'' But now
Republican governors are ``underneath the heels of mother
government in Washington, with her rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not all special pleading. In this year's budget,
Congress agreed, at Clinton's insistence, to finance the hiring of
100,000 new teachers. The states welcomed the money _ but not the
requirement that it be spent on extra teachers, which some states
do not need. ``It broke our hearts,'' says Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is offering something more to the governors' liking. He is
promising states almost total control over federal education money,
provided they test students and make schools accountable for the
results.
</P>
<P>
   This simultaneously increases the power of state governments and
of the federal department of education. But Republican governors
like the proposal because they support school testing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that, even if Bush is elected, he will
devolve power merely because he is a governor (after all, so was
Clinton). But on education, on welfare, on social policy generally,
the head of the Republican Governors' Association, Don Schafer of
North Dakota, is probably right when he says that ``as president,
George W. Bush would give unprecedented access to state governors
in shaping national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that it is not just up to the president and his
gubernatorial allies. Congress will have to approve any change they
propose, and the Democrats there are skeptical of the ``new
federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But, either way, if Bush is elected, devolution is likely to be
a defining issue for his presidency _ and the battle could
fundamentally alter the balance of power in America's system of
government. &QL;

   CARLSBAD, CALIF. _ The scene is the epitome of country-club
Republicanism. On manicured greens and fairways, business lobbyists
schmooze with golfing politicians. At the spa, large successful men
loll in the sauna like seals, exchanging gossip. Thin wives parade
their cosmetic surgery and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But close your eyes, move inside the conference hall, and you
hear something that does not chime with these images of the rich at
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda isn't to cut welfare benefits,'' says the man from
Arkansas. ``We want teachers to get better pay for teaching well.''
</P>
<P>
   The man from Oklahoma boasts about ``the largest road-building
program ever seen in the state.'' And the fellow from Louisiana
insists that ``we can make ourselves the party of the public-school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   These men are Republican state governors. They are gathered in
their Southern California resort not only to celebrate their
particular branch of Republicanism, not only to get one of their
own elected president, but to transform their party and even
America's system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Bush is helping us create a new Republican
Party,'' says Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Republican governors this decade has been one of
America's biggest political shifts. In 1992, after President Bill
Clinton was elected, there were 18 Republicans in state capitols,
five fewer than in 1988. Democrats had the governorships of all the
big states except California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reverse applies. Republicans have all the big states
(except California), and run a total of 31 states, with 70 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   These states have 340 electoral-college votes (270 are needed to
choose the president next year).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the governors were elected in the Republican landslide
of 1994. But, while the congressional Republicans who swept to
power that year have descended through bitter partisanship to
public vilification, the governors have become the most popular
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of the population approves of the job the
leaders of Congress are doing. On a conservative measure, compiled
by Thad Beyle of the University of North Carolina, the governors
enjoy an average job-approval rating of 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A different measure, used by a Washington Post-ABC poll, puts
the figure at 73 percent. George W. Bush scores 86 percent. Soviet
dictators would have settled for this.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it has not been hard to be a governor lately. The
states are awash with tax dollars. And, since they did not have
vast deficits to swallow up the early windfalls of the boom (all
but Vermont have balanced-budget requirements), the governors have
been pulling off an impressive feat for years: cutting taxes while
increasing both spending and surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed governors (Democratic as well as Republican) have cut
taxes six years running, by a cumulative $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, this could be a problem. Governors are spending
what could be a cyclical upswing in tax revenues on entitlements _
such as increased education _ which will be hard to reduce in a
downswing.
</P>
<P>
   But that is for the future. Right now, the main result is to
create a distinctive and increasingly vocal brand of Republicanism:
tax-cutting, ``compassionate,'' non-ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors are not all clones, of course. Some (George
W., Mike Leavitt of Utah) have boosted spending more than they have
cut taxes. Others (Christine Whitman in New Jersey, Frank Keating
in Oklahoma) have slashed taxes more. But all are policy
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   They experimented with welfare reform in the early 1990s,
lobbied for it at national level and, once Congress had seen the
light, implemented the reforms that have moved half of welfare
recipients into jobs. Now some, led by Jeb Bush in Florida, are
pioneering education reforms _ school vouchers, stringent school
testing _ that could have the same impact.
</P>
<P>
   They are pragmatic. They have to be. Half of them are faced with
legislatures that are either run by the Democrats or split between
the parties. To get anything done they must compromise. And getting
things done is their raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to do the stuff that improves people's lives. I can't
tell you the difference _ intellectually, emotionally _ between
being a governor and being a legislator,'' says Pennsylvania's Tom
Ridge, who used to be a congressman before he was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above that, they are pragmatic because they have a
fundamentally different constituency from that of congressional
Republicans. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are elected by small districts, redrawn every
decade. This is often done in such a way as to lump together all
the Republican subdivisions, or all the Democratic ones, into
single, like-thinking units. This tends to create partisan
bastions.
</P>
<P>
   The governors are different. They are elected by the state and
are therefore accountable to all voters, Republican, Democratic and
independent. The result, as Keating puts it, is ``two different
parties.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are ideological, confrontational, preferring
clear-cut decisions. The governors preach consensus and
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they may share the conservative views of many
congressional Republicans, but they do not share their political
habits, so it may be better to describe them as soft and smooth on
the outside, with crunchy bits: the ``praline'' wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   They are now seeking to make the whole party more to their
taste. That means transferring the state-level habits of government
up to Washington and moving some powers exercised in Washington
back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the repository of both these aims. Nearly all
Republican governors have endorsed him (only the maverick Gary
Johnson of New Mexico has backed someone else, Steve Forbes). And
they are helping him in less obvious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a ``conference call'' with the governors every two
weeks to get their opinions. In nearly every case, they have handed
over their campaigning machinery to him: they are honorary chairmen
of the Bush 2000 campaign in their states and their supporters are
his foot soldiers. That does not mean their states will go
Republican, of course, but it helps, especially in the primary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides go in for mutual back-scratching. Bush, his wife and
his father all campaigned for the party in the recent legislative
election in Virginia, helping the Republicans take the statehouse
for the first time this century.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (a strong Bush state) moved its primary election up to
Feb. 29, which should give Bush an early victory in a big state _
and a safety-net should he stumble in New Hampshire or Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above the support of the candidate, the governors are
raising their profile within the party. Four have been appointed
national spokesmen: on education, health care, taxes and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, for the first time, governors will meet
Republican senators to talk about the balance of power within their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors,'' says Lance Tarrance, the doyen of Republican
opinion pollsters, ``now define the political image of the
Republican Party.'' &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   And they are determined, says Keating, to use their influence
when it comes to drawing up the party's election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, this was dominated by social conservatives, and proved
a disaster. Luckily, party rules say that it is a governor's turn
to have the chairmanship of the committee that draws up the
manifesto this time (the job rotates).
</P>
<P>
   John Engler of Michigan says that, at a minimum, governors
should also screen the state delegates who serve on this committee.
The aim of all this is more ambitious than merely to get Bush
elected.
</P>
<P>
   The governors want one of their own in the White House to
reassert the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which says that
all power not explicitly given to the federal government resides
with the states and the people _ an idea, they reckon, compromised
by years of centralization.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Republican revolution of 1994,'' says Tommy Thompson
of Wisconsin, ``everybody talked about devolution.'' But now
Republican governors are ``underneath the heels of mother
government in Washington, with her rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not all special pleading. In this year's budget,
Congress agreed, at Clinton's insistence, to finance the hiring of
100,000 new teachers. The states welcomed the money _ but not the
requirement that it be spent on extra teachers, which some states
do not need. ``It broke our hearts,'' says Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is offering something more to the governors' liking. He is
promising states almost total control over federal education money,
provided they test students and make schools accountable for the
results.
</P>
<P>
   This simultaneously increases the power of state governments and
of the federal department of education. But Republican governors
like the proposal because they support school testing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that, even if Bush is elected, he will
devolve power merely because he is a governor (after all, so was
Clinton). But on education, on welfare, on social policy generally,
the head of the Republican Governors' Association, Don Schafer of
North Dakota, is probably right when he says that ``as president,
George W. Bush would give unprecedented access to state governors
in shaping national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that it is not just up to the president and his
gubernatorial allies. Congress will have to approve any change they
propose, and the Democrats there are skeptical of the ``new
federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But, either way, if Bush is elected, devolution is likely to be
a defining issue for his presidency _ and the battle could
fundamentally alter the balance of power in America's system of
government. &QL;

<P>
   SANTA FE, TEXAS _ As in hundreds of small towns all through
Texas, high-school football games in Santa Fe arouse emotions
almost as powerful as those of religion.
</P>
<P>
   School colors dominate the landscape around this windswept town
about an hour's drive south of Houston, and signs proclaiming ``Go
Indians'' (the team mascot) hang in the windows of local shops.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of Warpath Road stands the Medicine Man Pharmacy; on
the other, a sign for Big Chief Foods. On autumn Friday nights _
football nights _ Santa Fe residents gather to cheer the Indians to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the greatest drama has tended to occur
before the game. Twice now _ to a huge ovation from the crowd _
Marian Ward, a senior student, has taken up a microphone to deliver
a pre-game prayer.
</P>
<P>
   This would not generally cause much excitement; but Santa Fe is
now at the center of a debate about whether student-led prayers
before school football games violate the constitutional separation
of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging
the Santa Fe school district's policy of allowing the prayers. It
will hand down its decision next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The case has arisen from a lawsuit filed by the families of two
students, one Catholic and one Mormon, who claim that the
school-prayer policy violates the ``establishment clause,'' which
forbids government to get involved in any religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has invoked that clause in several
school-prayer cases over the past 40 years, creating a solid
argument that church and state must be separate. Its most recent
ruling, in 1992, barred clergymen from giving a blessing at
public-school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe school board, like other school-prayer advocates,
contends that football prayers fall into a different category. It
is pupils who offer the prayers, rather than school officials, and
it is also pupils who decide whether to have a pre-game prayer at
all. Surely this is just free expression, protected by the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's lawyer argues that, if the Santa Fe prayers are found
unconstitutional, this would amount to government control over what
students are allowed to say in an open forum.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, a law professor at Harvard, calls this a
``phoney'' argument. He says the only reason such a forum was
created at Santa Fe was to advocate a Christian world-view.
According to Dershowitz, ``You can be sure that the school would
not allow a student to get up and say ``In the name of Zeus, let's
have a good game tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that free religious expression based on a
majority vote is inherently unconstitutional, since it infringes
the rights of those, no matter how few, who may object.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the establishment clause, they argue, is to
ensure that state-sponsored gatherings (such as sporting events at
public schools) do not endorse the viewpoint of one religious group
at the expense of another. Thus, a student-led prayer offends
against the Constitution just as surely as one delivered by a
school official.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred political passions on both sides. At one of
this year's football games, dozens of Houstonians protested in
front of the field as Ward (protected by temporary federal court
injunctions) said her prayer, inciting the home crowd to cheer her
even more enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Even Governor George W. Bush has entered the fray, filing a
brief to the Supreme Court in support of the Santa Fe policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll, 82 percent of Texans supported his stand. The
court did not mention a separate issue within the Santa Fe case:
whether or not student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies are
constitutional. The case is different, since (even in Texas)
football games are voluntary, but graduations are usually
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the court will deal with this simply by
making a blanket statement about prayer at all high-school events.
And it is likely _ especially since, in the years since the
previous decision, two liberals have joined the court _ that it
will decide that prayer is illegal in every case. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ The question is ``too touchy'' to discuss in public,
says General Klaus Reinhardt, head of KFOR, the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, the United Nations mission in
Kosovo, declares it premature to talk about while his staff are
struggling to reopen schools, repair power stations and protect the
lives of the province's few remaining Serbs and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But, away from the public eye in the West, the U.N. bodies and
Russia, there is reluctant but growing agonizing about the possible
future independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Back in June, the U.N. passed a resolution that brought an end
to Serbian rule in the province, established a U.N. ``interim
administration'' and invited in NATO troops to police the peace.
But the resolution is a statement of intentions that, ultimately,
cannot be reconciled.

<P>
   It recognizes continued Yugoslav sovereignty over the Serbian
province, while instructing UNMIK to establish the institutions
``pending a final settlement'' of ``substantial autonomy and
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that nobody dares talk openly about what a final
settlement might be, nobody knows how a final settlement might be
established _ and no Kosovo Albanian is interested in living in an
autonomous part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   So it is by default, as well as for practical reasons, that the
U.N. in Kosovo is slowly helping to provide the province with all
the attributes of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Kosovars will start carrying U.N. Kosovo
identity cards and travel documents. U.N. customs officers already
operate on the external frontier with Macedonia and Albania. Cars
will soon have new license plates. And the Yugoslav dinar has, in
effect, been abolished.
</P>
<P>
   By September next year, local-government elections should have
been held. After that, the U.N. will have to start discussions
about the election of a Kosovo assembly and government.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that if, having lectured Kosovars about the virtues
of democracy, the voters duly elect an assembly only to be told
that it cannot proclaim the independence they seek, then NATO and
the U.N. may come to be seen as occupying powers rather than
liberators from Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian politicians are relaxed
about the future, because they believe that independence is
inevitable. But their patience is not infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to find, in two years or so, that the West was trying
to force Kosovo to stay inside a new federation with Serbia, some
of them at least might go back to war.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials in Pristina say they hope this
problem will disappear as the region changes. They argue that, if
and when Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, falls from
power, serious talks aimed at finding a compromise between Yugoslav
sovereignty and the Kosovar desire for independence can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not only do Kosovo's politicians reject outright any idea
of a compromise, but there is also no reason to assume that any
post-Milosevic government in Yugoslavia would be more pliant on
this question _ especially as it could not afford to lay itself
open to charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if, as is quite possible, Montenegro _ the tiny
coastal republic which, along with Serbia, makes up the rump
Yugoslavia _ were to declare independence, other intriguing
possibilities would open up.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of Montenegro, the Yugoslav federation would no longer
exist. Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia but not of Serbia, would
no longer technically have a job.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, a new question about Kosovo's future would arise,
because under its June resolution the U.N. is committed only to
``Yugoslav,'' not Serbian, sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   A darker possibility is that, if Montenegro were to declare
independence, and Milosevic were to resist its breaking away, NATO
might get another call for help. It would be difficult to ignore
such an appeal from the pro-western Montenegrin government.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing NATO wants is to be dragged into yet another
Balkan war. Amid such uncertainty, the diplomatic instinct seems to
be to wish the problem away.
</P>
<P>
   There is no appetite in western capitals to support Montenegro's
secession, but nor is there any desire to back the claims to the
territorial integrity of a country led by a man indicted as a war
criminal. Yet ``sticking our heads firmly in the sand,'' as one
western diplomat in Pristina puts it, is not much of a policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we accept independence as inevitable, and deal with the
remnant Serb population. Or we try somehow to convince Kosovo's
Albanians that they will never be independent, and try to restore
their contacts with Yugoslavia immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these things is likely to happen soon. The upshot in
Kosovo will be the creation of a unique and expensive protectorate,
in which its guarantors, NATO and the U.N., hope they do not become
the eventual targets of ethnic-Albanian rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, optimistic U.N. officials say that the future of Kosovo
is ``a process'' which has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the examples of Northern Ireland, South Africa and the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, one argues that, before any
final-settlement talks even begin, it would be ``difficult and
unnecessary to focus on the endgame.'' &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA _ The question is ``too touchy'' to discuss in public,
says General Klaus Reinhardt, head of KFOR, the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, the United Nations mission in
Kosovo, declares it premature to talk about while his staff are
struggling to reopen schools, repair power stations and protect the
lives of the province's few remaining Serbs and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But, away from the public eye in the West, the U.N. bodies and
Russia, there is reluctant but growing agonizing about the possible
future independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Back in June, the U.N. passed a resolution that brought an end
to Serbian rule in the province, established a U.N. ``interim
administration'' and invited in NATO troops to police the peace.
But the resolution is a statement of intentions that, ultimately,
cannot be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   It recognizes continued Yugoslav sovereignty over the Serbian
province, while instructing UNMIK to establish the institutions
``pending a final settlement'' of ``substantial autonomy and
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that nobody dares talk openly about what a final

<P>
   Smashing space probes into celestial bodies is becoming
fashionable. In July, Lunar Prospector was crashed at a speed of
6,000 kph (about 4,000 mph) into a dark crater near the moon's
south pole in what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to detect
water.
</P>
<P>
   And this was merely the precursor to several brutal encounters
that are due to take place between spacecraft and astronomical
objects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the solar system is taking a violent turn. The
European Space Agency (ESA) plans to chase a comet and then skewer
it with a harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   America's space agency, NASA, intends to use a huge copper
projectile to blow a hole in another comet, to see what it looks
like inside.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 3, two football-sized probes will smash into the
surface of Mars. The two probes, known collectively as the Deep
Space 2 mission, will be released from a probe called Mars Polar
Lander ten minutes before that also touches down near the planet's
south pole.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lander itself, the probes have no parachutes or
rocket motors to slow their descent _ just a protective
``aeroshell,'' which acts as a heat shield. This makes the probes
small and light enough to piggyback on the lander. But they are
also tough enough to survive an impact with the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   This impact will smash their aeroshells to pieces and embed the
probes in the soil. The impact will also cause the center of each
probe _ a sensor linked to the rest of the device by an umbilical
cord _ to bury itself a meter or so into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's main body will stay on the surface to transmit its
findings up to the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor craft, which will
then retransmit the data back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this violent approach is that slamming a probe
into the Martian soil is easier and cheaper than messing around
with a robot arm, and can penetrate further below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although the probes will seek evidence of water in the soil, and
take temperature and pressure readings, their main purpose is as a
technological demonstration. If they work, the crash-landing
technique could be used in subsequent missions to prick the skins
of other celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESA is planning an attack on a comet. Its three-ton
Rosetta probe will be launched in 2003, and will end up in orbit
around comet 46 P/Wirtanen in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Since comets are leftovers from billions of years ago, they are
regarded as crucial to understanding the formation of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   This comet was chosen for investigation because it is relatively
inactive _ most of the volatile materials in its nucleus having
been exhausted. (An active nucleus, spewing out gas and dust, would
be more dangerous to approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Having mapped the surface of the nucleus, Rosetta will release a
small lander. As the lander is pulled in by the comet's weak
gravity, it will unfurl three spring-loaded legs to absorb the
energy of the impact, and will then fire a harpoon into the comet's
surface to ensure that it stays put.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with this gentle pinprick, however, the NASA
researchers behind the Deep Impact probe are planning a giant
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a look at the inside of another comet _ called
P/Tempel-1 _ they plan to smash a projectile weighing half a ton
into it at 36,000 kph. This will, they calculate, produce a crater
as big as a football field and deep enough to swallow a seven-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, which is planned for July 4, 2005, will be so
violent that it should be visible through small telescopes on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the planners, the mission will have ``huge public
appeal'' because such an explosion ``naturally attracts the public
and schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the resulting cloud of debris will provide
information about conditions in the primordial solar system. It
could also put the normal fireworks seen that day in the shade. &QL;

   PISGAH, IOWA _ Geologically speaking, the Loess Hills of western
Iowa are one of the world's strangest regions.
</P>
<P>
   Loess (the word, at least in Iowa, rhymes with ``bus'') is soil
that was ground into a fine silt by glaciers between 13,000 and
24,000 years ago and then deposited by wind over 1,000 square miles
of Iowa, eventually to be collected in bluffs that stand 200 feet
(60 meters) high.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other country, China, can boast such thick layers of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing grand about the Loess Hills. Their charm lies
in subtlety. Cut this fine, pure soil at an angle and the rain will
destroy it. Cut it straight down and it will stand almost forever.
Leave a grassy patch of it alone and it will eventually sag into a
zigzag pattern called ``cat steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie flowers and animals which thrive there are found nowhere
else east of the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, dangers stalk the hills. Trees have invaded
the normally treeless prairie. Thoughtless soil stewardship has
encouraged erosion, as has full-blown soil-mining (the consistency
of loess makes it ideal for building fill).
</P>
<P>
   And there has been a great deal of building in urban areas in
the loess zone, even though the soil is prone to flooding when
disturbed; and even though geologists worry that once the outer
shell is removed, loess may be highly unstable.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that conservationists have turned the hills
into a local cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard of the Des Moines Register, the state's leading
newspaper, has spent the better part of two years writing articles
in favor of a larger protective role for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   His energetic work _ encouraged by fond memories of camping in
the hills _ is a throwback to the days when local newspapers
crusaded for worthy, if sometimes eccentric, causes.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, it is yielding results: Bruce Babbitt,
the interior secretary, visited the hills last year, and Congress
is close to passing legislation that would authorize a $275,000
Park Service study of options for protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics insist that, if Washington is to become involved
in the Loess Hills, it will have to be a different sort of
involvement from the usual Park Service model.
</P>
<P>
   Local landowners are not eager to sell their lands to the
federal government. County officials worry that putting more land
in government hands could drain scarce tax dollars from local
schools. And, in an area where gravel roads are the rule (and where
drivers are expected to lift a welcoming finger from their steering
wheel whenever they pass a vehicle coming in the other direction),
no one wants to see a crush of caravans and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the National Park Service is happy to be creative.
It has increasingly been looking at agreements under which local
residents hold on to most of the land in new parks while federal
officials stick to such tasks as interpreting nature for visitors
and providing landowners with conservation advice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many once-wary western Iowans are returning the
government's overtures by offering their full cooperation. That,
combined with recent agreements by several big companies and
government bodies to stop buying loess for fill in construction
projects, suggests that the Loess Hills may have life in them yet. &QL;

ALMODOVAR INDULGES FASCINATION WITH THE FEMININE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pedro Almodovar, the movie maestro of Spanish
excess, has always loved women. He has often been characterized as
a filmmaker with an acute sensitivity to feminine feelings of the
most intimate, extreme and wacky sort.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest widely acclaimed feature, ``All About My
Mother,'' that unmistakably emerges as Almodovar's dominant
concern. More than ``What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' more than
``The Flower of My Secret,'' more than even his biggest
international hit, ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,''
``Mother'' dissects, tests and celebrates female sensibility in
strange and wonderful ways.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with a certain fascination that the 48-year-old
writer-director had as a child growing up in a small town in
Spain's central La Mancha region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women who surrounded me in this village were very
interesting,'' Almodovar, wearing an olive guayabera shirt and his
trademark mop of unruly black hair, says in a mixture of English
and translated Spanish. ``It seemed to me that they possessed the
secret of life, that they seemed to live it better than the men
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only referring to my family, but men to me represented
power, and a power without explanation. I don't think that anymore,
but in the '50s, La Mancha was a very conservative, reactionary and
machista area. To get what they needed to get done, the women
learned how to act very well in real life. They were like
natural-born actresses who never went on stage but were always
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' is all about acting one's way through
life's travails, among many other things. The central figure is
Manuela, played by Argentine actress Cecilia Roth. Her life as a
Madrid nurse who convinces grieving survivors to donate their
deceased's organs for transplant is upended when her own teen-age
son, Esteban, is killed. She sublimates her grief by returning to
her hometown of Barcelona in hopes of finding the father Esteban
never knew but longed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   In the coastal city, Manuela becomes friends with an odd
assortment: La Agrado (Antonia San Juan), a transsexual hooker and
full-time self-dramatist; Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), an actual
actress, in town playing Blanche DuBois in ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' whose on-stage majesty both belies and reflects her
hopeless infatuation with a much younger, drug-addicted actress;
and Sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a young nun whose kindness to
Manuela's wayward ex has left her pregnant and HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   These women form a kind of pickup family, supporting one another
through tribulations both devastating and absurd. In the process,
they display incredible emotional resilience, although it often
takes a little subterfuge to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what he says about women as actresses in life,'' says
Cruz, the stunning young actress who is rapidly becoming Spain's
hottest cinematic export since that other Almodovar discovery,
Antonio Banderas. ``Pedro is a big observer, and he figured out as
a child that his mother and the aunts in his family were ... not
liars, but they would tell little lies to avoid trouble in such a
professional way that everything would turn out OK. I think that's
very funny, because we all do it, especially women. And I think
that's when he started to love actresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth first worked with Almodovar in the early '80s, after her
family had fled to Spain from the military junta that had taken
over Argentina. In those days, Almodovar films such as ``Dark
Habits'' expressed the wild gusts of freedom that were blowing
through the post-Franco nation following decades of its own fascist
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after working back in Argentina for many years, Roth sees a
new depth and maturity to her old friend's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I read the script, I understood Manuela deep
inside _ I smelled her,'' the petite blonde explains. ``After the
death of her son, she became a zombie, an empty vessel. But slowly,
her decision to go back through her life leads to filling herself
up again through these encounters and relationships with these
other characters. She becomes, again, a mother in different senses
with different people. At the end of this odyssey, it's all very
hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Paredes has worked with Almodovar off and on from
the '84 ``Dark Habits'' through the more recent features ``High
Heels'' and ``Flower of My Secret.'' She's probably best-known
outside Spain these days for her role as the grandmother in Roberto
Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' but there's something about Pedro
that always draws her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro knows well the types of relationships that form among
women, their character and complicity,'' Paredes says. ``He knows
that the feminine condition unites women. He has always observed
that women have the capacity to invent or transform reality to make
it more livable, more pleasant. This is what gives women this
innate capacity to act and perhaps comes from the fact that they've
been socially conditioned or repressed until very recently (and)
denied their physical, psychological and emotional needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of transforming ... San Juan, the popular Madrid
cabaret performer Almodovar picked to play the film's most
outrageous character, likes to keep the real nature of her own
sexual makeup enigmatic. Whatever her original gender may have
been, though, she thoroughly understands the imaginative female
survivalists Almodovar so adores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, women have spent a great deal of time alone,
talking to themselves,'' a chuckling San Juan says through a
translator, ``looking at themselves in the mirror, changing dresses
20 times, thinking alone; so they have developed this incredible
imagination. Also traditionally, men have been out on the street,
interacting and doing things, and because of that have not had a
chance to develop this kind of imagination. Women invent
constantly. They are creators, and it comes out of their solitude,
their loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film's bent toward melodrama and artifice, Almodovar
encouraged his actresses to play even the most outlandish,
emotionally extreme incidents in a down-to-earth manner quite
different from those of the filmmaker's earlier volatile heroines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I was conscious that I wanted to make a
much more sober film,'' Almodovar says. ``I call this a screwball
drama, rather than a comedy; I was much more interested in keeping
things completely transparent, even if some thought that that might
appear too simple. It talks about real and basic emotions, but not
in a loud way. In fact, the actresses were sometimes worried that
they weren't doing anything, but they were much more expressive
when they were like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The actresses concur _ and admit that tamping down their
emotions wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge was to be austere and modest in my
performance,'' Roth admits, ``make it so subtle yet still express
all the pain that was happening inside her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very expressive person _ I have to get it out of
myself,'' adds Cruz, who'll next be seen opposite Matt Damon in
Billy Bob Thornton's production of ``All the Pretty Horses.'' ``But
this approach makes this movie much stronger. All of the characters
are in very extreme situations, and all of them are together, so if
it had been done in a different, less-measured way, it could've
been crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still fairly weird. Almodovar gets a bit defensive when
asked about the trademark gender-bending and sexual provocations
that link ``Mother'' to his other films, but he admits that taking
such risks was thematically vital to the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is not only about the maternal instinct, it's about
the need to procreate,'' he explains. ``And that is a need that
even a transsexual can still have. I know such material is
delicate, but I think my talent is to mix it up and make it appear
natural. These characters do make up a family _ a peculiar family _
in the end, and it was very important to portray that as being as
natural as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Almodovar's artistic and thematic strategies seem to have
paid off. ``Mother'' is a huge hit in Europe, a top contender for
the European Union's film awards, Spain's official Oscar entry, and
it won its maker the directing prize at last spring's Cannes Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it seems to have elevated the onetime enfant
terrible of Spanish cinema to a new plateau of respect among
critics _ both the aesthetic and cultural kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm, again, hot,'' he says with a chuckle,
acknowledging that ``Women on the Verge,'' is more than a decade
old. ``But what is really good for me _ and I'm very surprised by
it _ is that everybody likes the movie. Always, in my career, there
have been people that really like my work but, also, people that
really dislike or hate it. There was always something
controversial, or a contentious situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, I guess because people are more familiar with what I
do, people have all been surprisingly accepting. That's put me in a
situation to do whatever I want. I did that in the past, but now I
don't feel that burden when I do a new movie. I feel free, like
people are going to watch what I do without prejudice or
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 13 movies, it seems, everyone now respects my
independence.'' &QL;

<P>
   Crossing the Sunshine Skyway Bridge never failed to depress Max
Timlin, even on this perfect morning when squadrons of brown
pelicans flew across a sky so blue it looked digitally enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature!'' he screamed at the windshield and smacked the
palm of his hand against the steering wheel so hard it stung.
</P>
<P>
   Max sat in his dream car, a 1965 Mustang convertible, black with
a cream-colored interior, purchased as a consolation prize after
his second divorce. The top was down, and as he gunned the car's
famous oversized 289 engine, a balmy breeze became a windstorm that
whipped through the ravaged wasteland that once was his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature, I really do,'' he said calmly now, and clicked
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was tuned to 92.1, the ``Rock Till You Drop'' station, but
instead of the Stones he got the whiny voice of Skeeter Davis,
``Don't they know, it's the end of the world? It ended when you
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned the tuner in disgust to National Public Radio only to
hear some windbag doctor singing the praises of another new miracle
drug to cure male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to revive a lot of dead marriages,'' said the
voice with an ugly little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late for me,'' thought Max, whose male potency drug of
choice had always been the Apalachicola Bay oyster. Suddenly his
favorite restaurants stopped serving them or served them with
doomsday warnings: ``If you eat these oysters, you'll enjoy the
hell out of them, but then they'll make you sick and you'll die.
Still hungry?''
</P>
<P>
   As he flipped a few random stalks of dirty blond hair out of his
blue eyes, his hand brushed against the scar on his forehead, a
result of a surgical procedure to remove skin cancer, basal cell
carcinoma. It was his sixth, nothing more than a disfiguring
nuisance, he thought, adding some twists and turns to the road map
of his face.
</P>
<P>
   His dermatologist would be furious to know that Max was riding
with the top down, but Max would not deprive himself of one of his
few remaining pleasures. He never worshipped the sun, but as a
teen-ager he had suffered from pizza-face acne, a condition his
parents hoped to ameliorate with weekly treatments under a sun
lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that burning and peeling may have helped your acne,'' said
Dr. Fishbine, some 35 years later, ``but they also gave you skin
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame it on the hole in the ozone, said the mischievous
doctor, blame it on your parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fishbine explained how years ago there were these shoe stores
called ``X-Ray'' shoes. You'd put your new shoes on and then slip
your feet into an X-ray machine to see how the shoes fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing we don't have a generation of people whose toes
are falling off,'' said Fishbine. ``How many things have we thought
were really good for us,'' he said, ``and they turned out to be
really bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Max thought about a generation of men taking male potency drugs.
Who could predict what one day would fall off?
</P>
<P>
   He was at the top of the Skyway now, and his mood darkened.
Forget the view of the Gulf of Mexico flowing into Tampa Bay, and
forget the bright white triangles of sailboats, followed by
dolphins at play. All he could remember now _ he shuddered when he
thought about it _ was that this was the spot in 1980 that the old
bridge was hit by a huge oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by gale-force winds, the harbor pilot steered the Summit
Venture into the Skyway, a sledgehammer crushing a sculpture made
of toothpicks. Much of the towering bridge was destroyed, and 35
people, most of them on a Greyhound bus, rode over the jagged end
of the bridge on a collective bungee jump without a cord, more than
175 feet down to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It took years and millions of dollars, but they built a
beautiful new bridge, one with a system of bumpers to protect
against runaway tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was so attractive, in fact, that more than 60 people
had killed themselves jumping off of it, nine in the last six
months alone. They were young and old, rich and poor, black and
white, straight and gay, drunk and sober, all coming and parking
and climbing the rail and looking down and letting go and falling
into that eternity or abyss that, in the end, is the only equality
the world offers.
</P>
<P>
   The last guy to jump tried to take his dog with him, but the
Rottweiler, named Daisy, survived. Max had tried to adopt that dog,
but the county didn't think, with his lifestyle, that he could give
the dog a good home. Why couldn't he get that Skeeter Davis song
out of his head?
</P>
<P>
   As he crossed the bridge north into St. Petersburg, he couldn't
rid himself of a pervasive sense of dread that the good things in
his life were behind him, that his hopes and aspirations had
expired, that he was driving off the 18th tee after playing a
miserable round.
</P>
<P>
   He was bright enough to recognize these as middle-aged angst, he
knew the Mustang was part of that, but they combined now in 1999,
with the end of a decade, the end of a century, the end of a
millennium. He was tired of things ending: his youth, his
marriages, his reporting job in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he was headed to St. Pete Beach, to meet a man named
K.J. Banks, a new editor with the Florida Sun, a newspaper Max very
much admired. Max had received an e-mail message the day before
asking him to meet Banks at the Gold Coin on a stretch of beach
called Pass-a-Grille, where, legend has it, pirates once landed to
grill their meat and drink their rum. The pirates were replaced by
tourists, the meat by grouper and shrimp, the rum by margaritas and
pina coladas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet me at 11,'' said the message. ``I've heard good things
about your work and know you are at loose ends. We can have a late
breakfast or early lunch. _ K.J. Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Max had been speeding, and the traffic was light, so he arrived
early. He remembered the Gold Coin from years ago, a delightful
little hole-in-the-wall now replaced by a grotesque three-story bar
with connecting restaurants, lounges and discos.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at a patio table overlooking the Gulf and waved at the
sea gulls diving at scraps left behind by previous customers. Max
pointed his finger and cocked his thumb at one and made a sound as
if he was firing a gun. K-choww! The noise scared the gull away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shot,'' said a woman's voice. Max turned and looked up to
see the figure of a tall woman standing between him and a blazing
sun. He shaded his eyes to block out the sunlight not already
eclipsed by a crown of dark wavy hair. She stepped aside so Max
could see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, I'm K.J. Banks. My friends call me Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   From experience, she knew that he was expecting a man, an
old-fart of an editor with patches on his sleeves and nicotine
stains on his fingers, or maybe one of those young corporate types
with the hundred-dollar haircuts and thousand-dollar suits. She
enjoyed his surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Max stood to shake her hand, which met his firmly. She looked
like someone famous, Susan Sarandon, maybe, but not the voluptuous
Atlantic City lemon-bath model. The woman before him was his age,
perhaps, but not _ like him _ a burnt-out shell of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a tan pantsuit over a white silk blouse, she looked
healthy and successful and could project both intelligence and
humor in a single ironic smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come with a proposition,'' she said, still shaking his
hand, ``and I know you won't disappoint me.''

<P>
   ``Do you like the movies, Max?'' said Kate Banks as if she were
going to ask him on a date.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a trick question, and he wondered if there was a
right answer. Maybe she was going to offer him a job as a movie
critic. He had filled in years ago for an aging critic recovering
from retinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At first Max had liked the idea of taking this little vacation
from real journalism, until the Christmas week he had to view 12
films _ no, not films, movies _ in six days. It turned his eyes to
black holes, his mind to mush, and his fingers to stone, and it
made him increasingly cranky about each movie, so that the ones he
saw early in the week got five stars, down to three, down to one,
down to a minus 2 for a Barbra Streisand flick, a grade his editor
refused to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just run the wire synopsis,'' she said, and never asked
him to review again.
</P>
<P>
   Max later came to see that time as an emblem for his life, that
experiences once chosen freely and with joy became soured by
obligation. It had happened with his two marriages and a cycle of
newspaper jobs. He wondered why this woman _ he was suddenly
intimidated by her _ would be interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like the movies, especially the old ones, so I mostly
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your favorite movie, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the early Bond flicks, but I'd be hard
pressed to choose between `Goldfinger' and `Thunderball.' How about
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My three older brothers would take me to the movies almost
every Saturday, and they liked the horror and monster movies, and
they would scare me to death, so that I would be crouching down
between the seats and looking with one eye through the cracks. My
favorite was `Godzilla,' the one with 10,000 Japanese actors and
extras and Raymond Burr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big lizard is back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, Max, that's what bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped talking for a minute and took a dragon-sized bite
from a blackened grouper sandwich, and wiped a stream of sauce from
the corner of her lip with the back of her hand. Max decided that
he liked her, even though he could not imagine where this
conversation was going or what she wanted of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese released `Godzilla' in 1954,'' she said, ``a
decade after we dropped the atomic bomb on them.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded Max that the movie was about a prehistoric monster
brought back to life by the testing of hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all the sequels, Max: `Godzilla vs. the Thing,'
`Godzilla vs. King Kong,' `Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster,' `Godzilla
vs. the Smog Monster,' `Rodan,' `Mothra,' I couldn't get enough.
When I got older, my friends told themselves I was being weird or
ironic, that I thought movies dubbed badly into English were funny.
But they weren't funny to me, Max. They weren't funny because
underneath all the rubber monster suits, they were all about
Hiroshima and mushroom clouds and radiation and mutations and, the
destruction of cities and civilizations, and the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what to say, Max took a long slug from his glass of
ice tea and leaned forward as if about to hear the solution to some
ancient puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's back, Max. You can't go to the freakin' movies
anymore without something destroying the world. If it isn't
lizards, it's dinosaurs. It if it isn't dinosaurs, it's aliens. If
it isn't aliens, it's comets, or meteorites, or asteroids. Next
thing it'll be hemorrhoids.''
</P>
<P>
   Max coughed and let out a laugh, and Kate Banks was laughing
too, and she took off her sunglasses, and revealed eyes so dark you
couldn't make out the pupils. She was close to his age, the
wrinkles around her eyes told that story, but the eyes themselves
were bright and youthful. This woman, 30 years ago, might have
inspired Van Morrison to write a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about `Titanic?''' he asked. ``A nice, sweet love
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the love story, Max. The ocean and the dark sky
full of stars _ that's the universe. The ship is the world. The
poor people are in the bottom, the rich on top. But nothing can
save them. Not hope, ambition, money, or technology. The ship goes
down, Max. The world goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a breath and changed her tone, back from the doomsday
prophet to the teaching editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here on the beach Max, and God has not made a
more perfect day, and it's the middle of 1999, the last year of a
decade, the last year of a century, the last year of a millennium.
Do you know what that word means, Max, I mean the Latin roots?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I was an altar boy once. It means a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how about the word millenarian?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that someone who is a thousand years old or someone who
makes women's hats?''
</P>
<P>
   She knew he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A millenarian is someone who is waiting for the world to end.
Who looks for a date like the year 2000 and expects the end will
come, that history, time, life as we know it, is over. In the eyes
of these people, any bad things that happen are signs of the last
days. Floods. Famines. War. A bear market. A shooting star. Or Ken
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, she reached over across the table and grabbed
one of his hands with her hand, pressed her nails into his flesh
and looked him straight in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these people are not just waiting for things to
happen. They want the world to end, and they can't wait for God to
make it happen. They're ready to take action themselves. They lead
others astray.''
</P>
<P>
   She read his look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paranoid, Max. I know what I'm talking about. It
happened with Jonestown and Waco and Oklahoma City. And I think
it's happening again _ and I think it's happening here _ now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your work, Max. You're not afraid of dangerous stories.
You covered the narco-terrorists in Miami. And everyone knows that
you were responsible for bringing to justice the church burners in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shook his head modestly. Like other reporters he found it
hard to give or receive praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard of a group called The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't they a rock group from the British Invasion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking of The Searchers. They did `Needles and Pins.'
The Watchers are an international group that set up shop in town
about two years ago, and word is they are recruiting young people,
and that their numbers are growing. I want you to investigate them
for me. Here's everything you'll need to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached into her purse and pulled out a silver key and a
single black computer disk and placed them carefully in his hand.

</P>

</P>
<P>
   It was almost a perfect morning, and no one was more surprised
at his cheeriness than Max Timlin. He was not a morning person _ or
an afternoon person, or an evening person, for that matter. But on
this summer morning, his coffee was strong and sweet, the breeze
off the Gulf was comforting, and an item in the morning paper made
him laugh:
</P>
<P>
   Television evangelist Curtis Woodson criticized the city of
Orlando for permitting gays and lesbians to carry rainbow-colored
banners, symbolizing diversity, in a Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no prophet,'' said Woodson, ``but I would not be waving
those flags in God's face if I were you. It'll bring about
terrorist bombs; it'll bring earthquakes, tornadoes and possibly a
meteor!''
</P>
<P>
   Max did not like Orlando much _ too much traffic, and too many
mouse ears. He chuckled at the idea of a meteor striking a theme
park, and how quickly it would take Disney to turn the huge crater
into a new attraction.
</P>
<P>
   He was still laughing _ he was almost giddy _ as he stood,
stretched, and leaned forward on the balcony rail. He looked to the
left and could see the Skyway Bridge, close enough to make out tiny
cars heading south.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, he lived on that side of the bridge, but now he
had a new place on St. Pete Beach. Kate Banks, editor of the
Florida Sun, had handed him a key to a condo on a stretch of sand
called Land's End.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gorgeous place, with cathedral ceilings, polished wood
floors, and expensive Florida art on the walls. He had never lived
anyplace like it. The place had two huge bedrooms, each with a
bath, one bath with a hot tub, a fancy office, a well-stocked
kitchen, and a living room extended onto a balcony with a
fifth-story view of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If the world was about to end, this was the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   That thought slapped him sober, like the old after-shave
commercial, and reminded him of why he was here. He had accepted a
strange proposal from Kate Banks, to investigate a group of
doomsday types called The Watchers. That was not so strange _ he'd
investigated and written about wackos and Wacos before. He
considered it a specialty. But Kate had added some stipulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to work out of my beach condo, not the newspaper
office. I live in a great old house not far from the paper. You can
phone me there. Only two people at the paper besides me will know
you are on the job: a photographer and a researcher. Here are their
names and numbers. You'll love working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the secrecy, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may remember that we won a Pulitzer in the 1970s for
covering the activities of the Science of God cult. They
infiltrated the newspaper. Stole files. Gathered dirt on the
reporters and editors, not a hard thing to do as it turns out, and
are still, after all these years, a pain in the butt. So just think
of us as a little gun-shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was not to come into the Florida Sun at any time. He could
access the newspaper's files and records electronically. The condo
office was completely wired. He could call Kate with any special
needs, and she would visit him once a week to check on him, and to
deliver his pay _ in cash.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more than cautious to Max; it seemed paranoid. But he
was not about to complain. He had a wallet bursting with money,
paradise for a pad, and, most important, a story to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Max reached into a desk drawer for an unlabeled black disk and
slid it into the slot in his computer. He called up a file named
``Leader.'' A color image slowly rolled from top to bottom until it
filled the screen and sharpened into focus. It was the face of a
man in his early 40s, perhaps a bit older. He had black wavy hair
atop an oval face. The jaw was strong, a cleft in the chin. The
eyes were narrow, deep-set, and dark brown, framed by dark brows.
The complexion was very pale, almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The full effect was severe, even threatening, except for the
smile, which was wide and inviting, so wide you were tempted to
count the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A text file revealed that this was Raoul Glaber, sometimes
called Roy Glaber, the founder and leader of The Watchers. There
was little known about Glaber outside of his association with his
religious group. He seemed almost like a man without a history. He
had turned down many requests for interviews, and became
increasingly reclusive, even as the work of The Watchers became
more public.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks was right. This was, by all its manifestations, a
millenarian group. From its creation, in 1977, Glaber had targeted
the year 2000 as climactic and apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is coming,'' he had written in an early pamphlet
``when the world as we know it will be shaken to its foundations.
The house of this world will crumble so that a new house can be
created. We will watch for the signs of the new world. We watch for
signs in the heavens, and for signs in the hearts of men. We, The
Watchers, will be ready when the Great Day comes. The date of the
Great Day is no mystery, but comes into our sight, only 23 years
down a narrow road which will end at a bridge which will cross from
a dark, decaying world into a bright new one.''
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked on an audio file enabling him to hear the voice of
Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come as a thief in the night,'' the voice said,
evoking what sounded like a biblical text familiar to Max. ``Woe
unto you who are working in the fields. Woe unto you if you are
great with child. Woe unto you who are not watching and waiting,
waiting and watching. For only those who watch will be ready, and
only those who are ready will cross over to a world remade. A world
washed in water. A world washed in fire. A world washed in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was mesmerized. His mind carried him back to a fifth-grade
class in Catholic School when Brother Brian Mahoney played
recordings of speeches by Hitler. Max didn't understand German, of
course, but the rising and falling intonations of the speaker
hypnotized and energized at the same time. When Der Fuhrer reached
a crescendo, the crowd roared _ how many people would it take to
raise such a cheer? When the recording ended, it snapped Max out of
what seemed like a trance.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brother Brian explained that this man had used his gift of
oratory for an evil purpose, to kill millions and millions of
people he hated: Jews, Gypsies, political opponents, homosexuals,
the physically handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Brian turned off the lights. For a dramatic minute the
room remained dark until he clicked on a slide projector. On a
white wall flashed image after image from something he called a
``concentration camp'': piles of skeletal bodies ready for plowing
into a mass grave, soldiers pointing rifles at terrified children,
naked women, old and young, being herded into a brick buildings,
living corpses standing behind barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Glaber's oratory had the same mesmerizing effect as
Hitler's_ but with one important difference: Glaber didn't sound as
if he were speaking to thousands upon thousands. His voice was not
thunder, but a zephyr. He sounded as if he were talking to one
person. He sounded, Max thought, as if he were whispering in your
ear. The Serpent in the Garden.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max begins his research on The Watchers, and
their charismatic and menacing leader, Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin couldn't remember a better meal, or a more congenial
partner, Ralph Rizzo, an iconoclastic Catholic priest with an
appetite for Cuban food. Their hunger brought them this Saturday
night to a favorite eatery, No Dinero, in the historic Ybor City
district of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Father Rizzo was one of several friends Max had met in St. Pete,
people he had written about while working in Gainesville, Miami and
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known for his dogged investigations, tracking
down bad guys, Max was no cynic. He knew that cynic was the Greek
word for ``dog.'' It was true, Max liked dogs, and sometimes felt
like a 14-year-old bloodhound, his best hunting days behind him,
but with a nose that could still pick up a scent.
</P>
<P>
   But Max was no cynic. In his own view of things, he was a
skeptic. A cynic could not believe that human beings were capable
of goodness. A skeptic doubted they were, but was always willing to
be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mother says she loves you,'' Max would quote an old
newspaper saying, ``check it out.'' But if it checks out, send her
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no saints and no heroes, thought Max, but there were
people of virtue and they were worth writing about. Sometimes he
had to fight his editors to make sure the story didn't get buried
deep in the paper, with the tire ads. But Max was stubborn and
liked the challenge of going against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of stories, ``Breach of Trust,'' came out about
priests and ministers who molested children, Max did a profile of
Father Ralph Rizzo, who in Max's words, ``combined the intellect
and sensibilities of a college metaphysics professor with the guts
and instincts of a union leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph, Brooklyn-born and the son of a longshoreman and a
schoolteacher, had abandoned university teaching and scholarly
writing for community organizing. He preached that there were only
two ways of reforming institutions: ``through the ear or up the
rear.'' He was good at both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, he had set up a free medical clinic, a food bank,
an AIDS hospice, a last-chance school for dropouts and an emergency
shelter for runaway teens. One television reporter dubbed him
``Father Teresa.'' Ralph bloodied his nose. This act won him
national attention, and no few admirers. Father Ralph was 62 years
old, wore a halo of curly, snow-white hair, and weighed about 140
pounds, but you didn't mess with him. He was Billy Martin in a
cassock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph, you ever heard of The Watchers?'' Max and Ralph began
their postprandial stroll down Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doomsday cult, no doubt about it,'' said Ralph. ``We've seen
kids at the shelter with Watcher T-shirts, even one with a `W'
tattooed on his arm. It's a sin to lure young people into something
like that, Max. These children need comfort and hope. When you're
16 and addicted to crack and HIV positive and living on the street,
it's pretty easy to believe that the world is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe it, Ralph? I mean that something big is about
to happen. In the year 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. Read the gospel. Jesus says the Kingdom is now. If you
don't believe me, ask the Man Himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Max looked down the street to see a man
surprisingly like Jesus in appearance, long brown hair and full
beard, a robe made of rough tan cloth, tied at the waist with a
rope. The man wore sandals. And, here was the real tip-off. He was
carrying a cross.
</P>
<P>
   The cross bore written messages, on both the vertical and cross
beams. ``Unless a man be born again in water and the spirit,''
``The Kingdom of God is at hand,'' and ``God so loved the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, on the long street in the heart of Ybor spread a
scene that was ripe for redemption. Hundreds of tourists,
teen-agers, music lovers and street people patrolled a district
that tried hard for a Bourbon Street effect, but came up
considerably short.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ybor was without its charms. Once the bustling center
of the Cuban-American cigar industry, Ybor still projected a quirky
ethnicity, including Latin dance clubs and wonderful little
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Father Ralph were sluggish from a feast of chicken and
rice, washed down with too much sangria, and polished off with a
delicious custard desert, and some sips of strong Cuban coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But as they made their way down the street, they walked past
strip clubs and tattoo parlors and thrift stores that gave the
place a seedier, more Bohemian flair. Father Ralph loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people Jesus would be hanging with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On one corner stood a nameless shop that sold holy objects,
blending traditional Catholic candles and sacramentals with the
trappings of voodoo and Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street was a nudie bar called Anytime Atoll, a garish
storefront awash in neon lights the color of lilacs. A young woman,
her hair dyed shoe-polish black and packed into a black-leather
body suit, stood, looking bored, in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you look at that,'' said Father Ralph. ``That young girl
has implants. I'd bet my collar on it.'' He wasn't wearing one.
``God gave that woman a beautiful body, and look whats she's done
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of offbeat perspective that Max found charming
about Ralph. In fact, an evening with Father Ralph was enough to
tempt even as lapsed a Catholic as Max back into the fold. ``Check
this out, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   A framed newspaper clipping in the window reminded passers-by
that this club was the home of an exotic dancer named Thrill Hills,
a woman who boasted a 65-25-35 figure.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa man was suing her for a ``whiplash injury incurred at a
bachelor party, where the curvaceous Ms. Hills allegedly whacked
him on the head with the most pendulous parts of her anatomy.''
Even Ralph was speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block they stopped at a shop called The Branding Iron,
which might best be described as a tattoo and body piercing
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptism leaves an indelible mark upon the soul,'' said Ralph.
But why would someone want to leave indelible marks upon the body?
``Perhaps I can understand it in the young, given their desire to
set themselves apart as members of a group, but look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   They stared at a photograph in the front window _ three women of
three different generations with matching rose tattoos on their
butts. A caption said they were grandmother, mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to all this, a sidewalk Jesus seemed almost normal, so
Max and Ralph rushed over to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a hundred dollars a night, plus tips,'' said the man,
who, after brief conversation, said his real name was Jacob
Coleman. He wore Birkenstock sandals. ``I'm Jewish,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So was Jesus,'' said Father Ralph, ``a good Jewish boy, real
name Joshua, with a wonderful Jewish mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then it happened. The front doors of The Branding Iron
burst open, almost as if there had been an explosion, and a group
of about a dozen young people rocketed out, so loud and so animated
they seemed part of the same reptilian organism, like Medusa's
head.
</P>
<P>
   The overall impression was black and white, boys and girls,
shaved heads, pierced nostrils, and serpentine tattoos. One carried
a music blaster, and it played something that sounded less like
music than a jagged, metallic vibration. A few toted skateboards
and roared, clumsily, into the street toward the three of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out, hippy dude,'' shouted what might have been the
leader and clipped the sidewalk Jesus at the ankles. Jacob Coleman
fell backwards and hit his head against the pavement. Max and
Father Ralph twisted out of the way to avoid the collision.
</P>
<P>
   A girl in the back of the pack held something that looked like a
toy rifle _ a super squirt gun maybe _ and pointed it at the prone
figure. Pop. Pop. Pop. Three paint balls hit Jesus in the chest,
soaking his robe in red. Just as quickly they turned the corner and
were gone.
</P>
<P>
   A figure stood on a nearby roof with a video camera and took in
the scene through the viewfinder. There, in the harsh street
lights, the camera captured the image of Father Ralph cradling the
body of the sidewalk savior in his arms, the poor man's Pieta. And
on one knee beside them, carrying the fallen cross over one
shoulder, was a dazed Max Timlin.

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max and his friend Ralph Rizzo, a Catholic
priest, enjoy an evening in one of the wilder parts of town,
ill-prepared for an encounter with a young group of Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In a funk, Max would yell that he ``hated nature,'' but, truth
be told, he hated technology more. Not all technology, of course.
He loved his car, a 1965 Mustang convertible. And he loved his VCR
although he never could figure out how to program it. And he loved
his little CD player, although he once told a friend that CDs made
music sound ``colder and more brittle'' than old vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, he loved his computer and the ease of revision it
offered the writer, instead of the endless retyping he could still
feel in his fingers from the 1970s. But tonight he could not get
his printer to work.
</P>
<P>
   He retried and retried and finally hollered ``I hate
technology'' and pounded his fist on the desktop. The printer
suddenly bleeped to life _ flashing green and yellow lights and a
burble of R2D2 noises _ and printed out the day's work.
</P>
<P>
   That morning he had read yet another news article about the
millennium's most frustrating technological glitch, known to
insiders as the Y2K problem. Y2K stood for the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a computer,'' the story read, ``1998 is merely 98, 1999 is
just 99, and so on. The trouble will arrive when 1999 rolls over to
2000 and computers get confused about how to interpret the double
zeros. The computers may think we've flashed back to 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't figure out why this problem would take more than 10
minutes and 10 dollars to fix, but experts insisted it would take
billions to kill the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fix, great computer networks would crash, plunging
air-traffic control, nuclear power plants, military installations,
international banking systems into chaos. Max could almost hear
computer after computer failing, clicking down, click, click,
click, like an equator of dominoes around the globe, click, click,
click, click ... click ... and then silence.
</P>
<P>
   The idea reminded Max of one of his favorite old books, ``Cat's
Cradle,'' by Kurt Vonnegut. Max remembered two details from the
story, that in a future world men and women made love through the
soles of their feet, and that the world ended when a renegade
element is loosed into the environment, turning all the world's
water to ice, slamming the future shut like a great iron door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, glad I found you decent.'' It was Kate Banks, and
even her soft voice made Max jump. ``Sorry I startled you. I buzzed
in at the front. When you didn't answer, I let myself in with my
key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting with my damn printer _ I mean your damn
printer.'' He handed her a file with about 30 pages of text. Not a
bad day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go over it on our way to dinner,'' she said. ``Let me
treat you. Do you like Italian?''
</P>
<P>
   Kate drove an old, gold Volvo sedan, vintage 1978 _ a quarter of
a million miles on her, said Kate proudly _ and Max enjoyed
watching her at the wheel. The car was in great shape, and Kate
looked wonderful driving it, wearing a pair of comfortable jeans, a
Florida State University T-shirt, white socks, and the only
extravagance, what looked like a $200 pair of running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She snapped off the radio, which was playing classical. ``Tell
me what you've found out, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you were right about The Watchers, Kate.'' It was the
first time he had used her name in conversation and wondered
whether it marked some kind of turning point. ``They are a classic
doomsday cult. Better yet, let's use your word: They are
millenarians. They don't seem to be Christians, in the conventional
sense, but they tend to quote the Bible _ especially the
apocalyptic stuff. They are very specific about the date Jan. 1,
2000. They associate it with something big, but it's not clear
what. The end of the world? A new world order? The Buccaneers win a
Super Bowl? Lions lying down with lambs? Lambs eating the lions?
What I can't tell you yet is how dark this thing is, or whether
they pose a risk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about members?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their pamphlets make one of those unprovable claims _
more than a million members worldwide. We'll know a little more in
the fall. They're planning a huge convention _ at the Star Dome if
you can believe that. But I don't think there are more than a
thousand in the area, and most of them live in Gulfport. They
actually own the Conquistador Hotel on Cosmos Key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of corporations is listed as the owner, but they all
trace back to Raoul Glaber, their leader. He's the one who scares
me. By all accounts he has this mesmerizing effect on people _
especially the young. The Watchers come in all ages, color and
sizes, but his recruiting efforts seem targeted toward the
alienated young, the kids we ran into _ or who ran into us _ in
Ybor City last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate nodded as they pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant
called Meat Balls. The place was owned by three Italian brothers
from the Bronx. In one room, which had about 12 tables, they served
the best Italian food Max had ever eaten _ a veal cacciatore,
tender beyond imagination, like butter. Max closed his eyes with
pleasure. Kate devoured the linguine with red clam sauce, and they
split a bottle of cheap Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   There were three large rooms in the back. One had a bowling
alley with only two lanes. You could use it at no charge, but you
had to replace the fallen pins by hand, like the old days. An
adjacent room had four pool tables, and Max and Kate shot two games
of eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   Max was winning the first, but scratched on the eight ball. Kate
won the next game in a rout. She was full of surprises, Max
thought, as he watched her lean over the table to kiss the winning
ball in the side pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think they call me Kate Banks?'' she said, laughing
at her own pun.
</P>
<P>
   The final room was a lounge with an old juke box and a tiny
dance floor. If you wanted to dance, you had to take off your shoes
to protect the shiny old wooden floor. Max couldn't believe how
relaxed he was feeling, or the renewal of his good spirits at a
time he assumed his life and work would be in continuous decline.
</P>
<P>
   They shared more wine and conversation, until Kate reached under
the table, undid the laces of her shoes and kicked his shin with a
stockinged foot. ``You up to a dance, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He loved music, but not what was playing, some corny old disco
number by the Bee Gees. He had told himself, over the years, that
more than nature and technology, he hated disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a dancer,'' he said, ``especially after a long
day of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suit yourself,'' she said with a smile, and scooted off to the
lady's room. Max suddenly felt oafish and over-the-hill, and walked
dejectedly over to the juke box, staring into its yellow light,
glancing for several minutes at the selections. One caught his eye,
an old favorite. The Stones had done the most famous version, but
the original was recorded by the great Stax-Volt artist, Irma
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He felt a hand on his shoulder. ``See one you like?'' It was
Kate, and her touch was like a jolt. He popped the number K-24.
``Ti-i-ime is on my side, yes it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma sounded like she was singing with a thousand-voice choir,
and Max felt like a parishioner in the Church of Soul. ``You'll
come runnin' back ... you'll come runnin' back, to me-e-e.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned and Kate's hand slid across his shoulders. He glided
one arm around her waist, and the other down her arm to her hand.
They locked fingers. Her cheek touched his, and he inhaled some
delicate flowery fragrance behind her ear. Max slipped off his
loafers and kicked them free. She put her feet softly on his. They
rocked gently back and forth in the light of the juke box like two
teen-agers transported back to the past, with a thousand years of
time ahead of them.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max ponders the Y2K computer bug before a
rendezvous with his editor Kate, an evening that turns to romance.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin was known as a fearless journalist, but, truth be
told, he was afraid of two things: lightning and high places. He
traced these phobias to a single event in his childhood, when a
baby sitter dragged him onto a roller coaster at the Georgia State
Fair. He could not have been more than 5 years old. He was so
terrified he could neither close his eyes nor scream. A bolt of
lightning crashed out of a dark blue sky. He wet his pants. And
that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he lived in the lightning capital of the world.
Three golfers were already dead this summer, the result of ignoring
the warning signs or trying to seek shelter under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to go, he thought, imagining some poor duffer raising
his sand wedge above his head, only to be zapped in midswing.
</P>
<P>
   He had read that a lightning strike could heat the surrounding
air to a temperature hotter than the sun. And this, it seems, had
been a record year for strikes, many of which had ignited forest
fires around the state.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the El Nino water currents in the Pacific were
being blamed for disaster after disaster. Tornadoes. Floods.
Droughts. Fires. Hurricanes. If one were looking to the skies for
signs of the last days, you didn't have to look too long or too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   But Max had more immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think we should go in, Kate?'' He turned a weather
ear to some distant rumblings over the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a while longer, Max. This breeze is so beautiful. And
look, there's a rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, to the southwest, a glorious rainbow arced from
Tampa Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, right over the Skyway Bridge. A
bridge over the bridge. But across the sky, blue-black clouds
gathered and billowed cinematically, illuminated from the inside by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Mississippi ... two Mississippi.'' He counted to six. A
faint rumble. They were still safe, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, will you answer me please?'' She reached up and punched
him on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   He now had proof that Kate was one hell of a journalist. Either
that, or she really was interested in him personally, and, in spite
of last night's slow dance, he found that hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   They had been walking along the beach for more than an hour now,
and she had asked him only a dozen questions. In return, he had
revealed to her all his secrets, including that he was petrified by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had been born in Atlanta, to a Catholic mother and a
Jewish father. That made him something of an outsider in a land
full of Protestants. He attended a small parochial school, St.
John's Elementary; a public high school in Buckhead; and got into
Emory on an academic scholarship, but left after a year.
</P>
<P>
   He hustled a job at a community weekly paper, the Auburn Caller,
covering high school sports. The decision broke his mother's heart
_ she thought of her only son as a doctor, or lawyer, or maybe even
a priest. His father, a criminal defense attorney, thought writing
would suit Max just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Max himself considered becoming a lawyer, mostly because his
favorite television show was ``Perry Mason.'' He imagined himself
the center of some dramatic courtroom scene, getting an arrogant
witness to admit that, yes, yes, he was the one who had committed
the murder, and that the beautiful, shapely blonde was _ in a
manner of speaking _ innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I visited my Dad's courtroom. I was about 12, and
realized that all that Raymond Burr stuff was just a crock. That
most trials were really boring. Then it occurred to me that what
had fascinated me was not the law, but the stories, the
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The breeze picked up and the sky lit up. ``One Mississippi, two
...'' This time the thunder rolled in at four. ``Let's go in,
Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until you tell me about your marriages.'' Not a topic he
usually talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short version is that I married and divorced twice. And
you'll find this interesting. Both times my wife ran off with the
same guy.'' More thunder. Kate looked at him in disbelief, and
tried to suppress a little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's true. His name is Lionel Cropper, but, of course, I
call him Crapper. He was my best friend _ once _ an editor who gave
me great assignments, but while I was all over the country, he was
all over my first wife, Helen. She died in a car crash. He was
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate reached over and squeezed his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the rebound, I fell in love with a young reporter, Jamie
Nelson, a beautiful, talented kid who I think was infatuated with
what she perceived to be a big-time reporter. We were married less
than a year, before Crapper managed to get her assigned to his
desk. As far as I know, they're still together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought of putting a hit out on this guy?'' A flash
of lightning. Louder thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to think that maybe it's all been for the best, that
I'm not cut out to be with somebody _ not in marriage anyway. At
least we were smart enough not to have any kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you regret that, Max? About the children, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being alone, finally. My mom's still alive and
well _ I've got few friends _ but good ones. I love dogs. Wish I
had one. But sometimes I wonder about being the end of the line,
the last of the Mohicans.'' He looked at the sky. ``What about you,
Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good marriage. Jonathan died 10 years ago. Lung
cancer. He was a terrible smoker. But those fierce blue eyes made
up for it. We made a baby, little Cassandra Banks. A wild child. A
great athlete, soccer and volleyball. She's off on her own. I don't
see her very often. I miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate began to cry. It took Max by surprise, until he realized
that his eyes were burning with tears too, not from crying, but
from the salty wind off the Gulf that was now whipping into a
mini-gale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever think about dying, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He had to speak louder now over the sound of the wind. ``Not
every day, if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean do you think that when you die, it's, it's _ all over _
like the way it was before you were born _ or is there something
waiting for us?'' Flash. One Mississippi. Crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy, Kate. I'm shaking. Please let's go in. At least
to the car.'' She threw herself on him and kissed him hard. He
caught her. And held her perfectly still, and sustained her weight,
and let her kiss him until she was through. One Mississippi ...
two... he counted to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Zzzzznnappp! A lightning bolt snapped so close, there was no
time to count. So loud it knocked them both to the sand. He could
smell it.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered her to her feet and raced toward the top of the
beach, it was raining hard suddenly, huge drops driven by the wind
into full sheets of water. He opened the door of the Mustang and
hustled her into the back seat and climbed in after her. The rain
drove down even harder, what he once called ``tarantula rains,''
his childhood mistake for ``torrential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more existential questions, Kate.'' Max tried to catch his
breath. ``You've brought down the wrath of the gods on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Max, but I miss Cassandra.'' She buried her head in
her hands as Max put his arm around her shoulder. ``I miss my
daughter.''
</P>

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max reveals his fear of lightning, which does
not deter Kate from leading him on a walk through a storm. She
reveals to him her concerns about her daughter. Max ponders the Y2K
computer bug before a rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Kate had assigned Max two helpers from the newspaper, the only
other people who knew he was on the trail of The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Rose was a crack researcher with an uncanny technical
instinct. She was in her mid-30s, tall, elegant and slightly
exotic, looking a little like NBC anchor Ann Curry. Violet was born
in Singapore, her father a British journalist, her mother a Chinese
translator.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Darling _ she received a lot of kidding after Bruce
Springsteen wrote a song with that title _ had been snapping photos
since she was a little girl in Cuba. She had a reputation as
inventive, independent, relentless and courageous, all the traits
Max appreciated in a photojournalist. Sherry was a short woman with
a delicate face and a surprisingly muscular body.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew her work and admired it. Sherry was a Pulitzer finalist
for her photographs of the 1980 Skyway Bridge disaster. A huge
tanker had hit the bridge in a fierce storm. At the exact moment
the storm cleared, Sherry was leaning out of a helicopter,
capturing startling images of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in town still talk about her picture of the yellow Buick
Skylark, stopped dead on a span of ragged metal, dangling 175 feet
above Tampa Bay. The driver escaped, but had to be restrained from
returning to the car to rescue his golf clubs from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee time is in three hours!'' he exclaimed, turning him into a
folk hero for a battalion of men wearing shiny white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew the Skyway disaster story well. He had written a
profile of the only man to fall from the bridge and survive. He was
Elmo Polonski, a man in his 50s, who had been driving south in a
pickup truck, on his way to work, when the oil tanker crashed into
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and truck soared through the air, heading down, down, the
ship getting closer and closer. His instinct was to hit the brakes.
The wheels of the truck hit the bow of the tanker and bounced off
into a choppy Gulf of Mexico. The truck submerged and the driver
escaped the cab, dazed and battered, but with just enough energy to
reach up and hook his arm over a rung of a rope ladder that had
been lowered to him. He blacked out and came to on the deck of the
ship, surrounded by strangers speaking Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Max remembered his lead for the story: ``Something interesting
happened to Elmo Polonski Friday on his way to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their shared history as chroniclers of the Skyway
disaster, Max was delighted to hook up with Sherry and her
colleague Violet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been all over the Internet,'' said Violet, ``and the
feeling I get is an increase in activities about The Watchers. More
Web sites, more conversation in New Age chat rooms, and Kate is
right _ much of the buzz centers on West Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet tapped out a few commands on her laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're planning a big convention _ you know about that, Max _
but they're talking like it's a Stones concert or something _ 30
maybe 40 thousand. They've booked the Star Dome. And they're making
a big deal that this is for `initiates' only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiates? I haven't come across that word with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like it sounds. Someone who has passed through an
initiation _ or joined the club _ or learned the secret handshake
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've checked all the photo files,'' said Sherry. ``Not much on
The Watchers _ a few photos of the leader _ but I went out and shot
some scenes around their headquarters at the Conquistador Hotel.
Take a look at these. The hotel is pink, but I might as well have
shot them in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   The images were of young people, from late teens into their
early 30s. They were entering the hotel or standing in small groups
in courtyards, or walking along the beach. What was remarkable was
that most were dressed in black, but some in white. The contrast
was startling in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The black tribe tended to be younger, like the kids he had seen
in Ybor City. The picture showed bald heads or spiky hair in weird
colors, tattoos, body piercing, lots of leather, even in the
Florida sun. If they were from the dungeons of Uranus, their
counterparts came from a yacht club on Neptune, neat white sports
clothes and shiny white running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The women wore white barrettes, or scarves, or headbands, the
men white sports caps with familiar logos. Their hair was short and
neatly groomed, their postures like models in a Spiegel catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory,'' said Sherry, ``is that we're seeing the before
and after effects of initiation.'' She explained that she dressed
like a tourist, took shots from a safe distance with a big lens,
pointing mostly at the water and sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   It was Violet's turn again. ``The Watchers draw from an odd mix
of mythologies and liturgies, on a spectrum from medieval
Catholicism to New Age Druids. I found out that initiation rites
are conducted _ all over the world _ on the eve of a full moon, and
always near the confluence of two bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the next full moon?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Thursday is the eve?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that these are public events. They are not
clandestine. They're even advertised in the alternative weekly.
Check this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet had clipped a small ad from the back page of Fishwrap, a
free and funky paper popular, because of the music news, with young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Are you watching?
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching alone?
</P>
<P>
   Then come watch with us.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   South end of Cosmos Key.
</P>
<P>
   Dress in black.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew that location well. The south end of Cosmos Key is the
closest point of land to the center of the Skyway Bridge, the exact
point where the Gulf of Mexico flows into Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that you'd look mighty fine in black, Sherry,
darlin'.'' She played along. ``Only way for you to find out, Boss,
is to rent a tux and take me to the dance.''

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin, out of a job and down on
his luck, is hired by editor Kate Banks to conduct a secret
investigation of a doomsday cult called The Watchers. Max begins
his research, focusing on the cult leader Raoul Glaber, a
charismatic man with a troubling message, who seems to be targeting
the young for recruitment. Max and a Catholic priest, Ralph Rizzo,
encounter a group of young Watchers in one of the wilder parts of
town. Kate begins to take a romantic interest in Max, much to his
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry arrived for The Watcher initiation ceremony
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pretend to be this biker couple hangin' with the punky
kids.'' It was Sherry's idea. She owned a Harley, and brought over
some biker gear for Max to wear: black jeans, a black and gold
Harley T-shirt, and a black helmet with a swirling snake design on
the sides. Sherry wore tight black shorts over a black bathing suit
and looked ``damn good,'' Max told her.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Max had never been on a motorcycle before, so he
was stuck riding behind Sherry, and though he enjoyed holding on to
her, he was glad they were riding at night so no one could get a
good look at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Pee-wee Herman,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the south end of Cosmos Key, Sherry slowed
down so the roar of the bike would not attract too much attention,
and then parked it near a palm tree at the north edge of the park.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, they could see that a crowd, maybe 200 to 300
people, had gathered. Most looked young and were dressed in black,
although they were mixed with a few onlookers dressed like tourists
attending a bonfire on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had lit a fire, which was illegal, although there was no
sign of the police. In general, Max hated beach cops. He'd received
too many petty parking tickets over the years, but, as Max and
Sherry walked hand in hand toward the site, not knowing what would
happen, he wished for some token of security.
</P>
<P>
   It was about an hour before midnight, a calm and cloudless
night. An almost round moon _ it would be full tomorrow _ had made
</P>
<P>
   its climb into the sky, turning colors from orange, to yellow,
to ivory. It was now positioned just to the southeast of the Skyway
Bridge. It made a nice photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry had rigged a small backpack with a hidden camera. She had
used the device before, usually chasing down corrupt politicians or
scam artists or gangsters. Her most famous ``gotcha'' photo was of
a well-known televangelist soliciting a teen-age prostitute. Sherry
and a policewoman, dressed like hookers, stood on a corner across
the street and caught the rat in the trap.
</P>
<P>
   So as Max and Sherry walked through the crowd, which continued
to grow, Sherry silently snapped dozens of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, old biker man, can I score a smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the approach of a tall, thin kid dressed
only in a pair of black Speedos and black flip-flops. His head was
shaved, but, more startling, he was completely hairless, even on
his arms and legs, and didn't appear to have any eyebrows or
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry pulled a pack of Camels from the front of her backpack
and handed him a cigarette and a light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to your hair, man?'' she asked. ``You look like
an Olympic swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaved it all off, biker lady. Getting ready for my
initiation.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he ran back toward a circle of friends and sat on the
edge of the beach looking out at the moon and the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was now about 10 minutes before midnight and the crowd had
grown to about 500 and pressed toward the water. A few boom boxes
had been playing the same strange metallic vibrations Max had heard
in Ybor City, but they were silent now, and the crowd calmed down,
and there was almost no noise, except for the sound of surf and the
croaking of sea birds, until the young man with no hair yelled,
``Watch! Over there!'' and pointed a long arm and skinny finger
toward the middle of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A sleek, white vessel sliced through the sea, the boat and its
wake brilliant in the moonlight. As it came closer, its huge
engines roaring, Max recognized it as something called a
``cigarette'' boat. Fast and powerful, it was favored by drug
runners in the tropics. This one was big, a 40- or 50-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The boat ate up the distance between the bridge and shore, its
engines now in a deafening roar, and Max could make out its full
size and elegance. He counted 12 figures on deck. Eleven men,
dressed in white, and what looked like a woman in a black, hooded
robe. Sherry had moved away from Max to a location where she could
snap away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome you all to the initiation rite of The Watchers,
here on the eve of the full moon, at the confluence of two great
bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat was wired for sound, although no speakers or
microphones were visible. The young man who issued the greeting
must have been wearing a wireless mike. He was not Raoul Glaber,
but a much younger man with hair so blond it looked almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The other men on deck looked equally young, blond and very
athletic, like TV infomercial models for exercise machines. ``Will
the candidates for initiation please come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points, the crowd parted to let through several
aspiring Watchers. Max counted 24 in all, 12 men and 12 women. He
estimated that they were in their late teens to early 30s. They
formed an awkward line at the shore where sea foam washed against
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The men on board, except the speaker, climbed down from the
anchored boat into the water, which was up to their chests, and
walked forward to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand before this bridge, an image of the world's
transformation. We watch for signs of the last days, and for that
day to come _ it is just before us _ when all that once was will
disappear, and time, newly born, will begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured toward the initiates. ``But first you must strip
yourself of the vestiges of the old, dark times.'' As if on cue,
the initiates began to remove their jewelry, most of it silver. One
man unpeeled several chains from around his neck. A girl took off
rings from each finger.
</P>
<P>
   The tall hairless kid removed earrings. One young woman, with
barbed wire tattoos on both arms, removed clips from her nose, ears
and an eyebrow. They dumped the jewelry into bags carried by the
men in white.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next startled Max, and by the buzz in the crowd,
several other onlookers. The initiates began to remove their
clothing. Off came bathing suits, and T-shirts, and caps, and black
jackets, and flip-flops, and even a pair of Doc Martens, until two
dozen figures stood in the moonlight, tall and short, doughy and
angular _ and completely naked. Sherry noticed that three of them
had the letter W tattooed on their snowy butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a glorious new beginning, for once you wore black,
when your hearts and minds were dark, but now, washed in this
water, you will wear white.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a roll call: ``James Weeks, Sasha Britton,
Bethany Davis ...''
</P>
<P>
   Each initiate was escorted by a Watcher out toward the boat,
leaned backwards like a dancer being dipped, and submerged in the
waters of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Kronauer, Russell Major, David Poynter ...''
</P>
<P>
   It reminded Max of the old-timey baptisms he remembered from the
evangelical South _ except for the nudity, which made this ceremony
look like a scene in a Salvador Dali painting.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the initiates were ushered back to the shoreline,
where they donned gleaming white robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, you will wear white,'' declared the
young man, ``until the day comes, and it will come soon _ watch for
it _ when we all will be clad in red _ the color of fire, the color
of Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   A cheer went up from the crowd, which evolved into a chant,
something you might hear at a political rally or a soccer game.
``Ra-oul ... Ra-oul ... Ra-oul.''
</P>
<P>
   It lasted for more than a minute, followed by another cheer, as
emerging from a cabin in the center of the boat, dressed in a dark
red running suit, emerged a man with dark hair and skin so pale it
looked ghostly in the moonlight. He stood behind the woman on the
deck, reached around her shoulders, and removed her hooded robe.
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the action and the cheer that went up from
the crowd, for there before him stood the most beautiful woman he
had ever seen, wearing nothing but long chestnut hair that cascaded
across her shoulders. He found himself embarrassed by this intimate
vision of her and lowered his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl's name is Angela Powers.'' Sherry was back now,
whispering in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began chanting her name: ``An-gel-a. ... An-gel-a
...'' until the man beside her raised his hands, silenced the
crowd, and began to speak.

<P>
   Max watched in fascination as the young woman, Angela Powers,
stepped elegantly down a ladder off the side of the boat and into
the water of the Gulf, which came up almost to her chin. She
executed an athletic surface dive and took three strong strokes,
stood, the water was now waist high, and walked unself-consciously
naked toward the shore.
</P>
<P>
   She looked maybe 21 years old, thought Max, about 5-foot-7, with
chestnut hair, wet and pulled back now, and skin that emitted a
healthy translucent glow even in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Max imagined the most beautiful model and the best woman athlete
merged into a single body. No gaunt, skeletal clothes hanger here,
but a woman who looked both voluptuous and chiseled _ how was that
possible? _ and as comfortable with her own body as a person could
be. Her eyes glowed blue, very blue.
</P>
<P>
   All the Watchers on shore stepped forward to greet her, and one
wrapped her in a dark red robe, the same color worn by Raoul
Glaber, who watched with a toothy smile from the boat. He began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela, our special angel, is now sheathed in red. It is the
color of blood, flame, Pentecost, the rising sun, the new
millennium, and, of course, the Florida State University football
team.'' The crowd burst into laughter at this unexpected bit of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see before you the bridge. A bridge to the sky. But also a
bridge of death, the place where too many have ascended and then
thrown their lives into the deep. It is a symbol of our times, of
our century.'' His voice was soft and steady, amplified perfectly
by an invisible sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the century that created the automobile and the
airplane and the television and the computer. Alan Shepard landed
there,'' he pointed to the moon, ``and hit a golf ball into space
right there. We created penicillin and cures for thousands of
diseases. People have hope of living longer and happier lives. So
maybe we should call our time the Age of Hope and Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, not to think of something to say, but as if preparing
to lift some great weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what have we done with the powers that have been given us?
We have become the masters of disasters. In 1915 the Ottoman Turks
killed a million Armenians. By 1933, Josef Stalin had caused the
death of more than 11 million of his countrymen, through systems of
starvation and torture. In three years, Pol Pot murdered more than
2 million, one out of every four Cambodians. If you committed the
crime of having a high school education, you could have been one of
his victims. In Uganda, thousands of victims of Idi Amin could be
found, their bodies mutilated, floating down rivers. In this very
decade hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have been hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what can we say of Hitler and the crimes of the Third
Reich? Just 22 Nazis were tried at Nuremberg for grotesque crimes
against humanity, crimes that separated, deported, tortured,
starved, gathered into concentration camps, gassed, and incinerated
6 million Jews and 5 million others. How do we begin to understand
this without declaring ours the Age of Hatred and Genocide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing in the God of Christians and Jews, but no
more. How does a just and merciful God rest amid the glories of
heaven, angelic music ringing in his ears, in the face of such
atrocities? Would a loving father permit such pain to be visited on
his children? How can this race of people think of itself as saved
or redeemed?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not worthy. And we cannot be worthy until this age
passes away, as a man walks across a bridge and leaves one side
behind and heads off for another. Our time must come to an end, and
a new age begin. An age of blackness must be purified, washed in
blood, healed by fire, before we can achieve an age of purity,
peace, and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are false prophets who have come before me with similar
messages. But salvation cannot be found in the poisoned potions of
Jonestown. Heaven is not behind the Halle-Bopp comet. It is not on
a faraway planet. You will not be whisked away there by friendly
aliens patting you on the back. And salvation is not in the
violence of Waco, or Oklahoma City, or Ruby Ridge. If I lead you
down those paths, walk away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2,000 years ago, a Jewish child was born in a tiny
village and given the name Joshua, although we know that man as
Jesus. His followers believe he died and rose from the dead and
ascended into heaven, but that he would return. One of them _ his
beloved friend John _ had a vision and wrote down what he saw in
what we now call the Book of the Apocalypse:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw an angel come down from heaven, and he laid hold on
Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the
bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him. And I saw
the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and
they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. And when the
thousand years expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured
them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
fire and brimstone. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
before God; and the books were opened. And whosoever was not found
written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children, look, I have inscribed your names into my book of
life.'' He held up what looked like a laptop computer. ``I accept
you as my own. I embrace you as a father. I gather you up and
shield you. I sit and watch with you for the time that is coming. I
heal you from the wounds placed upon you by your parents. Wounds of
abuse. Wounds of neglect. Wounds of addiction and dependency.
Wounds of crass materialism. They left you alone. They let you be
raised by strangers. While you were crying with grief or
loneliness, they dropped you off at the mall. They stood by while
you scarred your own bodies, or stuffed them to obesity, or starved
them to oblivion. They aborted you before you were born. And then
they went out and bought themselves a nice dinner, some dessert, a
carafe of wine. They created the Age that Hated Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love you, and I'LL LOVE YOU FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Raoul Glaber raised his voice, and
the crowd echoed back its cheers. Max looked and saw people holding
each other, tears streaming down faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come,'' he said, ``and follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down into the cabin of the boat and disappeared from
sight. In the next few minutes, his original 11 disciples, with
Angela Powers, waded out to the boat, climbed aboard, and prepared
to embark. The engines roared to life, the boat turned back toward
the bridge and sped off toward the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Back on shore, the new initiates greeted and hugged each other,
and were approached and congratulated by friends in the crowd, like
Jewish kids after their bar mitzvahs. Then they marched across the
park, stepped into three white vans _ with Conquistador Hotel on
the side _ and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry walked slowly, heads bowed, not touching now,
back toward her Harley, their every stepped being watched my a man
sitting on the branch of a nearby oak tree.

<P>
   If the world was going to end, thought Max, the best place to be
was in a traffic jam on U.S. 19, one of America's ugliest roads and
biggest parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more tourists and ``snowbirds'' flocked to West
Florida, the development and traffic clotted Route 19 to the point
of arteriosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good day to die,'' said Max to his Mustang,
quoting an old Native-American saying, and looking north toward
Clearwater and an endless line of traffic. Apocalypse today might
be considered a form of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half hour he inched by one strip shopping mall
after another, their stores offering everything from lawn furniture
to used cars to fast foods to lingerie modeling. Finally, he came
upon the landmark he was looking for, a large billboard inviting
one to stop in for a ``Quick Lube.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pulled the Mustang, its temperature gauge pointing toward
hot, into a big lot and parked it under a shady tree and pulled up
the top to avoid bird bombing runs. He had come here to meet Father
Ralph Rizzo and to sort out the things he had seen and heard at The
Watchers' initiation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He could not erase from his mind the image of Angela Powers,
naked as a newborn, shimmering wet in the moonlight. He told
himself that his thoughts about her were not lustful, that they
aroused in him a different kind of yearning, a fatherly desire to
save a lost daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph stood in the parking lot wearing sandals, khaki
shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a Yankees cap. As Max approached him,
Ralph swept his hand and pointed dramatically: ``Behold. There she
is. Our Lady of Clearwater. The Rainbow Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   It clicked now in Max's mind. He looked up to see on the glass
panels of a bank building the most remarkable image _ a
multicolored pattern of wavy bands that formed the familiar cloaked
outline of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Max remembered reading about
it. How a palm tree had been removed. How water from the sprinkler
system had washed upon the glass. How chemicals had bonded to form
this startling icon of red, blue, gold and violet. How this was now
a destination for pilgrims and preachers and miracle seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Max noticed about 100 votive candles before the image, along
with dozens of handwritten messages tacked to the fence. ``Dear
Mother of God. I am only 10 years old. My dad is sick and doesn't
have any money. Please help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph told Max that he came here once in a while to collect
messages, to greet pilgrims, and to minister to those seeking help.
He often directed them to food banks, or hospices, or AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two stories from the Gospel that always impressed
me,'' said Ralph, leading Max to a white plastic bench under a
tree. ``The first one is about this sick lady who figures that if
she can just touch the hem of His garment, she would be healed. It
says that Jesus felt the power going out of Him. In another town,
Jesus can't perform any miracles because the people there had no
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think God reached down from the sky and with some big
magic marker drew a picture of Mary on that glass? No. I think the
sprinkler system did that. The power is not in that image, but in
the faith of that 10-year-old boy who wants to help his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But people can believe in the wrong thing. The Nazis had faith
in Hitler. The Watchers have faith in Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does that name sound familiar to me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about him for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the first time I've focused on his name. Is this
the guy you saw on the boat _ with that beautiful girl?'' Max
nodded. ``Do you think Glaber has the hots for her?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a funny expression for a priest to use, and it evoked
from Max a muffled laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph turned professorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in The Watchers turns out to be a very old
story, Max. Social movements inspired by the millennium take many
shapes, but they always have two distinct features _ it's been that
way since the Middle Ages. I taught this stuff for years. First,
you need an alienated, disenfranchised, impoverished group _ in the
Dark Ages it was the peasants. And then you need a charismatic
leader who is self-important and usually a little loony. This Raoul
Glaber has obviously targeted the dispossessed young for
indoctrination. And he holds himself up as a kind of savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me, Ralph, is that I know this guy's a jerk, but
he makes a kind of perverse sense. It's hard to deny that we've
sort of screwed over a generation of young people. And we've
committed such atrocities over this century, some in the name of
religion. Maybe we've lost the chance to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull----,'' said Ralph. ``There are only three kinds of people
in the world. The ones like Glaber who look at things and see the
end. The ones, like that 10-year-old boy, who have hope even in the
dark days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the third kind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like you, Max, who can't make up your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a just and merciful God allow something like the
Holocaust to happen? I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Ralph. I'm
just trying to get inside Glaber's head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest trap in the world, Max. It's shows that, deep
down, you're a believer. If you believe only in chaos or accident
or biology, then you can account for someone like Hitler _ a crazy
person in a crazy world. If you believe in God, you've got some
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're not supposed to understand. Maybe you're just
supposed to act. To investigate this Glaber guy. And write a great
story. And save the life of that beautiful young woman. Maybe
that's the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here for a counseling session, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you come here for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to learn more about this millennium stuff. We may be
entering a new era, but I think I'm beyond the kind of rejuvenation
you're preaching, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You once had so much energy and passion. I admired that in
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've collected too many barnacles, Ralph, even for a good hull
scraper like you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever seen a piece of driftwood polished into
something glorious? Maybe God ain't done with you yet, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph got up from his seat to greet a tall, thin man with long,
unkempt hair, and a scraggly beard that flowed to his breastbone.
His face was gaunt, and Max could see that his belongings were
piled nearby in a grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, a foot shorter than this man, locked him in a bear hug
and dragged the man by the arm into the shade of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max,'' he said, ``I want you to meet Louis. He's a friend of
mine.''

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ For years on this tiny island where names and
loyalties go back centuries, it was called ``the secret'': the
harrowing but true story of how members of a local whaling crew
survived for 90 days adrift on the open sea after losing their ship
in the Pacific and running out of food.
</P>
<P>
   The disastrous voyage of the Essex, which was rammed and
eventually sent to the ocean's bottom by a great bull whale,
inspired Herman Melville to write ``Moby-Dick.'' But the real story
of the Essex, and its grim coda, never truly reached the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with lurid stories of ocean tragedies like ``The
Perfect Storm'' begetting a lucrative publishing phenomenon, the
dark past of this island better known for its wealthy tourists is
being packaged as a literary smash.
</P>
<P>
   Viking books paid Nantucket author Nat Philbrick a reported $1.2
million advance to write an account of the tragedy, which is
expected to be released in six months. For the past year Philbrick
has written from the dim basement of his quaint Nantucket home.
Filed in his makeshift office are neatly labeled folders: Whaling,
Starvation and Dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   And one more: Cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a reticent, always been a closed
community,'' explained David Wood, a Nantucket native and retired
schoolteacher. ``The secret is out of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret dates back to the island's heyday, the early 1800s,
when Nantucket was the world's greatest whaling port. The roofs at
the top of shingled houses were used as lookouts for incoming
ships. For a Nantucketer, the whale's oil, so precious that it was
used to anoint the pope, provided unimagined riches.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many sources of wealth, it came with a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody whale trade claimed many casualties _ the lookouts
atop the whalers' homes became known as ``widows' walks'' _ but the
Essex tragedy was the one that would rock the Quaker town through
the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the tragedy unravels from Philbrick's research
and the memoirs of the ship's first mate.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, 1819, Captain George Pollard and his crew of 20
boarded the Essex and began their voyage to the rich whaling
grounds of the Pacific. The officers on the ship were all
Nantucketers. Many crew members were from Cape Cod. One came from
England, and five whalers _ all African-Americans _ arrived from
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The tour went well for more than a year. By October 1820, the
crew had gathered 900 barrels of sperm oil before reaching the
Galapagos Islands. But a month later, on Nov. 20, the voyage took a
deadly turn.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Chase, the first mate, was repairing his smaller whaleboat
on deck when he turned and saw a giant sperm whale lying quietly on
the sea surface. As he gazed at the huge mammal, it suddenly rushed
the boat, thrusting and parting the waters like a locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was stunned. Whales usually were either docile or playful.
With a shudder, Chase realized that the pursuers of whales were
about to become the pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The giant animal struck the boat with a terrifying heave,
sending crew members sprawling across the deck. Then it turned and
attacked again. Within minutes, the Essex was taking on water. Soon
it was a crumpled, listing wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a supposedly dumb beast to deliberately sink a ship _ that
is horrifying,'' said Renny Stackpole, a Nantucket native and
maritime scholar. ``Melville locked on to this modus for the
conclusion of ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Captain Ahab, Melville's doomed protagonist, the crew of
the Essex seemed to be led by supernatural forces of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Their ship beyond repair, the men retreated to three smaller
whaleboats, with some provisions, and headed south. For one month,
they floated at sea on the 28-foot skiffs before landing on a
barren island. The portents were bad: They found little food, very
little water, and, ominously, the skeletal remains of six men who
apparently had been shipwrecked there decades in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the crew members elected to remain on the island while
Pollard and the other 17 crew members returned to the sea. The
three boats, leaking and ragged, took to the sea with one commanded
by the captain; another headed by First Mate Chase, and a third
under the command of another officer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their efforts to stay together, a severe storm soon
separated the boats. With provisions running out, three crew
members starved to death.
</P>
<P>
   It was after one sailor became delirious and died on Chase's
boat that the first mate suggested using the body for food. His
crew of three men agreed _ grimly separating the limbs and
``devouring'' the heart, according to his later account.
</P>
<P>
   The three men removed the flesh from the body, roasted it, and
ate for nine days before being rescued off the coast of South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew not whose lot it would fall next, either die or be
shot,'' wrote Chase, explaining that the starving men were prepared
to resort to murder to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an even grimmer story was unfolding on the boat
commanded by Pollard. The captain's boat had briefly reunited with
the third boat, only to be swept apart again by another violent
storm. The third boat was never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Pollard's crew members began starving. On Feb. 1, 1821,
the last four survivors, all Nantucketers, picked straws. They
apparently agreed that the loser of the lottery would be killed and
then consumed by the remaining crew. The shortest lot went to the
captain's teenage cousin, who agreed to be shot and then eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lad, my lad,'' exclaimed the captain. ``If you don't like
your lot I will shoot the first man who touches you.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, uncertain whether to choose death or continued
suffering, said he would accept his fate like a man.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot and eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Another man died naturally and was used for food before the
captain and another teenage crew member were rescued off the
Chilean coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all three men who chose to stay on the barren island
were rescued months later by a vessel sent from Nantucket to search
for the crew of the Essex. But only five men _ all Nantucketers _
made it off the whaleboats alive.
</P>
<P>
   News of the shipwreck had already reached the island newspapers
by the time of the rescues. Rumors of cannibalism, the worst
abomination in the eyes of Quakers, blew through the town like a
tempest.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the survivors' return to Nantucket, dozens of
islanders stood by the bay not uttering a word as the weary men
walked to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother of the youngster that pulled the unlucky lot
couldn't stand the sight of the captain after he told her of her
son's fate,'' said Philbrick.
</P>
<P>
   But, Philbrick said, many Nantucketers felt sorry for the
captain and supported him by giving him another job as commander of
a ship. But when that was shipwrecked, too, near the Hawaiian
Islands, the 34-year-old captain was deemed unlucky, and never went
to sea again. He spent the rest of his years walking the
cobblestone streets as the town's night watchman.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there are aspects of the Essex disaster that puzzle
Nantucket scholars.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery, say Stackpole and Philbrick, is why the four black
men on the captain's boat were the first to die. It may have been
mere coincidence, since there is no evidence to show that the men
were killed. But their unexplained deaths have always haunted the
abolitionist community that knew too well of the sometimes brutal
treatment of black whalers.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the story of the Essex became an international
scandal, with reporters from as far away as Australia covering it.
Melville and Ralph Waldo Emerson would visit the captain, said
Philbrick, and pepper him with questions.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Essex shipwreck, Melville was known mainly as
the author of pulp adventure novels, drawing on his youthful
experience as a whaler. ``Moby-Dick,'' punctuated by the dramatic
whale attack drawn from the Essex tragedy, became the greatest
American novel in the eyes of many scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after its publication, as the fame of ``Moby-Dick'' grew,
memories of the Essex disaster waned: It was no longer a legendary
story of survival but the backdrop for a great novel. Soon the
stories that once scandalized the island quieted into a delicate
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nantucketers wouldn't talk about it for the better part of the
century,'' said Stackpole.
</P>
<P>
   But when the whaling industry was replaced by tourism and all
the blood relatives of the victims had died, locals began to accept
the tragedy as part of their history, said Jim Patrick, a local
writer and house painter.
</P>
<P>
   Philbrick, 43, moved to Nantucket to become an author 14 years
ago, carrying memories of childhood tales of the Essex disaster. As
a little boy in Pittsburgh, Philbrick's uncle and father, both
maritime scholars, would tell him stories of the whale that
destroyed the Nantucket vessel.
</P>
<P>
   So two years ago, when Philbrick, who heads an institute on
maritime tradition in Nantucket, was trying to get Sebastian
Junger, author of ``The Perfect Storm,'' to speak on the island, he
mentioned the idea of writing a book about the Essex to the
author's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy it was a story about a whale, but as an adult who
moved to Nantucket, I began to relate to these men,'' Philbrick
said. ``I began to see what living this tragedy must have been
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in Nantucket, discussions of the Essex and the impending
book can be heard in local coffee houses, and even in a senior
community center.
</P>
<P>
   Sarcasm about cannibalism is common on the island: ``You mean
the story about our ancestors eating our other ancestors,'' quipped
a local waitress as she served lunch to her customers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Atlantic Cafe, a popular tavern, Peter Eldridge, a
burly carpenter, sipped a beer and defended the actions of the
Essex survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time ago,'' he said. ``If you strip off our
clothes and put us out there _ we are all animals. It would be no
different if the people had been from anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Eldridge, the survivors, especially the doomed
captain, are heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that the survivors saw it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The first mate, Chase, went on to become a successful seaman,
one of the wealthier captains on Nantucket. But in his twilight
years, memories of cannibalism began to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   The feeble old man, still living on the island, would order
twice the amount of groceries needed for his prosperous household _
enough food for an entire ship's crew _ and hoard it in the attic,
so he would never grow hungry.
</P>
<P>
   He died insane.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was late in another long, grueling day on the gloomy,
depressing set of ``The Green Mile,'' but Tom Hanks was finished
for the day, free to go.
 &HT;    So co-star Michael Clarke Duncan was all the more surprised to
find Hanks, two hours later, still on the set in full prison-guard
costume, watching actor Jeffrey DeMunn filming a scene.
 &HT;    ``I went to him and said, `Man, why are you here? If I'd wrapped
two hours ago, I'd be in my truck and gone,''' Duncan recalls. ``He
said, `Jeffrey DeMunn has to give me a look over here.'''
 &HT;    Duncan shakes his head in wonderment.
 &HT;    ``They could've gotten a production assistant to sit there,'' he
says. ``Tom said, `If Jeffrey looks and sees my face, his reaction
may be that much different or better than if he looked at a
stranger. That's why I'm here _ I want this movie to be good, so I
have to make a sacrifice.'
 &HT;    ``After that I had a new outlook,'' Duncan says. ``It's not just
about your scenes, your closeups _ it's about the whole team
effort. When I saw Tom do that, I knew this guy was one of the
greatest actors I've ever worked with.''
 &HT;    When Duncan's story comes up later during an interview at the
Park Hyatt in Century City, Calif., Hanks reacts with a faint air
of embarrassment. If he taught Duncan anything from the experience,
he says, he is glad to have been able to pass along a lesson taught
him by Oscar-winner Sally Field, his co-star in ``Punchline''
(1988).
 &HT;    ``I was shooting a scene where I was on the phone and I was
supposed to be speaking to Sally, who wasn't even working that
day,'' he recalls. ``I picked up, and she was on the other end.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Sally, where are you?''' Hanks says. ``She was in a
little room on the other side of the sound stage. I said, `What are
you doing here?' She said, `We have a scene together.' I said, `But
you're on the phone!'''
 &HT;    Hanks smiles softly at the memory.
 &HT;    ``You learn that kind of thing,'' he says. ``At a time when
you're allowed to be as cranky and lazy (as you want), when the
structure is in place to let you be the biggest a--hole you
possibly want to be, it's important that you still live up to your
responsibilities as a professional.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how to explain it,'' he says, scratching at the
beard he's grown for an upcoming role. ``This is what I do, and I
take great pride in what I do. By and large, I try to live up to
the faith everybody puts in me when they pay me the money.''
 &HT;    Given that Hanks banks $20 million a movie, there's a lot more
than faith at stake. Fortunately for all concerned, however, the
actor continues to churn out hits, from ``Sleepless in Seattle''
(1993), ``Philadelphia'' (1993) and ``Forrest Gump'' (1994) through
``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998) and ``You've Got Mail'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``The Green Mile,'' based on Stephen King's novel and set to
open nationwide on Dec. 10, casts him as the head guard on death
row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935. The film pivots on his
relationship with a hulking black prisoner (Duncan) who seems to
possess a miraculous supernatural power.
 &HT;    It's a strange story, by turns uplifting and heart-rending,
which Hanks says is exactly what he likes about it.
 &HT;    ``All true myths or folk tales, in their original form,
illuminate the paradox of what it is to be alive,'' Hanks says.
``Instead of there being a happy ending where everybody who's
innocent is rewarded and everybody who's bad is punished, for every
blessing there is a curse and for every triumph there is a tragedy.
 &HT;    ``That, to me, is the great road human beings walk every day,''
the actor says. ``We're trying to solve the mysteries of why that's
the case, and there is no solution.
 &HT;    ``That's why the movie is more oddly attractive to a big
audience than you'd think,'' he adds. ``You'd never think you'd
come out feeling somehow good or cathartic or, `Oh my God, I sure
am glad I spent those three hours on death row with those guys.'
 &HT;    ``But I think you do after this movie.''
 &HT;    Several scenes were filmed at the shuttered Tennessee State
Penitentiary, and Hanks took the opportunity to tour the prison's
old death-row building. The facility's electric chair had long
since been removed, but Hanks found the death chamber evocative
nonetheless.
 &HT;    ``The real prison was empty, but there were vibes,'' he recalls.
``It's not hard to go in and think, `Oh my God, could you imagine
coming here day in and day out?'
 &HT;    ``And the real death row was a creepy, creepy place.''
 &HT;    Creepy as it was, visiting death row _ and, for that matter, the
entire experience of making ``Green Mile'' _ didn't alter Hanks'
support of capital punishment.
 &HT;    ``It didn't change it at all,'' he says. ``I don't think the
film could possibly change anybody's idea of what they think _
you're either in favor of it or you're not. You either think it's
something important or you don't. You either think it's an
abomination or it's justice.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what I think,'' he says thoughtfully. ``There
are plenty of people who should be put to death for their crimes,
and there are probably people who shouldn't be put to death for
their crimes. On a case-by-case basis, I think there's a lot of
room for gray area.
 &HT;    ``I think some people are born bad and some are made bad,'' he
concludes. ``I don't believe in absolutes. I don't necessarily
believe people are born good or that they can be made good.
 &HT;    ``There are 4 billion people in the world, and 4 billion
variations on the theme.''
 &HT;    Death row is a long way from Hanks' days on the television
sitcom ``Bosom Buddies'' and his earliest big-screen success in
such goofy-guy epics as ``Splash'' (1984) and ``Bachelor Party''
(1984). He's a major star now, with formidable clout in Hollywood
and a worldwide fan base.
 &HT;    Every once in a while, however, Hanks is sitting in the living
room of the house he shares with his wife, actress Rita Wilson, and
their children. And onto the television screen flickers, say, an
old episode of ``Bosom Buddies'' or a scene from ``Bachelor
Party.''
 &HT;    ``I think, `Where did that enthusiastic young man go?''' the
43-year-old Hanks says, laughing. ``I change the channel.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe not every time, he admits.
 &HT;    ``The types of films I made early, I was thrilled to have
done,'' he says. ``I have a tendency to denigrate all the movies
I've made. That's a bad thing _ `Oh, it's some sad little movie
about a house.'
 &HT;    ``But, in fact, what I was learning at the time was really
important,'' Hanks says. ``Part of it was that those were the
opportunities I had then. The only thing I was somewhat cognizant
of was that I was trying to expand my horizons as an artist within
the confines of the options afforded me.
 &HT;    ``I think I was able to do that,'' he concludes, ``but the
nature of what fascinated me, the themes I thought I could bring
something to when I was 27 or 32, were very different from what
they are now.
 &HT;    ``But I look at the older movies and think, `Hmm, not a bad
job.'''

 (Includes a color slide of singer Shania Twain.) 
 By MARGY HOLLAND  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's hot, there's really hot and then there's Shania Twain.
 &HT;    The Canadian-born singer is closing out the millennium as one of
the most successful singers in the world. Her record-setting sales
and numerous accolades and industry awards have put her in a league
of her own: Sales of her most recent album, ``Come On Over''
(Universal-Polygram, 1997) have reached a staggering 13 million,
leaving her second only to pop/rock singer Alanis Morissette in
album sales by a female.
 &HT;    More recently, Twain received the prestigious Entertainer of the
Year award from the Country Music Association, the first time she's
received that honor.
 &HT;    So what does a 34-year-old who's risen from grinding poverty to
the pinnacle of success do when she's named Entertainer of the
Year?
 &HT;    Twain celebrated after the show by routing her limousine driver
through the Krispy Kreme drive-through window for ``one of those
great donuts they brought to us every day when we were recording
`Come On Over.'''
 &HT;    If that sounds like someone not exactly caught up in the awards
game, it should. Twain's CMA award now sits in her stable,
alongside her Grammies, gold and platinum records and untold
numbers of other honors.
 &HT;    ``I'm as excited as anyone when I get up there and win,'' she
says, ``but, to be honest with you, I don't sit there waiting. I
learned a long time ago that you just end up being very
disappointed. I think it can make you very bitter if you put too
much weight on that.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be bitter,'' the singer says. ``I don't even
want to compete on that level, so I take it very lightly,
actually.''
 &HT;    Twain wrapped up her first world tour this past summer,
performing before sold-out crowds of as many as 30,000 _ which, she
says, means a lot more than any award.
 &HT;    ``When I went out there, I didn't feel like I needed to prove
anything to anyone,'' Twain says. ``I understood that most people
didn't know my background. They had never really seen much of me
live.
 &HT;    ``Before I got my record deal, my livelihood was singing live,''
she adds. ``That's what I did. I am no different on my stage than I
was in any club. Throughout my childhood and all of my teens, it
was just me and a bar.
 &HT;    ``It was mostly rock music,'' Twain recalls, ``which requires a
lot of energy. Rock is the hardest thing to sing night after night,
six nights a week, with a matinee, and you're traveling in a very
dumpy truck and terrible hotels and it's awful.''
 &HT;    She shrugs, then smiles.
 &HT;    ``I've done all that,'' she says, ``so going into this situation
on the road was like a luxury, it was like floating on a cloud.
I've got this amazing bus, I've got my dog with me, I've got my
horse, I've got all sorts of wonderful people around me that I've
hand-chosen, so I know I like them. I'm making a great living, and
I don't even sing every night of the week _ I'm singing sometimes
two or three shows in a row at the most.
 &HT;    ``What an easy gig!
 &HT;    ``It was like nothing compared to what I was used to,'' she says
cheerfully, ``so if you come from that background and it was your
living, this kind of touring is pretty darn easy and fun.''
 &HT;    While Twain's life has certainly changed since her childhood in
Timmins, Ont., she says that she resists the star treatment and
does her best to live a normal life.
 &HT;    ``Everyone loves attention,'' she says. ``We love the attention
when it's complimentary and we hate the attention when it sucks, so
we're all the same. I'm no different than anyone else _ but, as far
as the actual fame goes, I really don't like being treated like a
star.
 &HT;    ``I like to be just a normal, everyday person,'' Twain adds. ``I
get away with a lot. I decided in the last year, especially on the
tour, because I really felt like I was living even more in a bubble
than I had ever before, I decided to start going for walks by
myself and not taking security, and I decided to start doing things
like other people do and like I used to do.
 &HT;    ``If you dress down and you just act like a normal person and
you don't act like a star,'' she says, ``then people don't notice
you as much, and I enjoy that the most.''
 &HT;    Twain admits that there are some benefits to star power _
especially when, as with all celebrities, she gets those special
requests to meet with terminally ill people, especially children.
 &HT;    ``The beauty about being able to reach people or to help people
when they're sick and dying is that you can almost only do that as
a celebrity,'' Twain says. ``It means so much to them. It's almost
like if you can use your celebrity in those ways and no other way,
than you've got a good balance.''
 &HT;    Helping that balance, she adds, is the support of her family,
even though her two brothers and two sisters remain in Canada,
thousands of miles away from her new home in Switzerland.
 &HT;    ``I depend on my family a lot,'' Twain says. ``I need to stay
grounded, in the sense that I like to remember where I'm from. I
get lonely like everybody gets lonely. I get lonely for smelling
firewood in the air, the sound of a loon and snowmobiling with my
nephews. I get lonely for those sorts of things, and I don't get
home often enough, so I bring my family to me.
 &HT;    ``They're experimenting with new things because of it,'' she
says, ``so it's kind of neat what's happening to us as a family. We
depend a lot on each other, more and more all the time.''
 &HT;    Twain plans to fly her family to Switzerland for the Christmas
holidays. In the meantime, having completed her CBS Thanksgiving
Night special, she is working on a Christmas album for 2000, as
well as a new country album which may be released as early as next
year.
 &HT;    Her schedule seems as demanding as ever, but the singer insists
that things are different now.
 &HT;    ``I started enjoying the ride, at least in the last year,'' she
says. ``The tour has been a great release for me, because I've been
able to get out on the stage and sweat it out, be with the fans,
feel that encouragement and get a lot of my confidence back. I
think I lost that for a while _ feeling the pressure of being a
celebrity, feeling like I had to live up to certain things.
 &HT;    ``It's all a part of it,'' she says. ``Realizing that you're
really not that great _ I mean, there's always someone who's better
than you in every way, and sometimes that's a hard pill to swallow
when you're a perfectionist and you're really trying to be great.
You're trying to be the best, and you have to accept that you're
just not always the best.
 &HT;    ``You have to come to terms with that and get comfortable with
yourself,'' the singer says. ``I'm finally getting there.''

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Michael Caine with Tobey Maguire in a
scene from ``The Cider House Rules.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I was never sexually abused,'' Michael Caine says, ``but I
look at adults in a different way than most people do.''
 &HT;    The 66-year-old actor is finally able to talk about his own
difficult childhood during World War II, thanks to his latest film,
``The Cider House Rules.''
 &HT;    Opening on Dec. 17, the film casts him as a saintly doctor
running an orphanage _ which sparked memories of his own childhood.
 &HT;    ``I was 6 years old when England was being bombed,'' Caine
recalls. ``The government evacuated the children and paid complete
monsters to take little ones in.
 &HT;    ``This woman took in me and a 4-year-old named Clarence. She
would go away and lock us in a cupboard under the stairs for three
or four days at a time. We never came out _ we just sat there in
the dark, which is where I picked up a lifelong battle with
claustrophobia.
 &HT;    ``I had it easier,'' he adds. ``She didn't break any of my
bones. She broke Clarence's foot with a tennis racket. She was a
real bastard _ she hit him because he went to the bathroom under
the stairs.
 &HT;    ``But we had been there for four days.''
 &HT;    These painful memories informed his role in ``The Cider House
Rules,'' as a doctor who ministers to orphans while also performing
abortions on the side, to keep unwanted kids from being brought
into the world.
 &HT;    ``I know it's just a role,'' Caine says over breakfast at New
York's Essex House hotel, ``but I wanted each child in this fantasy
orphanage to see me as someone who would love and protect them.''
 &HT;    Advance word has sparked talk of a second Best Supporting Actor
Oscar, but Caine doesn't want to hear about it.
 &HT;    ``Oh, please, don't mention it,'' he says hastily. ``Actors are
very superstitious people. We don't like to talk about things like
awards _ it's like what my mother used to call, `Put some mockers
on it.'''
 &HT;    At first, he recalls, Caine had his doubts about a movie version
of John Irving's best-selling novel.
 &HT;    ``I knew right away when I read it that I wanted to do it,'' he
says. ``But I had to question if anyone would want to see this
movie about an abortion doctor.
 &HT;    ``I also had to get over the title,'' he adds. ``When I first
read it, I thought, `What the hell does this mean? Maybe it's a
cheerleading movie _ the Cider House rules!'''
 &HT;    More serious was the challenge of an American accent _ a first
for the British actor, who spent weeks practicing with a speech
coach.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to play an American, but frankly I've
always been scared to try it,'' Caine says. ``If you screw up an
Irish or Scottish accent, there are probably 7 million people who
will know it. If I screw up an American accent, some 300 million
people will know.
 &HT;    ``Some 300 million people criticizing me at my age is too much
to take!''
 &HT;    ``Cider House'' is the latest step in a career comeback for
Caine, who by the 1980s had proven himself a world-class actor _
with Oscar nominations for ``Alfie'' (1966), ``Sleuth'' (1972) and
``Educating Rita'' (1983), plus a win as Best Supporting Actor for
Woody Allen's ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) _ who nonetheless
had a talent for bad movies.
 &HT;    He starred in Steven Seagal's directorial debut, ``On Deadly
Ground'' (1994), after all, and was unable to accept his Oscar in
person because he was on location filming ``Jaws: The Revenge''
(1987).
 &HT;    ``I didn't go in search of some of my more questionable films _
I was always on the lookout for the great roles,'' Caine says.
``When they weren't offered to me, I'd take the ones that would pay
the rent.''
 &HT;    In the early 1990s, with more than 100 films under his belt, he
seriously considered retiring.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a decent job,'' he says. ``Yes, I could have
gotten a job and made a lot more money doing crap scripts. The rule
is, if you get a crap script you get a lot more money, because they
can't find anybody else to do it.
 &HT;    ``But I got to the point where I just couldn't do those movies
anymore,'' Caine says. ``You know, sometimes I would even write a
letter that said, `Not only will I not do this movie, but if you
don't mind me saying _ and I don't want to be unkind _ but I don't
think you should do it, either.'''
 &HT;    The turning point was ``Blood and Wine'' (1997), which starred
Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    ```Finally this was a picture I wasn't ashamed of,'' Caine says.
 &HT;    He nailed the part, which in turn led to a role as a second-rate
nightclub impresario in ``Little Voice'' (1998).
 &HT;    Accepting a Golden Globe award for that role, Caine got one of
the evening's biggest rounds of applause when he said, ``My career
must be slipping _ I was actually able to be here to accept this
award.''
 &HT;    Once one of the world's handsomest leading men _ his signature
role was as a self-centered womanizer in ``Alfie'' _ Caine is now
firmly out of the leading-man bracket, which he says is just as
well.
 &HT;    ``It's tough for young actors to take risks,'' he explains. ``I
look at Brad Pitt in `The Fight Club.' I don't know if I would have
had the guts to do that role when I was younger. I see very little
risk being taken among that age group.
 &HT;    ``Of course, there are a few exceptions,'' he says, including
his ``Little Voice'' co-star. ``Ewan McGregor goes out on a limb
every single time. But he's got to stop taking his trousers off _
`OK, we've seen it, Ewan.'''
 &HT;    Acting is actually more rewarding for an older man, Caine
insists.
 &HT;    ``Acting is more fun at my age because I don't get the girl
anymore,'' he says. ``I get the part.
 &HT;    ``When you get the girl,'' he adds, ``you know what you're going
to do: You're going to make love to her, you're going to lose her
and then you're going to get her back and marry her _ that's what
you do when you're a male movie star.
 &HT;    ``But when you get to my age,'' Caine says with a smile, ``you
don't get the girl anymore _ I don't have to go to bed with anyone.
So it's great in a way, because I can get involved in other types
of dramas.''
 &HT;    Once upon a time Caine was as freewheeling a ladies' man off the
screen as on, but he's now been happily married for 26 years to
Shakira Baksa, a former Miss Guyana who appeared with him in ``The
Man Who Would Be King'' (1975).
 &HT;    ``So many people ask why the marriage has lasted,'' he says,
``and it's so simple: Many men marry without finding out what's out
there. I found out what's out there, and then I got married to the
woman I love.''
 &HT;    The actor recently had a chance to revisit his past, filming the
upcoming remake of ``Get Carter,'' his 1971 gangster hit. This time
the title role is being played by Sylvester Stallone, with Caine
playing Bromby, a sleazy nightclub owner.
 &HT;    ``Sly is playing a kinder, gentler Carter,'' Caine says, ``which
is fortunate. When I did the original movie, my Carter was vicious
_ he tries to kill Bromby by throwing him off a roof.
 &HT;    ``But, thank God, Sly forgives me _ I'm too old to do big
stunts!''

 (Includes a color slide of Ralph Fiennes with Julianne Moore in a
scene from ``The End of the Affair.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    How do you think you'd react to spending a few days making love
with actress Julianne Moore?
 &HT;    ``I got giggly,'' Ralph Fiennes confesses sheepishly. ``I got
like a silly schoolboy every time the director said, `Cut.'''
 &HT;    The two-time Academy Award-nominated actor co-stars with Moore
in ``The End of the Affair,'' a film which features some of the
most explicit love scenes of his career.
 &HT;    ``You try to click into the intensity of the moment while the
camera is rolling,'' he says, ``and then you need an outlet. For me
it was humor, and I think it was for Julianne, too. In fact, if
you'd seen us between takes, you'd have seen a lot of laughing.''
 &HT;    Based on Graham Greene's novel and adapted by writer/director
Neil Jordan, ``The End of The Affair'' is the story of an
extramarital love affair. Jordan was adamant in not shying away
from the story's sexual content.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Fiennes says, he didn't find it especially
arousing.
 &HT;    ``The actual process of putting it all on film is quite
mechanical,'' he says. ``You're saying to each other, `Well, should
we move this way, or what if I touch you there?' It's all mapped
out in a very technical way. When I look at it, I just see the
shot.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't erotic to film it,'' he adds, ``but I hope the
audience will find it erotic.''
 &HT;    Fiennes says that he wasn't initially sure he and Moore would
click, based on their first meeting.
 &HT;    ``We had a closing-night party for `Hamlet' when I did it on
Broadway,'' he recalls. ``It was on a boat that cruised around
Manhattan. I had always been very much an admirer of Julianne _ she
seemed so strong to me. So when I met her on the boat that night, I
think I held back a bit. I admit I was intimidated.
 &HT;    ``But when we started rehearsals for this film, we got along
famously.''
 &HT;    ``The End of the Affair'' is a semiautobiographical
fictionalization of a painful period in Greene's own life, based on
his own wartime affair with a married American woman, Catherine
Walston, to whom he dedicated the book.
 &HT;    ``Neil and I both agreed that my character is Graham Greene,''
Fiennes says. ``But I had to put that out of my head after I
understood that the story was rooted in his life. I realized that
what he put on paper, the characters he created, were changed.
That's what writers do _ they take a slice of life and add new
dimensions to it.''
 &HT;    Fiennes did, however, spend time trying to understand how a
writer captures the world around him.
 &HT;    ``I found myself taking a lot of notes,'' he says. ``I kept
writing my impressions of things in notebooks. I began to get a
sense of what it is to see the world around you and then mutate it.
 &HT;    ``A writer's view of the world is not like an actor's,'' he
continues. ``When you're an actor, you're showing yourself
physically. Writers are sort of physically anonymous _ the emotions
they give us are through words. Acting is instinctive, and you wear
your emotions on your sleeve.''
 &HT;    Fiennes was particularly fascinated by Greene's powerful assault
on religion. His character, Bendrix, is a virtual atheist, while
Moore's character is a committed Catholic, which ultimately drives
them apart.
 &HT;    ``I grew up a Catholic,'' the actor says, ``but I just hated
going to Mass. By the time I was 13, I just didn't believe in it
anymore. I pretty much rejected the church.
 &HT;    ``I think it distressed my mother,'' he adds, ``even though she
never really said much. Ironically, she ended up rejecting
Catholicism, too _ she stopped going to Mass and became much more
interested in a Buddhist approach to faith and belief.
 &HT;    ``But what I found fascinating about Bendrix was that his own
hatred of God became a sort of recognition of God's existence,''
Fiennes says. ``That was Greene's brilliant conceit. By hating God,
you have to acknowledge him.''
 &HT;    Fiennes doesn't mind discussing religion, but is less
comfortable discussing the approach to acting which has earned him
Oscar nominations for ``Schindler's List'' (1993) and ``The English
Patient'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``I'm just not good at going on with the current jargon about
emotional memory and stuff,'' he says. ``I never think through how
I'm going to act a part.
 &HT;    ``In a sense, every new role gives you a new process,'' Fiennes
adds. ``I suppose that, automatically, you must draw on your own
life _ but I never think about which of my own emotions are up
there on the screen.''
 &HT;    The actor is equally reluctant to discuss the details of his
life offscreen.
 &HT;    ``It's a funny thing,'' he says. ``As an actor, you want people
to see your work and you want them to like it, you want them to be
affected by it _ but you don't want your private life to affect
anyone but yourself. You don't want that to be a part of the
equation.
 &HT;    ``I understand the hunger that people have to know their
stars,'' he continues. ``If I'm in the audience and I see someone
on the stage or screen, I find myself wondering, `What's he really
like? Was that him, or was he just pretending?' I have that
curiosity in me, so I understand it.
 &HT;    ``But that doesn't make it any easier for me to give up my own
privacy.''
 &HT;    Fiennes has been remarkably successful in keeping his personal
life private, given the tabloid potential of his 1997 divorce from
actress Alex Kingston after the revelation of his ongoing
relationship with Francesca Annis, 20 years his senior, who played
his mother in his triumphant Broadway ``Hamlet'' in 1995.
 &HT;    ``There are parts of me that I want to keep to myself _ my
relationships with my friends and family, for instance,'' the actor
says. ``The cult of celebrity creates images that aren't real.
People don't see you, they see an image of what is created. The
danger in being a celebrity is trying to become that image.
 &HT;    ``I'm not complaining about becoming famous,'' he adds after a
moment. ``It gives me the luxury of choosing. But there's a trap in
that, too: You have to remember to keep choosing what you want to
do and not what somebody else wants you to do.''
 &HT;    That philosophy guided Fiennes' choice of his next film,
``Eugene Onegin.'' An adaptation of Pushkin's classic poem about a
jaded Russian aristocrat who kills his best friend, it is directed
by his sister, Martha, a successful director of television
commercials.
 &HT;    ``I have a friend who's a film critic and, before we started, I
asked him what he thought,'' Fiennes recalls. ``He said, `I don't
think you can possibly do it. It just wouldn't work.' So we went
ahead and did it anyway.''
 &HT;    Gambling on a long shot comes naturally to him, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Every time I step on a set or a stage for the first time,''
Fiennes says, ``and I'm surrounded by great actors, I think, `I'm
starting all over again from zero. I can't say these lines. I don't
understand this character.'
 &HT;    ``But you just have to go with it,'' he concludes. ``Like an
athlete _ you train and train, the day of the competition comes and
you've just got to go for it.
 &HT;    ``They say `action' or `curtain,' and you just have to commit.''

 (Includes a color slide of Tom Hanks in a scene from ``The Green
Mile.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was late in another long, grueling day on the gloomy,
depressing set of ``The Green Mile,'' but Tom Hanks was finished
for the day, free to go.
 &HT;    So co-star Michael Clarke Duncan was all the more surprised to
find Hanks, two hours later, still on the set in full prison-guard
costume, watching actor Jeffrey DeMunn filming a scene.
 &HT;    ``I went to him and said, `Man, why are you here? If I'd wrapped
two hours ago, I'd be in my truck and gone,''' Duncan recalls. ``He
said, `Jeffrey DeMunn has to give me a look over here.'''
 &HT;    Duncan shakes his head in wonderment.
 &HT;    ``They could've gotten a production assistant to sit there,'' he
says. ``Tom said, `If Jeffrey looks and sees my face, his reaction
may be that much different or better than if he looked at a
stranger. That's why I'm here _ I want this movie to be good, so I
have to make a sacrifice.'
 &HT;    ``After that I had a new outlook,'' Duncan says. ``It's not just
about your scenes, your closeups _ it's about the whole team
effort. When I saw Tom do that, I knew this guy was one of the
greatest actors I've ever worked with.''
 &HT;    When Duncan's story comes up later during an interview at the
Park Hyatt in Century City, Calif., Hanks reacts with a faint air
of embarrassment. If he taught Duncan anything from the experience,
he says, he is glad to have been able to pass along a lesson taught
him by Oscar-winner Sally Field, his co-star in ``Punchline''
(1988).
 &HT;    ``I was shooting a scene where I was on the phone and I was
supposed to be speaking to Sally, who wasn't even working that
day,'' he recalls. ``I picked up, and she was on the other end.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Sally, where are you?''' Hanks says. ``She was in a
little room on the other side of the sound stage. I said, `What are
you doing here?' She said, `We have a scene together.' I said, `But
you're on the phone!'''
 &HT;    Hanks smiles softly at the memory.
 &HT;    ``You learn that kind of thing,'' he says. ``At a time when
you're allowed to be as cranky and lazy (as you want), when the
structure is in place to let you be the biggest a--hole you
possibly want to be, it's important that you still live up to your
responsibilities as a professional.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how to explain it,'' he says, scratching at the
beard he's grown for an upcoming role. ``This is what I do, and I
take great pride in what I do. By and large, I try to live up to
the faith everybody puts in me when they pay me the money.''
 &HT;    Given that Hanks banks $20 million a movie, there's a lot more
than faith at stake. Fortunately for all concerned, however, the
actor continues to churn out hits, from ``Sleepless in Seattle''
(1993), ``Philadelphia'' (1993) and ``Forrest Gump'' (1994) through
``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998) and ``You've Got Mail'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``The Green Mile,'' based on Stephen King's novel and set to
open nationwide on Dec. 10, casts him as the head guard on death
row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935. The film pivots on his
relationship with a hulking black prisoner (Duncan) who seems to
possess a miraculous supernatural power.
 &HT;    It's a strange story, by turns uplifting and heart-rending,
which Hanks says is exactly what he likes about it.
 &HT;    ``All true myths or folk tales, in their original form,
illuminate the paradox of what it is to be alive,'' Hanks says.
``Instead of there being a happy ending where everybody who's
innocent is rewarded and everybody who's bad is punished, for every
blessing there is a curse and for every triumph there is a tragedy.
 &HT;    ``That, to me, is the great road human beings walk every day,''
the actor says. ``We're trying to solve the mysteries of why that's
the case, and there is no solution.
 &HT;    ``That's why the movie is more oddly attractive to a big
audience than you'd think,'' he adds. ``You'd never think you'd
come out feeling somehow good or cathartic or, `Oh my God, I sure
am glad I spent those three hours on death row with those guys.'
 &HT;    ``But I think you do after this movie.''
 &HT;    Several scenes were filmed at the shuttered Tennessee State
Penitentiary, and Hanks took the opportunity to tour the prison's
old death-row building. The facility's electric chair had long
since been removed, but Hanks found the death chamber evocative
nonetheless.
 &HT;    ``The real prison was empty, but there were vibes,'' he recalls.
``It's not hard to go in and think, `Oh my God, could you imagine
coming here day in and day out?'
 &HT;    ``And the real death row was a creepy, creepy place.''
 &HT;    Creepy as it was, visiting death row _ and, for that matter, the
entire experience of making ``Green Mile'' _ didn't alter Hanks'
support of capital punishment.
 &HT;    ``It didn't change it at all,'' he says. ``I don't think the
film could possibly change anybody's idea of what they think _
you're either in favor of it or you're not. You either think it's
something important or you don't. You either think it's an
abomination or it's justice.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what I think,'' he says thoughtfully. ``There
are plenty of people who should be put to death for their crimes,
and there are probably people who shouldn't be put to death for
their crimes. On a case-by-case basis, I think there's a lot of
room for gray area.
 &HT;    ``I think some people are born bad and some are made bad,'' he
concludes. ``I don't believe in absolutes. I don't necessarily
believe people are born good or that they can be made good.
 &HT;    ``There are 4 billion people in the world, and 4 billion
variations on the theme.''
 &HT;    Death row is a long way from Hanks' days on the television
sitcom ``Bosom Buddies'' and his earliest big-screen success in
such goofy-guy epics as ``Splash'' (1984) and ``Bachelor Party''
(1984). He's a major star now, with formidable clout in Hollywood
and a worldwide fan base.
 &HT;    Every once in a while, however, Hanks is sitting in the living
room of the house he shares with his wife, actress Rita Wilson, and
their children. And onto the television screen flickers, say, an
old episode of ``Bosom Buddies'' or a scene from ``Bachelor
Party.''
 &HT;    ``I think, `Where did that enthusiastic young man go?''' the
43-year-old Hanks says, laughing. ``I change the channel.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe not every time, he admits.
 &HT;    ``The types of films I made early, I was thrilled to have
done,'' he says. ``I have a tendency to denigrate all the movies
I've made. That's a bad thing _ `Oh, it's some sad little movie
about a house.'
 &HT;    ``But, in fact, what I was learning at the time was really
important,'' Hanks says. ``Part of it was that those were the
opportunities I had then. The only thing I was somewhat cognizant
of was that I was trying to expand my horizons as an artist within
the confines of the options afforded me.
 &HT;    ``I think I was able to do that,'' he concludes, ``but the
nature of what fascinated me, the themes I thought I could bring
something to when I was 27 or 32, were very different from what
they are now.
 &HT;    ``But I look at the older movies and think, `Hmm, not a bad
job.'''

SHANIA TWAIN, GETTING COMFORTABLE AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Shania Twain.) 
 By MARGY HOLLAND  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's hot, there's really hot and then there's Shania Twain.
 &HT;    The Canadian-born singer is closing out the millennium as one of
the most successful singers in the world. Her record-setting sales
and numerous accolades and industry awards have put her in a league
of her own: Sales of her most recent album, ``Come On Over''
(Universal-Polygram, 1997) have reached a staggering 13 million,
leaving her second only to pop/rock singer Alanis Morissette in
album sales by a female.
 &HT;    More recently, Twain received the prestigious Entertainer of the
Year award from the Country Music Association, the first time she's
received that honor.
 &HT;    So what does a 34-year-old who's risen from grinding poverty to
the pinnacle of success do when she's named Entertainer of the
Year?
 &HT;    Twain celebrated after the show by routing her limousine driver
through the Krispy Kreme drive-through window for ``one of those
great donuts they brought to us every day when we were recording
`Come On Over.'''
 &HT;    If that sounds like someone not exactly caught up in the awards
game, it should. Twain's CMA award now sits in her stable,
alongside her Grammies, gold and platinum records and untold
numbers of other honors.
 &HT;    ``I'm as excited as anyone when I get up there and win,'' she
says, ``but, to be honest with you, I don't sit there waiting. I
learned a long time ago that you just end up being very
disappointed. I think it can make you very bitter if you put too
much weight on that.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be bitter,'' the singer says. ``I don't even
want to compete on that level, so I take it very lightly,
actually.''
 &HT;    Twain wrapped up her first world tour this past summer,
performing before sold-out crowdsof as many as 30,000 _ which, she
says, means a lot more than any award.
 &HT;    ``When I went out there, I didn't feel like I needed to prove
anything to anyone,'' Twain says. ``I understood that most people
didn't know my background. They had never really seen much of me
live.
 &HT;    ``Before I got my record deal, my livelihood was singing live,''
she adds. ``That's what I did. I am no different on my stage than I
was in any club. Throughout my childhood and all of my teens, it
was just me and a bar.
 &HT;    ``It was mostly rock music,'' Twain recalls, ``which requires a
lot of energy. Rock is the hardest thing to sing night after night,
six nights a week, with a matinee, and you're traveling in a very
dumpy truck and terrible hotels and it's awful.''
 &HT;    She shrugs, then smiles.
 &HT;    ``I've done all that,'' she says, ``so going into this situation
on the road was like a luxury, it was like floating on a cloud.
I've got this amazing bus, I've got my dog with me, I've got my
horse, I've got all sorts of wonderful people around me that I've
hand-chosen, so I know I like them. I'm making a great living, and
I don't even sing every night of the week _ I'm singing sometimes
two or three shows in a row at the most.
 &HT;    ``What an easy gig!
 &HT;    ``It was like nothing compared to what I was used to,'' she says
cheerfully, ``so if you come from that background and it was your
living, this kind of touring is pretty darn easy and fun.''
 &HT;    While Twain's life has certainly changed since her childhood in
Timmins, Ont., she says that she resists the star treatment and
does her best to live a normal life.
 &HT;    ``Everyone loves attention,'' she says. ``We love the attention
when it's complimentary and we hate the attention when it sucks, so
we're all the same. I'm no different than anyone else _ but, as far
as the actual fame goes, I really don't like being treated like a
star.
 &HT;    ``I like to be just a normal, everyday person,'' Twain adds. ``I
get away with a lot. I decided in the last year, especially on the
tour, because I really felt like I was living even more in a bubble
than I had ever before, I decided to start going for walks by
myself and not taking security, and I decided to start doing things
like other people do and like I used to do.
 &HT;    ``If you dress down and you just act like a normal person and
you don't act like a star,'' she says, ``then people don't notice
you as much, and I enjoy that the most.''
 &HT;    Twain admits that there are some benefits to star power _
especially when, as with all celebrities, she gets those special
requests to meet with terminally ill people, especially children.
 &HT;    ``The beauty about being able to reach people or to help people
when they're sick and dying is that you can almost only do that as
a celebrity,'' Twain says. ``It means so much to them. It's almost
like if you can use your celebrity in those ways and no other way,
than you've got a good balance.''
 &HT;    Helping that balance, she adds, is the support of her family,
even though her two brothers and two sisters remain in Canada,
thousands of miles away from her new home in Switzerland.
 &HT;    ``I depend on my family a lot,'' Twain says. ``I need to stay
grounded, in the sense that I like to remember where I'm from. I
get lonely like everybody gets lonely. I get lonely for smelling
firewood in the air, the sound of a loon and snowmobiling with my
nephews. I get lonely for those sorts of things, and I don't get
home often enough, so I bring my family to me.
 &HT;    ``They're experimenting with new things because of it,'' she
says, ``so it's kind of neat what's happening to us as a family. We
depend a lot on each other, more and more all the time.''
 &HT;    Twain plans to fly her family to Switzerland for the Christmas
holidays. In the meantime, having completed her CBS Thanksgiving
Night special, she is working on a Christmas album for 2000, as
well as a new country album which may be released as early as next
year.
 &HT;    Her schedule seems as demanding as ever, but the singer insists
that things are different now.
 &HT;    ``I started enjoying the ride, at least in the last year,'' she
says. ``The tour has been a great release for me, because I've been
able to get out on the stage and sweat it out, be with the fans,
feel that encouragement and get a lot of my confidence back. I
think I lost that for a while _ feeling the pressure of being a
celebrity, feeling like I had to live up to certain things.
 &HT;    ``It's all a part of it,'' she says. ``Realizing that you're
really not that great _ I mean, there's always someone who's better
than you in every way, and sometimes that's a hard pill to swallow
when you're a perfectionist and you're really trying to be great.
You're trying to be the best, and you have to accept that you're
just not always the best.
 &HT;    ``You have to come to terms with that and get comfortable with
yourself,'' the singer says. ``I'm finally getting there.''

 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I was never sexually abused,'' Michael Caine says, ``but I
look at adults in a different way than most people do.''
 &HT;    The 66-year-old actor is finally able to talk about his own
difficult childhood during World War II, thanks to his latest film,
``The Cider House Rules.''
 &HT;    Opening on Dec. 17, the film casts him as a saintly doctor
running an orphanage _ which sparked memories of his own childhood.
 &HT;    ``I was 6 years old when England was being bombed,'' Caine
recalls. ``The government evacuated the children and paid complete
monsters to take little ones in.
 &HT;    ``This woman took in me and a 4-year-old named Clarence. She
would go away and lock us in a cupboard under the stairs for three
or four days at a time. We never came out _ we just sat there in
the dark, which is where I picked up a lifelong battle with
claustrophobia.
 &HT;    ``I had it easier,'' he adds. ``She didn't break any of my
bones. She broke Clarence's foot with a tennis racket. She was a
real bastard _ she hit him because he went to the bathroom under
the stairs.
 &HT;    ``But we had been there for four days.''
 &HT;    These painful memories informed his role in ``The Cider House
Rules,'' as a doctor who ministers to orphans while also performing
abortions on the side, to keep unwanted kids from being brought
into the world.
 &HT;    ``I know it's just a role,'' Caine says over breakfast at New
York's Essex House hotel, ``but I wanted each child in this fantasy
orphanage to see me as someone who would love and protect them.''
 &HT;    Advance word has sparked talk of a second Best Supporting Actor
Oscar, but Caine doesn't want to hear about it.
 &HT;    ``Oh, please, don't mention it,'' he says hastily. ``Actors are
very superstitious people. We don't like to talk about things like
awards _ it's like what my mother used to call, `Put some mockers
on it.'''
 &HT;    At first, he recalls, Caine had his doubts about a movie version
of John Irving's best-selling novel.
 &HT;    ``I knew right away when I read it that I wanted to do it,'' he
says. ``But I had to question if anyone would want to see this
movie about an abortion doctor.
 &HT;    ``I also had to get over the title,'' he adds. ``When I first
read it, I thought, `What the hell does this mean? Maybe it's a
cheerleading movie _ the Cider House rules!'''
 &HT;    More serious was the challenge of an American accent _ a first
for the British actor, who spent weeks practicing with a speech
coach.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to play an American, but frankly I've
always been scared to try it,'' Caine says. ``If you screw up an
Irish or Scottish accent, there are probably 7 million people who
will know it. If I screw up an American accent, some 300 million
people will know.
 &HT;    ``Some 300 million people criticizing me at my age is too much
to take!''
 &HT;    ``Cider House'' is the latest step in a career comeback for
Caine, who by the 1980s had proven himself a world-class actor _
with Oscar nominations for ``Alfie'' (1966), ``Sleuth'' (1972) and
``Educating Rita'' (1983), plus a win as Best Supporting Actor for
Woody Allen's ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) _ who nonetheless
had a talent for bad movies.
 &HT;    He starred in Steven Seagal's directorial debut, ``On Deadly
Ground'' (1994), after all, and was unable to accept his Oscar in
person because he was on location filming ``Jaws: The Revenge''
(1987).
 &HT;    ``I didn't go in search of some of my more questionable films _
I was always on the lookout for the great roles,'' Caine says.
``When they weren't offered to me, I'd take the ones that would pay
the rent.''
 &HT;    In the early 1990s, with more than 100 films under his belt, he
seriously considered retiring.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a decent job,'' he says. ``Yes, I could have
gotten a job and made a lot more money doing crap scripts. The rule
is, if you get a crap script you get a lot more money, because they
can't find anybody else to do it.
 &HT;    ``But I got to the point where I just couldn't do those movies
anymore,'' Caine says. ``You know, sometimes I would even write a
letter that said, `Not only will I not do this movie, but if you
don't mind me saying _ and I don't want to be unkind _ but I don't
think you should do it, either.'''
 &HT;    The turning point was ``Blood and Wine'' (1997), which starred
Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    ```Finally this was a picture I wasn't ashamed of,'' Caine says.
 &HT;    He nailed the part, which in turn led to a role as a second-rate
nightclub impresario in ``Little Voice'' (1998).
 &HT;    Accepting a Golden Globe award for that role, Caine got one of
the evening's biggest rounds of applause when he said, ``My career
must be slipping _ I was actually able to be here to accept this
award.''
 &HT;    Once one of the world's handsomest leading men _ his signature
role was as a self-centered womanizer in ``Alfie'' _ Caine is now
firmly out of the leading-man bracket, which he says is just as
well.
 &HT;    ``It's tough for young actors to take risks,'' he explains. ``I
look at Brad Pitt in `The Fight Club.' I don't know if I would have
had the guts to do that role when I was younger. I see very little
risk being taken among that age group.
 &HT;    ``Of course, there are a few exceptions,'' he says, including
his ``Little Voice'' co-star. ``Ewan McGregor goes out on a limb
every single time. But he's got to stop taking his trousers off _
`OK, we've seen it, Ewan.'''
 &HT;    Acting is actually more rewarding for an older man, Caine
insists.
 &HT;    ``Acting is more fun at my age because I don't get the girl
anymore,'' he says. ``I get the part.
 &HT;    ``When you get the girl,'' he adds, ``you know what you're going
to do: You're going to make love to her, you're going to lose her
and then you're going to get her back and marry her _ that's what
you do when you're a male movie star.
 &HT;    ``But when you get to my age,'' Caine says with a smile, ``you
don't get the girl anymore _ I don't have to go to bed with anyone.
So it's great in a way, because I can get involved in other types
of dramas.''
 &HT;    Once upon a time Caine was as freewheeling a ladies' man off the
screen as on, but he's now been happily married for 26 years to
Shakira Baksa, a former Miss Guyana who appeared with him in ``The
Man Who Would Be King'' (1975).
 &HT;    ``So many people ask why the marriage has lasted,'' he says,
``and it's so simple: Many men marry without finding out what's out
there. I found out what's out there, and then I got married to the
woman I love.''
 &HT;    The actor recently had a chance to revisit his past, filming the
upcoming remake of ``Get Carter,'' his 1971 gangster hit. This time
the title role is being played by Sylvester Stallone, with Caine
playing Bromby, a sleazy nightclub owner.
 &HT;    ``Sly is playing a kinder, gentler Carter,'' Caine says, ``which
is fortunate. When I did the original movie, my Carter was vicious
_ he tries to kill Bromby by throwing him off a roof.
 &HT;    ``But, thank God, Sly forgives me _ I'm too old to do big
stunts!''

 (Includes a color slide of Ralph Fiennes with Julianne Moore in a
scene from ``The End of the Affair.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    How do you think you'd react to spending a few days making love
with actress Julianne Moore?
 &HT;    ``I got giggly,'' Ralph Fiennes confesses sheepishly. ``I got
like a silly schoolboy every time the director said, `Cut.'''
 &HT;    The two-time Academy Award-nominated actor co-stars with Moore
in ``The End of the Affair,'' a film which features some of the
most explicit love scenes of his career.
 &HT;    ``You try to click into the intensity of the moment while the
camera is rolling,'' he says, ``and then you need an outlet. For me
it was humor, and I think it was for Julianne, too. In fact, if
you'd seen us between takes, you'd have seen a lot of laughing.''
 &HT;    Based on Graham Greene's novel and adapted by writer/director
Neil Jordan, ``The End of The Affair'' is the story of an
extramarital love affair. Jordan was adamant in not shying away
from the story's sexual content.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Fiennes says, he didn't find it especially
arousing.
 &HT;    ``The actual process of putting it all on film is quite
mechanical,'' he says. ``You're saying to each other, `Well, should
we move this way, or what if I touch you there?' It's all mapped
out in a very technical way. When I look at it, I just see the
shot.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't erotic to film it,'' he adds, ``but I hope the
audience will find it erotic.''
 &HT;    Fiennes says that he wasn't initially sure he and Moore would
click, based on their first meeting.
 &HT;    ``We had a closing-night party for `Hamlet' when I did it on
Broadway,'' he recalls. ``It was on a boat that cruised around
Manhattan. I had always been very much an admirer of Julianne _ she
seemed so strong to me. So when I met her on the boat that night, I
think I held back a bit. I admit I was intimidated.
 &HT;    ``But when we started rehearsals for this film, we got along
famously.''
 &HT;    ``The End of the Affair'' is a semiautobiographical
fictionalization of a painful period in Greene's own life, based on
his own wartime affair with a married American woman, Catherine
Walston, to whom he dedicated the book.
 &HT;    ``Neil and I both agreed that my character is Graham Greene,''
Fiennes says. ``But I had to put that out of my head after I
understood that the story was rooted in his life. I realized that
what he put on paper, the characters he created, were changed.
That's what writers do _ they take a slice of life and add new
dimensions to it.''
 &HT;    Fiennes did, however, spend time trying to understand how a
writer captures the world around him.
 &HT;    ``I found myself taking a lot of notes,'' he says. ``I kept
writing my impressions of things in notebooks. I began to get a
sense of what it is to see the world around you and then mutate it.
 &HT;    ``A writer's view of the world is not like an actor's,'' he
continues. ``When you're an actor, you're showing yourself
physically. Writers are sort of physically anonymous _ the emotions
they give us are through words. Acting is instinctive, and you wear
your emotions on your sleeve.''
 &HT;    Fiennes was particularly fascinated by Greene's powerful assault
on religion. His character, Bendrix, is a virtual atheist, while
Moore's character is a committed Catholic, which ultimately drives
them apart.
 &HT;    ``I grew up a Catholic,'' the actor says, ``but I just hated
going to Mass. By the time I was 13, I just didn't believe in it
anymore. I pretty much rejected the church.
 &HT;    ``I think it distressed my mother,'' he adds, ``even though she
never really said much. Ironically, she ended up rejecting
Catholicism, too _ she stopped going to Mass and became much more
interested in a Buddhist approach to faith and belief.
 &HT;    ``But what I found fascinating about Bendrix was that his own
hatred of God became a sort of recognition of God's existence,''
Fiennes says. ``That was Greene's brilliant conceit. By hating God,
you have to acknowledge him.''
 &HT;    Fiennes doesn't mind discussing religion, but is less
comfortable discussing the approach to acting which has earned him
Oscar nominations for ``Schindler's List'' (1993) and ``The English
Patient'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``I'm just not good at going on with the current jargon about
emotional memory and stuff,'' he says. ``I never think through how
I'm going to act a part.
 &HT;    ``In a sense, every new role gives you a new process,'' Fiennes
adds. ``I suppose that, automatically, you must draw on your own
life _ but I never think about which of my own emotions are up
there on the screen.''
 &HT;    The actor is equally reluctant to discuss the details of his
life offscreen.
 &HT;    ``It's a funny thing,'' he says. ``As an actor, you want people
to see your work and you want them to like it, you want them to be
affected by it _ but you don't want your private life to affect
anyone but yourself. You don't want that to be a part of the
equation.
 &HT;    ``I understand the hunger that people have to know their
stars,'' he continues. ``If I'm in the audience and I see someone
on the stage or screen, I find myself wondering, `What's he really
like? Was that him, or was he just pretending?' I have that
curiosity in me, so I understand it.
 &HT;    ``But that doesn't make it any easier for me to give up my own
privacy.''
 &HT;    Fiennes has been remarkably successful in keeping his personal
life private, given the tabloid potential of his 1997 divorce from
actress Alex Kingston after the revelation of his ongoing
relationship with Francesca Annis, 20 years his senior, who played
his mother in his triumphant Broadway ``Hamlet'' in 1995.
 &HT;    ``There are parts of me that I want to keep to myself _ my
relationships with my friends and family, for instance,'' the actor
says. ``The cult of celebrity creates images that aren't real.
People don't see you, they see an image of what is created. The
danger in being a celebrity is trying to become that image.
 &HT;    ``I'm not complaining about becoming famous,'' he adds after a
moment. ``It gives me the luxury of choosing. But there's a trap in
that, too: You have to remember to keep choosing what you want to
do and not what somebody else wants you to do.''
 &HT;    That philosophy guided Fiennes' choice of his next film,
``Eugene Onegin.'' An adaptation of Pushkin's classic poem about a
jaded Russian aristocrat who kills his best friend, it is directed
by his sister, Martha, a successful director of television
commercials.
 &HT;    ``I have a friend who's a film critic and, before we started, I
asked him what he thought,'' Fiennes recalls. ``He said, `I don't
think you can possibly do it. It just wouldn't work.' So we went
ahead and did it anyway.''
 &HT;    Gambling on a long shot comes naturally to him, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Every time I step on a set or a stage for the first time,''
Fiennes says, ``and I'm surrounded by great actors, I think, `I'm
starting all over again from zero. I can't say these lines. I don't
understand this character.'
 &HT;    ``But you just have to go with it,'' he concludes. ``Like an
athlete _ you train and train, the day of the competition comes and
you've just got to go for it.
 &HT;    ``They say `action' or `curtain,' and you just have to commit.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAROLINA-FLOODS (Undated) _ Scientists fear that the
post-hurricane flood of eastern North Carolina has created an
ecological time bomb, and they fear for the biologically rich
waters that separate the famous Outer Banks from the Carolina
mainland. This complex of sounds, bays and inlets comprises the
second largest estuary in the country, after Chesapeake Bay, and is
one of the nation's most important incubators of marine life.
Rarely have ecologists confronted such a striking example of what
can happen when a first-order natural disturbance is combined with
a first-order disturbance of the natural world by humans. By
William K. Stevens. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COSMOLOGY-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Continued evidence over the
last year that the expansion of the universe is accelerating has
provided fresh new evidence of the distressing finding that
something in the wastelands of space could be pushing against
gravity. So scientists are reluctantly accepting the notion that
something in the most fundamental theories of physics is terribly
wrong. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-POLIO (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: The provocative
theory that AIDS is a manufactured disaster arising from early
testing of the polio vaccine in Africa seemed farfetched when it
first came to public attention, in an article in Rolling Stone in
1992. Most scientists dismissed it after a scientific committee
reviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low. But that
panel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was
later shown to be in error. And now a remarkable new book, ``The
River'' by Edward Hooper, offers tantalizing clues to revive and
expand the polio vaccine theory. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1900
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-POLE (Undated) _ Less than a century after explorers
made their first heroic assault on the poles of Earth, an American
spacecraft is racing toward Mars and the first landing in the polar
region of another planet. The robotic Mars Polar Lander is being
aimed for a landing on Friday on the vast terraces of ice and dust
a few hundred miles from the planet's south pole. Spring is turning
to summer there, the season of constant sunlight, which the
spacecraft will draw on for energy to power its computer and
transmitter and array of cameras, sensors, digging arm and ovens
for heating and analyzing soil samples. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLOTKIN-RAINFOREST (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Mark
J. Plotkin, who staked his reputation on finding new medicines in
the rain forest. But he earliest efforts at finding great medicines
failed, forcing him and others to recognize that even in the rain
forests medical miracles are rare. By Jon Christensen. (1830 words)
</P>
<P>

   SCI-YEAST-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ Essay: New discoveries with
individual yeast cells raise intriguing questions about future
evolutionary possibilities. By Malcolm Browne. (1140 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
pollution automobiles generate by stirring up dust, a snake with
unusual eating habits and the Eberly telescope. By Henry Fountain.
(650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEVERS (Undated) _ Fevers can be mysterious, which is when
the challenges multiply. The hospital is always filled with
patients with fevers no one understands. In some, it is a sign of
an underlying disease that is not yet known. In other people, like
AIDS or cancer patients with suppressed immune systems, the fever
may have any number of causes, including their underlying disease
or, most dangerously, an infection that could rapidly kill if left
untreated. Whatever the case may be, mysterious fevers are common,
and among the most vexing of medical problems. By Sandeep Jauhar.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-SPEECH (Undated) _ Parents now are being told to
seek speech therapy earlier for children who are exhibiting
problems, a sharp change from previous years when adults were
assured that often, very bright children did not learn to speak
until they were much older. The new advice is based, in part, on
studies showing that children with speech impairments are more
likely to have reading and social problems later on. By Randi
Hutter Epstein. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Research showing much puberty for
girls arriving much earlier than previous studies had shown could
force textbooks and medical schools to revise the age at which
puberty is considered premature. Current medical textbooks state
that just 1 percent of girls younger than 8 show signs of puberty.
In a new review of existing data, in the Oct. 4 issue of the
journal Pediatrics, researchers concluded that ``the onset of
breast development between 7 and 8 years of age in white girls and
between 6 and 8 years in African-American girls may be part of the
normal broad variation in the timing of puberty and not, in most
cases, a pathological state.'' By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OLDER-ATHLETES (Undated) _ A new generation of older
athletes are healthier than their predecessors, living longer and
pointedly aware of the importance of getting and staying in shape.
They are forming pickup teams, creating senior divisions in sports
leagues and competing in large-scale events in gyms and playing
fields across the country. By Linda Villarosa. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cradling the phone between the neck and the should can lead to
brain damage, at least temporarily. (115 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Juvenile arthritis often relegates its victims to the
sidelines. But a University of Buffalo study of weight training
found that a carefully designed exercise program significantly
reduced pain and increasing ability to function. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A study comparing identical and fraternal Australian twins
found evidence that stuttering may have a genetic basis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celebrex and Vioxx are two of the hottest drugs on the market,
in large part because of their potential for reducing pain and
inflammation without the risk of gastric harm associated with
medicines like ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin. But a pair of new
studies has led the Journal of the American Medical Association to
conclude that while those risks are indeed lowered, they are not
lowered enough to justify the extra cost of prescribing them for
most people. (360 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ People who buy handguns are more likely to kill themselves
than people who do not, even up to six years after the purchase, a
new study concludes. (250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science question answered: How many living
species are there? What is the breakdown of plants, vertebrates,
etc.? By C. Claiborne Ray.

ANOTHER STEP IN THE MODERATE/CONSERVATIVE TUG-OF-WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell is getting even closer to the national
Southern Baptist Convention. Recently, Liberty University, a
9,400-student liberal arts school in Lynchburg, Va., that Falwell
founded, became officially affiliated with the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As the Southern Baptist Convention has grown more conservative,
Falwell, an independent Baptist who likes to be called a
``fundamentalist,'' has grown ever closer to the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell and other members of his Thomas Road Baptist Church in
Lynchburg have been voting delegates at the last two national
Southern Baptist Conventions. Some have even talked of Falwell
ending up as president of the 15.7-million member denomination, the
nation's second-largest after Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be too surprising either. But Falwell, who
founded the now-defunct Moral Majority and who still is a
sought-after national spokesman for religious conservatives, says
he has enough to do right now.
</P>
<P>
   Linking of Falwell's university to Southern Baptists came last
week when the executive board of the Southern Baptist Conservatives
of Virginia voted to designate Liberty as a Southern Baptist
school. The Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia is an
alternative state organization that was created because the main
state Baptist group is controlled by moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many moderate Southern Baptists won't be overjoyed
that Falwell's university now is tied to the Southern Baptist
Convention, the denomination's president, the Rev. Paige Patterson,
lauded the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the great Liberty University to be part of our Southern
Baptist Zion ... is an answer to prayer for us all,'' said
Patterson, a longtime friend of Falwell and president of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Freddie Gage, an evangelist based in the Fort Worth
suburb of Euless, Texas, who is on the board of Liberty University,
said many of his moderate Baptist friends might like Falwell if
they knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Falwell is the most misunderstood man in America,'' Gage
said. ``If you ever sat down and talked with him, you couldn't help
but like the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's embrace of the Southern Baptist Convention is the
latest episode in a 20-year power battle between conservative and
moderate Baptists. The outcome isn't settled. Conservatives clearly
dominate the national organization. But now the battle has switched
to the states.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, particularly, moderates are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist General Convention of Texas, which has 2.7 million
members _ more than some national denominations _ has practically
declared its independence from the conservative national
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates' domination of the Texas convention became even
clearer earlier this month when Texas Baptists meeting in El Paso
rejected the controversial statement championed by conservatives
declaring that wives should graciously submit to the leadership of
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   However, Baptist conservatives in Texas are doing some rebelling
of their own. They've formed an alternative state convention called
Southern Baptists of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That organization scored a coup recently when the 12,000-member
First Baptist Church of Dallas, known as a flagship church of
Baptist conservatives, officially aligned itself with the
conservative state convention. The pastor emeritus of First
Baptist, the Rev. W.A. Criswell, is considered the spiritual leader
of the Baptist conservative revolution of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas conservative group is still small _ about 260 churches
are aligned with it out of some 6,000 Baptist congregations in the
state. But many predict other congregations will follow the lead of
First Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of moderate-conservative struggle is occurring in
Virginia. Moderates are in control in Virginia, too. But the
aforementioned alternative conservative state convention is
offering opposition. And Falwell is a powerful ally.
</P>
<P>
   Where all this will end is anybody's guess. Most Baptists don't
like these political struggles. But they are sure to continue into
the next millennium. So we will keep watching.

COSBY'S NEW ANIMATED SERIES ON NiCKELODEON GROWS ON YOU 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the debut episode of ``Little Bill,'' Nickelodeon's fresh new
animated series _ inspired by a popular line of children's books
created by that sly preschool czar Bill Cosby _ viewers meet a
5-year-old charmer with an insatiable curiosity and the cutest
little peanut-shaped, bald head.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted upfront that nothing particularly riveting,
as least by today's TV standards for crime and punishment, actually
happens to Little Bill outside the normal tussles of
pre-adolescence. Little Bill, whose large ``B'' on his shirts makes
him look like a miniature superhero, can be rambunctious and
hardheaded, sweet and tender, talkative and alarmingly meek _ like,
um, most of us, adult and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   On a conventional network, however, it's a certainty that Little
Bill would BE conventional, the youngest sibling of a suburban
family popping in and out of twin SUVs. And everyone would be
white, except for one kid of color written in to make its defensive
case for racial diversity. Not here, though.
</P>
<P>
   Not on Nickelodeon, which has already amassed a nice little
track record for going against the grain in children's programming
_ how else could you explain ``Gullah Gullah Island,'' the
channel's live-action show inspired by the culture of a
250-year-old slave dialect?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there IS a token character on ``Little
Bill.'' He's an Anglo kid with what looks like orange hair.
Practically everyone else in ``Little Bill'' is African-American,
and there are a number of Latino and Asian characters moving rather
seamlessly in and out of Bill's middle-class, multigenerational,
citified life.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who might find the cultural shift somewhat
off-putting _ hey, we all have our issues _ remember this is The
Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Any follower of Cosby's work, particularly his breakthrough
animated series ``Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids,'' the NBC sitcom
``The Cosby Show,'' and even his current ``Cosby'' on CBS,
understand and accept how race in Cosbyworld can be brought up and
disposed of without ever mentioning it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a factual observation, not a criticism. Watching
``Little Bill,'' which premiered Sunday night, you recognize that
the basic ingredients of Cosby's universal dilemmas remain the
same. That while Cosby's modus operandi is how normality comes with
a black face, the aim here is making children feel reassured, which
any child psychologist will tell you is a recognized concept of
early childhood learning.
</P>
<P>
   What I like most about Cosby's book series and the slightly
altered TV program (Little Bill is actually younger in the TV
version) is that adults won't find it so boring they'd fall asleep,
leaving a child unchecked with the power of a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``Little Bill'' may follow the adventures of its
young protagonist, but it's by and large a show about family that
tightly reflects Cosby's wisdom and humor, a mild-mannered comedy
that never actually cracks you up but is a litany of amusing,
gentle anecdotes making you feel warm inside.
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Xavier Pritchett, Little Bill lives in a small
residential neighborhood in a big city with his father, Big Bill
(Gregory Hines), a natural with children who can often be found
spending quality time with his jazz collection, and his mother,
Brenda (Phylicia Rashad), who, like Rashad's characters in
Cosbyworld, is warm and sensible but firm. An 8-year-old brother
and 10-year-old sister round out the immediate clan.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Dee voices Little Bill's spirited great-grandmother, whom
they affectionately refer to as Alice the Great. Cosby also called
on his ``Cosby'' co-star Madeline Kahn to voice a quirky neighbor,
Mrs. Shapiro. Little Bill's running buddies include Dorado, Andrew
and Kiku, an Asian girl who likes to tussle with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Bill'' is unique in a couple ways. Two stand-alone
stories make up each half-hour episode, and the series is digital
desktop animation. You know what I mean if you've seen
Nickelodeon's ``Blue's Clues,'' which features quirky cutout
characters also animated by computers to play with a live-action
person. On ``Little Bill,'' everything is computer-generated,
making simple shapes and primary colors come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Opening each half-hour episode with the signature greeting
``Hello, friend,'' (This was a saying of Cosby's son, Ennis, who
was killed while changing a tire on a deserted Los Angeles-area
road) ``Little Bill'' proceeds to tell simple tales teaching the
importance of friendship and family while showing children how to
solve problems creatively and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Cosby Show,'' the show's power lies within its subtle
language and situations. In one episode, titled ``Treasure Hunt,''
Little Bill wanders around the house on a rainy day, trying to find
his ``thing,'' (for Dad it's jazz; for Mom, it's photography; for
his big brother, it's chess. Find your passion, is what it
preaches).
</P>
<P>
   Another episode, about Little Bill and his buddies' infatuation
with a popular TV show, is quite the sly proponent of imagination
over media technology. And just in time, too, considering the
recent press reports that watching too much TV and being zoned out
on Playstation make kids fat and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every network turned away from ``Little Bill,'' failing
to see its commercial value. Nickelodeon appears to be a better
fit. Where else could this program get a prime-time spot, and for
26 episodes?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nickelodeon understands the world of those under the
age of 5, people who find repetition comforting.
</P>
<P>
   With its assortment of Web sites, merchandising and book series
based on its TV shows, Nickelodeon shows that it has an uncanny way
of seeing commercial treasure where others might see uncommercial
trash. Hey, more power to you, Nick.

</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization, which is conducting meetings in
Seattle this week, has become to leftist mythology what the United
Nations is to the militia movement: the center of a global
conspiracy against all that is good and decent. According to urban
legend, the ``ultra-secretive'' WTO has become a sort of
super-governmental body that forces nations to bow to the wishes of
multinational corporations. It destroys local cultures, it despoils
the environment and it rides roughshod over democracy, forcing
governments to remove laws that conflict with its sinister
purposes.

   While the Republican presidential candidates aim attack ads at

   4. THE TENUOUS REALITY OF `MILLIONAIRE' AND `GREED,' by James
Surowiecki
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing that's changed about the major TV
networks in the last few years, aside from their steadily shrinking
share of the audience, is that more and more of their programming
is ``reality-based.'' Perhaps as a result of its success, though,
``reality-based programming'' is now being used as a label to cover
shows that are, well, not real, like the huge hit game show ``Who
Wants To Be a Millionaire'' and its recent successful competitor
``Greed.''

</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council recently began running an ad
that accused Steve Forbes of ``tearing down his opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes fired back at the RLC with his own ad: ``George W. Bush
says he wants a positive campaign. Then why are Bush's liberal
supporters running this negative ad attacking Steve Forbes?'' A
Forbes press release added, ``Forbes Calls on Bush To Cease
'Politics of Personal Destruction' Against Senator John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, Bill Bradley and Al Gore
denounced each other's ``personal attacks'' and ``scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is accusing everyone else of negative campaigning, but
nobody's answering the question that ought to come first: What's
wrong with negative campaigning? Politicians and journalists
pretend to explain this through a series of platitudes, none of
which are convincing:
</P>
<P>
   --Be nice. The RLC says it's trying to keep the GOP ``civil'' by
pressuring Forbes to maintain a high ``tenor.'' Its ad says Forbes
needs to be taught ``If he doesn't have anything nice to say, don't
say anything at all.'' Bradley gets a similar lecture from The
Washington Post, which accuses him of forsaking his ``pledge of
chivalry'' by criticizing Gore's modest proposals for health care
and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But what's so great about being nice or chivalrous? Bradley
thinks Gore is running on a timid platform designed to avoid
political heat rather than to solve problems. Forbes thinks the
same of Bush. If they're right, the worst thing they can do for the
country is to refrain from pointing out these failings. McCain is
accused of getting ``angry.'' Bradley is much nicer.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore claimed that Bradley's health-care plan would bust the
budget, Bradley's spokeswoman answered, ``Bill Bradley reserves his
anger for the Americans without health insurance.'' Bradley might
have served those Americans better by directing his anger at Gore's
misrepresentations. But that would have been impolite.
</P>
<P>
   --Stay clean. The Post asks whether Bradley's criticisms of
Gore's policies belie Bradley's professed ``rectitude,'' his
``desire to be super-clean,`` and ``his image as an above-the-fray
politician.'' But where's the virtue in such aloofness? Why should
Bush get credit for keeping his hands clean and preserving his
above-the-fray image if, as Forbes alleges, he has achieved this by
letting the RLC do his dirty work? And shouldn't Bradley get
credit, by comparison, for striding into the fray and leveling his
charges squarely at Gore?
</P>
<P>
   --Be positive. Bradley accuses Gore of offering ``attacks''
instead of a ``positive vision,'' based on the calculation that
it's ``easier to campaign against your opponent than for
yourself.'' Two weeks ago, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich
illustrated Bradley's more ``positive'' style.
</P>
<P>
   While endorsing Bradley, Reich insisted, ``I won't say anything
negative about the vice president.'' What nonsense. Anyone who
endorses Bradley is saying something negative about Gore. Since
elections are comparative, the difference between campaigning
``against your opponent'' and campaigning ``for yourself'' is
semantic. When Bradley says he's the candidate of big ideas and
poll-free principles, he's being just as negative as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't hurt others. Journalists and wounded politicians love to
equate criticism with assault. Bradley says Gore's strategy is
``attack, attack, attack, attack.'' Forbes and the RLC decry each
other's ``attack ads.'' The New York Times says Forbes ``became
known as a slash-and-burn politician for his commercials that
lacerated Bob Dole'' in 1996. Bush, mimicking Bill Clinton, calls
questions about whether he used cocaine ``the politics of personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times accuses Bush's rivals of ``Bush bashing''
at last week's GOP debate in Arizona. A McCain adviser fears Bush
will ``get out the blowtorch and go after McCain.'' All this sounds
awful, until you remember that nobody has been attacked, bashed,
slashed, burned, blowtorched, lacerated, or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes leveled charges about Dole's record that could be--and
were--rebutted. The ``bashing'' Bush endured in the Arizona debate
consisted largely of the observation that he had failed to show up.
Clinton turned out to be guilty of the central allegation in the
Lewinsky scandal, and Bush still hasn't answered the cocaine
questions. The truth often hurts. It ought to be told anyway.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't get personal. Bradley has alluded several times to the
1996 Clinton-Gore fund-raising scandal. Last Monday, he cited
published reports that ``Clinton administration Cabinet officers
are being asked to arrange their travel schedules and public
announcements so the vice president can finance his political
campaign with taxpayer dollars when his funds run out.'' Rather
than rebut Bradley's allegation, Gore huffed, ``Personal attacks
have no place in a campaign.'' But isn't a campaign exactly the
place where Gore should be confronted if he has indeed abused his
position and violated the spirit of the campaign finance laws? How
can one person point out another's misdeeds without getting
personal?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't throw the first punch. The New York Times thinks Bradley
crossed a moral line last week when he began to criticize Gore on
his own initiative rather than ``in response to attacks by Gore.''
Bradley agrees that a candidate who has been criticized is uniquely
entitled to respond in kind. Running a positive campaign, he
argues, ``doesn't mean I'm going to stand like this forever and let
someone slap my face.''
</P>
<P>
   But why does it matter whether Gore criticized Bradley first?
This is a debate, not a fistfight. If Bradley can explain why Gore
would be an inferior president, why should he have to wait to say
so?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be insensitive. Last week, Bradley began airing an ad in
which a woman says: ``When I was pregnant with my second child,
Bill Bradley proposed a law that women be allowed to stay in the
hospital for 48 hours. Thanks to Sen. Bradley, my daughter is alive
today.'' When critics pointed out that Bradley's bill hadn't passed
until after the woman's daughter was born, Bradley accused the Gore
campaign of displaying ``a real insensitivity'' by challenging the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled that people would attack a woman who obviously
lived through tremendous trauma, has her views, and expressed
them,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether the ad is true. To raise that question is to
``attack a woman.``
</P>
<P>
   --Don't scare people. Gore has been telling blacks and Hispanics
that Bradley's health-care plan would kill Medicaid and provide no
sufficient alternative. Bradley calls this a ``scare tactic'' and
says it's ``wrong'' that Gore is ``using race or ethnicity to try
to scare people.'' But if Gore's assertion is true, what's wrong
with conveying it to the ethnic groups most broadly affected? Gore
isn't calling Bradley a racist. He's making an economic argument,
which Bradley can rebut and has rebutted. The ``scare tactic''
charge, which implies that Gore is using fear and rhetoric to
bypass rational scrutiny, is itself a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be divisive. Bradley accuses Gore of ``poisoning the
atmosphere'' with ``divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the public wants solutions that work, not attacks
that divide,'' says Bradley. Similarly, Bush boasts that he's ``a
uniter, not a divider,'' while the RLC complains that Forbes, by
criticizing Dole in 1996, caused ``fighting within the Republican
Party that was divisive and not inclusive.'' Imagine that--fighting
and divisiveness in an election.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with informing certain segments of the electorate
that your opponent is using the feel-good rhetoric of ``solutions''
to pull a fast one at their expense? If you're lying, shame on you.
But if you're telling the truth, why does it matter that your
message is divisive?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't hurt your party. The RLC ad says Forbes ``hurt the
Republican Party'' in 1996 and will ``help the Democrats'' in 2000
by criticizing his GOP rivals. Republican National Committee
Chairman Jim Nicholson vows to ``blow the whistle on candidates''
who ``tear down other Republicans.'' Meanwhile, Bradley is taking
heat for questioning Gore's campaign-finance practices.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, says the Post, Bradley ``was more
restrained,'' declining ``to comment on the Clinton
administration's fund-raising behavior.'' But why should Bradley
shut up about the Clinton-Gore fund-raising scandal? And why should
Forbes shut up about what he regards as a Republican betrayal of
conservatism? Does loyalty to party supersede loyalty to country?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't alienate voters. Bradley frets that Gore's attacks on
his health-care plan will ``alienate the public'' and foster
skepticism toward big programs. NOW President Patricia Ireland
warns the candidates that ``negative campaigning depresses the
women's vote.'' On the bright side, Forbes' campaign manager says
this year Forbes is ``much less likely'' to ``run the same kind of
negative spots that he did against Dole,'' because ``four years ago
he was a message candidate. Now he believes he can be president.''
But what's wrong with ``alienating'' voters from bad programs and
bad candidates? And isn't it nobler to deliver a depressingly true
``message'' than to shade the truth so you can get elected?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't practice politics as usual. Just as Forbes accused Dole
of playing sneaky ``Washington politics'' in 1996, Bradley now
castigates Gore for resorting to the typical ``Washington
politics'' of slash and burn. Gore is delighted to reciprocate.
``There goes Sen. Bradley again, acting like a typical politician,
launching negative attacks on Al Gore,'' a Gore spokesman crowed.
</P>
<P>
   How does the fact that such attacks are ``typical'' clarify
whether Gore is right about Bradley or vice versa? Never mind. All
you need to know is that negative campaigning is the oldest trick
in the book. And the next oldest trick, if you can't answer the
charge, is to whine about negative campaigning.

<P>
   &UR; By JOEL ACHENBACH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The spaceship comes down in your backyard, crushing a bed of
petunias, and out steps the alien. This is always an awkward social
moment. What, exactly, do you say to someone who may hold the
secrets to the universe?
</P>
<P>
   After, that is, you finish quivering and quaking and wondering
if he (she? it?) is going to suck you down like a raw oyster?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously you would want to get some information out of the
alien--no easy trick, to judge from most alien-encounter
narratives. The aliens who show up in the middle of the night and
abduct people are notoriously stingy with information. They never
solve any mathematical equations. They don't offer up the
long-sought simple and ``elegant'' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.
They don't tell us where Jimmy Hoffa is buried.
</P>
<P>
   When aliens do communicate with humans, they're always a bit
like the Michael Rennie alien in the 1951 movie ``The Day the Earth
Stood Still'': They tell us to behave. They say we need to get our
act together. They're self-help gurus.
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene in Carl Sagan's excellent novel ``Contact'' when
Ellie Arroway, his protagonist, whooshes down some kind of
intragalactic ``wormhole'' and winds up on a sunny beach, face to
face with an alien. The alien, annoyingly, doesn't seem to know who
built that wormhole subway system. Eventually Arroway gets around
to asking what is no doubt her most urgent question: ``I want to
know what you think of us, what you really think.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That's really the wrong question there. That's blowing it
big time. This gal crosses half the galaxy and is tossed and
rattled around to within an inch of her life, and when it's over
she starts fishing for a compliment!
</P>
<P>
   No, a better question to an alien would be: What are you made
of? Are you based on carbon and liquid water? Do you have DNA as
your information-bearing molecule or something like it?
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jay Gould put it this way, on Timothy Ferris' recent PBS
program ``Life Beyond Earth'': ``What's your biochemistry?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people may argue that other questions should precede the
biological ones. They might, for example, choose a political
question, asking who, exactly, is in charge of this universe. Or
they may skew theological, and ask if there's a God and what
exactly he's got on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   A good argument could be made that a physicist should pose the
first batch of questions to an alien, asking whether it's possible
to go faster than the speed of light and whether there are other
universes outside our own. The physicist and the alien would no
doubt get embroiled in a discussion of string theory, and soon
they'd be jotting down incomprehensible equations about
10-dimensional vibrating loops.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe at the end of the encounter we'd figure out how to yank
free energy out of the quantum vacuum. We'd have a new trick for
cooking a hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   My feeling is that the biology questions trump everything else.
We know essentially nothing about life beyond Earth. Because we are
ignorant of other biological systems, we have no context for
understanding Earth life, for knowing to what extent the life we
see around us is, on the cosmic scale, relatively ordinary or
totally freakish.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know, for example, if Earthlike planets are common. We
look around our own solar system, and what appears to be common are
planets that have no life whatsoever. We also see signs that Venus
and Mars were once more hospitable to life and over many hundreds
of millions of years became inhospitable. Bad stuff happens to good
planets. It'd be nice to know more about that trend.
</P>
<P>
   We also don't know how life originates and to what extent it
evolves in an orderly pattern. The debate in Kansas over the
teaching of evolution misses the real debates within the field.
There are those who argue passionately that life originated with a
single replicated molecule. Another camp favors the notion that it
began with a kind of garbage bag of molecules that more or less
eased its way from nonlife to life.
</P>
<P>
   And the biggest question may be to what extent evolution is
divergent or convergent. Divergence gives us a bewildering variety
of life; convergence gives rise, repeatedly, to certain anatomical
features, like wings and eyeballs. You can make an argument that
intelligence is an extremely unlikely, random, quirky event in
terrestrial biology, or you can make the counter-argument that you
can see intelligence coming down the pike from many millions of
years in advance. On that issue hinges the abundance of intelligent
life in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is it that life elsewhere will go through the same
evolutionary leaps as life on Earth? To take one obscure but
critical example: Life on Earth remained entirely one-celled for 3
billion years. For at least half of that time, those cells didn't
have a nucleus. They couldn't use oxygen in their metabolism. They
were pitiful even by microbial standards.
</P>
<P>
   So, how lucky was the evolutionary leap from prokaryotes
(non-nucleated microbes) to eukaryotes (nucleated, and using
oxygen)? It happened here about 2.1 billion years ago. Was that our
lucky break? Or does life, in general, figure out the trick of
using oxygen and growing big and brawny?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, we don't really know what we're talking about
when we talk about ``intelligence.'' We tend to think of creatures
that use technology and language. But that could be shortsighted.
Maybe most intelligent creatures are dolphinoids, blissfully
swimming in an alien ocean with little interest in building
spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment that we could see the universe through the
eyes of an alien creature. Would the universe look more or less the
same? Or would we be confused, dazzled, and feel as though we were
hallucinating?
</P>
<P>
   Are the aliens interested in the same things that interest us?
Could we carry on a meaningful conversation?
</P>
<P>
   We should prepare ourselves for finding something out there
that's totally unexpected. And we have to prepare for bad news, or
at least bad news in the context of our Star Trek fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   We may have wildly overestimated the abundance of
extraterrestrial civilizations. Carl Sagan thought there were
millions such civilizations in existence right now in our own
galaxy. The actual number may be a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could be, as Sagan's old collaborator I.S. Shklovskii
argued, ``functionally alone.'' Not literally alone, just so
isolated that there's no practical way to make contact of any kind
with another intelligent species.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever we do, we shouldn't take ourselves for granted. There
may be something extremely rare and wonderful about a world in
which water splashes on the surface, and where life survives for
nearly 4 billion years, where it has the leisure to evolve and,
through natural selection, explore the possibilities of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The search for life beyond Earth always doubles back to our own
existence. Why are we this way? How did we come about? How special
is it to be a thinking organism? This is the kind of stuff you'd
want to discuss with the aliens. And remember, they like it when
you compliment them on the really cool spaceship.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PAUL KRUGMAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a picture is worth a thousand words, a two-page spread in The
New York Times, featuring more than a dozen pictures, can speak
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the lavish Nov. 15 advertisement by the Turning
Point Project, a coalition of activists opposed to globalization in
general and the World Trade Organization in particular, said more
than any merely verbal exposition about what really motivates those
activists could. Indeed, it revealed quite a bit more than its
sponsors intended.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the ad was the WTO ``ministerial'' taking place
in Seattle this week. The WTO has become to leftist mythology what
the United Nations is to the militia movement: the center of a
global conspiracy against all that is good and decent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the ``ultra-secretive'' WTO has become a
sort of super-governmental body that forces nations to bow to the
wishes of multinational corporations. It destroys local cultures,
the headline on the ad read ``Global Monoculture''; it despoils the
environment; and it rides roughshod over democracy, forcing
governments to remove laws that conflict with its sinister
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Like most successful urban legends, this one is based on a
sliver of truth. The gradual global progress toward free trade that
began in the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Trade
Agreements Program, has always depended on international
negotiations: I'll reduce my tariffs if you reduce yours.
</P>
<P>
   But there has always been the problem of governments that give
with one hand and take away with the other, that dutifully remove
tariffs and then use other excuses to keep imports out.
(Certainement, there is free trade within the European Union, but
those British cows, they are not safe.)
</P>
<P>
   To make agreements work there has to be some kind of
quasi-judicial process that determines when ostensibly domestic
measures are de facto a reimposition of trade barriers and hence a
violation of treaty. Under the pre-WTO system, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this process was slow and
cumbersome. It has now become swifter and more decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some of its decisions can be challenged: Was the
U.S. ban on dolphin-unsafe tuna really a trade barrier in disguise?
</P>
<P>
   But the much-feared power of the WTO to overrule local laws is
strictly limited to enforcement of the spirit of existing
agreements. It cannot in any important way force countries that are
skeptical about the benefits of globalization to open themselves
further to foreign trade and investment. If most countries
nonetheless are eager or at least willing to participate in
globalization, it is because they are convinced that it is in their
own interests.
</P>
<P>
   And by and large they are right. The raw fact is that every
successful example of economic development this past century--every
case of a poor nation that worked its way up to a more or less
decent, or at least dramatically better, standard of living--has
taken place via globalization; that is, by producing for the world
market rather than trying for self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers who do that production for the global market
are very badly paid by First World standards. But to claim that
they have been impoverished by globalization, you have to carefully
ignore comparisons across time and space--namely, you have to
forget that those workers were even poorer before the new exporting
jobs became available and ignore the fact that those who do not
have access to the global market are far worse off than those who
do.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis of 1997-99 temporarily gave those who claim
that globalization is bad for workers everywhere a bit of
ammunition, but the crisis did not go on forever, and anyway the
solution to future crises surely involves some policing of
short-term capital movements rather than a retreat from
globalization as a whole. Even the Malaysians continue to welcome
long-term foreign investors and place their faith on manufactured
exports.
</P>
<P>
   What about the environment? Certainly some forests have been cut
down to feed global markets. But nations that are heedless of the
environment are quite capable of doing immense damage without the
help of multinational corporations--just ask the Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   For what it is worth, the most conspicuous examples of
environmental pillage in the Third World today have nothing to do
with the WTO. The forest fires that envelop Southeast Asia in an
annual smoke cloud are set by land-hungry locals; the subsidized
destruction of Amazonian rain forests began as part of a Brazilian
strategy of inward-looking development.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, integration of the world economy, which puts
national actions under international scrutiny, is probably on
balance a force toward better, not worse, environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   But anyway, these are side issues, because what that
advertisement makes clear--clearer, I suspect, than its sponsors
intended--is that the opposition to globalization actually has very
little to do with wages or the environment. After all, leaving
aside a photo of tree stumps and another of an outfall pipe, here
are the horrors of globalization the Turning Point Project chose to
illustrate:
</P>
<P>
   A highway interchange, a parking lot filled with cars, a traffic
jam, suburban tract housing, an apartment building with numerous
satellite dishes, an office with many computer screens, office
workers on a busy street, high-rise office buildings, a ``factory
farm'' with many chickens, a supermarket aisle, a McDonald's arch.
</P>
<P>
   Each picture was accompanied by a caption asking, ``Is this Los
Angeles or Cairo?'' ``Is this India or London?'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   What is so horrible about these scenes? Here's what the ad says,
``A few decades ago, it was still possible to leave home and go
somewhere else: The architecture was different, the landscape was
different, the language, dress, and values were different. That was
a time when we could speak of cultural diversity. But with economic
globalization, diversity is fast disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't argue with that; lives there the tourist with soul so
dead that he does not wish that he could visit rural France, or
Mexico City, or for that matter Kansas City the way they were,
rather than the way they are? But the world is not run for the
edification of tourists. It is or should be run for the benefit of
ordinary people in their daily lives. And that is where the
indignation of the Turning Point people starts to seem rather
strange.
</P>
<P>
   For surely the most striking thing about the horrors of
globalization illustrated in those photos is that for most of the
world's people they represent aspirations, things they wish they
had, rather than ominous threats. Traffic jams and ugly
interchanges are annoying, but most people would gladly accept that
annoyance in exchange for the freedom that comes with owning a car
(and more to the point, being wealthy enough to afford one). Tract
housing and apartment buildings may be ugly, but they are paradise
compared with village huts or urban shanties. Wearing a suit and
working at a computer in an office tower are, believe it or not,
preferable to backbreaking work in a rice paddy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course what is good for the individual is not always
good if everyone else does it too. Having a big house with a garden
is nice, but seeing the countryside covered by suburban sprawl is
not, and we might all be better off if we could all agree (or be
convinced by tax incentives) to take up a bit less space.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for cultural choices: Boston residents who indulge
their taste for Canadian divas do undermine the prospects of local
singer-songwriters and might be collectively better off if local
radio stations had some kind of cultural content rule. But there is
a very fine line between such arguments for collective action and
supercilious paternalism, especially when cultural matters are
concerned; are we warning societies about unintended consequences
or are we simply disagreeing with individual tastes?
</P>
<P>
   And it is very clear from the advertisement in The Times that
the Turning Point Project--and the whole movement it
represents--are on the supercilious side of that line. Although
they talk of freedom and democracy, their key demand is that
individuals be prevented from getting what they want--that
governments be free, nay encouraged, to deny individuals the right
to drive cars, work in offices, eat cheeseburgers, and watch
satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Presumably because people will really be happier if they
retain their traditional ``language, dress, and values.'' Thus,
Spaniards would be happier if they still dressed in black and let
narrow-minded priests run their lives, and residents of the
American South would be happier if planters still sipped mint
juleps, wore white suits, and accepted traditional deference from
sharecroppers ... instead of living in this ``dreary'' modern world
in which Madrid is just like Paris and Atlanta is just like New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Well, somehow I suspect that the residents of Madrid and
Atlanta, while they may regret some loss of tradition, prefer
modernity. And you know what? I think the rest of the world has the
right to make the same choice.

</P>
<P>
   The most important thing that's changed about the major TV
networks in the last few years, aside from their steadily shrinking
share of the audience, is that more and more of their programming
is ``reality-based.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, you have the continued proliferation of the
too-scary-to-be-fictional genre, which was pioneered by Fox and
exemplified by ``When Animals Attack'' and ``World's Scariest Car
Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more and more of the networks' schedules are
occupied by news shows--which generally have at least a loose
connection to reality--such as ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   And although ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' is no longer
provoking belly laughs across the country, variants thereof air
regularly as specials.
</P>
<P>
   The great virtue of reality-based programming is that it's
relatively inexpensive to produce, since very little of the
material needs to be paid for. And for people who are supposedly
obsessed with celebrities, Americans seem remarkably interested in
what other ``real'' people are doing--as long as what they're doing
involves either being chased down with 40 vials of crack, fighting
a long illness, driving the wrong way on a freeway, or getting
upended off a ladder by an overly friendly springer spaniel.
(Wasn't that a great segment?)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result of its success, though, ``reality-based
programming'' is now being used as a label to cover shows that are,
well, not real, like the huge hit game show ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' and its recent successful competitor ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire,'' which ended its fall run last week, picked up
where it left off this summer, dominating its time slot and
actually casting a slight halo effect on its ABC peers, while
``Greed'' has been one of the only--OK, the only--bright spot in a
disappointing fall season.
</P>
<P>
   It's their success that prompted a recent headline in Variety
proclaiming ``Nets Reap Ratings From Reality Shows.''
</P>
<P>
   What's odd about this is that game shows--even if they're not
fixed like they were in the '50s--are real only in a very tenuous
sense. Thoroughly staged and stage-managed, they're dramatic, or
perhaps melodramatic, precisely because of the artificial structure
of their formats.
</P>
<P>
   We don't, it's true, know how any given episode of
``Millionaire'' is going to turn out, and even though one might say
the same about a forthcoming episode of ``ER,'' the fact that in
theory no one knows how the ``Millionaire'' episode is going to
turn out may make it more real.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Millionaire'' and ``Greed'' are to ``Cops'' and ``When
Animals Attack'' as the zoo is to the Serengeti Plain, offering a
kind of semblance of uncertainty (and, therefore, reality) instead
of the actual thing, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the actual thing is just the possibility that something
genuinely unexpected is going to happen--who knew that deer could
beat down hunters with their front hooves?--but in part, especially
with a show like ``Cops,'' it's the possibility that nothing
especially important is going to happen. ``Millionaire,'' by
contrast, is circumscribed in both directions. You know it'll be
exciting but not too surprising, and you know it won't be too
surprising but also not dull.
</P>
<P>
   Game shows do have many of the same advantages as true
reality-based programming--relatively low production cost, endless
supply of material--and some others in addition, including the
ability to keep Chuck Woolery off the dole.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that TV viewers would rather spend prime time
watching a not-so-great-looking guy answer questions about the
Great Lakes than watching gorgeous twentysomethings pretend to be
teen-agers has to count for something.
</P>
<P>
   But only in a world as totally hermetic as that of TV production
would game shows count as real. Next we'll probably hear that
``Felicity'' counts as real, too, since the people saying their
lines on the show are actual human beings who are actually saying
the words.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good to me.

   SCI-CAROLINA-FLOODS (Undated) _ Scientists fear that the
post-hurricane flood of eastern North Carolina has created an
ecological time bomb, and they fear for the biologically rich
waters that separate the famous Outer Banks from the Carolina
mainland. This complex of sounds, bays and inlets comprises the
second largest estuary in the country, after Chesapeake Bay, and is
one of the nation's most important incubators of marine life.
Rarely have ecologists confronted such a striking example of what

a first-order disturbance of the natural world by humans. By
William K. Stevens. (1700 words)

   SCI-COSMOLOGY-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Continued evidence over the
last year that the expansion of the universe is accelerating has
provided fresh new evidence of the distressing finding that
something in the wastelands of space could be pushing against
gravity. So scientists are reluctantly accepting the notion that
something in the most fundamental theories of physics is terribly
wrong. By James Glanz.

<P>
   SCI-AIDS-POLIO (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: The provocative
theory that AIDS is a manufactured disaster arising from early
testing of the polio vaccine in Africa seemed farfetched when it
first came to public attention, in an article in Rolling Stone in
1992. Most scientists dismissed it after a scientific committee
reviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low. But that
panel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was
later shown to be in error. And now a remarkable new book, ``The
River'' by Edward Hooper, offers tantalizing clues to revive and
expand the polio vaccine theory. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1900

   SCI-MARS-POLE (Undated) _ Less than a century after explorers
made their first heroic assault on the poles of Earth, an American
spacecraft is racing toward Mars and the first landing in the polar
region of another planet. The robotic Mars Polar Lander is being
aimed for a landing on Friday on the vast terraces of ice and dust
a few hundred miles from the planet's south pole. Spring is turning
to summer there, the season of constant sunlight, which the
spacecraft will draw on for energy to power its computer and
transmitter and array of cameras, sensors, digging arm and ovens
for heating and analyzing soil samples. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-PLOTKIN-RAINFOREST (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Mark
J. Plotkin, who staked his reputation on finding new medicines in
the rain forest. But he earliest efforts at finding great medicines
failed, forcing him and others to recognize that even in the rain
forests medical miracles are rare. By Jon Christensen. (1830 words)

   SCI-FEVERS (Undated) _ Fevers can be mysterious, which is when
the challenges multiply. The hospital is always filled with
patients with fevers no one understands. In some, it is a sign of
an underlying disease that is not yet known. In other people, like
AIDS or cancer patients with suppressed immune systems, the fever
may have any number of causes, including their underlying disease
or, most dangerously, an infection that could rapidly kill if left
untreated. Whatever the case may be, mysterious fevers are common,
and among the most vexing of medical problems. By Sandeep Jauhar.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-SPEECH (Undated) _ Parents now are being told to
seek speech therapy earlier for children who are exhibiting
problems, a sharp change from previous years when adults were
assured that often, very bright children did not learn to speak
until they were much older. The new advice is based, in part, on
studies showing that children with speech impairments are more
likely to have reading and social problems later on. By Randi
Hutter Epstein. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Research showing much puberty for
girls arriving much earlier than previous studies had shown could
force textbooks and medical schools to revise the age at which
puberty is considered premature. Current medical textbooks state
that just 1 percent of girls younger than 8 show signs of puberty.
In a new review of existing data, in the Oct. 4 issue of the
journal Pediatrics, researchers concluded that ``the onset of
breast development between 7 and 8 years of age in white girls and
between 6 and 8 years in African-American girls may be part of the
normal broad variation in the timing of puberty and not, in most
cases, a pathological state.'' By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OLDER-ATHLETES (Undated) _ A new generation of older
athletes are healthier than their predecessors, living longer and
pointedly aware of the importance of getting and staying in shape.
They are forming pickup teams, creating senior divisions in sports
leagues and competing in large-scale events in gyms and playing
fields across the country. By Linda Villarosa. (800 words)

   _ A study comparing identical and fraternal Australian twins
found evidence that stuttering may have a genetic basis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celebrex and Vioxx are two of the hottest drugs on the market,
in large part because of their potential for reducing pain and
inflammation without the risk of gastric harm associated with
medicines like ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin. But a pair of new
studies has led the Journal of the American Medical Association to
conclude that while those risks are indeed lowered, they are not
lowered enough to justify the extra cost of prescribing them for
most people. (360 words)

RABBIS MADE THEIR MARK ON TEXAS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In Texas, Yom Kippur may not be a school
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Gefilte fish may not be as common as barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers may considerably outnumber rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jews have not been insignificant forces in the
history and culture of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite, says author and former newspaper reporter
Hollace Ava Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the relatively small Jewish congregations in tiny
towns and big cities throughout the state, rabbis have played a
prominent role in Texas history, taking on civic and spiritual
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rabbis have become visible,'' said Weiner, a former
reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``They are called upon
for lots of things. ... They are educated outside the region. They
bring something a little exotic or erudite here that others don't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jewish Stars in Texas: Rabbis and Their Work'' (Texas A&AMP;M
Press, $24.95), Weiner tells the stories of 11 Texas rabbis who
made an impact on Texas from the 1870s until the 1980s. But in
telling those 11 stories, she is also writing about the history of
Texas, Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the rabbis told us something about Texas,'' she said.
``I didn't want it just to be a Jewish book. It's a slice of
Texana.''
</P>
<P>
   The book adds to the often-neglected scholarship on Jews in the
South and Southwest, said Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and former rabbi at Temple
Emanu-El in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Jewish community has not done a great job of
presenting the story of Jews in rural and smaller towns around the
country,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's book is part of a growing interest in the history of
Jews in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although that history stretches back to before the founding of
the country, Jews began to arrive in large numbers in the United
States at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging scholarship represents a maturing of the American
Jewish community and a coming of age, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``New communities don't look at their history,'' he said. ``They
are too busy becoming Americans. It is only when a community has a
greater sense of security, becomes part of the fabric of a
community, that it takes stock of its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner begins her profiles with Heinrich Schwarz of Hempstead,
Texas' first ordained rabbi. The last rabbi profiled is Levi Olan
of Dallas, who took the pulpit of Temple Emanu-El eight hours after
President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot and preached about the
``shame of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, Weiner writes about rabbis such as one in Lubbock
who presented art lectures and one in Galveston who fought the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis Weiner profiles share some characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Many, especially in the early days, were not exactly the cream
of the crop, Weiner said. The top-notch students and teachers were
often given positions in New York or other cities with larger and
more prestigious Jewish congregations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who came to Texas were often rebels of sorts, she
said. They were willing to bend some of the rules to survive in a
new part of the country, she said. Some understood that it would be
difficult to keep a kosher household in Texas, for example.
Although shellfish are forbidden in a kosher diet, Sam Perl, a lay
rabbi from Brownsville, was the chaplain to the shrimp producers
association because ``what was good for the region was good for the
Jewish people who were merchants in the area,'' Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas rabbis excelled at reaching out to the community
beyond the Jewish congregation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Weiner recently heard a story from a man whose
brother was killed in World War II. The family, Christians, was
informed the day before Easter. Christian preachers were too busy
on Easter Sunday to console the family, so the town's rabbi came
and sat with the family for the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the complete story of Jews in the state may not be
fully told, Weiner said she expects interest from Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of curiosity about Jews,'' Weiner said. ``I
find very little prejudice and anti-Semitism, but a lot of
curiosity. Many people have never met a Jew. They'll say, `Oh, you
are a Hebrew. Tell me about your church.' They may get the
terminology wrong, but they are interested.''

<P>
   OXFORD, ENGLAND _ This week, trade ministers from the world's
richest countries will have an opportunity to make a major
contribution to poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle could lay the
foundations for an international trading system that spreads the
benefits of globalization more widely, creating new hope for the
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, it could extend into the next millennium a set of
trade rules geared toward the interests of the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   in the industrialized world, trade is often seen as a remote
activity that barely impinges on everyday life. For many of the
world's poorest people, it is, quite literally, a matter of life
and death.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, textile exports provide income for millions of
poor women, income that is used to educate their children. In
Africa, trade underpins the livelihoods of smallholder farmers
growing tea, coffee and cocoa. In the Philippines, trade threatens
the livelihoods of corn farmers facing subsidized competition from
U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries and poor people need a rules-based global trading
system. Without rules the strong prevail because they have the
capacity to inflict damage on the weak through trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Problems emerge, however, when the rules are rigged against the
poor, and the referee is wearing the colors of the powerful. This
is broadly what is happening under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of textiles. During the last round of world trade
talks, the Uruguay Round, the industrialized countries promised to
phase out import restrictions within ten years. By now, they should
have removed about one-third of the quotas under the Multi-Fiber
Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the European Union and the United States have removed
less than 5 percent of the restrictions. This translates into
poverty and unemployment in countries such as India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles are the tip of a protectionist iceberg. While the
industrialized countries preach the virtues of free trade
principles, they remain unconvinced about the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been particularly adroit in slapping
tariffs on imports it considers too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Protectionist measures bite deepest in areas where developing
countries have the strongest comparative advantage, notably
agriculture and labor intensive manufacturing goods.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the average tariffs facing exports from the poorest
countries to the industrialized world are about one-third higher
than those facing industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, developing countries lose about
$700 billion a year as a direct result of protectionist measures.
This represents around 12 percent of their combined gross domestic
product. It is also equivalent to fourteen times the level of
annual aid flows to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike aid, trade generates the self-reliant growth, employment
and investment needed to tackle poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas the hypocrisy in world trade rules defies
credibility. Take the case of agriculture. The average American
farmer receives about $20,000 in subsidies each year from his
government.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of a staggering $335 billion in subsidies provided
by the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Getting access to agricultural markets
in the United States or the European Union is about as
straightforward as leaving Alcatraz.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to developing countries, the United States is
demanding that the Seattle talks lead to more open markets into
which American grain companies can dump domestic surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, the dumping of U.S. corn is destroying the
livelihoods of desperately poor farmers on the island of Mindanao.
The annual subsidy given to American farmers is about one hundred
times higher than the annual income of farmers in Mindanao, more
than half of whom live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   None of this deters the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, from giving sermons on the benefits of level playing
fields in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   So what needs to be done to restore the credibility of the WTO
and create a system of trade rules capable of contributing to
global poverty reduction efforts?
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle talks could start with a trade barrier ``bonfire''
for the poorest countries, with the industrialized countries
committing themselves to phasing out all barriers within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   At present the 48 least developed countries account for 0.4
percent of world trade, and their share is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   The talks could then proceed to two key measures on agriculture.
Export subsidies should be brought under the WTO's anti-dumping
rules and be made subject to a ban. At the same time, the Indian
government's proposal to exempt countries with food deficits from
agricultural market liberalization to combat hunger and promote
rural employment should be adopted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Textiles will remain one of the key litmus tests for the
success, or failure, of the Seattle talks. The test itself is
simple enough. Are the industrialized countries willing to do what
they should have done years ago: namely, phase out the Multi-Fiber
Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the WTO patents regime must be rebalanced. Access to
knowledge-based technologies is increasingly vital for countries to
compete successfully in global trade, but by increasing royalty
payments to northern companies the WTO system makes these
technologies unaffordable to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   For any of these changes to happen, the WTO process must be open
and transparent. This is far from the case at present, with many of
the world's poorest countries being excluded from the secretive
``Green Room'' consultations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for WTO ministers in Seattle is to demonstrate the
political will to set a new, more equitable, course for world trade
that truly benefits the world's poor. &QL;

<P>
   People like paper. Despite advances in digital technologies that
were expected to lead to paperless offices, one of the biggest
growth markets in the technology world right now is for printers,
largely the ink-jet variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperless home or the paperless office is a myth,'' said
Paula Burskey, who covers the sector for Dataquest Inc., a
technology-research organization in San Jose, Calif. ``People like
something to put in their hand that is hard copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, they are printing out information from the Internet, she
said. ``The on-line availability of information has driven printer
volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, printer manufacturers, who tend to make most of their
money selling ink cartridges, are thinking up ways to encourage
people to print more documents.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors at Comdex, the computer trade show recently held in
Las Vegas, visibly brightened when asked how the printer business
was doing. ``People still need that printout,'' said Chris
Strammiello, a Xerox Corp. marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, whose background is in photocopiers, was until recently a
proponent of the paperless-office concept. Now, however, it uses
the phrase ``digital office,'' one in which documents of all sorts
exist in computer memories but where printing is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way from Xerox, Ricoh Co. was showing off a new
product called the eCabinet, targeted at small business and
individual departments of larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at about $14,000, the eCabinet stores documents, faxes,
electronic mail and the like on a hard drive and on removable DVD
disks. The idea is keep all of a company's current documents
on-line and a digital archive of older data in easily accessible
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Japanese company's American subsidiary has just returned
to the printer industry because customers demanded more than just
the storage, an exhibitor said. Unlike most of the printer
companies, Ricoh is offering only laser models.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet devices, however, are where the action is, accounting
for about 70 percent of the market, according to Pradeep Jotwani,
vice president of consumer sales and marketing at Hewlett-Packard
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is the dominant maker of printers, accounting
for more than 40 percent of worldwide annual shipments.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why ink-jet printers are more popular
than lasers. One is a price as low as $49.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so inexpensive, ink-jet units are often bundled
with computers in the consumer market, which is growing rapidly,
especially in Europe, as people link up with the Internet, Jotwani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet technology is finding its way into multiple-purpose
machines that combine printers, scanners, faxes and copiers in one
unit. Canon Inc., among other manufacturers, had several such
products on display at Comdex, drawing a lot of interest with units
priced between $300 and $400, what a scanner alone would have cost
just a few years ago or what a basic laser printer costs now.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins on manufacturing ink-jet printers are not high,
especially at the low end, where, Burskey of Dataquest noted, a
printer costs just $10 or so more than an ink cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   So printer makers look to profit from what Strammiello of Xerox
termed an ``annuity stream'' that comes by selling supplies,
largely ink cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox this month offered consumers free Internet and electronic
mail access with any printer purchase for the rest of the year, and
it has a Web site that offers templates to help businesses create
brochures and that offers such printing-intensive children's
projects as constructing paper cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it in our interest to maximize consumer value of the
products that they purchase,'' Jotwani said. &QL;

Paula Burskey, who covers the sector for Dataquest Inc., a
technology-research organization in San Jose, Calif. ``People like
something to put in their hand that is hard copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, they are printing out information from the Internet, she
said. ``The on-line availability of information has driven printer
volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, printer manufacturers, who tend to make most of their
money selling ink cartridges, are thinking up ways to encourage
people to print more documents.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors at Comdex, the computer trade show recently held in
Las Vegas, visibly brightened when asked how the printer business
was doing. ``People still need that printout,'' said Chris
Strammiello, a Xerox Corp. marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, whose background is in photocopiers, was until recently a
proponent of the paperless-office concept. Now, however, it uses
the phrase ``digital office,'' one in which documents of all sorts
exist in computer memories but where printing is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way from Xerox, Ricoh Co. was showing off a new
product called the eCabinet, targeted at small business and
individual departments of larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at about $14,000, the eCabinet stores documents, faxes,
electronic mail and the like on a hard drive and on removable DVD
disks. The idea is keep all of a company's current documents
on-line and a digital archive of older data in easily accessible
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Japanese company's American subsidiary has just returned
to the printer industry because customers demanded more than just
the storage, an exhibitor said. Unlike most of the printer
companies, Ricoh is offering only laser models.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet devices, however, are where the action is, accounting
for about 70 percent of the market, according to Pradeep Jotwani,
vice president of consumer sales and marketing at Hewlett-Packard
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is the dominant maker of printers, accounting
for more than 40 percent of worldwide annual shipments.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why ink-jet printers are more popular
than lasers. One is a price as low as $49.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so inexpensive, ink-jet units are often bundled
with computers in the consumer market, which is growing rapidly,
especially in Europe, as people link up with the Internet, Jotwani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet technology is finding its way into multiple-purpose
machines that combine printers, scanners, faxes and copiers in one
unit. Canon Inc., among other manufacturers, had several such
products on display at Comdex, drawing a lot of interest with units
priced between $300 and $400, what a scanner alone would have cost
just a few years ago or what a basic laser printer costs now.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins on manufacturing ink-jet printers are not high,
especially at the low end, where, Burskey of Dataquest noted, a
printer costs just $10 or so more than an ink cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   So printer makers look to profit from what Strammiello of Xerox
termed an ``annuity stream'' that comes by selling supplies,
largely ink cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox this month offered consumers free Internet and electronic
mail access with any printer purchase for the rest of the year, and
it has a Web site that offers templates to help businesses create
brochures and that offers such printing-intensive children's
projects as constructing paper cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it in our interest to maximize consumer value of the
products that they purchase,'' Jotwani said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a robot that looks and swims like an ancient fish,
scales and all. Or a minuscule video camera that is positioned
during heart surgery by voice commands from the surgeon to a
robotic arm. Or a robot that selects a component from a bin on an
assembly line, then installs it with just the right amount of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Robots were once sort of one-trick ponies that were programmed
to do a simple task, and many still are.
</P>
<P>
   But today's robots, and future generations still in research
laboratories, are increasingly complex, combining artificial
intelligence, sensors, speech recognition and other leading-edge
technologies which make them seem almost human. Indeed, they can
perform certain tasks better than a human.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales of industrial robots to the auto industry, by
far the biggest user, soared 101 percent in the first half of this
year from a year earlier, boosted by economic growth in the United
States and Europe, according to an annual survey by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The European market for industrial robots has already posted a
32 percent increase in orders this year, and is forecast to grow at
about 10 percent annually to 32,000 robots in 2002, while the
United States should see a 9 percent annual increase, the U.N.
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fanuc Ltd. of Japan is a leading supplier of robots to the
global auto industry, where they weld, cut, paint and load and
unload machine tools.
</P>
<P>
   But robots are becoming involved in an increasing array of
industries, performing functions from painting refrigerators to
molding plastic to packaging nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   A major customer of Fanuc Robotics, the American subsidiary of
Fanuc, is the U.S. Postal Service, which uses robots to read bar
codes on mail and sort it.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how robotics is evolving, consider one of
Fanuc's newest developments, a commercial, intelligent robot that
can do skilled mechanical assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with sensors and 3-D vision, it knows just how much
pressure to apply to fit one part into another, in a vertical,
horizontal or diagonal position, a major improvement over its
predecessor which could handle only vertical positions.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant difference between it and older versions,
said Sunil Gupta, the product manager for the robot, is its 3-D
vision, which gives it depth perception. ``It's not exactly human
vision, but it's getting there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So accomplished is the robot that it is being used to make other
robots at Fanuc in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But far from the assembly lines of Detroit is another robotic
field that is just beginning to tap its enormous potential _ robots
that entertain and even act as companions.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Sony Corp. came out with a metallic robot dog named
Aibo, the Japanese word for partner.
</P>
<P>
   With a camera for eyes, microphones in its ears, and artificial
intelligence software, Aibo barks, ``sings'' robotic songs and wags
its tail when it is patted on the head. It can even play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the dog in Japan, where robots are wildly popular
with individuals, especially teenagers, outstripped Sony's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of Aibos is now under development at Sony's
Digital Creatures Laboratory, but the entertainment giant is by no
means the only player.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has produced a prototype of a
talking robotic cat, designed as a companion for Japan's elderly.
And Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. produced a robotic fish that
is already swimming in the aquarium at an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Robotics is also playing a role in the rapidly growing field of
less invasive surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Motion Inc., a California company, has developed a
robotic platform procedure for heart bypass surgery, where the
surgeon is seated at a computer console about 3 meters (10 feet)
from the operating table and operates by manipulating with voice
commands three robotic arms holding instruments and a tiny video
camera, which is positioned in the patient's body.
</P>
<P>
   Because the robotic system smooths out even the tiniest tremors
in a surgeon's hands, it allows for precise surgical procedures
that would otherwise be impossible or extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows heart surgery with incisions no larger than the
width of a pencil, compared with the current practice of opening
the rib cage. The result is a less painful and much faster
recuperation for the patient.  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Unfortunately for investors who find the idea of robotics
appealing, there are few opportunities unless you aspire to being a
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complex, and lengthy development of robots, some of
it extremely arcane, takes place at universities like the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Carnegie Mellon's
Robotics Institute, often in cooperation with small, private
companies or subsidiaries of big corporations, as in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Robotics projects that relate to space and defense are often
funded by the U.S. government and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fanuc and Computer Motion are among the few companies that
are publicly listed, and worth investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Fanuc, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, obtains
roughly 30 percent of its gross revenue from robots, most of which
are bought by the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hideyuki Mizuno, who follows the company for ING Barings in
Tokyo, said that Fanuc's robot business is being driven by demand
from Europe and the United States, where cost-cutting and
improvements in productivity are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian companies have not used robots as extensively because of
cheap labor costs,'' he said, ``and the Asian auto industry is
still quite small,'' referring to the industry outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But with Japan's economy in a recovery mode, Fanuc shares have
been on a tear this year, soaring some 126 percent, and Mizuno, and
several other analysts are maintaining their buy ratings on the
stock _ not so much because of improving robot sales, he said, but
because he expects that increased capital spending in Japan will
boost Fanuc's other business _ making computerized controls for
machine tools.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Computer Motion, one of the few publicly listed stocks
in its field, jumped to almost $14 in mid-October from $9.50 a week
earlier, on the announcement that a successful heart bypass
operation had been performed using its robotic platform.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Wald, who follows the company for George K. Baum, a
specialist boutique, has a ``speculative buy'' rating on the stock.
Like most such companies, Computer Motion is losing money now, but
Wald expects it to become profitable at the end of next year _
provided it has passed its clinical trials and obtained approval of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are also looking for there is a recurring revenue
stream that comes from the disposable kits that go with the
product,'' he said. He has a $20 a share target price over the next
18 months if all goes well. &QL;

   HOLIDAYS-SINGLES (Albany, N.Y.) _ This is a plea to Mom, Dad,
Grandma, Titi, Nana, Auntie and all the uncles from Andre to Jarrel
to Zach this holiday season. When in the presence of single people,
think twice before starting any question that begins with the word,
``Soooooooooooo?'' The word can make even the calmest single jump.
As in, ``Soooooooooo, is there someone special?'' By CELINA
OTTAWAY.

   CYBER-SANTAS (San Antonio) _ For the cyber-savvy, there will be
no last-minute crisis over holiday gift-giving. For them, there
will be no frenzied trips to the malls, no fighting traffic, no
midnight gift-wrapping. By DON SHERON.

   HOLIDAY-CLUTTER (Albany, N.Y.) _ If your daily bread is hard to
spot beneath the piles of clutter in your house, how will you ever
find your Christmas pudding? The holidays are a microcosm of your
whole life, experts say. If it's a muddle, odds are the holidays
will be, too. But there's good news. Now is the best time to

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Now that Hillary Clinton has
answered the will-she-won't-she riddle, the next questions are: How
can she balance her duties as first lady with the demands of a New
York Senate campaign and why is she doing this anyway? By this time
next year, she will be the most psychoanalyzed sitting first lady
in history. Several new books claiming to understand her inner
thoughts are in the works. By MARIANNE MEANS
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Subtitled ``Living with
conviction in a cynical time,'' Paul Loeb's latest book, ``Soul of
a Citizen'' is like a 362-page pep rally for the soul. It should be
mandatory reading for anyone over the age of 12 - especially every
woman or man who has traded ``I give a damn'' for ``I give up.'' By
STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Every time I see another public
opinion survey doubting the wisdom of allowing free expression by
the media, my skin thins a bit. The latest came across my desk just
the other day. According to this survey by the Scripps Howard Texas
Poll, half of Texans don't like the way the media have been
covering the 2000 presidential campaign so far, while only 38
percent of Texans approve.

<P>
   ``Once upon a time'' is the stuff of fairy tales, not corporate
histories. But that is how Stora Enso Oyj introduces its saga, and
for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish company is as old as the millennium. That makes it
one of the oldest companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock is also well worth buying, industry analysts say.
Stora joined forces a year ago with Enso Oyj of Finland to create
Europe's biggest paper maker.
</P>
<P>
   The combined group is taking advantage of record-low inventories
around the world and raising prices. At the same time, it is
divesting itself of 2 billion ($2.04 billion) worth of utility
assets in a bid to overtake International Paper Co. and become the
top paper maker in the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a story, not only because Stora is so old but also
because its history so well illustrates the ongoing struggle in
Europe between public and private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Stora traces its origins to Stora Kopparberget, or the Great
Copper Mountain, in Falun, Sweden. The mine was first worked at
some time between 850 and 1080.
</P>
<P>
   A Deed of Exchange dated 1288 and signed by the king bequeathed
an eighth part in the mine to the diocese of Bishop Peter of
Vasteras in exchange for a farm complete with mills, fields,
pastures, fishing rights and forests.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a great success, at least not at first. In 1347, King
Magnus Eriksson issued a charter following a disappointing visit to
the mine. The charter, which is one of the oldest surviving
documents of its kind in Sweden, details the poor conditions in and
around the mine and outlines a new management and wage structure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1360, a few years after the Black Plague struck the mine in
force, the king supplemented the charter with a Mining Statute.
This allowed master miners to mine ore in proportion to the number
of smelters they owned.
</P>
<P>
   It also determined the sequence of work. At this point,
according to Stora research, the mine emerges as a truly corporate
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   This was obviously a success _ so much so that in 1396 Queen
Margareta reasserted the crown's right to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Stora Kopparberget thrived through most of the 15th century. A
guild was formed, with St. Orjan as the patron saint. By this time,
the miners probably mined more than 2,000 ship's pounds of copper a
year, according to preserved Lubeck accounts. That is about 300,000
kilograms. Almost all of Swedish copper was sold through Lubeck and
through the Hanseatic League.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of a pump driven by a water wheel gave the mine a
new lease on life in 1556. King Gustav Vasa was enthusiastic about
the new technology but had trouble with master miners who refused
to abandon their traditional working methods.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by the beginning of the 17th century, all the
mine's chambers were being worked as one, systematically utilized
unit, enabling Sweden to surpass Germany in production and refining
and dominate the European copper market.
</P>
<P>
   A copper mint was the next step, just in time for Sweden's move
to a copper monetary standard. For more than 200 years, all of
Sweden's copper coinage was minted in nearby Avesta. The biggest
coin was the 10 daler piece, which weighed almost 20 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Mining copper ore required enormous amounts of wood. In 1648, a
trading company was formed to transport wood to Falun, which by
this time had become a town.
</P>
<P>
   The mining thrived and work went on all day and night. The pits
went deeper and deeper and the walls between the chambers became
thinner and thinner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1687 they caved in. Extraordinarily, no one was hurt. All of
Stora Kopparberget's miners were above ground, celebrating
Midsummer. Indeed, the cave-in exposed hidden ore and created a
tourist attraction, the Great Pit. It was a stroke of great luck in
what were otherwise bleak lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1734 the Swedish scientist Carl von Linne visited the mine
and called it the greatest marvel in Sweden but ``as terrible as
hell itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry became increasingly important and, by the late 1800s,
generated more than half of Stora's income. Associated works also
produced silver, sulfuric acid, newsprint and red paint (which,
according to legend, followed the discovery of iron deposits by a
Finnish shepherd boy when his billy-goat, Kare, returned home with
red horns).
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish crown's direct authority over the mine came to an
end in 1862 and the mine and the various individual works were
combined into one company, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag. In 1885,
Stora became a limited company. The nominal capital was 9.6 million
kronor.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Stora was a rapidly growing company with
interests in market pulp, sawn goods, newsprint and electricity as
well as mining. But in 1990, the company decided to focus
exclusively on its most profitable sector, forest products, and in
November 1998 it completed its merger with rival paper maker Enso.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stora Enso has 40,000 employees around the world. It is
listed on the Helsinki and Stockholm exchanges and has market value
of about 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stora seems to have made the right choice. Chile, which now
produces most of the world's copper, has been forced into recession
by low copper prices.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, forest products and paper in particular are ripe
for significant growth, industry analysts said. Pent-up demand from
the recovering economies of Asia and the need to replenish low
inventories in Europe and North America will enable Stora Enso to
boost both prices and supply over the next few years, they said.
</P>
<P>
   There could even be a sudden, sharp surge in demand from
magazines and newspapers that want to mark the millennium with
features, the analysts said.

<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ President Boris Yeltsin is
hospitalized with what doctors say could be pneumonia. By Michael
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSIDENT (Beijing) _ A Chinese political dissident has
been held in a psychiatric hospital for more than seven years,
since he unfurled a protest banner in Tiananmen Square in 1992, his
wife and a human rights group say. The case is an unusual but
alarming example of the misuse of psychiatric facilities by Chinese
authorities to silence a political opponent, human rights advocates
say. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-POVERTY (Stutterheim, South Africa) _ This small town's
struggle to improve the lives of its residents demonstrates the
enormous challenge confronting South Africa's new president, Thabo
Mbeki, as he strives to undo the legacy of apartheid, which
banished millions of blacks to desolate towns lacking
infrastructure and industry. By Rachel L. Swarns.

   SCOTUS-BOYCOTTS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday

foreign policy when it adopted a law requiring state agencies to
boycott companies that do business with the military regime in
Myanmar, formerly Burma. By Linda Greenhouse.

<P>
   (Will move in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-STUMP (Keene, N.H.) _ In place of the stump speech, Al Gore
has discovered the stump meeting. Offering up just himself, Gore
wanders into living rooms with 30 people or into school gymnasiums
with 300. He makes a short introduction and opens up the floor to
all comers. He answers questions for an hour or so, then stays
until the last person drifts away. And after two months of
practice, Gore has these seemingly spontaneous sessions down pat.
But spontaneity has its limits. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

<P>
   PRISON-CALLS (Undated) _ For Ruth Smith, the telephone call from
prison was a way for her cousin to speak with his dying mother. For
Tulen Rivera, the calls from prison are an opportunity for her
three boys to speak with their father. For Ruby Jackson, speaking
by phone with her imprisoned husband was a chance to talk without
having to spend eight hours on an overnight bus. But for New York
state, like most other states, telephone calls from prison are
something else. They are a way to make money. Under current state
policy, the families of inmates are charged the highest possible
rates for calls from prisons, and most of the money is kept by the
state. By John Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-CLUB-DISCRIM (Undated) _ Just weeks after a jury in Boston
found that a suburban country club had systematically discriminated
against a group of women golfers and awarded the women $1.9 million
in damages, the Massachusetts attorney general has asked a judge to
appoint a monitor to take over the country club. The takeover, if
approved, would mark the first time that a court took such direct
control of a private country club. By Marcia Chambers.

   MEDICAL-DEVICES (Undated) _ Thousands of heart specialists
watched on closed-circuit television monitors as a tiny
experimental device was implanted in a patient's coronary artery.
The doctors heard the voice of Dr. Martin Leon, who was describing
the operation taking place in a hospital many miles away. But Leon
was anything but a disinterested observer. What he did not tell the
assembled doctors was that he was an investor in the company that
manufactured the device. He is not the only one to wear many hats
in the world of medical devices. Inventors are researchers.
Researchers are promoters. Promoters are investors. And, finishing
the circle, investors are inventors. It is a phenomenon found in
every medical treatment using devices, from laser surgery to gene
therapy. A special report. By Kurt Eichenwald and Gina Kolata.

CAMPAIGN PRODUCES PASSEL OF BIOS AND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Story moving in ``p'' and ``e'' categories)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The politicians are in overdrive. The pundits are yelling at
each other on all-news channels, and showing no sign of listening
to any ordinary citizen. The public may be driven to distraction by
the time it has to choose next November.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Campaign 2000 is upon us, the earliest and most
front-loaded race for the White House in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign season already has produced a bevy of political
books. Platitudes fill ``A Charge to Keep,'' the ghost-written tome
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. The polls may show W as the
Republican frontrunner, but he loses the autobiography battle to
Sen. John McCain's ``Faith of My Fathers'' by a landslide. A far
more insightful Bush book, ``First Son,'' by Bill Minutaglio of the
Dallas Morning News, was written without W's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   A White House contender who dropped out, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
finally gets the biography he deserves from Adam Clymer of the New
York Times. No person in public life has endured so many awful
books.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's entertaining to see a team of veteran political
writers, Jules Witcover and Jack W. Germond, revitalize themselves.
They've traded in shopworn, post-election insider accounts for
thoughtful, early-season reflections.
</P>
<P>
   In ``No Way to Pick a President'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux,
303 pages, $26), Witcover coolly dissects the sometimes-dangerous
flaws in how America chooses a president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the electoral college system, for instance, three
19th-century presidents lost the popular vote but won the White
House. In the 20th century, haphazard picking of vice-presidential
nominees put the bribe-taking Spiro Agnew and an overmatched Dan
Quayle within a heartbeat of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaigns have become an image-is-everything exercise.
Sound bites and even physical positioning at debates are rehearsed.
Candor becomes controversial and a gaffe can be fatal. The
percentage of eligible voters taking part has steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
   Witcover spends more time finding faults than in spinning
solutions. Still, his is an important book: An election campaign
should fire the imagination and pump new blood through the veins of
democracy. America is falling short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fat Man in a Middle Seat'' (Random House, 262 pages, $25) is
Germond's often-funny, sometimes poignant recollection of 30 years
spent covering presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Washington, D.C., talking heads, Germond can poke
merciless fun at himself. For instance, he was convinced by 1974
that a Democratic governor would win the White House in 1976 _ not
Jimmy Carter, but John Gilligan of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gilligan, however, who toured a state fair with reporters
and was asked if he planned to attend the sheep-shearing contest.
``I don't shear sheep,'' he replied. ``I sheer taxpayers.''
Gilligan became one of the few Democrats to lose in '74.
</P>
<P>
   The best chapter, however, is on how Germond's head was turned
and his wallet filled by participation in ``The McLaughlin Group,''
the weekly panel of capital pundits. Eventually, he become angry at
himself for being part of a verbal food fight. He vividly describes
McLaughlin's egocentric and autocratic behavior, his verbal
abusiveness, and the shameless ``buckraking'' that made Washington,
D.C., journalists take it. Germond didn't. He quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fat Man'' has a central flaw common to political reporters.
Germond is transfixed and enraptured with a campaign of long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The soft spot for a hardboiled Germond is Robert F. Kennedy's
tumultuous, tragic bid for the White House in 1968. Germond is
still full of excuses as to why RFK for months refused to challenge
Lyndon Johnson. He loses no opportunity to denigrate the one
politician who did, Minnesota's quiet, witty Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
He seems to use RFK as a measure of all presidents to follow, and
mischaracterizes the strengths of George Bush (Sr.) and Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Charge to Keep'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co., 288 pages, $23)
bears the junior Bush's byline. In reality, this autobiography was
largely put together by his communications director, Karen Hughes.
The original ghostwriter, a Houston Chronicle scribe, bailed out
complaining that Bush aides had not furnished sufficient material.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is easy to understand. Seeking to bury memories of
a feckless youth _ and heavy drinking that lasted until the age of
40 _ Bush speaks to his love of family and his dog. Spot, too, has
White House lineage as offspring of Barbara Bush's celebrated
spaniel Millie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spot and I spend a lot of quality time together. She loves to
play ball and she has trained me well. Almost every day, we play
fetch,'' Bush informs readers.
</P>
<P>
   The dog aside, this is a bow-wow of a book. Take, for instance,
Bush's account of allegedly running the Texas Rangers as
``managing'' general partner. The book claims he pursued the team
``like a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity,'' in one of the
book's many awkward cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line in baseball is results: wins and losses,'' it
adds. ``It's a people business. ... We succeeded in baseball
because we had a vision and a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The real bottom line is a bit different. The Rangers were
purchased soon after George Bush Sr. was elected president. The
money to buy the team was put up by friends of the Bush family, and
those wanting association with the first family. W invested exactly
$606,000 for 1.8 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush would sell his share for $14.9 million. Not
since Hillary Clinton's $100,000 profit on the commodities market
has a politician done so well with a little help from friends.
</P>
<P>
   W served as a kind of ``roving good will ambassador ... the out
front guy'' while a highly capable general manager actually ran the
Rangers, Minutaglio writes in his detailed, fair but unsparing
biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Son'' (Times Books, 371 pages, $25) covers a lot of
ground. It discusses a clan of vast connections that has supplanted
the Kennedys as the first family of American politics. Bush is the
son of one American president, and the descendant of another on his
mother's side. His paternal great-grandfather was co-founder of
Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   W was the oldest, most combustible of five children, a man who
would become known by friends as the Bombastic Bushkin, a play on
the Johnny Carson character. He skated through Yale without getting
a single ``A,'' having a fine time and oblivious to the civil
rights movement and antiwar tumult of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, W has gone through life as a front man,
using family connections to raise money for business ventures.
Connections are always available, whatever the challenge. W credits
his religious reawakening to a conversation with evangelist Billy
Graham one night at the family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. In
one sense, Bush backers will find ``First Son'' devastating. In
another, however, they stand to be reassured.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor comes across as a man lacking in depth or
attention to detail. He seems somehow far less mature than McCain,
another self-confessed C student and hell-raiser who was forced to
grow up in the hell of the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, George W. Bush exhibits a steel fist within
the velvet glove. W is tough as nails. It was he, not Bush Sr., who
ordered imperious White House chief of staff John Sununu to resign.
He is self-confident and appears to have licked the drinking habit
that once made him challenge George Sr. to a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Minutaglio is a lucid, witty writer. ``First Son'' is also a
primer on Lone Star culture. The author is particularly skilled in
describing the Texas rich, from their deep carpets and fawning
servants to their ruthlessness in preserving privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward M. Kennedy'' (Morrow, 448 pages, 27.50) has a few juicy
personal revelations. Along with brother Jack, the future senator
wears a microphone as he stands before the church altar awaiting
bride Joan Bennett at the couple's 1958 marriage. Watching the film
of her wedding, Joan Kennedy hears JFK tell Ted that being married
doesn't really mean having to be faithful to your wife.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't. But Clymer's book is mainly about the public man.
Whatever his private flaws, Kennedy has emerged as a giant of the
Senate. His causes have ranged from airline deregulation to civil
rights, from community health clinics to AIDS research. He is
treated as a devil figure by Republican fund-raisers, but has found
a succession of conservative Republican collaborators (notably
Orrin Hatch) on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The book revolves around three transformations. A succession of
family tragedies would force a pampered youngest son, while still
in his 30s, into the role of family patriarch. Although heir
apparent to the presidency, he would renounce that role and settle
into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy drinker and womanizer for a quarter-century, Kennedy
would clean up his life in the early 1990s and settle into a happy
second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Eyelids will drop at Clymer's penchant for legislative detail.
But some nuggets are fascinating, such as an angry Hatch putting
down an effort by fellow conservative Jesse Helms to block AIDS
education.
</P>
<P>
   The book comes alive when Kennedy takes to the road, defying
government thugs on a trip to military-ruled Chile, or debunking
the Reagan administration's ``constructive engagement'' in
white-ruled South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has persevered, and managed to preserve what limited
help the federal government offers to mothers and kids, the
disabled and the working poor. The book's message is perhaps summed
up in a quote from the late columnist Murray Kempton as
Massachusetts' senior senator learns about rural poverty on a visit
to Appalachia:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the first Kennedy to be a loser in politics, and he
gives every sign of not anticipating a second chance. He makes his
witness now, not as a candidate, but as a kind of steward; he
travels to call attention not to himself but to the needs of
others.''

 UNDATED: original findings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a sorcerer in this tale of nothingness, it would be
Einstein, who formulated his theory of general relativity in 1915.
That theory successfully describes how gravity warps space and
moves galaxies, stars, planets and other matter around in the
cosmos. But when Einstein applied his theory to the entire
universe, which was thought at the time to be static and
unchanging, he realized that the mutual attraction of all its
galaxies would rapidly cause them to collapse together in a fiery
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   So Einstein theorized in 1917 that some other force must be
holding things apart. He called this theoretical fudge factor ``the
cosmological constant'' and thought of it as a uniform energy
permeating all of space. Because of Einstein's equation describing
the equivalence of mass and energy, E(EQ)mc2, the energy of the
cosmological constant can also be regarded as mass, or weight.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years later, though, Einstein was rethinking his
fudge factor. By then, astronomers had discovered that galaxies
were not static, after all, but were flying apart as a legacy of
what they theorize was the Big Bang explosion, to which most
cosmologists attribute the origin of the universe. Gravity would at
most slow down the expansion and cause a re-collapse hundreds of
billions of years in the future, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The fudge factor was unnecessary; in fact, Einstein renounced it
and called it his ``biggest blunder.'' Though the idea saw sporadic
revivals over the decades, it ended in obscurity. So the discovery
that Einstein might have been right in the first place has left
physicists at a loss. ``Clearly, there is something that
everybody's missing,'' said Wilczek, who happens to live in the
house Einstein once occupied in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The weight problem ``would be No. 1 on my list of things to
figure out,'' said Dr. Edward Witten, a physicist at the Institute
for Advanced Study, who leads the effort using an advanced theory
called string theory to unify what is known about the interactions
of all particles in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   That urgency has led Weinberg and others to a suggestion that
some physicists regard as desperate. He has raised the possibility
that there have been many Big Bang universes, most of which really
do have huge cosmological constants that are incompatible with
life. But by the luck of the draw, a very few would have lighter
vacuums like the one in this universe, and only in such universes
could life, and physicists, exist to ponder the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Weinberg seems convinced that this solution is the
right one. In one of his papers on the topic, he included a poem by
Hughes Mearns that captures the endless frustration that physicists
have faced in calculating the weight of emptiness:
</P>
<P>
   As I was going up the stair
</P>
<P>
   I met a man who wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there again today.
</P>
<P>
   I wish, I wish he'd stay away.

CALCULATING THE WEIGHT OF NOTHINGNESS CALLED SCIENCE'S NO. 1
MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the sorcerer's apprentice, who could not banish the spirits
that his spells had conjured up, astronomers around the world have
been trying _ with increasing desperation _ to disprove an
astonishing discovery announced early last year: Distant galaxies
are being swept apart, ever faster, by a tide formed of apparently
empty space.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have long known that the universe is
expanding, they had assumed that the expansion was gradually
slowing because of the gravitational attractions of the galaxies.
Instead, scientists announced last year, some antigravity effect
seemed to be accelerating the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was such a challenge to conventional theories that
most scientists assumed they would quickly discredit the theory.
But almost two years of effort to do so has yielded observational
data that only support the conclusion. Last month, a subtle but
initially promising objection to the measurements of the
accelerating expansion by one group of astronomers was disproved by
a new analysis of that data.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, a different team of astronomers reported its
observations of ripples in the gases of the young universe, before
stars and galaxies had even formed. Though the observations
supported a favored theory of how the universe began, they also
provided fresh new evidence of the distressing finding that
something in the wastelands of space could be pushing against
gravity. So scientists are reluctantly accepting the notion that
something in the most fundamental theories of physics is terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To explain their observations, scientists say, they must answer
a question that sounds paradoxical: How much does emptiness weigh?
</P>
<P>
   Although the answer has eluded scientists since Einstein first
raised the question more than 70 years ago, physicists are
comfortable with the idea that a seemingly perfect vacuum could
weigh something. According to the theory of elementary particle
physics, even a vacuum is filled with fields containing energy and
evanescent particles that flit in and out of existence, adding heft
to nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Einstein, this ``funny energy,'' as cosmologists
have sometimes called it, would be so different from ordinary
matter and energy that it would have the opposite gravitational
effect, producing repulsion instead of attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But when physicists try to use conventional theories to
calculate how much energy should repose in emptiness, the result is
a vacuum so monstrously heavy that it would blow the universe
apart. Galaxies, stars, planets and life could never have formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest embarrassment in theoretical physics,''
Dr. Michael Turner, an astrophysicist and cosmologist at the
University of Chicago, said of the weight problem. ``Every attempt
to calculate it has gotten an absurd answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Wilczek, a particle physicist at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., called the nothingness problem
``maybe the most fundamentally mysterious thing in basic science.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeff Harvey, a physicist at the University of Chicago, said,
``Basically, people don't have a clue as to how to solve this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists have gone so far as to wash their hands of the
search for a solution, suggesting simply that all of the calculated
weight of a vacuum is the product of imperfect theories and that
some other strange inhabitant of empty space could be pushing the
galaxies apart. They call this shifting, flowing form of energy
quintessence.
</P>
<P>
   Though any weight of the vacuum should stay the same over cosmic
time, accelerating the expansion with a steady nudge, quintessence
could push more strongly at some times, more weakly at others.
Because the key to those changes may lie in the properties of
matter and space as they exist at energies that are unattainable on
earth, the universe would become in effect a giant physics
experiment, said Dr. Andreas J. Albrecht, a physicist at the
University of California in Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessence or no quintessence, until the weight problem is
solved, physicists are forced to concede that they do not have a
fully working theory of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, not only for cosmology but for elementary particle
theory, this is the bone in our throat,'' said Dr. Steven Weinberg,
a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Texas,
who shared a Nobel Prize in 1979 for his work in theories of
elementary particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the difficulties presented by the observations that
distant galaxies are flying apart faster and faster, those
observations have actually helped to solidify other cosmic
theories, especially one that predicts the amount of matter and
energy in the universe and explains how it formed large structures.
That makes the observations impossible to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   The provoking measurements were first reported last year by two
teams of astronomers, one led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and one by Dr. Brian Schmidt of the
Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The
astronomers used the unexpected dimness of exploding stars in
far-off galaxies, the dimness indicating their unexpectedly great
distance, to show that the cosmic expansion discovered decades
earlier has been speeding up over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most astronomers, it was a very uncomfortable, unsettling
thing,'' said Dr. Robert Kirshner, a member of Schmidt's group at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the new observations of cosmic acceleration were so
unsettling, said Albrecht of the University of California, that ``a
reasonable position for someone to take is that the observations
are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So astronomers have done everything they can to find a flaw. But
since the first announcements, dozens of new observations have
offered nothing but support.
</P>
<P>
   Now Perlmutter has proposed a satellite that would observe
thousands of exploding stars a year to make even more stringent
tests of the original findings.

PERSONAL HEALTH: YESTERDAY'S PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY IS THE NORM TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend who runs the child care program at a Brooklyn high
school reports that one of the newly enrolled mothers, a freshman,
is 13. Her baby's father is 14. While children having children is
not a new phenomenon, the ever-dropping age of puberty is.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents become worried when their 7- or 8-year-old
daughters begin to develop breasts or grow pubic hair. They wonder,
is this normal? Will the surge of sex hormones adversely affect the
girls' behavior, moods or physical growth? Can girls who are still
emotionally and socially immature adjust well to early physical
maturation? And when should more explicit sex education and
cautions about birth control begin?
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dr. Marcia E. Herman-Giddens and colleagues
described the results of physical examinations of 17,077 American
girls, which revealed that white girls were showing bodily signs of
sexual maturity an average of one year earlier than previous
studies had indicated, and black girls two years earlier. On the
average, breast development was notable before age 10 in white
girls and before age 9 in black girls, and the growth of pubic hair
generally occurred about a year later. But even at age 7, 27
percent of black girls and nearly 7 percent of white girls had
begun to grow breasts, pubic hair or both.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, she and others suggest, should prompt a
redefinition of the ages at which puberty is considered precocious.
Current medical textbooks state that just 1 percent of girls
younger than 8 show signs of puberty. In a new review of existing
data, in the Oct. 4 issue of the journal Pediatrics, Dr. Paul B.
Kaplowitz, Dr. Sharon E. Oberfield and members of the Lawson
Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, concluded that ``the onset of
breast development between 7 and 8 years of age in white girls and
between 6 and 8 years in African-American girls may be part of the
normal broad variation in the timing of puberty and not, in most
cases, a pathological state.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast development is stimulated by estrogen, which is released
from the ovaries upon a hormonal signal from the pituitary gland.
The growth of pubic hair, however, is a result of stimulation by
androgen, the so-called male sex hormone, also produced by the
ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation about why earlier maturation may
be occurring in girls, especially because there has been no
apparent advance (and no racial difference) in the onset of puberty
in boys. For girls, better nutrition over all and fewer infectious
diseases no doubt play a role, because these trends result in more
consistent growth. The increase in childhood obesity may also be a
factor, because fatty tissue is a source of the sex hormone
estrogen. Another suggested possibility is increased exposure to
certain plastics and insecticides that degrade into substances that
have estrogenlike effects.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the reasons, the phenomenon is real and, to many
parents, worrisome. The new report by Kaplowitz of the Medical
College of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, Dr.
Oberfield of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons
and members of the endocrine society should prove reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of adolescent girls know all too well that life can be
an emotional roller coaster, with unpredictable outbursts of temper
and outrageous or infuriating behavior. Indeed, precocious puberty
has been associated with behavioral problems. In one study of 33
early-maturing girls, as a group, they appeared to be more
depressed, socially withdrawn, aggressive and moody than a
comparable group of girls who had not yet entered puberty. But
another study that followed girls with precocious puberty to age
17{ found that they suffered no lasting psychological effects,
except a tendency toward excessive psychosomatic complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Although girls undergoing early sexual maturation may be far
from their teenage years, parents would probably do well to read up
on how to cope with an adolescent and what is considered the range
of normal behavior for this often volatile time of life.
</P>
<P>
   Another common concern involves the ability of girls as young as
7 or 8 to cope with menstruation. Kaplowitz and his colleagues
point out that a 7-year-old who is developing breasts will not
undergo the start of menstrual cycles, or menarche, for another two
years. That time gap should give parents and pediatricians enough
time to prepare. Also, once a girl starts menstruating, she is
potentially able to become pregnant and needs explicit sex
education. Adults who wait too long end up with pregnant
13-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
   But the main concern for pediatricians and for some parents is
the effect that hormones might have on the child's growth. Estrogen
is known to cause the growth plates in long bones to close, which
can slow or shut down linear growth. Concerned parents and
pediatricians sometimes wonder whether early-maturing girls should
be given a hormone that blocks the pituitary stimulus of the
ovaries and would presumably allow such girls to grow taller.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the new evidence is most reassuring. Kaplowitz and his
co-authors point out that ``the younger the age at onset of
puberty, the longer the duration of puberty,'' meaning that the
adolescent growth spurt occurs for a longer time in early-maturing
girls. This in part offsets the loss of adult height that might
occur when the skeleton matures earlier. Indeed, girls who undergo
early menarche tend to grow somewhat more than girls whose menarche
occurs later. The end result is little if any difference in adult
height.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the authors state, the concern that girls who enter
puberty ``between 6 and 8 years of age will become very short
adults without intervention is overstated, because adult height
within the normal range is reached in the majority of cases.'' Only
if the onset of puberty occurs before age 6 has hormonal therapy
been shown to make a meaningful difference in a girl's height.
</P>
<P>
   Who should undergo evaluation for early puberty? The authors
recommend that white girls younger than 7 and black girls younger
than 6 who show breast or pubic hair development should be examined
to be sure they have no disorder that involves an excess production
of hormones that could distort their development. Too much
androgen, for example, would cause masculinization and could result
in infertility. Girls who have any of the following conditions
should be fully evaluated:
</P>
<P>
   _An unusually rapid progression of puberty that would cause
rapid skeletal maturation and a predicted height four inches less
than their genes might dictate or less than 4 feet 11 inches.
</P>
<P>
   _The presence of any newly developed problem involving the
central nervous system, including headaches, seizures or
neurological deficits.
</P>
<P>
   _Behaviors suggesting that the girl's emotional state, or the
family's emotional state, is being adversely affected by the
progression of puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the authors say, parents of boys would be wise to seek
medical evaluation if evidence of excessive androgen production
(other than the growth of pubic hair) occurs before age 9. Such
signs might include enlargement of the penis and scrotum, acne and
very rapid growth. Boys who mature too rapidly, the authors say,
often have a central nervous system disorder.

   SIDE EFFECTS: Hold the Phone, Save the Brain
</P>
<P>
   Cradling the phone between the neck and shoulder is certainly
not good for the neck. But for one French psychiatrist it was bad
for his brain, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the psychiatrist, 43, talked that way for an hour, he lost
the vision in his left eye and had difficulty speaking, according
to a case report in the journal Neurology. A brain scan showed that
pressure from a bone called the styloid process, which runs behind
the jaw, had caused a tear in the artery that supplies blood to the
brain, disrupting the flow.

   THERAPIES: Sweating Away Pain of Juvenile Arthritis
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile arthritis often relegates its sufferers to the
sidelines. But a University of Buffalo study of weight training has
found that a carefully designed exercise program significantly
reduces pain and increases ability to function.
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented this month at a meeting in Boston of the
American College of Rheumatology and the Association of
Rheumatology Health Professionals, compared six patients with
juvenile arthritis who received eight weeks of resistance training
with five who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The children who exercised used 25 percent less pain medication
and increased their overall physical capacity by 32 percent, while
the sedentary sufferers increased their use of painkillers. Blood
tests also found an improvement in the chemicals that regulate
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While adults with arthritis are often told that careful
exercise can improve their condition, children are often told to
skip phys ed or cut back,'' said the author of the study, Dr.
Nadine Fisher, an assistant professor of occupational therapy and
rehabilitation medicine at the University of Buffalo. ``Showing
that exercise actually helps with juvenile arthritis gives parents
and children ways to manage the symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: On the Trail of a Gene for Stuttering
</P>
<P>
   A study comparing identical and fraternal twins in Australia
found evidence that stuttering and its severity may have a genetic
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented last week at a convention of the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association in San Francisco, found that
inherited traits seemed to play a much stronger role in stuttering
than environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a database of 6,717 subjects compiled by the
Australian Twin Project, a team led by Dr. Susan Felsenfeld, a
professor of speech pathology at Duquense University in Pittsburgh,
found 407 who reported stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing the stutterers and their twins, the
researchers found that both identical twins were more than three
times as likely as fraternal twins to be stutterers.
</P>
<P>
   While this finding was similar to an earlier survey, data from
the interviews were used to rank stutterers in terms of severity
and emotional distress related to the condition. Again, researchers
found a greater concordance on these measures among identical than
fraternal twins.
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, researchers presented the results of a
series of brain scans given to stutterers before and after
intensive retraining in speech fluency.
</P>
<P>
   Before treatment, the scans showed higher than normal activity
in areas of the brain's right hemisphere, which organizes the
muscles used in conscious movements, said Dr. Luc F. De Nil of the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, speech is automatic, he said, ``but it appears
that stutterers lack that automaticity.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, De Nil said, the ``overall levels of activation
were more like that of normal speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rx MONEY A Lower Risk and a Much Higher Cost
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex and Vioxx are two of the hottest drugs on the market,
in large part because of their potential for reducing pain and
inflammation without the risk of gastric harm associated with
medicines like ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin. But a pair of new
studies has led The Journal of the American Medical Association to
conclude that while those risks are indeed lowered, they are not
lowered enough to justify the extra cost of prescribing them for
most people.
</P>
<P>
   Painkillers like ibuprofen, known as nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, work by suppressing a chemical called the
COX enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   But the two new drugs work more precisely, blocking only the
form of the enzyme known as COX-2, associated with inflammation,
while bypassing COX-1, which plays a role in the normal functioning
of the digestive tract and kidneys. Its developers hoped that as a
result the so-called COX-2 inhibitors would not promote the gastric
discomfort and ulcers that are the most serious side effects of the
older drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In one of two articles in last week's issue of the journal,
Harvard Medical School researchers gave 1,149 arthritis patients
Celebrex, naproxen or a placebo. The drugs were equally effective
in reducing symptoms, and 5 percent fewer patients receiving
Celebrex reported gastric discomfort. Only one patient, who was
receiving naproxen, developed an ulcer during the 10-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the other article, researchers from the University of
Birmingham in England analyzed studies involving 5,435 patients and
found that Celebrex reduced the risk of ulcer by up to 80 percent
and Vioxx by 49 percent. But the older drugs were not producing all
that many ulcers among patients at low risk for gastric bleeding,
the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Walter L. Peterson of the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, wrote
that the studies indicated that more than 500 low-risk patients
would have to be treated with a COX-2 inhibitor to prevent one
ulcer caused by taking a traditional painkiller.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new drugs, still under patent protection, cost more,
Peterson calculated the yearly cost of preventing one ulcer at
almost $400,000, a figure he said indicated that low-risk patients
should stick to the older drugs.
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: When Guns Spell Danger for the Owner
</P>
<P>
   People who buy handguns are more likely to kill themselves than
people who do not, even up to six years after the purchase, and
women who buy guns are doubling their risk of becoming murder
victims, concluded a study published Nov. 18 in The New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, Dr. Garen Wintemute, an epidemiologist
at the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of
California at Davis, said the suicide statistics merely reflected,
to an extent, the fact that some people who intended to kill
themselves bought handguns to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, the risk of suicide peaked in the first week of gun
ownership, when the rate was more than 50 times higher than
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``But only a relatively small number fit that pattern,''
Wintemute said. Suicides during the first month after purchase
accounted for only 14 percent of gun suicides by men and 25 percent
of gun suicides by women. Most of the time, he said, a gun
``becomes a danger down the road'' when depression or other
stresses arise.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared mortality rates for the 238,292 people who
legally bought handguns in California in 1991 with the rates for
the state's population at large.
</P>
<P>
   Over six years, the likelihood of suicide was 15 times as high
for women who bought pistols as for women who did not and 3 times
as high for men who bought guns as for men who did not.
</P>
<P>
   While the main focus of the study was suicide, homicide was also
examined. Wintemute said the murder rate was slightly lower than
average for men who bought handguns, but twice as high for women.
``It may be that women purchase handguns for protection against
violence from an intimate partner and that these handguns are used
by the partners against them,'' he said.

   Danger: Road Dust
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is the impact that automobiles have on air
quality, the focus is usually on what's coming out of the tailpipe.
But researchers from the California Institute of Technology have
looked at another effect that cars have on the air: the dust they
kick up.
</P>
<P>
   Their analysis is bad news for those who suffer from allergies.
The dust raised by passing traffic on paved roads contains up to 20
known allergens, including molds, pollen and animal dander.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Environmental Science
and Technology, noted that the problem is worse in places with
roadside vegetation, like residential and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In two residential parts of Los Angeles, they said, road dust
contributed 5 percent to 12 percent of the allergens in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the concrete of downtown Los Angeles, however, road
dust was responsible for less than 1 percent of the airborne
allergens.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-Food Snakes
</P>
<P>
   Snakes are not dainty eaters. Most open their jaws wide and use
their upper teeth to ratchet themselves over and around their prey,
gobbling it whole.
</P>
<P>
   It may not seem possible, but two University of Massachusetts
researchers have discovered a snake with even worse table manners.
Like a teenager in a hurry to finish dinner, it shovels food into
its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Called the threadsnake, it is a burrowing creature, often less
than five inches long and an inch in diameter, and found in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Its lower jaw has a unique structure, with three joints on each
side. When the threadsnake eats (its usual food is the larvae and
pupae of ants and other social insects), the front, teeth-bearing
parts of the jaw move inward and outward, like a pair of swinging
doors. The food is quickly raked into the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who wrote about their discovery in the journal
Nature, noted that this feeding technique may be related to the
snake's hazardous foraging strategy.
</P>
<P>
   To feed on ant larvae, for example, the threadsnake must invade
the nest, which is aggressively defended by worker ants that can
injure or even kill the snake.
</P>
<P>
   So threadsnakes may have evolved their fast-feeding ability in
order to be able to eat and run _ for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Telescope Back at Work
</P>
<P>
   The Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory in West
Texas, which has the largest mirror in the world, has begun regular
operations after a two-year shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope, which is being operated by a consortium of three
American and two German universities, will be used for
spectroscopy, or analyzing the spectrum of light emitted by
objects, and is particularly suited to large-scale surveys and to
the study of phenomena that vary over time, like supernovas.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the telescope has more in common with the radio
telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico than with most light
telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Arecibo instrument, which is a fixed bowl in the earth,
the Texas mirror is fixed in elevation, the angle at which it faces
the sky. (Unlike the Arecibo bowl, however, the mirror can be
rotated: it is on the equivalent of a lazy susan.)
</P>
<P>
   A typical telescope tracks an object by moving its mirror as the
Earth rotates.
</P>
<P>
   With the Texas telescope, an object is tracked not by moving the
mirror but by moving a platform that is suspended over it,
constantly keeping the light from the object in focus.
</P>
<P>
   This reduces the size of the mirror that can be accessible at
any one time to 362 inches from its as-built 433 inches, making it
effectively the third-largest mirror in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But having a fixed mirror also made the instrument far less
expensive than other large telescopes.

<P>
   After not having touched a basketball for nearly half a century,
63-year-old Aldona Siuta of Avon, Conn., decided last year that it
was time to fulfill her hoop dreams: she laced up a pair of high
tops and threw herself into a twice-weekly women's over-50 pick-up
game she had read about in her local paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't played basketball since high school, but as soon as I
heard the ball bouncing, those 40-some years went out the window,''
said Ms. Siuta, who works part time as an actuarial analyst and has
seven grandchildren. She also plays soccer against women her age on
a team called _ what else? _ Still Kicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell people that I play soccer and basketball, they
look at me with complete disbelief,'' she said. ``But at this age,
getting out there and doing something is better than sitting
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Siuta, more and more people over 50 are realizing that
the benefits of team sports competition do not have to end with the
arrival of gray hair and stiff knees. Today's aging athletes are
healthier than their predecessors, living longer and pointedly
aware of the importance of getting and staying in shape. They are
forming pickup teams, creating senior divisions in sports leagues
and competing in large-scale events in gyms and on playing fields
across the country, a kind of senior varsity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior team sports is an established trend and here to stay,''
said Mike May, director of communications for the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association, based in North Palm Beach, Fla. This
trade group, which keeps track of Americans' participation in
sports, estimated that more than twice as many people 55 and older
frequently took part in basketball and slow-pitch softball in 1998
as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Stewart, executive director of the Fifty-Plus Fitness
Association, a nonprofit organization in Stanford, Calif., says the
increase in team sports participation is part of an overall surge
in fitness activities among people over 50. This trend, he said, is
fueled by the millions of baby boomers turning 50 every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers have always been active and they want to continue
to stay in shape as they get older,'' he said. ``They know that
exercise contributes to healthy aging, and team sports allow them
to stay motivated to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Butterfield, a 53-year-old database manager born at the
front end of the baby boom, started playing soccer after cheering
for her children from the sidelines. She now competes indoors and
outdoors several times a week with other women close to her age,
near her home in Dartmouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of watching the kids and decided I wanted to do
something for myself,'' she said. ``Soccer is important to me
because I have a sit-down job, and it's the only exercise I get.
But the camaraderie of the group, the friends I've made from
soccer, is really the best benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in search of higher-level competition have flooded the
National Senior Games-Senior Olympics, an annual multisport event
for athletes 50 and older. The games began 14 years ago with 2,500
participants; last month's event in Orlando drew 12,000. Similarly,
the Senior Softball World Series, for players over 50, has
ballooned to 122 teams from 68 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Don Berg, the 78-year-old pitcher for the San Diego Silver
Hawks, has competed in 11 Senior World Series tournaments and has
eight championship rings. ``When I play in the big games, I get my
adrenaline up,'' said Berg, a retired physical education teacher
who plays softball three or four times a week. ``Out on the field I
feel like I'm in high school again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some older athletes play almost as well as they did in their
glory days. Earl Hitt, 72, plays on several volleyball teams in the
St. Louis area, including one that competes against 20- and
30-year-olds in an open league. His team has four members in their
70s and several others in their 60s. ``You can see the look on the
other team's faces when us old guys walk out onto the court,'' he
said. ``Those are the guys that are the most fun to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are in it strictly for a good time. Bobbie Emery, the
Still Kicking coach, loves to see the joy on the faces of her team,
including her mother, who just turned 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd expect women their age to be dignified,'' Ms. Emery
said. ``But all of them are beginners and some never even had a gym
class. It's great to see them get out there, running and falling
and making fools of themselves just for the fun of it.''

   The Species Census
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many living species are there? What is the breakdown of
plants, vertebrates, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   A. The latest estimate done for the Hall of Biodiversity at the
American Museum of Natural History is 10 million to 13 million
living species, said Dr. Niles Eldridge, curator of the museum's
division of paleontology.
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 study done by Dr. Robert M. May and published in the
journal Science said only about 1.5 million species then had
scientific names, though far more certainly exist. He pointed out
that ``total'' figures are not actual counts, but theoretical
reckonings based on things like the number of species that make up
typical food chains in different climates. Some groups, like
mammals, have been intensively studied, and others, like mites, are
little known. A big problem is defining a species, May said: some
biologists discern 200 kinds of British blackberry; others might
list 20, or 2 or 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two kingdoms, the prokaryotic monerans and the eukaryotic
protists (two kinds of microscopic unicellular organisms), make up
about 5 percent of recorded living species; the kingdoms of
funguses and plants make up about 22 percent; the rest are animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward O. Wilson included a breakdown of the animal kingdom
in his book ``The Diversity of Life'' (Norton, 1992). In this
estimate, well over half the total species are insects; mammals
make up 0.388 percent of the total, and other chordates (animals
with at last a precursor of a spinal cord) are just over 3.7
percent.

KID ROCK PARTIES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If you must embrace the currently hot rap-metal
genre, you could do a lot worse than Kid Rock, suburban Detroit's
answer to Iceberg Slim.
</P>
<P>
   The self-effacing former Bob Ritchie was firing on all cylinders
Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, the first of two sold-out
dates at the barnlike venue, which boasts one of the most thorough
security frisks outside of the Tel Aviv international airport.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute set had an air of celebration, since after 10
years of trying, the high-energy rap-rocker had finally gone
platinum with his ``Devil Without a Cause'' album, a chart staple
for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid, touring with his solid Twisted Brown Trucker Band (but
minus sidekick Joe C., the foul-mouthed midget who helped make Kid
Rock a favorite at Woodstock '99 and the MTV Video Music Awards),
hit the stage to the ``S.W.A.T.'' theme, charging into his radio
smash ``Bawitdaba.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palladium floor was instantly transformed into a seething
mosh pit, forcing the Kid to make several announcements urging the
unusually varied crowd to remain cool.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in wide-brimmed fedora, shiny red pants and tank-top
T-shirt, the 28-year-old prowled the stage with his hand-held
microphone, delivering the album tracks ``Cowboy'' and ``I Am the
Bullgod,'' pausing only to strap on a guitar for a couple of the
record's ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by hard-working drummer Stefanie Eulinberg, the group
threw in tightly played riffs from '70s arena-rock standards
including ``We're an American Band,'' ``La Grange,'' ``Back in
Black'' and ``Fortunate Son,'' confirming that this Kid was equally
influenced by FM radio rock and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the night's loose party atmosphere was the act's
guitar tech, who could be observed at the side of the stage mixing
drinks when he wasn't keeping track of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see that on stage at a Sting concert. &QL;

 By RANDI HUTTER EPSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legend has it that Albert Einstein did not say much as a
toddler, making his mother and father worry that he might never be
very bright. His supposed failure to master language early has
reassured parents of late talkers ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most pediatricians have been similarly
reassuring. Let young children learn to speak at their own pace,
they told parents. Don't even consider speech therapy, at least
until school age.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is changing. Today, parents are generally told to look
for signs of delay early, even in a baby's first year, and seek
help. No one should assume that a silent 2-year-old is a budding
genius; silence may be a sign of hearing loss or a neurological
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The new advice is based in part on studies showing that children
with speech impairments are more likely to have reading and social
problems later. Working with very young children, with malleable
brain connections, may rewire defective connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know the earlier the intervention, the better the brain
can reorganize,'' said Dr. Diane Paul-Brown, director of clinical
issues in speech-language pathology for the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, neuroscientists are using advanced new tools
to look into the inner workings of the brains of infants and
toddlers, hoping to gain insight into the biological basis of
language.
</P>
<P>
   The results, still very preliminary, do not offer any quick
fixes. But they demonstrate that a person's ability to understand
and say words begins in the first few months of life, and experts
say they provide even stronger evidence that efforts to correct
speech defects should begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this past decade, we have learned a tremendous amount about
how much learning goes on in this early period, and language is a
great example,'' said Dr. Patricia Kuhl, a professor of speech and
hearing sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. ``It
used to be that we didn't think anything was going on up there
until there was evidence language had begun. Now we know that while
babies are quiet, there is a tremendous amount going on in the
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Speech therapists and neuroscientists are delighted with the
flurry of studies, but the option of early intervention has left
many parents of young children in a quandary: how does one
distinguish normal speech development, with all of its
age-appropriate blunders, from a language defect that warrants
medical attention?
</P>
<P>
   While it is easy to spot a language problem in, say, a
9-year-old, detecting one in a toddler who is just beginning to
experiment with words is much trickier. It is a rare 2- or
3-year-old who is completely comprehensible. Lisping, stuttering,
slurring long words _ all are normal.
</P>
<P>
   For toddlers, communication is far more important than
articulation, said Dr. Michael Cunningham, a pediatric
otolaryngologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in
Boston. Parents should not expect a toddler to pronounce every
sound correctly, but should concentrate on diction and the melody
of speech: does a question, for example, sound like a question?
</P>
<P>
   At this age, he and other doctors said, many sounds are
difficult and mispronunciation is to be expected. Compared with the
``m'' sound, made by simply closing the mouth, for instance, the
``r'' requires lifting the tongue, pulling it to the back of the
mouth and tightening the lips. Double consonants are another tricky
maneuver. ``If you came to me and said your child cannot say `st'
and he was 3, 4 or even 5 years old, I would not be concerned,''
Paul-Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Many toddlers stutter simply because the brain is working faster
than the mouth muscles, not because they have a chronic problem.
``You should worry if there is stuttering in the family, or if you
see secondary characteristics, such as eye blinks or hand flicks as
if the child is trying to push away the stutter,'' said Debra
Hagen, a speech pathologist in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For most children, the powers of language blossom somewhere
between 18 months and 2 years, with an outpouring of words flowing
together in a crude grammar. Children know an average of about 50
words at this stage. ``Something happens in the brain that enables
children to grasp a sense of grammar,'' said Dr. Rebecca Landa, a
speech pathologist and associate professor of psychiatry at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. ``For instance, most
2-year-olds will say throw ball, not ball throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins are particularly interesting because they tend to speak
later than singletons. Dr. Elizabeth Bryan, a British pediatrician
who is president of the International Society of Twin Studies, says
the delay is probably environmental, not genetic. Children born
prematurely often reach milestones later than those born full term,
and many twins are premature.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bryan notes that parents of twins and other multiple-birth
children tend to focus their gaze somewhere between the children,
inadvertently withholding eye contact, which can be crucial in the
development of speech. And twins, she added, tend to have the worst
language teachers: they talk to each other. ``Their main model for
language,'' she said, ``is someone who talks as badly as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The new approach to language research relies not so much on such
behavioral factors as on brain imaging technology. The studies,
which are beginning to localize regions where language defects
occur, do not provide clues to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists hope the information may provide a way to detect
language defects early, ultimately allowing speech therapists to
focus on those at high risk, perhaps even before their first words
are uttered.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at the
Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York, scientists
are using magnetic resonance imaging to scan brain patterns in 6-
and 7-year-olds as they stare at video screens with flashing words.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies of adults, scientists have found that brain
patterns among dyslexics are different from those of normal
readers. ``But it is very important to study children, right about
the time reading difficulties begin to appear,'' said Dr. Bruce
McCandliss, an assistant professor of psychology at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results suggest that reading intervention programs
may change the patterns of brain activation in children at risk for
dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   McCandliss' team and others are also using shower-cap-like
devices that measure the electricity firing from the brain as
children think about words or say them. ``Mapping the pattern of
electricity as someone reads a word enables us to record hundreds
of signals from the brain within a second,'' McCandliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from another Sackler Institute study suggest
that the brain has distinct regions for every aspect of the ability
to understand a word. There is one region for recognizing a word's
sound, for instance, and another for recognizing the meaning of
that sound. The findings, reported by a team led by Dr. Michael
Posner, director of the institute, were published in February in
the journal NeuroReport.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are trying to spot the very beginnings of
language in a young child. Dr. Kuhl of the University of Washington
found that even before children were 1, they were already beginning
to categorize sounds, a crucial step toward learning a language.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, Dr. Kuhl compared the ability of 30 American and
Japanese babies to distinguish between the ``r'' and ``l'' sounds.
(Previous studies have shown that Japanese adults cannot hear the
difference between the two.) She found that at 6 months, babies
from both countries scored the same: about 64 percent of the time
they distinguished between the two sounds.
</P>
<P>
   But between 10 and 12 months, the American babies' scores rose
to 84 percent while the Japanese babies' dropped a bit, to 59
percent. Even at age 1, Dr. Kuhl said, the Japanese babies were
developing a code for their language that did not require two
categories for ``r'' and ``l.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these insights, assessing a toddler still depends on
traditional methods like having a speech pathologist evaluate a
child's ability to understand and communicate at an age-appropriate
level. Though parents can be guided by certain milestones, like the
50 words for 2-year-olds, any parent who is worried should consult
a speech pathologist, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And the experts add that a critical ingredient of early
assessment is not speech at all, but hearing. ``If you have a kid
with chronic ear infections, they may not pick up every sound, and
then language development will be off,'' said Dr. Debra E. Seltzer,
director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Babies and
Children's Hospital of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people didn't appreciate the encoding of language
that happens from the age of 6 months,'' Dr. Seltzer said. ``If
there is something intervening, like ear infections, they will not
hear subtle sounds and the messages will not be carried to the
brain properly.''

ROBOTIC ADVENTURER AIMS FOR MARS' SOUTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ariz.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a century after explorers made their first heroic
assault on the poles of Earth, an American spacecraft is racing
toward Mars and the first landing in the polar region of another
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The robotic Mars Polar Lander is being aimed for a landing on
Friday on the vast terraces of ice and dust a few hundred miles
from the planet's south pole. Spring is turning to summer there,
the season of constant sunlight, which the craft will draw on for
energy to power its computer and transmitter and array of cameras,
sensors, digging arm and ovens for heating and analyzing soil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, if all goes well, the craft will
prospect the frigid landscape for water and investigate the thin
air above, the surface and the underground or clues to the planet's
climate history.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken by previous craft reveal the polar terrain to
be layered with the residue of dust and ice, each layer of varying
thicknesses reflecting past weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million mission will thus be seeking answers to the two
most important scientific questions about Mars: where is the water
and was the planet significantly warmer and wetter in its early
history, as suggested by abundant evidence of surface erosion?
</P>
<P>
   These questions strike at the heart of the larger question of
whether life in some form could ever have arisen on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first in a series of missions that will
explore on the surface different parts of the planet, particularly
looking for water,'' said Dr. David Paige, a scientist at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``We know there's water in
the atmosphere. We don't know where else there's water on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission scientists liken their strategy for exploring the
layered polar terrain to the reading of tree rings or ice cores in
learning about Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of settling gently onto the surface, about 500
miles from the pole, the lander is to flex its 6.5-foot mechanical
arm and begin digging a trench about 20 inches deep. In winter,
carbon dioxide frost would probably be covering the site. Now the
surface will probably be fine dust, left by wind storms that
frequently blow over the planet. A tiny camera mounted on the arm
will take color pictures of the soil and trench walls.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is water vapor in the atmosphere, scientists expect
to find some water ice in the soil. The mechanical arm is to scoop
up soil samples and place them in ovens for analysis by instruments
designed by the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The electric ovens will heat the samples to see what gases are
released. By measuring the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide
gas, scientists will be able to determine the amount of ice beneath
the surface, as well as minerals that may have formed when Mars had
a warmer climate. Eight samples are expected to be examined during
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we know about life says that water is an essential
part of it,'' said Dr. William V. Boynton, a University of Arizona
planetary scientist who developed the instruments for testing the
soil. ``If Mars was always as dry as it appears now to be, then
it's not very likely life could have ever gotten started. But if
there really were oceans on Mars at one time, that's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The craft is also carrying two probes, each the size of a
basketball, for penetrating even deeper, perhaps more than three
feet. It is supposed to release the probes just before entering the
Mars atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The probes are to slam into Mars at 400 miles an hour, hitting
30 to 35 miles away about a minute ahead of the spacecraft's. Each
impact should drive a five-inch-long penetrator into the ground,
where instruments are to heat soil to look for water vapor from any
buried ice.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the first explorers to reach Earth's South Pole, the
two probes have been named Amundsen and Scott. The Norwegian Roald
Amundsen led the first successful expedition to the South Pole,
reaching it on Dec. 14, 1911. Robert Falcon Scott, an Englishman,
arrived with his team a month later, beaten in their quest and the
entire team destined to die on their return trip.
</P>
<P>
   The lander's other scientific instruments include a
multispectral, stereoscopic camera for observing the landscape; a
meteorology package for measuring air temperature, winds, pressure
and humidity, and a light detection and radar system, called lidar,
that emits laser light to detect clouds and hazes.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the Russian-designed lidar is a small microphone
supplied by the Planetary Society, a group advocating space
exploration. The microphone will be used to try to make the first
recordings of sounds on the surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an effort to bring all human senses to bear on the Red
Planet,'' Paige of UCLA said. ``We have already brought sight and
touch to Mars, almost taste if you consider our analytical
experiments with soil samples.''
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the lander will be the fourth spacecraft to
operate on the planet's surface. Two Viking spacecraft landed there
in 1976, and Mars Pathfinder, with its tiny roving vehicle
Sojourner, explored mid-latitude geology in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Haynes, director of systems management at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said the spacecraft was
in ``excellent condition and behaving exactly the way we designed
it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the laboratory, which directs the mission for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have spent weeks
reviewing all navigation instructions that have been transmitted to
the lander to avoid a repetition of the embarrassing mistake that
doomed its traveling companion, the Mars Climate Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   A mixup between English and metric units in navigation data sent
the spacecraft off course, and probably to its destruction, as it
was attempting to orbit Mars in September. All radio contact with
the craft was lost.
</P>
<P>
   As originally planned, the Climate Orbiter was to act as a
communications relay station for the lander. The lander's own radio
can transmit directly to Earth, but is too weak to handle the full
data load.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loss but not a crippling one for the lander's
mission,'' Paige said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, another orbiting craft, Mars Global Surveyor, has
been circling the planet on a mapping mission since 1997 and will
be relied on as the lander's main link in communicating its
discoveries in the southern polar region of Mars.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September, the one-two punch of Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd
dropped some three feet of rain on the eastern third of North
Carolina, turning the region into a putrescent hell of polluted
flood waters, decomposing chickens and hogs, rotting farm fields
and ruined neighborhoods. Never before in the recorded history of
the region, experts say, had there been such a big and disastrous
flood.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists fear the flood has also created an ecological
time bomb that could bring disaster of a different sort, and they
fear for the biologically rich waters that separate the famous
Outer Banks from the Carolina mainland. This complex of sounds,
bays and inlets comprises the second largest estuary in the
country, after the Chesapeake Bay, and is one of the nation's most
important incubators of marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have ecologists confronted such a striking example of
what can happen when a first-order natural disturbance is combined
with a first-order disturbance of the natural world by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you there have been floods like this in the
past,'' said Dr. Robert S. Young, a coastal marine geologist at
Western Carolina University, ``but I can also say with the same
amount of assurance that there has never been a flood like this
with the potential for this much ecological impact. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is that the September flood picked up huge
amounts of organic matter in the form of decomposing vegetation,
topsoil, farm and lawn fertilizer, raw sewage, hog waste from
containment ponds maintained by the state's corporate farms, even
grass clippings _ and then washed it directly into the estuary. It
is still coming, in fact, at several times the ordinary rate,
turning the water the color of strong tea or weak coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, in Pamlico, Albemarle and Currituck sounds, the
organic matter is mostly trapped because the barrier islands of the
Banks convert the sounds into a single, nearly closed lagoon. The
material sinks to the bottom of this shallow body of water, and
that is the root of the scientists' fears.
</P>
<P>
   When the water warms up again next spring and summer, they say,
two things are likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   First, the organic waste will provide nutrients for the
production of vastly larger amounts of algae called phytoplankton.
When they die, they will fall to the bottom and join the carpet of
organic matter washed there by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   Second, multiplying aquatic bacteria will feed on both the dead
algae and the matter washed off the land. In the process they will
use up tremendous amounts of oxygen from the water. If weather and
water conditions are right _ or wrong _ great expanses of the
estuary could rapidly be drained of oxygen, killing multitudes of
fish and other creatures and drastically limiting habitat for
surviving aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   That would be no small thing for a region that in large measure
draws its living from the water, and which serves as an incubator
for marine creatures that range far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs that oxygen-poor ``dead zones'' may
develop. Soon after Hurricane Floyd passed, while the water was
still relatively warm, scientists detected dangerously low oxygen
levels in the mouth of the Neuse River, which flows into Pamlico
Sound. Such a situation develops when large amounts of fresh water
off the land flow over denser, deeper, saltier water where the
organic matter lies, preventing the deeper oxygen-poor water from
mixing with surface water so that oxygen can be replaced. Since
then, the weather has gotten cooler and high winds have sometimes
mixed the waters, and the low-oxygen situation has moderated.
</P>
<P>
   So attention is turning to next spring's warm-up, and
researchers all along the mid-Atlantic Coast are stepping up their
monitoring activities, from satellite observations to aircraft
surveys to old-fashioned measurements from boats, in an attempt to
track what happens. No one really knows how long it will take for
abnormal flows of organic nutrients into the estuary to subside, or
how long after that it will take for bottom deposits of the
nutrients to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   No one would invite a disaster like the Carolina flood, of
course, but it has nevertheless presented scientists with a stellar
research opportunity. ``This is a sort of an ecological experiment
on a very grand scale that no one would ever be given permission to
do if they had asked for it,'' said Dr. Gene Feldman, an
oceanographer with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, who oversees satellite-borne observations of the
developing situation.
</P>
<P>
   So far as is known, this is the first time that virtually every
river basin feeding the estuary has flooded at the same time, said
Dr. Pat Tester, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration based in Beaufort, N.C., whose research
team is coordinating the intensified air-sea-satellite monitoring
effort.
</P>
<P>
   While it is likely that floods of this magnitude have occurred
in the past, experts say, they have never done so in conjunction
with such widespread ecological disturbance caused by humans. These
include, for instance, increased erosion caused by the cutting of
forests and plowing of fields, deposition of pesticides and of
nutrients in the form of fertilizer from farms and lawns, livestock
waste, sewage systems that overflow in floods and North Carolina's
hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   Inland waterways, estuaries and coastal ecosystems around the
world have been subjected to a chronic, long-term increase in
organic matter washed off the land. One major consequence of this,
for instance, is an oxygen-starved dead zone off the Louisiana
coast that has at times been as large as the state of New Jersey.
More generally, many experts say, over-fertilization from organic
runoff has surpassed industrial pollutants as a threat to aquatic
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's waters, too, have been subjected to this
long-term, increasing inflow of nutrients. ``Smaller doses were
already having a negative impact on fish habitat,'' says Dr. Larry
Crowder, a marine ecologist at the Duke University Marine
Laboratory in Beaufort, who studies the estuary's marine life. Now,
he said, the lower-level chronic dose of extra organic matter has
become a ``high-level acute dose.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman of NASA puts it another way: ``It's like flushing the
toilet'' into the estuary.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been compounded, Young said, by people's
destruction of coastal wetlands that ordinarily would absorb and
sequester many of the nutrients washing into the estuary.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Tester says, the influx of nutrients could be
good for some fish species. Salt-water species like croaker and
spot, which are small sport fish, and menhaden, from which oil and
fertilizer are produced, spawn offshore. About this time of year,
the young move into the estuary, where they feed on tiny
crustaceans called copepods and grow big enough to migrate out to
sea again.
</P>
<P>
   The nutrient influx could spur phytoplankton growth this winter,
which in turn could increase the numbers of copepods and create a
feast for the croaker, spot and menhaden. Thus, Tester says,
``there's a potential for it to be a banner year'' for production
of these young fish.
</P>
<P>
   But Crowder says there is evidence that the physical stress
caused by low oxygen and low salinity has affected some fish by
making them more susceptible to diseases that cause things like
rotting fins, skin and scales that slough off, body sores and
swollen abdomens that might indicate a viral infection. The influx
of nutrients could also spur the abundance of disease pathogens, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer amount of fresh water flooding the estuary may already
have killed many immobile marine creatures that bigger fish eat,
like small worms, crustaceans and crabs. Some bottom-dwelling
creatures may also have simply been buried and suffocated by the
sediments gushing in.
</P>
<P>
   Besides croaker, spot and menhaden, the estuary is also a
nursery for flounder, weakfish, shrimp and crabs, all valuable
commercial species. ``The organisms that we fish commercially
depend on the estuary's being healthy,'' Crowder said. So far, he
said, there are mixed reports from fishermen: some, who are not
catching anything, say the estuary is ruined, while others, who
are, say it is fine.
</P>
<P>
   These mixed reports might be explained, Crowder said, by
disruptions in fish movements caused by the flood; some fish may
have fled some parts of the estuary for others, and some that
usually move from the estuary to the ocean in the fall may have
moved earlier. Recreational fishermen offshore, he said, report
that there are lots of game fish there, including red drum, spotted
sea trout and mackerel. But they are hard to catch, possibly
because they have been gorging on fish fleeing the estuary and are
not hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next summer,'' Crowder said, ``is going to tell the tale.''
</P>
<P>
   With the return of warmer weather, ``the algae will go to work
and the microbes will go to work; it's going to be a real
interesting place.''
</P>
<P>
   The best case ecologically would see a dry, windy spring and
summer that would keep mixing the water and so replenish its
oxygen. The worst case would see heavy rains in the spring or
summer that would cause more freshwater runoff, which in turn would
stratify the shallow estuary so that bottom water could not mix and
gain new oxygen. Should that happen, Crowder said, ``it could be
very grim,'' with en masse death of marine life and habitat
restricted for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens next year might not be the end, because it
could take several years for the situation to play out and for
nutrient levels to fall back to within some kind of boundary.
</P>
<P>
   But at this stage, said Feldman of NASA, ``we don't really know
what's going to happen.''

DOCTORS' UNSOLVED MYSTERIES: WHEN FEVERS HAVE NO KNOWN CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fever took up residence in the young man like a squatter who
had started to break things. In the beginning it seemed benign
enough. It started one morning as a temperature of 101. That was
all: no cough, no diarrhea, no skin rash, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors thought it was probably a run-of-the-mill viral
infection that would go away on its own. But it didn't. Soon, the
nosebleeds and abdominal pain started.
</P>
<P>
   He went to New York Presbyterian Hospital, the large academic
medical center where I work, for answers, but his medical history
provided no clues. He had been healthy his whole life. A year
earlier, he had moved from South America to live with relatives in
Brooklyn. He was faithful to his girlfriend and had never used
drugs. He had always tested negative for tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his skin was pale and his body thin. His deep-set eyes
were insecure, like those of a scared, sick child. Otherwise his
exam was normal: no mouth sores or enlarged lymph nodes or skin
rash or heart murmur. His lungs sounded clear.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors suspected he had an infection, because infections are
the most common cause of short-term fevers. But his urine had no
bacteria or white blood cells. His chest X-ray was normal. Blood
cultures did not grow any organisms.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days of negative tests, his doctors decided to send
him home. Though the fever persisted, he did not have an obvious
infection. Though he was still fatigued, the nosebleeds had stopped
and he did not seem sick enough to warrant continued
hospitalization. So he went home, with an assurance that whatever
it was that ailed him would soon go away.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. He soon found himself back in the hospital. Infection
was still the prime suspect, so cultures were repeated, but this
time a wider net was cast. He was tested for a long list of
ailments, common and not so common: babesiosis, ehrlichiosis,
brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, Q fever, malaria, cytomegalovirus,
human T-cell lymphoma virus, histoplasmosis, herpes, bartonellosis,
HIV, tuberculosis and syphilis. All were ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer also needed to be ruled out, so doctors did blood cell
counts, a CAT scan and bone marrow biopsies, obtained through a
large needle drilled through his hip. All normal. Tests for
rheumatic diseases and various others were also normal.
</P>
<P>
   So after another month the doctors again threw up their hands
and sent the young man home. His discharge diagnosis: fever of
unknown origin.
</P>
<P>
   Fevers cause trouble, for doctors and patients. Because almost
any disease can cause a fever, the list of possibilities is long
and daunting. It is shortened only with the most meticulous of
interviewing and physical exams. Questions about travel, medicines
and symptoms become paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with fever want answers. Nothing else is so firmly
linked in their minds to disease. The fever punishes them. It revs
up their metabolism, causing them to feel fatigued and lose weight.
If it lasts long enough, their muscles start to break down as the
fever literally consumes them. (Tuberculosis, a common cause of
prolonged fever, used to be called consumption.)
</P>
<P>
   Fevers can be mysterious; then, the challenges multiply. The
hospital is always filled with patients with fevers no one
understands. In some, like the young man, it is a sign of an
underlying disease that is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   In others, like AIDS or cancer patients with suppressed immune
systems, the fever may have any number of causes, including their
underlying disease or a dangerous infection that could rapidly kill
if left untreated. Whatever the case, mysterious fevers are common,
and among the most vexing of medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The modern definition for such fevers was proposed in 1961 by
Dr. Paul Beeson and Dr. Robert Petersdorf, infectious-disease
specialists at Yale. Their definition _ a fever of at least 101
degrees lasting for three or more weeks and defying explanation,
despite at least one week of intensive investigation inside a
hospital _ was intended to exclude all but the most perplexing
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature cutoff excludes many ``low-grade fevers'' that
are not true fevers at all. (The normal average human temperature
may vary between 98 in the early morning and 100 in the early
evening.) The duration requirement excludes most viral and many
bacterial illnesses, which are either self-limited or obvious.
</P>
<P>
   In their first systematic studies, Beeson and Petersdorf found
that about 35 percent of their adult patients with mysterious
fevers had infections, 20 percent cancer and 15 percent rheumatic
diseases. The rest were in a miscellaneous category or were never
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, relatively small changes have occurred in the
distribution. Cancer is now as common as infections, especially in
very protracted fevers. Rheumatic diseases, like lupus and
rheumatoid arthritis, are less common, probably because they can
now be caught and treated early.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the infectious diseases, syphilis, common in the 1950s, is a
rare cause of fever of unknown origin today. Tuberculosis, a
leading infectious killer, remains a major player.
</P>
<P>
   The fever of unknown origin has become an even bigger problem as
immune-deficiency conditions have proliferated. Doctors invariably
hospitalize people with AIDS and bone marrow transplants when they
get these fevers so they can receive intravenous antibiotics to
fight off life-threatening infections. In the hospital they are
often kept in isolation, as far as possible from people who can
infect them.
</P>
<P>
   Their diets are severely restricted: no fresh fruit or raw
vegetables that harbor fungus, no undercooked meat, no yogurt. Many
doctors even discourage patients from getting fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   (A nurse once removed flowers from the room of a cancer patient
of mine and afterward stopped me in the hall to tell me she felt
evil. The patient, young and newly married, called me into his room
later. With tears in his eyes he asked me if it was OK for him to
hug his wife.)
</P>
<P>
   But these measures, draconian as they may seem, save lives.
Studies in the 1970s showed that immunosuppressed patients with
mysterious fevers lived longer if they were hospitalized and
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The approach is beginning
to change: a recent study suggested that outpatient treatment may
suffice for some patients whose immune systems are recovering. But
most doctors still prefer to err toward caution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, patients suffer, both from the fever and from what is
done to manage it. Consider a large group of those with compromised
immune systems: newborns. When a newborn has a fever, blood is
drawn for cultures, a bladder catheter is placed to get urine for
culture and examination, and a needle is inserted into the spine to
get fluid to check for meningitis. Though these procedures are
painful and have obvious risks, most doctors think they are
justified if an occasional baby is saved from brain damage or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with terminally ill patients. They live longer when
their fevers are treated aggressively, but not always better.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget a middle-aged man I treated last year, as an
intern. His doctor told him he had leukemia in the spring of 1997.
At first his disease responded to chemotherapy, and he went into
remission. But it returned and eventually proved resistant to all
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was going to die. But first, he wanted to spend a
little more time with his two young sons to impart a few lessons
they could carry with them when he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But he could not escape the hospital. The leukemia had ravaged
his immune system, so every time he got a new fever, every few
weeks, he would be hospitalized and placed in virtual isolation.
His sons were discouraged from visiting him because they were young
and posed an infectious risk.
</P>
<P>
   He was given antibiotics _ antibacterials, antivirals,
antifungals _ for weeks at a time, often becoming violently
nauseated and short of breath during his daily infusions. With each
passing day his frustration and sadness grew as he realized the
fever was gobbling up the precious little time he had left.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he decided he had had enough. The months of
hospitalizations and the endless, mysterious fever had taken a toll
on his mind as much as his body. He told his doctors he was going
home. They discouraged him, telling him he could rapidly succumb to
an infection, but he would not be dissuaded.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before he finally left, he called me into the small
room that had become his home. ``They say I will die if I leave the
hospital,'' he said. ``I will take that chance because here I am
already dead.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Most major airlines fly to Venezuela, and
American Airlines has direct flights there. The flight from the
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport lasts about five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ENTRY: A valid passport and visa or tourist card are required.
Tourist cards are issued on flights from the United States. U.S.
citizens should carry their passports with them at all times.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: You can rent a car to explore the region, though
rates tend to be expensive, and robberies aren't unheard of. To get
to other destinations, you may take Avensa or Servivensa, two
domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: The Venezuelan currency is the bolivar, and is written
Bs. In July, the exchange rate was about 600 bolivars to the
dollar, although you should check the exchange rate before going.
U.S. dollars and traveler's checks are widely accepted at the
larger hotels and tourist destinations, although you should carry a
healthy supply of bolivars for smaller purchases and in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   TOURS: To get to Angel Falls, you fly into Canaima National
Park. Flights from Venezuela's international airport are readily
available, and an ``air pass'' allows tourists to fly to Canaima,
then to another destination of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Our three-day, two-night tour cost $200 U.S. per person,
although others in our group haggled the price down by as much as
$75. We used Tiuna Tours, which we booked at the airport from one
of the many tour booths located at the international terminal.
Whichever company you use, make sure the entire tour is outlined
for you, and that you get a receipt.

`HEMINGWAY VS. FITZGERALD': WITH HEMINGWAY AS FRIEND, WHO NEEDED
ENEMIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald must surely rank as one
of the oddest couples in literary history. Best friends briefly and
later acrimonious rivals, they were two of their generation's
pre-eminent writers, their mutual achievements obscured by the
potent legends that accrued around their names.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, whose hard, clean prose helped reinvent 20th-century
English, is too often remembered for his posturing as an adventurer
and macho man, while Fitzgerald, the author of ``The Great
Gatsby,'' a signal work in American literary history, is frequently
shrugged off as a social historian of the 1920s, a Jazz Age playboy
who allowed alcohol and self-indulgence to dissipate his charm.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald,'' Scott Donaldson, author of
earlier biographies of both men, laments the cult of celebrity that
has diminished the accomplishments of artists, while putting
``every detail of their private lives'' under ``intense scrutiny.''
His own book, however, turns out to be another exercise in what
Joyce Carol Oates has called ``pathography,'' a form of biography
that pays scant attention to an artist's work and instead focuses
on his dysfunctional relationships and his slide into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald'' is a book filled with incidents of
bad behavior, alcoholic excess and petty vendettas, a book that
discusses ``Gatsby'' in terms of its alcoholic content (``Gatsby
himself is never drunk and the narrator Nick Carraway rarely so,
but the book is saturated with liquor'') and quotes the
psychoanalytic theorizing of so-called experts who never met
Hemingway or Fitzgerald. At one point Donaldson even cites an
article called ``Love Survival: How to Mend a Broken Heart'' in an
effort to illuminate the romantic difficulties of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The volume draws heavily on correspondence between the two
writers (as well as letters to their mutual editor, Maxwell
Perkins), recent biographical studies and memoirs by mutual
acquaintances like Morley Callaghan (``That Summer in Paris'') and
Robert McAlmon (``Being Geniuses Together''). Most of the material
in ``Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald'' will be overwhelmingly familiar to
any reader acquainted with the lives of its two subjects. Once
again we are told the story of how Fitzgerald helped the young
Hemingway, acting as his agent and advocate and performing some
crucial editing on ``The Sun Also Rises.'' And once again we are
told the story of how Hemingway paid Fitzgerald back by belittling
him to mutual friends and creating a snide, condescending (and
probably fictionalized) portrait of him in ``A Moveable Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, who ``could ill abide being beholden to anyone,''
clearly resented Fitzgerald's help, and in this book, as in many
others, he receives the bulk of the blame for the friendship's
demise. He emerges from these pages as an ingrate and bully, a
megalomaniac who projected his own insecurities onto those closest
to him and who believed he needed to reject friends and lovers
before they could reject him. Fitzgerald, in contrast, comes across
as a well-meaning but annoying fellow who hero-worshiped the wrong
people, and who consistently sabotaged himself by getting drunk and
behaving like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   In one typically overwritten passage, Donaldson describes
Hemingway as having ``a dark side to his nature, blacker than
Zimbabwe granite.'' ``Hemingway felt a compulsion to dominate, to
lord it over others,'' he writes, ``and Fitzgerald had a
complementary need to be dominated. If Ernest liked to kick, Scott
wore a sign on his backside saying `Kick Me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson argues that Hemingway consistently tried to spin the
story of his friendship with Fitzgerald to his own advantage,
misremembering his former friend's editorial suggestions ``through
a pattern of exaggerations, lies, and outright inventions.'' In
addition he points out that Fitzgerald was not the only friend
Hemingway repudiated, that Gertrude Stein, another mentor, was also
dissed, as was Faulkner, a fellow Nobel Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   While the friendship between Hemingway and Fitzgerald dwindled
after 1926 _ they were rarely on the same continent during the
1930s and saw each other only four times in that decade _
Fitzgerald, in Donaldson's words, ``struggled gamely to preserve
the illusion of what had once been the closest of relationships.''
His star, however, was falling, while Hemingway's was ascendant,
and his ``eagerness to be involved in Ernest's life and career''
was now regarded as meddling on the part of a pathetic has-been.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway was condescending about Fitzgerald's work and mocked
his former friend as a coward, a lap dog to the rich and a
henpecked husband in thrall to a manipulative woman. He likened
Fitzgerald to a dying butterfly, a glass-jawed boxer and an
unguided missile crashing to earth on a ``very steep trajectory.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fitzgerald's death in 1940 at 44, Hemingway's attacks
accelerated, in large measure, Donaldson suggests, because of the
posthumous revival of Fitzgerald's reputation. During the last
years of his life, Fitzgerald indulged in the occasional gibe
against his former friend (``Ernest would always give a helping
hand to a man on a ledge a little higher up,'' he remarked), but
for the most part he seems to have regarded the lost friendship
with wistful regret.
</P>
<P>
   In chronicling the sad arc of the Fitzgerald-Hemingway
relationship, Donaldson manages to give the reader a sense of his
subjects' volatile personalities, not a particularly hard job given
all that has been written about the pair. But his reluctance to
address their work seriously, coupled with his focus on the tawdry
melodramas of their lives, results in a shallow, voyeuristic book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemingway and Fitzgerald were different, not better,'' he
writes in one particularly trite passage. ``Each was great in his
own way. In that league, no one had to lose for both of them to be
winners.'' Winners, it turns out, subject to today's laws of fame,
and hence the focus of yet another cheesy chronicle of calamity and
waste.

 &HT;    At odds over cleanliness of endoscopes
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How clean is clean enough?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question University of Georgia microbiologist David
Lewis is posing to the medical community about endoscopes, which
are used mostly to check out colons and lungs in about 15 million
surgical procedures a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators and medical associations maintain that
disinfecting the flexible tubing is sufficient. But Lewis and a
growing number of health professionals think the equipment needs to
be sterilized or sheathed to reduce the risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationwide, this is really rather a sloppy situation,'' Lewis
said. ``There is no way, with all the joints and valves and
crevices, to really get these things clean. And if you don't
believe me, look at the tubing when the repairman opens it up.
You'll find gunk all through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But does all that gunk _ tiny chunks of tissue, feces, mucus and
blood _ actually pose a risk to patients? Scientifically speaking,
the risk is very low. Between 1988 and 1992, there were 28
published cases of infection _ or about 1 infection per 1.8 million
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And when you consider the other option _ exploratory surgery _
the gamble looks even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is relative,'' said Lynne Sehulster, a
microbiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and
Prevention's hospital infection program. ``Nothing is risk-free.
And it's very easy to say all scopes should be sterilized. ... But
really, if they're properly cleaned, there's nothing to be gained
by making such a demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that it's difficult for patients to know whether
the equipment has been properly cleaned, Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   Most flexible scopes are cleaned with glutaraldehyde, a
disinfectant. But the length of time the scopes are soaked varies
widely. The CDC does not specify times or temperatures. But Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, the manufacturer of glutaraldehyde, and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration recommend that they be soaked for at least
45 minutes, while the industry standard hovers closer to 20
minutes, according to a study published this year in the journal
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 1997 survey in the Archives of Family Medicine showed
that a majority of primary care physicians failed to follow more
than one-third of the federal guidelines for the proper cleaning of
sigmoidoscopes, used for the detection of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis, along with others, questions the accuracy of the low
infection figure. They believe the scopes are cross-contaminating
patients at a higher rate, but that the majority of infections
result in mild illnesses that are not easily connected to the
endoscopic procedures. They also think doctors aren't reporting
cases because they're afraid of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Sehulster disagrees. ``If a problem were occurring with
post-procedural infections or adverse outcomes to the extent that
is implied by the critics in the field, I'm confident that medical
professionals would have jumped right in to seek out a solution,''
she said. But Sehulster added that infection surveillance may not
be complete, because so many of the procedures are done in an
outpatient setting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons health practitioners are hesitant to change
cleaning methods is cost. While disinfection is a relatively cheap
process, sterilization of endoscopes is a complicated endeavor. The
tubing can't be heated like most medical devices, because the
process damages the equipment. So special chemicals and equipment,
such as peracetic acid processors, have to be used, at
significantly higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some doctors and hospitals are revising their
procedures for cleaning endoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates uses sheaths that slip over
the instruments and are discarded after a procedure. But Dr.
Russell Kramer said the practice started using the sheaths about
three years ago not because the doctors were worried about
infection rates, but because it was faster than waiting for the
scopes to soak the recommended times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, perception-wise, patients think this is much better.
But in reality, that's sort of a heart decision, not an
intellectual decision,'' he said. ``Either way is equally safe in
my opinion. When we cleaned them (and did periodic cultures on the
endoscopes), we never came up with any bacteria that was
transmissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations from all sides of the debate on
how to get a clean scope:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go to hospitals, hospital-based clinics or private practices
that are large enough to have dedicated staff to clean the
endoscopes. Those facilities have more money to spend on the
cleaning process and they probably aren't under as much pressure to
reuse the equipment quickly, which could result in shorter
disinfectant soaking periods. However, even that doesn't always
guarantee a safe scope: In 1997, tuberculosis cases in Maryland and
South Carolina were linked to dirty bronchoscopes used in two
hospitals, according to a Journal of the American Medical
Association study.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shop around for a physician or hospital who cleans the
endoscope in a manner that makes you feel comfortable. Ask for a
sheath, if it's available. Be prepared to pay a couple of hundred
bucks for it though; insurance typically doesn't cover the cost.
Ask about the cleaning procedure, and specifically whether the
scopes are disinfected or sterilized. Find out whether the people
who clean the equipment are trained for the job or are doing it as
a side responsibility. Ask them if the endoscopes are checked with
periodic bacterial cultures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for the newest scope the practice or hospital offers. In
recent years, manufacturers are getting smarter about making
endoscopes that are easier to clean and thus safer to use.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this will guarantee that you will get the
cleanest of the clean scopes, but it does give your doctor a
heads-up that you're familiar with the issue and it's important to
you. And if there's any indication a clinic is evading your
questions, move on.

 &HT;    At odds over cleanliness of endoscopes
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How clean is clean enough?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question University of Georgia microbiologist David
Lewis is posing to the medical community about endoscopes, which
are used mostly to check out colons and lungs in about 15 million
surgical procedures a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators and medical associations maintain that
disinfecting the flexible tubing is sufficient. But Lewis and a
growing number of health professionals think the equipment needs to
be sterilized or sheathed to reduce the risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationwide, this is really rather a sloppy situation,'' Lewis
said. ``There is no way, with all the joints and valves and
crevices, to really get these things clean. And if you don't
believe me, look at the tubing when the repairman opens it up.
You'll find gunk all through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But does all that gunk _ tiny chunks of tissue, feces, mucus and
blood _ actually pose a risk to patients? Scientifically speaking,
the risk is very low. Between 1988 and 1992, there were 28
published cases of infection _ or about 1 infection per 1.8 million
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And when you consider the other option _ exploratory surgery _
the gamble looks even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is relative,'' said Lynne Sehulster, a
microbiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and
Prevention's hospital infection program. ``Nothing is risk-free.
And it's very easy to say all scopes should be sterilized. ... But
really, if they're properly cleaned, there's nothing to be gained
by making such a demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that it's difficult for patients to know whether
the equipment has been properly cleaned, Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   Most flexible scopes are cleaned with glutaraldehyde, a
disinfectant. But the length of time the scopes are soaked varies
widely. The CDC does not specify times or temperatures. But Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, the manufacturer of glutaraldehyde, and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration recommend that they be soaked for at least
45 minutes, while the industry standard hovers closer to 20
minutes, according to a study published this year in the journal
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 1997 survey in the Archives of Family Medicine showed
that a majority of primary care physicians failed to follow more
than one-third of the federal guidelines for the proper cleaning of
sigmoidoscopes, used for the detection of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis, along with others, questions the accuracy of the low
infection figure. They believe the scopes are cross-contaminating
patients at a higher rate, but that the majority of infections
result in mild illnesses that are not easily connected to the
endoscopic procedures. They also think doctors aren't reporting
cases because they're afraid of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Sehulster disagrees. ``If a problem were occurring with
post-procedural infections or adverse outcomes to the extent that
is implied by the critics in the field, I'm confident that medical
professionals would have jumped right in to seek out a solution,''
she said. But Sehulster added that infection surveillance may not
be complete, because so many of the procedures are done in an
outpatient setting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons health practitioners are hesitant to change
cleaning methods is cost. While disinfection is a relatively cheap
process, sterilization of endoscopes is a complicated endeavor. The
tubing can't be heated like most medical devices, because the
process damages the equipment. So special chemicals and equipment,
such as peracetic acid processors, have to be used, at
significantly higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some doctors and hospitals are revising their
procedures for cleaning endoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates uses sheaths that slip over
the instruments and are discarded after a procedure. But Dr.
Russell Kramer said the practice started using the sheaths about
three years ago not because the doctors were worried about
infection rates, but because it was faster than waiting for the
scopes to soak the recommended times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, perception-wise, patients think this is much better.
But in reality, that's sort of a heart decision, not an
intellectual decision,'' he said. ``Either way is equally safe in
my opinion. When we cleaned them (and did periodic cultures on the
endoscopes), we never came up with any bacteria that was
transmissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations from all sides of the debate on
how to get a clean scope:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go to hospitals, hospital-based clinics or private practices
that are large enough to have dedicated staff to clean the
endoscopes. Those facilities have more money to spend on the
cleaning process and they probably aren't under as much pressure to
reuse the equipment quickly, which could result in shorter
disinfectant soaking periods. However, even that doesn't always
guarantee a safe scope: In 1997, tuberculosis cases in Maryland and
South Carolina were linked to dirty bronchoscopes used in two
hospitals, according to a Journal of the American Medical
Association study.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shop around for a physician or hospital who cleans the
endoscope in a manner that makes you feel comfortable. Ask for a
sheath, if it's available. Be prepared to pay a couple of hundred
bucks for it though; insurance typically doesn't cover the cost.
Ask about the cleaning procedure, and specifically whether the
scopes are disinfected or sterilized. Find out whether the people
who clean the equipment are trained for the job or are doing it as
a side responsibility. Ask them if the endoscopes are checked with
periodic bacterial cultures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for the newest scope the practice or hospital offers. In
recent years, manufacturers are getting smarter about making
endoscopes that are easier to clean and thus safer to use.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this will guarantee that you will get the
cleanest of the clean scopes, but it does give your doctor a
heads-up that you're familiar with the issue and it's important to
you. And if there's any indication a clinic is evading your
questions, move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients have a right to get a clean scope,'' Lewis said.
``But they have to know what to ask to make sure they get one.''

 &HT;    Reynolds Price's take on Jesus' preaching
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week The New Yorker ran an essay by John Updike about his
religious faith. This week Time ($3.50) features a unique
interpretation of the Gospels according to novelist Reynolds Price.
The North Carolina author of ``Three Gospels'' was asked to take
another look at episodes in Jesus' life and to create an updated
version. Price explains that one teaching he does not agree with is
Jesus' instruction to ``Go then and make disciples of all
nations.'' That command, Price writes, ``goes on contributing
heavily to the evils of national and religious warfare,
institutional and individual hatred, imperialism and enslavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Also of interest are Jack White's essay on the ``feud'' between
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and Atlanta Constitution editorial page
editor Cynthia Tucker over the city's affirmative action program,
and Richard Lacayo's assessment of the Norman Rockwell exhibit on
display at Atlanta's High Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   White calls for a more ``dignified debate,'' not ``a wallow in
the mud.'' Reviewing Rockwell, Lacayo generally praises the
artist's work while bemoaning the sentimentality. ``There are parts
of this show that could make you hate Santa Claus,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  We've got mail: The New Yorker ($3) goes digital this week
with several fascinating articles about e-commerce, e-mail and the
Internet. Seymour Hersh explains why high-tech changes are breaking
the code breakers at the National Security Agency. Even Third World
countries have begun exchanging national security messages
encrypted in unbreakable digital code, Hersh writes. In ``Your Mail
Has Vanished,'' writer Michael Specter goes in search of lost
e-mail in Schaumburg, Ill., where AT&AMP;T Global Network Services has
its huge e-mail delivery infrastructure. And, in a clever short
essay, Adam Gopnik praises the Internet for returning us to an
18th-century love of words. Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope would
have their own Web pages, he writes, and ``would have been merrily
scribbling short essays, anonymous accusations, flames and
billets-doux.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millionaire fever: The show makes Mensa members laugh, but as
U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) notes, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' appeals to ordinary Americans who can remember the
names of state capitals or sitcom chronology. The magazine explores
the TV show's impact on future programming and looks back at the
golden age of quiz shows, before the scandal. Not all the answers
on the 1950s shows were rigged. Dr. Joyce Brothers won ``The
$64,000 Question'' by answering a series of tough questions about
boxing. The sponsor, Revlon, apparently wasn't happy with her
success, writes correspondent Lewis Lord, because Brothers didn't
wear makeup.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mission to Mars: No one expects to find little green men on
Mars, but Newsweek ($3.50) looks at what the polar lander may
discover when it probes the red planet this week. Meanwhile,
Hollywood has caught a case of Mars fever. Brian De Palma's
``Mission to Mars'' will touch down in theaters in March; ``Red
Planet,'' starring Val Kilmer, should land next summer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seasonal stress: Not surprisingly, a poll by Family Life
($3.50) found that 70 percent of those surveyed said the holidays
are more stressful since they became parents. The magazine's tips
for reducing the stress level include cutting the gift list, buying
gifts online, including the children in Christmas rituals such as
singing carols at bedtime or reading stories to one another and
opting for a potluck holiday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Sports Illustrated Women ($3.50) names the
sportswomen of the year (the U.S. women's soccer team), the athlete
of the century (Jackie Joyner-Kersee) and the 100 greatest female
athletes of the century. Joining Joyner-Kersee in the Top 5 are
Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Billie Jean King, Sonja Henie and Martina
Navratilova. ... The U.S. women's soccer team also makes Glamour's
($2.99) Top 10 list, along with singer Jewel, ``Harry Potter''
author J.K. Rowling and TV actress Camryn Manheim.

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

VENEZUELA'S REMOTE ANGEL FALLS IS NATURE AT ITS MOST STIRRING
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ANGEL FALLS-HOW TO and ANGEL FALLS-VENEZUELA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANAIMA, Venezuela _ The steady hum of the DC-3 twin-engine
propellers lulled me into serenity, while outside, the bright July
sun reflected off the crystalline pools of water below.
</P>
<P>
   As I gazed out of the small, boxy window of a plane that had
flown during World War II, the anticipation began to grow. Here, in
southeastern Venezuela, was something different, something eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Falls _ the world's tallest waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, located on South America's northern coast, is the
continent's sixth-largest country in area and one of its
wealthiest. The capital, Caracas, is the undisputed political,
economic and cultural center of Venezuela. But the country also
reveals a host of landscapes, from tropical beaches and savannah to
dense jungles and the flat-topped tepui (pronounced ``te-poo-ee'')
mountains for which the country is famous.
</P>
<P>
   The single greatest tourist draw, however, is Angel Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled deep in the recesses of Canaima National Park in the
Venezuelan state of Bolivar, the towering waterfall drops from a
height of 3,212 feet off the top of Auyantepui. Known in Venezuela
as ``El Salto Angel,'' the waterfall is 19 times the height of
Niagara Falls. The mighty cascade is named for Jimmie Angel, an
American pilot who landed on top of Auyantepui in 1937 while
searching for gold. Angel's four-seater plane got stuck on top of
the mountain and he, his wife and two companions had to trek for 11
days before finding another human being.
</P>
<P>
   One trip, and the reason becomes clear. Formed more than 130
million years ago, the tepuis are massive and shrouded in clouds,
with sheer drops that make navigation seem impossible. And the
dense surrounding jungle makes you feel as if you've tumbled back
in time to a prehistoric age. In fact, the soaring tepuis were the
inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel ``The Lost
World.'' Nearly a century later, millions of tourists visit the
area annually.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to Angel Falls usually requires an experienced guide
from one of the area's many tour companies. Short excursions offer
an aerial view of the falls, on a plane that circles two or three
times a day. But seeing the falls by boat is a more visceral, if
more expensive, experience.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip began with a flight from the international airport near
Caracas to Canaima National Park in the southeastern part of the
country. As we stepped onto the dirt tarmac, an achingly beautiful
symphony of colors met our eyes: a lush landscape ripe with the
bluest skies, the greenest verdure and soil the color of shimmering
copper.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, the sun-kissed faces of smiling Pemon Indians
welcomed our group of about a dozen people. The Pemon have lived in
the region for centuries and continue to thrive in the nationally
protected park. Many of them work as guides for tour companies,
making a living while sharing their traditional surroundings with
visitors from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, our group was ushered onto a large truck
outfitted with benches. We bumped along dirt roads and splashed
through puddles, while large tree limbs brushed up against the
sides of the truck. We made a quick stop at a nearby lodge and then
got on another truck to ride to a clearing by the river.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived, several Pemon set about unloading our bags and
wrapping them in large plastic trash bags to keep them dry. We each
strapped on a well-worn, orange life jacket and gingerly boarded
the boat, painted a bright shade of lime green.
</P>
<P>
   Once propelled by human muscle, the canoes _ long, flat and
carved from laurel trees _ are now equipped with outboard motors to
speed up the trip. Young Pemon train for years as apprentices
before they learn the rivers well enough to navigate them. But in
the capable hands of a well-trained captain, the boats slice easily
through the tea-colored waters of the Carrao and Churun rivers that
wind through the park. The coloration comes from natural elements
that seep into the water from the surrounding riverbed and shores.
</P>
<P>
   With a Pemon perched at both ends of the canoe, we set off.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, we arrived at the camp that would be home
for the next two nights. After picking out a hammock, we ate dinner
_ a casserole of beef and noodles _ amid the din of foreign
tongues. Italian blended with German, Spanish commingled with
French, and English peppered the mix. Night fell, and the camp came
alive with laughter, card games and dominoes played by the feeble,
yellow light of hanging lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   We slumbered deeply that night, cocooned in cotton hammocks that
swayed with each slight movement. During the night, the sky opened
up and rains fell loudly on the pitched, corrugated tin roof.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a rooster crowed urgently as the sun began its
daily dance across the sky. I arose and went down to the river.
There, in the soft blue light of dawn, a shy Pemon named Barsiano
was fishing from a boat, his line dropping directly from his hand
into the water, as generations of his ancestors had done. The
tea-colored waters, new and exotic for us, recall an ancient way of
life for the Pemon.
</P>
<P>
   Up at camp, the delicate clink of plates and the shuffling of
bare feet on the sodden floor signaled the beginning of a long day.
After breakfast, we were back on the boat for the two-hour ride to
the falls. We sped along, dodging rock outcroppings and swift
rapids, until we finally reached a clearing. We got off the boat,
stretched our legs and prepared for the next leg of the trip _ a
one-hour jaunt through dense, wet jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the jungle, with its thick canopy and outlandish
vegetation, was like slipping through a door into another world.
Spindly vines dropped from enormous trees, gnarled roots threaded
through each other like large snakes, and giant, 3-foot leaves
lined the zigzag path to the falls. As we trudged through the moist
jungle, beads of perspiration began to form on my neck, and my wet
sneakers squished] with each footfall.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an hour later, the roar of rushing water, always
perceptible, began to get louder. ``We're almost there,'' our guide
said. One more turn, and then all of a sudden, there it was.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderous, majestic power of Angel Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, something is so beautiful and divine it takes your
breath away. For several moments, I could do nothing but raise my
eyes and stare at the tremendous cascade of water pouring from atop
Auyantepui. It hurtled nearly two-thirds of a mile toward the
earth, crashing down upon the rocks with a might that sent mammoth
clouds of spray billowing up into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Another short walk placed us at the base of a smaller cascade
where the water's force had diminished. One by one, people stripped
down to their swimsuits. Bobbing in the chilly water, against a
backdrop of huge sky broken only by the tremendous tepui mountains,
I felt a part of something timeless. Water had gushed over this
plateau for eons, and in this place, with pilgrims from around the
globe, the minutiae of life quickly paled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months later and thousands of miles away, the memories
have begun to fade, and somehow the photos don't quite capture the
essence of the falls. But there is something comforting about
knowing it's still there, a pristine and untouchable cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Still the stuff of novels.

PUERTO LA CRUZ SPARKLES WITH WATER ACTIVITIES, NIGHTLIFE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies ANGEL FALLS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO LA CRUZ, VENEZUELA _ The 2-foot lobster landed on the
deck of the boat with a resounding splat!
</P>
<P>
   Our guide and boat captain, Raul, had thrown the hard-shelled
creature over the edge of the craft and was swimming underwater
again in his shiny, black wetsuit, small harpoon in hand. I peered
over the edge of the boat and glimpsed him gliding through the
glittering water, tracking his next catch. Just then, my meager
fishing line quivered and I reeled in my own small dweller of the
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-sea fishing is just one of the things awaiting the visitor
to Puerto la Cruz, on the northern coast of Venezuela. Located in
Anzoategui state, the area is a good jumping-off point for aquatic
sports and is only an hour's flight from the international airport
near Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1930s, Puerto la Cruz wasn't much more than a sleepy
coastal village. But oil discovered to its south created a boom
that continues to feed tourism in the area. Although its population
is only 160,000, Puerto la Cruz has become the main gateway for the
hugely popular Margarita Island to the northeast. The island boasts
white-sand beaches, duty-free shopping and a vibrant nightlife. But
for those seeking more tranquillity and less tourism, Puerto la
Cruz is an attractive choice.
</P>
<P>
   The main esplanade, the Paseo Colon, stretches along the coast
for several blocks, offering restaurants, bars and a variety of
excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has more than 1,700 miles of coastline gazing onto the
Caribbean Sea, as well as more than 300 islands sprinkled off the
coast. Most of the islands surrounding Puerto La Cruz are located
within the boundaries of Mochima National Park. Some of the islands
are barren and rocky, but a large number have nice, quiet beaches
and a coral reef suitable for snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   Island excursions are available at tourist offices along the
Paseo Colon and typically offer a daylong trip to two or more
islands, usually with lunch and drinks, for between $30 and $40.
You can also hook up directly with a water taxi. The process is
informal. You barter a price _ in our case about $15 _ and with the
right boat captain, you can usually squeeze in a few hours of
deep-sea fishing or scuba diving.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip began with a visit to El Faro, a small beach on an
island called Chimana Segunda. The waters of El Faro are clear, the
sand is white, and open-air thatched huts are available to store
belongings or to take a break from the fierce coastal sun. Large
iguanas roam the beach freely, cautiously eying tourists for a
moment, then lumbering away.
</P>
<P>
   After we had roasted on the beach for an hour, our boat captain
Raul offered to take us fishing. We hopped on board, sandy feet and
all, while he fired up the engine. We chugged off and within 10
minutes found a spot to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh squid awaited our hooks. There's nothing quite like the
tug of a fish on the end of your pole. And the scenery was
spectacular: The water's turquoise surface was broken only by sharp
rocks, with pelicans perched on their precipices.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day at sea, we returned to Puerto la Cruz, and the
place was ready for us.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cornucopia of restaurants _ offering Indian, Lebanese,
Italian, and American cuisine _ and lots of seafood. But no trip to
Venezuela would be complete without sitting down to the country's
national dish: pabellon criollo.
</P>
<P>
   The meal, found in many restaurants, consists of seasoned,
shredded beef, white rice, black beans sprinkled with cheese, and
tajada (fried plantain). If you're just looking for a snack, the
local areperas offer up a variety of arepas, small corn patties
that can be eaten plain or stuffed with anything from cheese to
octopus to avocado. After a big meal and a beer or two _ Polar and
Solera are two common domestic varieties _ the paseo beckons.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking sun shimmers across the Caribbean Sea, and lovers
stroll along the promenade; vendors lay out their glittering wares,
and the timbre of native music hangs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   You could get used to this.
</P>

THEORY THAT AIDS BEGAN IN AFRICN POLIO VACCINE IS REVIVED BY BOOK

(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is AIDS a disaster inadvertently brought on by humans that arose
from early testing of a polio vaccine in Africa in the 1950's?
</P>
<P>
   This provocative theory seemed far-fetched when it first came to
public attention in an article in Rolling Stone in 1992. Most AIDS
experts dismissed it after a scientific committee reviewed the
theory and deemed the probability very low.
</P>
<P>
   But that panel based its conclusion in part on a published
finding that was later shown to be in error. Now a remarkable new
book by a British journalist offers tantalizing clues to revive and
expand the polio vaccine theory.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The River'' (Little, Brown, $35), Edward Hooper suggests
that an experimental oral polio vaccine might have been made with
chimpanzee tissue contaminated with an ancestor of the virus that
was to cause AIDS. Although he has no medical expertise, Hooper,
48, has done a prodigious amount of research since 1990. In 1,070
pages, including extensive footnotes, he builds a case based
entirely on circumstantial evidence that he accumulated in hundreds
of interviews and exhaustive library research.
</P>
<P>
   He finds close coincidence in both time and place between the
earliest cases of AIDS and the testing of an oral vaccine developed
at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia and, later, in two
laboratories in Belgium. From 1957 to 1960, the vaccine was given
to a million people in what are now Rwanda, Burundi and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   If the experimental vaccine was contaminated, nothing could have
been done about it because tests for the ancestor virus did not
exist then. And it would have been a one-time event because
standard polio vaccines were not made from chimpanzee tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Of 28 cases of AIDS acquired in specified towns in Africa
through 1980, 23 were from the same towns where the experimental
vaccine was given or within 175 miles of them. The area is the
epicenter of the African epidemic, which is the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for a simian virus' lurking in polio vaccine:
millions of Americans were inadvertently infected with such a
virus, SV-40, in the 1950's and early 1960's. (Fortunately, it was
not harmful.) But in 1967, several laboratory workers in Germany
died from the newly discovered Marburg virus after it had been
imported in African green monkeys. The virus is harmless for the
monkeys but lethal for humans.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities Hooper describes could be coincidence. ``The
River'' does not prove his extraordinary theory, nor does it claim
to. But it builds a sufficiently detailed case to require serious
examination of his theory.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to find answers require extensive research, and in the
book and in subsequent interviews Hooper has offered a long list of
suggestions, including laboratory testing of the small amounts of
vaccine that still exist after having been stored for more than 40
years. Because the vaccine may have degraded over the decades,
performing all the proposed research might still not determine
whether it accidentally touched off the AIDS epidemic. Even if a
simian virus turned up in the stored samples, it would not prove
that it started the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the vaccine thesis is disproved, Hooper's
research has embarrassed scientists. He has found that leading
researchers kept sloppy records and that prestigious peer-reviewed
medical journals published reports that omitted crucial details.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a diligent search, Hooper could turn up no records of
what primate tissues were used to prepare the first experimental
polio vaccines, which were tested mostly in Africa but also in the
United States and Europe. Though the government requires more
record keeping today, scientists say there is ample room for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a negative review in the journal Nature,
experts writing in scientific journals have praised Hooper's
diligence and scholarship and the plausibility of the thesis, even
if they are skeptical of it. In the journal Science, Dr. Robin A.
Weiss, a leading virologist in London, wrote that Hooper had
written the most exhaustive history of polio vaccine trials and
early AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Wistar Institute, the first independent medical research
center in the United States, appointed the 1992 panel to examine
the theory that its vaccine might have touched off the AIDS
epidemic. Now it says it is trying to find independent experts to
do what they were unwilling to do seven years ago, when the panel
recommended testing the remaining stocks of the experimental polio
vaccine. One aim is to detect evidence of simian cousins of HIV-1,
the virus responsible for the overwhelming majority of AIDS cases
in the world. A second is to determine the primate species from
which the vaccine was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since American doctors first recognized AIDS in 1981, the
origin of the viral disease has been a mystery. Scientists have
dismissed many theories, including those that held that the Central
Intelligence Agency or KGB concocted it, because they lacked
evidence or did not fit the facts.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that the earliest documented HIV-1 infection is
from 1959 in a man in Kinshasa in what was then the Belgian Congo,
was later Zaire and is now Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists generally agree that HIV-1 derives from a simian
virus in chimpanzees. But the unanswered question is how the virus
jumped to humans. The usual view is that passage must have occurred
in blood-to-blood contact, like a bite or cut during the slaughter
of chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   But humans have killed chimpanzees for centuries. So why did
transmission not occur until the late 1950's?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional explanation cites the vast social changes that
occurred after World War II: mass migration, urbanization and
sexual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Monkey cells were routinely used to make polio vaccines then and
now. But Hooper theorizes that chimpanzees were also used to
prepare the experimental polio vaccine. As circumstantial evidence,
he points to a large colony of chimpanzees at the Lindi River in
central Congo, where the primates were caught for research. (The
river of the book's title is a metaphor for the search for the
source of AIDS.) Only a small percentage of chimpanzees are
believed to carry the HIV-1 ancestor virus. But if chimpanzee
tissues sent to a laboratory in Philadelphia or Belgium were
infected, they might have found their way into one or more batches
of experimental polio vaccine, particularly the strain known as
CHAT, prepared at the Wistar Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In such an event, HIV's simian ancestor might have grown in the
batches of polio vaccine used in experimental trials only. When the
vaccine was squirted into human mouths, the simian virus could have
passed through a sore or ulcer and entered the bloodstream,
subsequently to evolve into HIV-1. From there it would have been
transmitted through sexual or blood-to-blood contact.
</P>
<P>
   Any contamination would have been accidental, because specific
tests could not have been performed before 1985, when a simian
counterpart of HIV was first isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Whether chimpanzee tissue was used should be easily confirmed or
refuted by checking laboratory records and scientific journals. But
Hooper said he could not find out precisely how the vaccine was
made, and neither could the committee that the Wistar Institute
appointed in 1992 to examine the theory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The committee was justifiably skeptical of the theory, in part
because British scientists had reported that a seaman from
Manchester died of AIDS in 1959 and probably was infected for about
10 years, thus placing the origin of HIV-1 before the development
of polio vaccines. Also, the experimental Wistar vaccine had been
given in Poland and Sweden, and AIDS was not reported there in the
critical years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the committee's skepticism, it recommended that two
independent laboratories test the remaining vaccine. In seeking
such cooperation, Wistar officials found only one lab, at the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, willing to do
the work, so it was dropped because it would have been impossible
to obtain confirmation, Dr. Clayton Buck, Wistar's deputy director,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The testing has taken on new urgency because further research
has shown that the Manchester man did not die of AIDS: that the HIV
thought to have been isolated from his body was actually from
someone else infected more recently.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the misdiagnosis of AIDS in the seaman does not
alter any of the committee's other conclusions. Even if chimpanzee
tissue was used, the vaccine theory remains a long shot, the head
of the committee, Dr. Claudio Basilico of New York University, said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the committee was so concerned about the theoretical
dangers from primate tissues that it urged vaccine manufacturers to
make ``a serious effort'' to stop using them.
</P>
<P>
   Basilico says his committee may be reactivated to oversee the
preparation of the stored vaccine for testing. The Wistar Institute
has pledged to find two or three independent laboratories to do the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ought to be done because it can be done,'' Basilico said,
though he added that the testing might not provide a conclusive
answer, in part because of the difficulty of disproving a theory.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the material for the independent laboratories, the
Wistar Institute will include samples other than polio vaccine for
purposes of scientific controls. The committee will code all the
material to keep the testing laboratory from knowing which is
which, Basilico said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wistar polio vaccine was also given to a small number of
Swedes. When some of the remaining vaccine was tested in 1995 as a
result of Hooper's work, Swedish scientists found no evidence of
simian viruses in it. But the findings do not refute the theory,
because different vaccine batches may have been used in Africa and
Sweden. Nor did the Swedish scientists try to determine the source
of the primate species for the vaccine. Dr. Hans Wigzell, the
director of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in an
interview that he was skeptical of the vaccine theory but assumed
the Swedish government would be willing to do more laboratory
testing to try to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper's recommendations go beyond such testing.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal is to conduct a formal investigation into the
missing information and how the vaccine was made. If the precise
technique could be determined, then scientists could investigate
whether a contaminating simian virus was capable of surviving the
vaccine-making process.
</P>
<P>
   A second recommendation is to conduct a vast search of blood and
tissues for evidence of HIV in blood or tissue taken before the
polio vaccine era; detecting the virus would strongly challenge the
vaccine thesis.
</P>
<P>
   A third proposal is to find out whether another early case of
HIV, in a baby born in 1973 to a teenager in New Jersey, could have
been linked to the testing of the experimental vaccine at a women's
prison in Clinton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 million people dead and 33 million more infected, AIDS
is among the worst epidemics in history. A seriously researched
theory about something so devastating deserves a full scientific
investigation even if the theory is unlikely and chances of proving
or disproving it are slim. Since the credo of science is to seek
the truth, science should assure the public of its integrity.
</P>

   Vaccines are unquestionably one of medicine's great triumphs,
and they have nearly eradicated polio from the world. But if
experimental batches of polio vaccine were inadvertently
contaminated with an ancestor of the AIDS virus when immunizations
were made by much cruder techniques than those used today, then
scientists and government officials would have to accept
responsibility for a historic blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many scientists say privately that publicizing Hooper's
theory would risk tarnishing public confidence in the safety of
vaccines. Scientific groups that could have sponsored scientific
meetings to discuss the vaccine theory, or taken an interest in
testing the vaccine, have not done so. Hooper said an official of
the World Health Organization told him that the origin of AIDS was
``certainly of no interest today.''
</P>
<P>
   But that attitude is surely shortsighted. As Dr. Peter Piot, the
head of the U.N. AIDS program, said in a recent interview, ``If it
were possible to determine where AIDS came from, that would be
important for science and the world to know.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cold air will spill south through the Eastern states as a brisk
windflow from the north becomes established between strong high
pressure in the Middle West and a developing ocean storm off the
Atlantic seaboard. Farther west, rapid warming will develop from
the eastern Rockies to the Plains while a series of Pacific
disturbances keep the Northwest unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers, though fewer than on Monday, will linger over the
interior Northeast, especially near the Great Lakes and northern
Appalachians. Most of the region will have a mixture of clouds and
sun with a stiff wind that will add to the chill of the day.
Farther east, the combination of a jet stream disturbance and moist
winds from the ocean will promote snow showers near the coast of
New England. Narrow bands of heavier snow squalls will brush Cape
Cod during the day. Tuesday night and Wednesday, the growing
offshore storm will cause an area of steadier, heavier snow to
expand toward the west, threatening extreme eastern New England
with several inches of accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful from the eastern slopes of the
Rockies through the Plains to the Southeastern states. After a
chilly morning, gusty winds from the southwest will cause readings
to surge into the 60s over most of the western Plains and eastern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Damp weather will linger in much of the Northwest. Showers will
be common near the coast and in many interior valleys. An area of
steadier rain will reach the northern California and Oregon coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Season Ends
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Atlantic hurricane season that began on June 1 ends
Tuesday. Twelve tropical storms were named in the Atlantic and nine
became hurricanes. Five were classified as major hurricanes,
packing winds exceeding 110 mph. Although the official hurricane
season is over, an unusual tropical storm or hurricane churning
across the Atlantic in December will count toward the 1999 seasonal
total. Since 1871, only six storms have formed in December, the
last in 1984. The list of storm names is changed each year. The
2000 list, headed by Alberto, will be used beginning January 1.

   IMMIG-DETAIN (New York) _ An Egyptian man painted as a terrorist
and held for three years behind bars because authorities said they
had secret evidence against him was near freedom Monday, his
attorneys said. The attorneys said the Justice Department notified
them late Monday that 38-year-old Nasser Ahmed _ once a close

to be released from a federal jail in lower Manhattan sometime
Monday night. By Benjamin Weiser.

   MEDICAL-DEVICES (Undated) _ Thousands of heart specialists
watched on closed-circuit television monitors as a tiny
experimental device was implanted in a patient's coronary artery.
The doctors heard the voice of Dr. Martin Leon, who was describing
the operation taking place in a hospital many miles away. But Leon
was anything but a disinterested observer. What he did not tell the
assembled doctors was that he was an investor in the company that
manufactured the device. He is not the only one to wear many hats
in the world of medical devices. Inventors are researchers.
Researchers are promoters. Promoters are investors. And, finishing
the circle, investors are inventors. It is a phenomenon found in
every medical treatment using devices, from laser surgery to gene
therapy. A special report. By Kurt Eichenwald and Gina Kolata.

   BRADLEY-FOREIGN-POLICY (Dateline to kum, N.H.) _ Bill Bradley
called Monday for more limited American intervention in ethnic wars
overseas and said the Clinton-Gore administration had compromised
U.S.-Russian relations with its singular focus on President Boris
Yeltsin. Bradley also advocated the immediate start of new
strategic-arms reduction talks with Russia to cut the number of
nuclear warheads even deeper than proposed by President Clinton.

   SAFRICA-POVERTY (Stutterheim, South Africa) _ This small town's
struggle to improve the lives of its residents demonstrates the
enormous challenge confronting South Africa's new president, Thabo
Mbeki, as he strives to undo the legacy of apartheid, which
banished millions of blacks to desolate towns lacking
infrastructure and industry. By Rachel L. Swarns.

<P>

<P>
   PRISON-CALLS (Undated) _ For Ruth Smith, the telephone call from
prison was a way for her cousin to speak with his dying mother. For
Tulen Rivera, the calls from prison are an opportunity for her
three boys to speak with their father. For Ruby Jackson, speaking
by phone with her imprisoned husband was a chance to talk without
having to spend eight hours on an overnight bus. But for New York
state, like most other states, telephone calls from prison are
something else. They are a way to make money. Under current state
policy, the families of inmates are charged the highest possible
rates for calls from prisons, and most of the money is kept by the
state. By John Sullivan.

WHAT LANGUAGE IN THE YEAR 3000? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Bliss on baem cumendum tusende yeara, Eallum!
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Happy New Millennium, Everybody!'' in the language that
the residents of England were speaking in A.D. 1000. For this
back-translation, which I have jazzed up only a little, I am
indebted to Antonette diPaolo Healey of the Dictionary of Old
English Project at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Though hard to understand today, that English wasn't gibberish a
millennium ago. On the contrary, the somewhat guttural tongue
spoken and laboriously written at the time of Aelfric's
``Grammaticus'' in 1000 was rich in vocabulary and complex in
syntax. But we can now say _ in the words they would have used then
_ Nu we tus feorran common, cild (``We've come a long way, baby'').
Let us not derogate their mode of communication; that's when men
were menn and women were wifmenn.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 3000, will my clone _ telepathically transmitting
the content of this column to The Times' Mars bureau _ be using the
same words as I do now? Of course not; even the word  &UR; evolve &LR;  will
evolve, or evolute. (I just exhumed that back-formation from
 &UR; evolution &LR; ; it's never too early to get a jump on the changes to
come.)
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press, preparing a book of ``21st Century
English,'' has been surveying language mavens like me to get
answers to questions like ``Will English continue its progress to
becoming a global language?'' (An American ear would prefer ``Will
English continue to become'' or ``Will English continue its
progress toward becoming,'' but perhaps I'm regressing.)
</P>
<P>
   One future-fixated question engenders another: ``What will
happen to dialects?'' (Fuggetaboudit.) And Alysoun Owen, a
commissioning editor at Oxford, also wonders, in stiffly Standard
English, ``How will language used in relation to the sexes
develop?'' (Human nomenclature has already been given a unisex
haircut: ``You, Leslie. Me, Alysoun. Who what?'')
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I have for months been surveying Olbom _ On
Language's Board of Mentors _ to get a fix on 3000's Earthlingo for
today's millennial Times Capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything may happen to a language in a thousand years,'' says
Jacques Barzun, whose House of Intellect is now in San Antonio.
``Think of what befell Anglo-Saxon when William the Conqueror and
fewer than a thousand men won a battle at Hastings: after a couple
of centuries, a mixed English-and-French tongue with two words for
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like  &UR; null &LR;  and  &UR; void &LR; ; for no good reason, modern lawyers cling
to both. Language has no life independent of its speakers and does
not change according to laws of its own. ``The mass of new words
born of cybernetics is no evolution but an eruption,'' Barzun
notes. ``English-American may be subject to even more violent
change. Suppose a coalition of other continents conquers North
America and unloads here its surplus population. Or suppose
illiteracy gets to be the prevailing mode, with only the relative
few reading and writing. There would shortly be two languages
spoken, as in ancient Rome and in England after the Norman
Conquest.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's stipulate that the English-speaking world is not
overwhelmed. What will we sound like then?
</P>
<P>
   ``The English of the year 3000 will sound like some strange
dialect of current English,'' says Sol Steinmetz, the great
American lexicographer. ``It is impossible for any living language
not to change. Edward Sapir, in his classic 1921 work, `Language,'
called this inevitable change `the drift of a language.'''
Steinmetz predicts: ``In this future language, the word cents might
be pronounced as `since' and the word  &UR; business &LR;  as `bidnis.'
Certain grammatical cases (like  &UR; whom &LR;  and  &UR; whose &LR; ) might disappear
entirely.'' (No  &UR; who/whom &LR;  problem? Utopia beckons.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the braking action of schools and dictionaries,
Steinmetz foresees a somewhat simplified spelling (as did Noah
Webster two centuries ago, and he was  &UR; rawng &LR; ). Vocabulary? ``A
great expansion from the currently conservative estimate of half a
million to well over a million words,'' he says. ``This is not to
say that 40 percent of our vocabulary will be replaced, a notion
very hard to back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Howzabout slang, boyo? ``Most of the current slang and argot
will vanish,'' Steinmetz says, ``but new slang, argot and jargon
will continue to replenish the ever-growing vocabulary of the
coming millennium.'' Presumably, this means ``Man, that's cool''
will give way to ``Woman, that's warm.'' (I can do that; bring on
the organ replacements.)
</P>
<P>
   Will English and American English fuse into a great world
language, understandable not only in Kansas and Liverpool but also
in Kuala Lumpur and the Congo?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burchfield, former chief editor of the Oxford English
dictionaries and the man who dared to revise Fowler's Modern
English Usage, thinks not. ``It seems likely that mutually
unintelligible varieties of English will be distributed throughout
the English-speaking world,'' says this New Zealander, now resident
in Oxfordshire. ``The two major forms of English, those of North
America and the British Isles, will as languages be as separate
from each other as, say, French and Italian and Dutch and Afrikaans
are now.''
</P>
<P>
   This divergence is not what most of us expect, as Brits today
embrace  &UR; mind the gap &LR; ,  &UR; humped-zebra crossing &LR;  and  &UR; bug jab &LR;  while
Yanks adopt  &UR; watch your step &LR; ,  &UR; striped speed bump &LR;  and  &UR; flu shot &LR; ;
on the other hand, a parallel political theory of ``convergence,''
so confidently put forward only a generation ago by
accommodationists between Communism and democracy, is discredited
today.
</P>
<P>
   But Burchfield has a solution to the problematic prospect of our
parting: ``Increasingly sophisticated electronic devices _ the
third-millennium equivalents of the mobile phone _ will make it
possible for intercommunication to occur, face to face or at a
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: ``The message of Speaker A will be instantly
translated into the language of Speaker B,'' Burchfield says.
``Techniques now familiar to journalists interviewing people who
speak, say, only Albanian will be familiar to English-speakers
throughout the world. No need for the presence of human
interpreters _ electronic translating aids will be no more
remarkable than spectacles and/or glasses and hearing aids are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   If this vision comes to pass, the uniqueness of national
language and tribal dialect will be preserved, which will give
societies the cohesion of tradition and a sense of cultural
difference from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time _ thanks to the tiny interpreter implanted in
everybody's teeth _ third millennarians will be blessed with
instant understanding of what is being said in any language, which
should convey a sense of worldly unity.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it: Language in the third millennium will defend
diversity, while translated communication will assert unity. ``O
brave new world, that has such people in't!''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back a thou, we say, Bliss on baem cumendum tusende
yeara, Eallum! Looking ahead to 3000,  &UR; Kant wate &LR; .

CLINTON, PUERTO RICO CHIEF SAID TO BE NEAR PACT ON TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello are nearing an agreement that would allow the resumption
of limited Navy target practice on the Puerto Rican island of
Vieques, two senior Clinton administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
agreement between Puerto Rico and the Navy could be announced at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, speaking in San Juan on Monday, said he expected
Clinton to announce a decision on a compromise in a matter of days.
Rossello called the discussions ``a dynamic situation, not a static
one,'' adding: ``There are different components that are constantly
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is pushing a compromise based upon a Pentagon
report calling for steep reductions in the Navy's live-fire combat
training on Vieques, the Navy's phased withdrawal over five years
and a substantial boost in economic development assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Aguilar, the governor's press secretary, said in a
telephone interview from San Juan that Rossello is speaking ``on a
daily basis'' with either the president or senior White House aides
in the final stages of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't quantify how many conversations the president and the
governor have had,'' Aguilar said. The latest discussions follow
telephone conversation that Clinton and Rossello had before
Thanksgiving while the president was traveling in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, a political ally of both the president and Vice
President Al Gore, told a news conference in San Juan on Monday
that he continues to oppose any resumption of bombing on the
52-square mile island located eight miles east of the main island
of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we want the bombing to end and the
Navy to leave Vieques,'' Rossello said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Navy and Marine Corps are pressing for an
immediate White House go-ahead to permit combat training on Vieques
by a battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower. The force is scheduled to sail for the Persian Gulf on
Feb. 18. To meet that time schedule, the Navy wants to resume
training on Vieques by next week.
</P>
<P>
   The target range on Vieques, opened in 1941, has been closed
since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly bombed a range
observation post, killing Navy contract security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four other civilian range workers.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders, backed by allies in Congress,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley
and influential Hispanic organizations, have demanded the permanent
end to live-fire training and the phased transfer of 22,000 acres
of Navy-owned land to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps contend that Vieques is the only
location where Atlantic-based forces can conduct final combat
rehearsals that combine simultaneous Marine amphibious landings
with Navy-Marine air support and gunfire from nearby warships.
</P>
<P>
   The island is home to more than 9,300 civilians, who live on a
swath land about 10 miles from the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials have forged backup plans to complete final combat
training for carrier-based attack aircraft with live-fire bombing
on two military target ranges in Florida and non-explosive inert
naval gunfire by surface warships against the target range on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Marines would rehearse their amphibious mission at Camp Lejeune,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, in an interview with the
American Forces Press Service published Monday, called the dispute
over the target range on Vieques ``a difficult political issue,''
adding that ``we've got to overcome the political opposition'' in
Puerto Rico to continued military training on Vieques. It would be
irresponsible for the Pentagon to send forces into combat with
inadequate combat training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any resumption of combat training on Vieques could be
complicated by several dozen protesters camped on the 899-acre
target area since last spring to block any resumption of shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico police superintendent Pedro Toledo said Sunday that
Puerto Rico's law enforcement agencies will not participate in any
round-up of civilian protesters encamped on federal land. ``The
areas under federal jurisdiction are going to be the concern of the
federal authorities,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Licatovich, a spokesman of the U.S. Marshals Service, said
that agents from the Justice Department agency would be used to
process anyone arrested on the Navy-owned property. But Licatovich
declined to discuss any plans to arrest the protestors.

 &HT;    'American Village' an experience in history
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEVALLO, Ala. _ A replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon
comes to life in rolling cow pastures south of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Part classroom, part theater, the American Village _ a $4.5
million re-creation of a colonial town _ opens today.
</P>
<P>
   Gravel walkways crunch under the footfalls of Benjamin Franklin
and Thomas Jefferson. Airy music from a fife sweetens the air.
</P>
<P>
   In an open field, white A-frame tents illustrate Washington's
gloomy encampment at Valley Forge. A post office, print shop and
trade shop sit down the lane.
</P>
<P>
   During today's grand opening, Gov. Don Siegelman will dedicate
the facility, as will a faux Washington who will enter on a
galloping white steed.
</P>
<P>
   Around those props, costumed actors will teach the foundation of
American citizenship to Alabama's 5th- through 12th-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, what we have here is a stage,'' said Thomas
Walker, who thought up the idea of bringing Mount Vernon to
Alabama. ``The drama of American self-government can be played out
from Concord Bridge to the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in
Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a former officer for the state PTA, decided Mount Vernon
was the best model to show students how the nation's government was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main mission is teaching citizenship,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old directs the state-chartered Citizenship Trust,
which conducts mock elections in Alabama schools. Through a $3.9
million county bond issue, a county lodging tax and donations, the
group built the colonial classroom on a 113-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons of the revolution will be woven with topics taught in
Alabama classrooms. The state Legislature approved $300,000 to
develop historical vignettes for the village.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50,000 students are projected to visit the first year.
Marketers eventually hope to cultivate a market throughout the
Southeast. Admission is $5.
</P>
<P>
   Students will become delegates at the first Constitutional
Convention in 1787; they'll debate cases in a courtroom inspired by
1770s Williamsburg; they'll vote on issues of the day; they'll sign
legislation in a replica of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington said the sacred flame of liberty was entrusted to
the hands of the American people,'' Walker said. ``What we're
trying to do is show we're stewards in everyday life of that sacred
flame.''
</P>
<P>
   On Alabama land where black Angus cattle once roamed,
Revolutionary War solider Joseph Plumb Martin declared battle.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin wasn't engaging British redcoats of the 1770s.
Instead, the historical figure played by Christopher Long of
Birmingham took aim at what he said was an ever-present enemy in
today's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers went into battle and the musket _ the British Brown
Bess _ was their enemy,'' said Long, costumed in three-cornered hat
and white vest. ``Today, the fight is not for freedom but against
apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   American Village
</P>
<P>
   What: Grand opening of colonial village based on George
Washington's Mount Vernon.
</P>

 &HT;    Surgeon General looks to black schools for help in AIDS
education
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the AIDS epidemic gets worse in the black
community, Surgeon General David Satcher plans to call on
predominantly black medical schools to help spread information
about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher will lead a national satellite conference today from
Atlanta to address the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to enlist the support of historically black medical
schools to helps us get the message out about the magnitude of this
epidemic,'' Satcher said. ``We must use every means available to
educate, motivate and mobilize communities to fight HIV and AIDS.
The HIV and AIDS epidemic is a national problem, but an effective
response must occur at community and individual levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morehouse School of Medicine will host the simulcast from
the campus of Spelman College.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Morehouse, Satcher's teleconference also will address
Meharry Medical School in Nashville and the Howard University
College of Medicine in Washington, D.C. The schools are the
country's only three historically black medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher also will address the Charles R. Drew University of
Medicine and Science in Los Angeles; and Tuskegee University in
Tuskegee, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In each location, a community-based AIDS service organization
that provides care to African-Americans living with HIV or AIDS
will co-host the event. Outreach Inc., will serve as the local
co-host.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is a most important step for the Surgeon General to
conduct this teleconference to inform the nation that the rates of
infection continues to increase in the African-American
community,'' said Sandra McDonald, founder and president of
Outreach. ``To hear this message come from the highest office in
the country is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is now the leading cause of death among black men between
the ages of 25 and 44, and the second-leading cause of death among
black women in that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said that even though the overall death rate from AIDS
is falling, the rate of infection among blacks is growing. Blacks
make up only 13 percent of the nation's population, but accounted
for 49 percent of the AIDS deaths last year and 48 percent of the
new AIDS cases reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started out as a predominantly white gay male disease,
but that has changed,'' said Satcher.``I hope that the black
community is beginning to get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said he hopes that the medical schools are able help
motivate people into changing their sexual and social habits,
adding that 40 percent of the new AIDS cases developed from drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also means talking about abstinence. Relationships should
not begin with sex,'' Satcher said. ``And we are also trying to
convince people to get tested. The earlier you are diagnosed, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said there are thousand of people in the black
community with HIV or AIDS who for some reason -- like
embarrassment, fear of doctors or the high cost of medicine -- are
not getting treatment. He estimates that another 250,000 Americans
don't even know they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger with that is they could be spreading it,'' Satcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still no cure for AIDS, Satcher said new drugs
are able to suppress the virus and prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What used to be a death sentence, we can prolong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's teleconference will begin at 4:30 p.m.

FATHER OF BOY RESCUED FROM CAPSIZED BOAT WANTS HIM RETURNED TO
CUBA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The father of a 5-year-old Cuban boy who drifted in the
Atlantic Ocean for two days on an inner tube before he was rescued
on Thanksgiving Day has enlisted the aid of the Cuban government in
seeking his child's custody.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports from Havana, Elian Gonzalez's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, and Cuban government officials have lodged
complaints with American diplomats in Havana accusing Elian's
mother of kidnapping the boy. The mother was among 13 people who
had packed themselves into a 17-foot aluminum boat in an attempt to
flee Cuba. She is believed to have died along with nine others when
their vessel broke apart during the 90-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   While immigration lawyers said that surviving parents are
normally awarded custody of their children, this case has been
complicated by the tensions surrounding U.S. relations with Cuba.
For now, Elian is staying in Miami with relatives of his father
until immigration authorities hold a hearing on his case next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said that Gonzalez, who they said worked as a doorman
at a tourist hotel in the resort town of Varadero, had originally
agreed to let Elian stay in Miami. But during a Cuban news program
last night, Gonzalez was reported to have said that he did not give
permission for his child to be taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States is such a country of human rights, they
should return my child,'' he said during the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Sunday, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said
it had begun to draft documents to obtain the child's return. The
ministry also blamed the United States for what it called stupid
immigration policies under the Cuban Adjustment Act that grant
asylum to refugees who step foot on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is on the government of the United States that the
responsibility falls entirely for these new and painful deaths of
Cuban citizens,'' the statement said. ``Because of the unreasonable
way in which that country promotes, stimulates and rewards illegal
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, a State Department spokesman, refuted the Cuban
accusations Monday, saying that the American government did not
condone illegal immigration from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reprehensible that anyone would suggest the U.S. is
responsible in any way for these tragic deaths,'' Rubin said. ``We
stay strong in our commitment to encourage safe, legal and orderly
migration and urge individuals in Cuba to refrain from attempting
to migrate illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Associated Press, Gonzalez said he
would be willing to go to the United States to claim his son.
Spencer Eig, a lawyer representing Elian, hoped he would come to
the United States, although for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what Elian has been through, the last thing he needs is
more conflict,'' Eig said. ``We are hoping the United States
government takes a humanitarian approach and allows the boy to stay
as a Cuban refugee. I also think it would be helpful if they make
it possible for his father to visit him here. He would see how
wonderfully his son is adjusting to life.''
</P>
<P>
   He would also see how his son has become a symbol beyond a mere
custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has literally become a poster boy for the Cuban American
National Foundation, the influential exile lobbying group. The
foundation has printed 4,000 posters that feature a picture of
Elian under the caption: ``Another Child Victim of Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Eig elevated Elian to the status of a millennial icon. ``He is a
heroic boy,'' he said. ``He is perhaps the last hero in the 20th
century battle against totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University
of Miami, said the politically and emotionally charged themes
swirling around the custody case could obscure the basic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, because the Cuban American National Foundation is
using this boy as a poster child of immigration to demonstrate the
tyranny of the Cuban regime,'' he said. ``They're saying it's
forcing even 5- year-olds to leave the country, but he is a
personal victim of these tragedies,'' Abraham said. ``He lost a
parent and now he's in a situation because his father is still in
Cuba. These tragedies are the result of the failure of both
countries to regulate immigration normally.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to do so, combined with Cuban unhappiness over the
island's economic and political climate, have also led to an
increase in rafters attempting to enter the United States, where
they are usually granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman said that 1,265 Cuban immigrants were
picked up this year, doubling last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South
Center at the University of Miami, said the refugee flow was
spurred by a belief among the would-be refugees that there was
little change they could expect from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of rebelling against the government is not something
they believe in or can see,'' he said. ``They do not see that as
something imminent. So what do they do? As perilous as it is, the
softest wall in this equation is the wall of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that both the Cuban government and the United States
could take measures to allow for easier immigration and improved
economic chances for the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players could do things to ease the situation,'' he
said. ``But it is at an impasse and the people are getting crushed.
What they look at for as a best option, at least some people, will
lead inevitably to more tragedies like this. But nobody wants to
say uncle.''

NEXT STOP IN EVOLUTIONARY LINE: COLLECTIVE BEINGS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If evolution is still unfolding, and most scientists believe it
is, just how complex an organism could the evolutionary process
create, before hitting some fundamental limit?
</P>
<P>
   People leading independent lives, as we do today, might not be
the end of the human evolutionary line. Is it possible that one day
we might subordinate impulses toward individual behavior and merge
into an organic community, a kind of human superbeing with its own
sense of self?
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict what might happen in the next million years
or so, but it's fun to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: an important rung in the evolutionary
ladder was the transition from single-celled to multicellular
existence. And that rung may have been the first of many along an
endless road to complexity.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for that first step, which our remote ancestors
took eons ago, still poses many puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   But however the progression from individual independence to
collective life may have unfolded, it seemed to have required some
kind of chemical internet, by which independent cells communicated
with one another and learned to enhance their collective well-being
by acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the human race has already hit upon something like that.
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental step in the process entails inducing many
independent individuals to join together and march in lockstep.
Scientists in Denmark recently discovered an intriguing new
manifestation of this behavior in cells of baker's yeast _ the kind
that makes bread dough rise.
</P>
<P>
   Yeast cells ordinarily lead lives independent of one another as
they leaven bread dough, ferment grape juice or cause yeast
infections. But a team led by Dr. Sune Dano of the University of
Copenhagen reported in a recent issue of Nature that they had
engineered a yeast community in which all the cells produced
synchronous pulses of a chemical called NADH, one of the substances
created when an organism breaks down sugar to generate energy.
</P>
<P>
   This chemical oscillation of yeast, in which concentrations of
NADH rhythmically rise and fall, has been observed before. But the
trick in this case was finding a way to keep the oscillations going
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Dano said in an interview, the scientists exploited
a theory for which the Belgian chemist Ilya Prigogine was awarded
the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In simple terms, Prigogine
showed that despite the laws of thermodynamics that make most
physical processes run downhill, an upward march toward increasing
complexity can be achieved in ``open'' systems.
</P>
<P>
   Open systems, which Prigogine dubbed ``dissipative structures,''
are those to which energy is constantly added and waste (in the
form of entropy, a measure of a system's disorder) is removed.
Trees and people are examples of dissipative structures.
</P>
<P>
   In Dano's application of this idea, a glass tube containing
yeast cells was constantly replenished with fresh cells, along with
glucose and cyanide, while waste matter and excess liquid were
constantly removed and discarded. When conditions were adjusted
precisely, clock-like chemical oscillations were induced in the
yeast culture, and they continued indefinitely, as long as fresh
yeast cells, glucose and cyanide were continuously added in the
right amounts and excess fluid was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Collective chemical oscillations in yeast colonies, the
scientists concluded, ``suggest an evolutionary path from
unicellular to multicellular behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeast cells are not the only creatures that routinely cross the
boundary between one-celled and multicellular existence.
</P>
<P>
   Single-celled bacteria can form huge mat-like colonies that live
almost like multicellular creatures, and evidence that such mats
existed even during the earth's early years has been found in
ancient rock.
</P>
<P>
   Soil amoebas _ highly complex single-celled organisms _ live
independently from one another when there is plenty to eat. But in
impoverished environments they join together to produce spores, and
in their collective state they can move relatively fast, sensing
light and warmth as guides to food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of collective beings from single-celled organisms
has been going on a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of years ago, shells of single-celled animals (called
nummulites) were deposited in huge layers in the limestone later
used by ancient Egyptians in building the Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
   Among the oldest multicellular animals with an apparent sense of
self are the sponges, which can exist either as independent, freely
moving cells or as huge assemblages of cells held together by
skeletons made of protein and minerals, and containing complex
food-filtering plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Once thought to have no power of locomotion, sponges have been
shown to be capable of creeping over a surface at a speed of a few
millimeters a day to seek out food.
</P>
<P>
   At higher levels of organization, many individual insects (ants
and bees for example) are essentially mere components of the
superbeing represented by the colony or hive.
</P>
<P>
   Communication provides the coherence allowing such superbeings
to function; the complicated dance steps used by bees to inform
their hive-mates of the directions and distances to food sources
serve as their colonies' internet.
</P>
<P>
   Higher still on the complexity ladder are birds that flock and
fish that swim in perfectly choreographed collective patterns.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strangest creatures is the naked mole rat, a nearly
blind little animal living in East African deserts that spends its
life underground within a ``eusocial'' organization, as biologists
call it, more like that of insects than of other mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Each individual in a mole rat colony serves as a cog in a big
wheel; only one female in a colony produces young, and the other
animals have the specialized jobs of searching for food, caring for
the young, guarding against predators and house-cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   For a naked mole rat, the sole focus of existence is the colony;
individual life outside the colony is meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel, ``Brave New World,'' envisions a
human society in which individuals are programmed before birth as
``Alpha-plus intellectuals,'' ``Epsilon-minus morons'' or any of
the intermediate levels, predestining everyone to specific
occupations in a rigidly structured society, not unlike that of
mole rats.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the world has sufficient ``carrying capacity'' to sustain
its human population in the guise of individuals capable of
independent action. But might a day come when we run out of
necessities and are forced to evolve toward a eusocial superbeing?

 &HT;    For E-tailers, shopping season already a success
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only five days into the official holiday shopping
season and online retailers are already reporting record numbers of
shoppers and dwindling supplies of the season's hottest gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping products in stock and providing customer service to
millions of first-time Web shoppers is an uphill battle for
retailers that not every e-commerce site will be able to win in the
war for the $6 to $8 billion consumers are expected to spend online
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday shopping will not be problem free, but it does beat
the mall,'' says Jupiter Communications analyst David Schatsky.
``Some sites like JCrew and Toys 'R Us spent a lot of money getting
their houses in order,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schatsky says the hordes of online shoppers means an increased
number both people accessing the sites and increased orders, which
means the potential for technology failures and shipping foul-ups
are a lot higher than they were last year. He says the biggest
problems consumers are likely to see will be in order delivery not
in accessing the the sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Schatsky's predictions are already evident on several
retailing sites. Several e-tailers have already run out of some of
this season's top-selling items. The Toys 'R Us Web site already
has a caveat on its homepage warning holiday shoppers that many
items advertised on the site might not be available. Many sites
have also run out of Pokemon, the hot Nintendo game and trading
card phenomena, items.
</P>
<P>
   Toy stores running out of toys isn't unusual online or offline
at Christmas, but Bluefly.com, an discount online clothing store
has already run through its stock of trendy pashmina shawls.
Pashmina is a combination of cashmere blended with silk.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bluefly founder and CEO Ken Seiff says that running out
of hot items is the nature of his business. ``We are an off-price
retailer.'' We sell last of season products from 250 designers at
up to 75 per cent off. Sometimes, you get a very limited quantity
of great products. So we sell out of products very frequently and
are continually replenishing with new items.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly's pashmina wraps were selling for $79, much lower than
retail prices of $200 to 400. Seiff says because of the item's
popularity Bluefly opted not to replace it and expects it to be
back in stock late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Even while struggling with sold-out pashmina, Seiff says
business is up 700 per cent over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday
following Thanksgiving Day last year. Like most of online
retailers, Seiff says everything this holiday season depends on
state-of-the-art technology and customer service. ``We upgraded our
hardware and customer service two weeks ago,'' he says. ``We
wouldn't have made it out of the weekend and held up under the
traffic without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic and spending was up at almost every online retailer.
Portal site Yahoo said transaction volume in its shopping and
auction area was up more than 400 per cent Friday from the same day
last year. Yahoo also said that in the 10 days preceding the
so-called ``Black Friday'' Yahoo shopping processed more orders
than during the entire 1998 holiday season. The most requested
items were Pokemon toys, cards and games for kids.
</P>
<P>
   America Online reports that spending over the Thanksgiving
weekend nearly tripled over last year and the number of shoppers
using AOL was 2.5 times higher than last year. Spokeswoman Wendy
Goldberg says AOL shoppers are buying toys, apparel, flowers and
sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People this year are expecting more from online shopping,''
says Goldberg. ``It's out of the experimental phase. They want
great customer service, great tools like search and
personalization. They also want great graphics so they know what
they are buying.''

 &HT;    Delta union members, management ratify agreement
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pilots at Delta Air Lines ratified a pay agreement
covering two new aircraft types, enabling the Atlanta-based carrier
to proceed with purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   The accord sets pay rates for the Boeing 777 and 767-400
widebodies, both of which are key to Delta's effort to upgrade its
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the pact, reached by pilot union and management
negotiators in September, means Delta will resume 777 purchases
after deferring nearly a dozen orders last summer amid a stalemate
in pay talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to talk to Boeing in the next few days about
rescheduling the orders,'' spokesman John Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta got its first two 777s in March but then delayed further
purchases, citing pilot union threats to ground the planes without
a ratified pay agreement by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The two-engine 777 is a highly-efficient international jet
already flown by several of Delta's trans-Atlantic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-400 is a new, stretched version of the existing 767 and
will be used by Delta to replace aging L-1011s on high-volume
domestic routes. The first plane is set for delivery in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The pay pact passed with 63.4 percent of the rank-and-file vote,
the Air Line Pilots Association said. About 96 percent of Delta's
9,200 pilots voted, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an all-time record for us,'' said Charles Giambusso,
chairman of Delta's ALPA unit. ``It certainly indicates our pilots
are extremely engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots who voted against the pact felt it would dilute the
union's leverage in new contract talks that started in September.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks are still in preliminary stages, with both sides
hoping for an agreement by May 2000, when the pilots' existing
four-year contract becomes amendable.
</P>
<P>
   Under the interim accord for the two new planes, 777 captains
will get base pay of $250 an hour, or about $225,000 a year,
retroactive to May 1. The rate will increase to $265 an hour, or
about $238,500 a year, on Jan. 1, when 6 percent profit sharing is
converted to salary for all Delta pilots. Captains of 767-400s will
get $243.80 an hour, or $219,420 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The pact also includes a 3 percent raise for pilots of most
other planes in Delta's fleet, and it eliminates the lower
``B-scale'' pay schedule for junior pilots. Those elements were
pot-sweeteners by the company to break last summer's logjam.

 &HT;    Hokies solidify No. 2 BCS rank
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is certain in the wacky world of the Bowl Championship
Series. But on Monday, Virginia Tech (11-0) took another big step
toward playing No. 1 Florida State in the Sugar Bowl for the
national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies, who closed their regular season by thumping Boston
College on Friday, more than doubled their lead over third-place
Nebraska (10-1) in the BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the second-ranked Hokies held a slim lead of 0.63
points, fueling speculation that once-beaten Nebraska might be able
to leap over them into second place. After Virginia Tech's victory
and Nebraska's 33-30 overtime win over Colorado, the Hokies now
lead the Cornhuskers by 1.54 points.
</P>
<P>
   One of the computer experts has said there is ``no suspense''
concerning Virginia Tech's status in the Sugar Bowl. But others
would say only that the Hokies appear in good shape going into the
final week before the major bowl lineup is determined.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, the Big East champion, has completed its season;
Nebraska still has to play Saturday against Texas for the Big 12
championship in San Antonio. If Nebraska beats Texas by a big
margin, the Cornhuskers will close that 1.54-point gap in the final
BCS rankings. Whether Nebraska could close it enough to catch
Virginia Tech is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Nebraska was so close to Virginia Tech,
speculation was rampant that the Hokies could get left out of the
big game, despite its record.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much invested in the BCS, so the two best teams
will play,'' Beamer said. ``I personally think one of those teams
has to be Virginia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech never has won a national championship in football,
while Florida State, which has a record of 108-31-1 in the '90s,
will be going for its second title under coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   The final BCS rankings, a formula based on regular polls,
computer rankings, strength of schedule and losses, will be
released Sunday about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams in the rankings will play for the national
championship at the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. The rest of the BCS bowls
_ the Orange, Rose and Fiesta _ also will be announced Sunday.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE REALITY OF THE FANTASY IN THE HARRY POTTER
STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a quarter of a century ago that Bruno Bettelheim, the
child psychologist, accounted for what may be the most impressive
and otherwise mysterious publishing phenomenon of the season: the
fact that the Harry Potter mysteries by the previously unknown J.K.
Rowling are turning out to be among the best-selling books in
history.
</P>
<P>
   In his classic study of children's literature, ``The Uses of
Enchantment,'' Bettelheim denigrated most children's books as mere
entertainments, lacking in psychological meaning. The great
exception to this rule was fairy tales, to which Bettelheim
attributed something close to magical power. ``More can be learned
from them about the inner problems of human beings,'' he wrote,
``and of the right solutions to their predicaments in any society
than from any other type of story within a child's comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   That was quite a statement at the time, applied as it was to a
form of literature that depicted fantastical worlds, seemed
unnecessarily scary, depended on unrealistically happy endings and
had very little claim on high literary culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Bettelheim's main idea was that children live with greater
terrors than most adults can understand, and fairy tales both give
uncanny expression to that terror and show a way to a better
future. The same can be said of the Harry Potter books, and that
could well be the reason why the three published so far occupy the
first, second and third places on the New York Times hardcover
fiction best-seller list, something that no other author in living
memory has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowling's books are not fairy tales in the conventional
Grimm Brothers sense, and they are not as good either. They lack
the primal, brutal terror of the Grimm stories, and it was the
expression given to that terror that was at the heart of their
emotional usefulness for Bettelheim. The Harry Potter stories are
light, modern tales, Indiana Jones-like fantasies for children.
</P>
<P>
   When I began to read them, having heard how great they were from
my several addicted nephews, it was hard for me to understand what
all the sensation was about. Conservative Christians have
criticized the Harry Potter books, saying they lead their young
readers in the direction of paganism. For me the problem was that
Ms. Rowling's world of sorcerers, gravity-defying broomsticks,
spells, potions, unicorns and centaurs, goblins, trolls,
three-headed dogs and other monstrous and magical creations seemed
so divorced from any reality as to kill off the narrative
excitement. But whereas adults see in Harry Potter a fairly
conventional supernatural adventure story _ one not nearly as
brilliant or literary as, say, ``The Hobbit'' or the ``Alice in
Wonderland'' books _ something more fundamental evidently
reverberates in the minds of children, something as powerful as the
witch of ``Hansel and Gretel.'' And read from this point of view,
the Harry Potter books do indeed contain many of the elements that
Bettelheim identified in the Grimm tales. Ms. Rowling's success in
this sense may show the continued power of the form and the
archetypes that those long-ago Germans perfected.
</P>
<P>
   The key here is, not surprisingly, the hero, Harry himself, who
is 10 years old in Ms. Rowling's first book. One of the first
things we learn about him is that his parents died when he was an
infant; he is being raised by an aunt and uncle who are dumb, stiff
and uncomprehending and who treat him with stingy cruelty.
Following Bettelheim's model, this would be very similar to the
archetype of the evil stepmother as a representative of the ``bad''
parent who frighteningly and uncontrollably replaces the ``good''
parent. What children see at the outset in the Harry Potter books
is a lonely boy being raised by evil people, and all parents seem
evil to their children at least some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Harry is that his mother and father were important
sorcerers who were killed by a certain Voldemort, the evil genius
of this story, who has been trying to seize power for eons. Here
Ms. Rowling's adventure takes on a primal quality that links it
with many classic tales, from ``Great Expectations'' to ``Star
Wars'': A family secret and a family struggle are passed down from
one generation to another, and a lot of meaning comes when the true
nature of that struggle is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in the fairy tale scheme is that Harry's
situation contains many of the inchoate fears of childhood, not
just the fear of parental abandonment. Harry is skinny and weak and
wears glasses patched together with tape, and in this sense he
seems to stand in for the vulnerability, the powerlessness that
children feel. He lives in a cupboard under the stairs, since his
spoiled cousin has both of the children's bedrooms upstairs, so in
a sense he is expelled, like Hansel and Gretel, even from his evil
home.
</P>
<P>
   Most conspicuously, Harry is picked on by his cousin, Dudley,
the son of Harry's guardians, who treat Dudley with blatant
favoritism. There could hardly be a stronger echo of another common
fairy tale theme, exemplified by Cinderella's evil stepsisters.
</P>
<P>
   To Bettelheim the conflict between Cinderella and her
stepsisters represents the intense sibling rivalries that children
feel and the fears that these rivalries give rise to. Fairy tales,
with their eventual happy endings, point a way out for the child
who otherwise, Bettelheim said, has no hope ``that he will be
rescued, that those who he is convinced despise him and have power
over him will come to recognize his superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of Harry's story the disadvantages he feels
are partly recapitulated outside his home. After he learns that he
is somebody, the son of famous sorcerers, Harry goes off to
Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he discovers
that other students all seem to know more than he does, that they
are insiders while he is the quintessential outsider.
</P>
<P>
   One boy in particular is the head of a small gang that picks on
him. A teacher seems intensely and for no reason to dislike him.
But gradually Harry emerges as an independent figure whose talents
and skills are widely recognized. The rest of Ms. Rowling's first
volume shows Harry assuming his true identity, gaining the courage
to overcome obstacles and winning a battle against the adversaries
of his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's story, in other words, with its early images of
alienation, rejection, loneliness and powerlessness leading to its
classically fairy tale ending, contains the same basic message that
Bettelheim described in ``The Uses of Enchantment.'' It is ``that a
struggle against severe difficulties in life is unavoidable, is an
intrinsic part of human existence _ but that if one does not shy
away, but steadfastly meets unexpected and often unjust hardships,
one masters all obstacles and at the end emerges victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Morality is not the issue in these tales,'' Bettelheim said,
``but rather, assurance that one can succeed.'' Such assurance
comes in ways that adults often do not understand, but Ms.
Rowling's Harry Potter seems to provide it.

DOWNLOAD, RIP AND PLAY WITH MP3 FILES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   About a year ago, a friend of mine brought over a CD, put it in
the CD player, and we listened to songs. There were 16 cuts on the
disc, with music by top-name country stars, light opera and jazz,
all playing clearly and crisply.
</P>
<P>
   Where did he buy this eclectic music collection?
</P>
<P>
   There is no such CD for sale. ``The amazing part of it,'' he
added, ``is that I don't own one of those albums with those songs
on it. I downloaded them all from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a collection of old-time radio shows _ the Great
Gildersleeve, Amos 'n' Andy, the Shadow, Lum and Abner, Jack Benny
_ all downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These little stories give recording-company executives apoplexy.
And at the same time, those executives salivate at the thought of
an easy, cheap way to market, distribute and sell music over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The format used is MP3, industry shorthand for ``Moving Picture
Experts Group audio player 3.'' It's a compression system, used to
slim down audio files so they may be transmitted quickly without
loss of quality when expanded back to their original form.
</P>
<P>
   For the listener, the format means new artists who can never
seem to get accepted by record labels but turn out to be big hits
with the public, can gain exposure for their music on their own Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   A typical 3-minute song, for instance, takes up about 30
megabytes of disk space. Compressed into MP3 format, the file is
about 3 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The file can be played by an MP3 player (WinAmp is a popular one
on the Internet, available from www.winamp.com) on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   It can be transferred to a CD, but CD players can't recognize
the MP3 format. (However, there are some CD players now being
produced that can decompress MP3 files on the fly and play them.
The advantage: A CD, instead of holding 60 minutes of music, can
now hold about 150 to 200 songs.) There are serious legal issues
with posting copyrighted songs on the Internet, but that hasn't
stopped every cut from recently released CDs from showing up in MP3
format soon after the CD's release in stores (and in many cases,
even before). But there are many aspects of MP3 use that are
perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that MP3 is the second-most frequently used
search word on most search engines. (In case you wonder, ``sex'' is
in the lead.) ``I Want My MP3!: How to Download, Rip &AMP; Play Digital
Music'' by Bill Mann (McGraw-Hill; $19.99) gives a complete
overview of MP3. The 374-page book also comes with a CD-ROM that
contains all the software covered in the book, including the
Sonique stand-alone player (one of the popular ones available) and
a collection of MP3 fills.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the press release says, I had MP3 up and running on the
computer in less than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It provides information on installing and setting up players,
using programs that do ripping (taking tracks from CDs and
converting them to MP3), and gives types on utilities for working
with MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites suggested in the book include: www.mp3.com;
www.musicmatch.com; www.rollingstone.tunes.com; www.listen.com.

MANCHESTER DOCKLANDS GET SPIFFYNEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 5) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ Ask just about anyone here what he
associates most with the paintings of L.S. Lowry and he'll probably
talk _ with misty nostalgia or utter relief _ of the passing of the
industrial north of England depicted in Lowry's spare cityscapes,
where stick-figure people are dwarfed by the smokestacks and
viaducts.
</P>
<P>
   So there is quite a delicious irony in the glittery $200 million
project named for the artist that is rising on what used to be the
drear and depressing docklands of the Salford district where Lowry
lived all his life _ the very emblem of the urban regeneration that
has, in recent years, devoured the last vestiges of his Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply the Lowry, this complex of theaters, galleries and
spaces, with its attendant cinemas and shopping, is set to open
April 28 and has been earmarked by the British government _ by the
National Landmark Millennium Project for the Arts _ as a flagship
arts project of the millennium year, financed to the tune of $100
million by Britain's National Lottery. Private investors, city
authorities and the European Union are providing the rest of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on Pier 9 of what used to be Britain's third busiest
docks, the Salford authorities hope visitors will be enticed by
what is said to be the world's greatest Lowry collection _ an
assemblage of over 330 works that the city has been squirreling
away for years.
</P>
<P>
   Two theaters for dance, drama and music _ one for 1,730 people _
will flank two more galleries, and a plaza will provide space for
up to 10,000 at outdoor performances. The opening program includes
the Paris Opera Ballet performing Rudolf Nureyev's ``Bayadere''
from May 4 to 7, and a South African dance extravaganza called
``Gumboots'' from May 22 to 27. Tickets can be ordered from
(44-161) 876-2000.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial complex of shops, a hotel and movie theaters will
be similar to an American mall. A separate building is to house
what is called the Digital World Center, a showcase for
technological advance and research. Nearby a footbridge shaped like
a dinosaur's spine will lead to a projected Imperial War Museum for
the North, complementing the existing Imperial War Museum in
London, and, not so incongruously in this eclectic blend of
offerings, to the Old Trafford soccer stadium of Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing new about the conversion of old
British docklands into landmarks for the late 20th century, some
closely tied to the turn of the millennium. The phenomenon is
already familiar in east London with the high-rises of Canary Wharf
and the Millennium Dome. But for anyone who knew Salford in the
past _ as a stubborn blight of row houses akin to the toughest
areas of the old Bowery in New York _ the project is more than the
sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some people who consider Salford a kind of no-go
area, said Michelle Bowey, spokeswoman for the Lowry, ``but the
regeneration of Salford Quays is well advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the modernization of Manchester's docklands says
something about the forces that have reshaped northern England
since William Blake wrote of the ``dark Satanic mills'' of
industrial Britain in the early 19th century, or even since
Britain's oldest television soap opera, ``Coronation Street,''
first turned Salford's gritty working-class life into the stuff of
drama more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that history has its roots in the Victorian era, when
rapid industrialization spurred expansion of the empire. The
Manchester Ship Canal, of which Salford is the inland destination,
brought cotton from the colonies for the textile mills that
provided Lawrence Stephen Lowry (1887-1976) with the inspiration to
find a cohesion and lyric beauty as well as a sense of isolation in
the early-20th-century industrial landscape. The works for which he
is best known were done between 1905 and 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles enriched the barons of industry but did little for the
growing industrial proletariat. The crude capitalism of the era
threw up the boxlike workers' row houses where Lowry's stick
figures lived. Railroads rattled across viaducts, belching smoke _
another familiar image from a body of work that extends to
minimalist seascapes and bright depictions of yachting.
</P>
<P>
   In postwar Britain, though, the decline was already well
established. Areas like Salford came to represent the mean streets
of Greater Manchester from which Salford now seeks to distance
itself with the Lowry.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s Salford's docks, opened by Queen Victoria in 1894,
had become a wasteland of dereliction. In 1982 they closed forever
to shipping. And as services gradually replaced industry as the
northwest's newest source of wealth, so, too, did Salford's docks
become a target for gentrification. Restaurants, bars and lofts
replaced Lowry's industrial vistas.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not such a break with the past as it might seem.
Lowry's paintings imposed a vision on a grim and gloomy urban
sprawl. Today's urban planners are trying to do the same.

PRIME MINISTER IS RE-ELECTED IN MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Malaysia's fledgling reform movement
made few inroads Monday in a parliamentary election that returned
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to power after a campaign that
stressed stability and economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the hardest-fought elections in recent years, the
governing National Front won 149 seats, well exceeding its goal of
maintaining a two-thirds majority in the 193-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Though a coalition of opposition parties did reduce the National
Front's seats from 162, most of the opposition seats went to a
popular Islamic party rather than to the democratic reform party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the National Front is still the party of choice of
the peoples of Malaysia,'' said Mahathir, 73, who has been given a
new five-year mandate after 18 years as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in a televised victory speech at 3 a.m. Tuesday, he
acknowledged a setback that dented his standing in the country's
Malay heartland and could cause him trouble within his own
Malay-based party, known as Umno. His backing among the ethnic
Chinese and Indian minorities remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce campaign in which each side charged the other
with dirty tricks, the Islamic opposition party, Pas, expanded its
control from one to two northern state assemblies, out of 11 that
were contested nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keadilan has lost, and lost big,'' said William Case, an
expert on Malaysian politics, referring to the new reformist party
that was formed in protest against the jailing last September of
Mahathir's chief political rival, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The firing and trial of Anwar, who had been deputy prime
minister, touched off demonstrations and inspired a reform movement
that attempted to emulate the groundswell that toppled Indonesia's
former president, Suharto, in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that can be read into this result is that
not very much has changed after all,'' said Case, who teaches at
Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. ``It is possible to
paint a picture of real continuity to the years prior to the whole
fallout over Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   That continuity, he said, placed Malaysia's political cleavage
between the secular Umno and the Islamist Pas. ``And in that fault
line Keadilan _ progressive and democratic _ has slipped right
through the crack,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   But the strength of the Islamic party, Pas, which formed a
temporary and ill-fitting tactical alliance with supporters of
Anwar, posed a new problem for Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Pas' repeat victory in the state assembly of Kelantan and the
extension of its control to the state of Terengganu opened the
possibility of a backlash against Mahathir within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   The political action now moves to Umno's party congress next
year. But with Anwar, who had been Mahathir's heir apparent, now
out of politics, the party does not appear for now to have a
credible challenger to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The current political drama began in mid-1998 when Anwar
appeared to be preparing the ground for a challenge to Mahathir. In
response, Mahathir fired him, then had him put on trial in the most
lurid political drama Malaysia has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has since been sentenced to a six-year prison term for
corruption and a second trial has begun on charges of sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposition's biggest symbolic victory Monday, his wife,
Wan Aziza Wan Ismail, won one of the few seats to be taken by the
party she founded, Keadilan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy yet sad because I wish my husband were
around,'' she said. ``I have called the prison tonight to tell my
husband of our victory but the prison said it was already too late.
First thing tomorrow I will convey the good news to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday morning if he found her victory significant,
Mahathir displayed some of the animosity that has emerged in his
comments about his former protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of sympathy when you go around with
your child and cry,'' he said. ``It pulls at the heartstrings of
people. The question is whether she can contribute anything at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition heavyweights, both in Keadilan and in a vocal
ethnic Chinese opposition party, lost their parliamentary races.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mahathir's animosity has also been directed at the
foreign press, which has at times lionized Anwar. At the victory
celebration, a member of the crowd called out to the prime
minister, ``I want you to tell the foreign press not to write
anything bad about us anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   Still smiling his victory smile, Mahathir took the bait.
``That's freedom of the press,'' he said, ``to write or not to
write or to tell lies.''

<P>
   Odd thing about tragedy: It sometimes can be appallingly funny.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' the final one-act
presented in ``bash, latter day plays,'' Neil LaBute's
pre-millennial post-mortem on contemporary American morality.
</P>
<P>
   In this torturously tense, sharply written vignette, which takes
a vicious left turn about midway through, Calista Flockhart and
Paul Rudd play Boston College sweethearts who've returned for the
weekend to their New York home for a big formal party at the Plaza
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As the story moves forward and back through dueling monologues,
Sue (Flockhart) tells us how her boyfriend John (Rudd) accidentally
pricked himself with a needle while pinning on her corsage. The
sight of John's blood excited her, Sue confesses, as she lets out a
strange, hysterical giggle that causes some in the audience to
giggle nervously, too.
</P>
<P>
   That Sue's bizarre, vaguely comic anecdote should prefigure a
much uglier and bloodier incident, involving a pair of gay men
unlucky enough to be in Central Park at the wrong time of night, is
indicative of LaBute's chilling ability to conceal big, nasty
surprises in pretty packages. It's hardly coincidental that Sue is
being played by the actress known as America's prime-time
heartthrob, Ally McBeal, in what amounts to a brutal rebuttal of
prefabricated pop-culture expectations (although Rudd's crafty,
cockeyed performance is the one worth watching here).
</P>
<P>
   It's probably fair to say that ``bash,'' which opened a limited
run Sunday night at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills, won't
provoke many mixed reactions. As with LaBute's two highly praised
feature films, ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and
Neighbors,'' this theatrical triptych is unsparing in its evocation
of the casual viciousness of modern-day life, especially as
practiced by the male half of the species.
</P>
<P>
   While some viewers have taken that viewpoint as evidence of the
author's misogyny, or worse, what finally stands out from these
cold-blooded parables is an unflinching, if savagely ironic
humanism, which is offset by the kind of cryptic fatalism you'd
expect from a Greek oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly unrelated at first, the three one-acts jostle each
other in disconcerting ways. Like a Polaroid slowly materializing,
the nebulous trio of narratives gradually takes on sharper coloring
and resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening monologue, ``Medea Redux,'' Flockhart (in the
stronger of her two appearances) portrays a young, blue-collar
Midwestern woman testifying about a love affair gone horribly wrong
with her former junior high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting alone at a table with only a tape recorder and a glass
of water, harshly lit by an overhead lamp (James Vermeulen supplies
the ominous lighting design), she recounts the disturbing details
of the romance to a group of unseen interrogators whose responses
can only be inferred.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging on cigarettes and dropping her ``g's,'' Flockhart
convinces us of her character's mix of naivete and knowingness,
innocence and calculation, just as the playlet itself skillfully
situates a modern tabloid-style subject within the highbrow
literary context of Euripidean blood-lust (as its title suggests).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, classical Greek ideas about fate, and whatever gods
still exist, surface throughout this otherwise very late-'90s
drama. In the middle vignette, ``Iphigenia in Orem,'' a blandly
likable Utah traveling salesman (played by Ron Eldard with
disarmingly creepy candor) admits to a horrifying deed while
pondering its cosmic significance in, of all places, a Las Vegas
hotel room. When he momentarily loses his story line and tells his
(again, unseen) confessor that, ``I have gotten off the path
somehow,'' he fingers the deeper sense of moral dislocation that
hovers over the play like a brooding deity.
</P>
<P>
   Like Scott Pask's starkly metaphorical set design, LaBute's
writing is straightforward but allusive, edged with references to
corporate mergers, sharks, Mormonism, childhood, Hollywood movies
and so on. If his style occasionally feels heavy-handed, Joe
Mantello's sensitive, hyperbole-free direction keeps the
production's focus on its three engaging young actors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the actions they speak of are supremely ugly, ``bash'' as
a whole exhibits a startling beauty, hard and cold to the touch,
yet packed with a warming truth. &QL;

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ When Martin McGuinness was nominated
Monday to be the Cabinet minister in charge of education in
Northern Ireland's new government, there was a sharp intake of
breath in the august chamber at Stormont, and Sammy Wilson looked
like he was about to keel over.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a schoolteacher, and his Democratic Unionist colleagues
had just spent the better part of three hours inside the reconvened
Northern Ireland Assembly denouncing McGuinness and other members
of Sinn Fein as a bunch of murderers unfit for public office.
</P>
<P>
   But at 5:45 p.m., local time, Martin McGuinness, a former leader
of the Irish Republican Army, became Sammy Wilson's boss.
</P>
<P>
   The gasps from Wilson's corner were quickly followed by hisses,
and John Alderdice, the assembly's moderator, threatened to clear
the house.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator who has spent a decade
persuading the IRA to let politics take over in their campaign for
a united Ireland, ignored the hecklers, taking his pledge of office
in Irish, then English, and yet another milestone in the peace
process had been passed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's nomination of the 10 Cabinet ministers who will
administer the first power-sharing government to include all shades
of opinion in Northern Ireland was the first step in a weeklong
process of returning political power here since 1972, at the height
of the violence that has killed some 3,500 people since 1969.
Britain has ruled directly from London since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the British Parliament will begin the legislative
process that is expected to see power devolved to Northern Ireland
by Thursday. On that day, the IRA is expected to designate a
representative to discuss disarming with an international group
headed up by a retired Canadian army general.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting of the 108-member assembly was its first since
July 15, when it was suspended amid scenes of farce. Four months
ago, McGuinness was nominated as minister for agriculture, leading
Wilson and others in the Democratic Unionist party led by the
fundamentalist preacher Rev. Ian Paisley to yell that McGuinness
knew a lot about fertilizer _ a less than subtle reference to the
IRA's practice of using fertilizer for some of its bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But those nominations were declared null and void after just 15
minutes, and the assembly suspended, when the largest party, the
Ulster Unionists, refused to take part in the process. The Ulster
Unionists, who represent most Protestants in Northern Ireland,
refused to sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA began
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, the British and Irish governments asked George
Mitchell, the former US Senator from Maine, to save the Good Friday
Agreement he had brokered in April 1998, which created the assembly
and was supposed to transform the debate over Northern Ireland's
status from a violent to a strictly political one.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three months of Mitchell's patient diplomacy,
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble agreed to drop his party's
``no guns, no government'' policy in return for evidence that the
IRA was serious about disarming. On Saturday, Trimble, who is the
assembly's first minister, got his party to back the compromise
only after promising he would resign and collapse the assembly if
the IRA does not begin disarming by February.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the assembly in July came after Seamus Mallon,
deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which
represents most Irish Catholic nationalists, resigned as the
assembly's deputy first minister. The assembly's first order of
business Monday was to approve a motion rejecting Mallon's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The motion passed easily, 71-to-28, but not before those who
want the assembly, and the whole Good Friday Agreement, to collapse
spent three hours complaining that the rules had been bent to avoid
a new election that could have seen Trimble and Mallon replaced.
Paisley's deputy, Peter Robinson, suggested Mallon should be called
``the minister for loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley also failed to get the 30 votes needed to debate his
motion calling for Sinn Fein to be excluded from holding office in
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams tried to assuage hard-line
unionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unionists have nothing to fear from sharing power with
republicans,'' he said. ``Our future is bound up together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-liners were having none of it, and they continued
to make catcalls. When some spectators coughed on cue in an attempt
to drown out Adams, he complained that there were ``latcheekoes''
in the gallery. The coughers, young men who support Paisley, looked
at each other perplexed, unaware they had been called buffoons in
Irish slang.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session showed how much a work in progress the assembly
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point of order!'' Robinson yelled at one point. Robinson said
that while it was common knowledge that parliamentary privilege
allowed him to call someone a liar without fear of legal
repercussions, he wanted to know whether it extended to calling
someone a murderer. Looking as perplexed as the young toughs who
had been called latcheekoes, Alderdice said he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears that Paisley and his crowd would use
parliamentary procedure to throw a wrench into the strict timetable
for returning power to politicians here. But for all their
complaints, the Democratic Unionists took their two seats in the
Cabinet alongside McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein
official who was put in charge of health.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley said the distinction was that his people would not sit
in the same room with Sinn Fein Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, as people here are fond of saying,
Paisley's people were in the same room as Sinn Fein, and Martin
McGuinness was still Sammy Wilson's boss.

OPRAH WINFREY LAWSUIT SILENCES PUBLIC DEBATE ON FOOD PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   In 1996, Oprah Winfrey and her television guest, former rancher
Howard Lyman of the Humane Society, were sued by Texas cattle
barons for disparaging cattle. And freedom of speech was mugged.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey and Lyman, in light of England's ``mad cow disease'' and
possible links to a fatal degenerative brain disease in humans, had
questioned the feed practices of the cattle industry in the United
States on her TV program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Winfrey won convincingly in the lower federal court in
1998, the judge did not strike down the Texas food disparagement
law as unconstitutional. The law is still on the books. And still
being used to try to silence critics.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle ranchers appealed the lower court's decision to the
U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court will
render its decision soon. Nevertheless, the cattlemen's $10 million
lawsuit has already cost Winfrey over a million dollars to fight
it. Most citizens and many companies could not afford the risk of
such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen's lawsuit has sent waves of caution across the
nation. Who can afford to fight a food industry in a court of law?
</P>
<P>
   And that is the point. Stifle all discussion about food
processing, growth hormones and other chemicals used to produce
larger crops or fatter livestock, pesticides and herbicides,
genetically engineered foods, irradiating fruits and vegetables,
questionable practices in feeding livestock, slaughterhouse
techniques, pollution from hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   The list is formidable and important to our health.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states now have food disparagement laws. And two other
states, California and Michigan, currently have bills pending in
their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, states want to protect their farmers and
ranchers from losing business. They need consumers to trust their
products. But these food disparagement laws violate both the spirit
and the letter of the First Amendment _ worse, they stifle debate
on public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural groups and producers advertise the safety and
quality of their foods in local and national media. They have every
right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Having done so, however, means those groups and producers are
now ``public figures.'' And First Amendment principles that are
applied to them change and are more strict.
</P>
<P>
   Under settled First Amendment law, to recover damages in a libel
lawsuit, a public figure must first prove that the person who is
accused of libel has made a damaging public statement that is
factually false and did so knowing the statement was false, or with
reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions, like ``I hate broccoli,'' are protected under normal
First Amendment jurisprudence. No so in food libel laws.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, most of these food disparagement laws will be struck
down, but not before they have endangered the health and nutrition
of the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only 13 states have these laws, they have an effect
nationally. A book on food published in New York might cause a
lawsuit to be filed in Idaho, which has a food disparagement law.
Oprah Winfrey's television program originates in Chicago, but she
was sued in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of the Nation reported that actor Alec Baldwin
approached numerous television channels and networks with a
proposal for a documentary entitled ``The History of Food'' and
that he was turned down. The Nation story quotes Baldwin: ``But all
of these outlets, they're like, `Oh, God! We can't do that, because
of that Oprah Winfrey beef lawsuit.' I mean this is what I'm
getting from the History Channel. They just say, `We'll call you.'
And I never hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Hatherill is a research scientist and faculty member
of the Environmental Studies Program at the University of
California at Santa Barbara. He wrote a commentary piece for the
Los Angeles Times in April in which he describes his publisher
having ``stripped lengthy passages'' from his new book, ``Eat to
Beat Cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatherill wrote: ``I was not allowed to disclose dangers
inherent in some common foods like dairy and meat products, as well
as over-the-counter medicines like calcium supplements and
nonprescription pain remedies. The problem had nothing to do with
whether there was sufficient evidence to support the claims _ there
is _ it came down to fear of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `We could win the lawsuit, but it would cost us
millions, and it's just not worth it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to try to protect the produce of your local
rancher and farmer with these food defamation laws, quite another
to end up protecting corporate giants like Monsanto Co. According
to a June 1, New York Times front-page story by Melody Petersen,
over a year ago, ``Vital Health Publishing of Bloomingdale, Ill.,
canceled a book, `Against the Grain: Biotechnology and the
Corporate Takeover of Your Food,' after the manuscript had been
sent to the printers. The publisher had received a letter from a
lawyer at Monsanto Co. who said he believed the manuscript, which
he had not seen, included false statements that would disparage a
herbicide called Roundup, made by Monsanto.''
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologist Marc Lappe, who co-authored the book, said the
manuscript had already been approved by the publisher's lawyer.
``But Monsanto's letter changed the lawyer's mind.'' Lappe and his
co-author, Britt Bailey, found another publisher, Common Courage
Press, which published the book last November. And, according to
the New York Times story, the new publisher has not heard a word
from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it was a bullying tactic made by a giant corporation
that has the resources to take anyone to court and bury them, even
if those they take to court eventually win.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association
threatened an environmental group in Vermont for distributing
reports questioning the health safety of irradiating fruits and
vegetables. In a letter from United's law firm, the group, Food and
Water, was told that nearly 30 states had passed or were
considering legislation that allowed lawsuits against anyone who
disseminated false statements against agricultural products. The
letter ended, ``We must advise you that Food and Water's actions
will be closely scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final verdict in the Oprah Winfrey lawsuit, the
damage has been done to public discourse about issues concerning
food, diet, health and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The few illustrations of how public debate on these issues was
smothered shows only the surface of the problem. It reaches
ordinary individuals who educated themselves on these issues in
order to speak out in concern for public health. Many have been
silenced.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas beef barons have crammed their bull manure into the
mouths of legitimate public debate.

   STUTTERHEIM, South Africa _ A city councilman proudly pointed
out the progress here on a recent day, stamping on a stretch of
recently tarred road. Someday, he said, the roads will all be
paved.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed at the new reservoir that supplies communal taps that
used to run dry. Some day, he said, every house will have indoor
plumbing. He pointed at the 500 new houses rising from stacks of
bricks, to be equipped with sinks and toilets. ``Soon, we will all
be flushing,'' said the councilman, Lloyd Mgwangqa.
</P>
<P>
   But a noisy constituent jeered at his words, her bare feet
slapping against the sandy lane as she trailed behind him. She
jabbed her finger toward crumbling mud houses and miles of dirt
road. ``What do you say about my house, councilor?'' she hissed.
``When will we get what you promised?''
</P>
<P>
   This small town's struggle to improve the lives of its residents
demonstrates the enormous challenge confronting South Africa's new
president, Thabo Mbeki, as he strives to undo the legacy of
apartheid, which banished millions of blacks to desolate towns
lacking infrastructure and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Staggering under the weight of their poor citizens, without an
adequate tax base and staffed by inexperienced and sometimes
corrupt officials, at least a third of this country's 843
municipalities cannot meet their basic financial obligations, much
less build houses for people who need them, government officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has committed his government to providing basic services
to the poor, to bridge the yawning gap between well-off whites and
impoverished blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But in this town of 35,000, there is not enough money to pave
roads, to install sewer pipes or to build houses for the remaining
2,000 families who need them.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Mgwangqa and six other black activists swept
onto the City Council with the slogan ``One house, one tap.'' They
hung the photograph of Stutterheim's first black mayor, one of the
seven, in Town Hall. But they quickly learned the limits of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 60 percent of the overwhelmingly unemployed
population does not pay taxes or service fees, leaving the town
with little cash for capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of good plans, and we made a lot of promises,''
admitted Mgwangqa, who still uses an outhouse and a communal water
tap at home. ``But the means are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with cities and towns that cannot provide necessary
services, the national government plans to overhaul the entire
system of local government. Officials announced in early November
that they would merge weak towns with stronger ones to maximize
resources, reducing the number of municipalities by 60 percent _ to
about 330. The change is to be made in time for local elections
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Stutterheim, in fact, is often celebrated as a strong town,
because it has managed to make some improvements while continuing
to pay creditors and salaries. Indeed, much progress has already
been made since the end of apartheid, with 3 million people housed.
</P>
<P>
   But the need remains enormous. About 7.5 million people in this
country of 39 million still lack access to running water, officials
say. Twenty-one million go without sanitation. And 3 million more
need housing.
</P>
<P>
   The government is encouraging struggling localities to team up
with other towns, community groups and private sector partners to
provide services more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Pending legislation would require local officials to meet
performance standards and to eliminate property tax exemptions and
rebates for wealthy country clubs, rural landowners and
government-owned property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the package of reforms, all of them complement
one another to build an effective system of local government,''
said Jackie Manche, the acting deputy director general of the
national Department of Provincial and Local government. ``It will
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation will be far from painless. Under the new
system, Stutterheim expects to inherit several rural villages with
about 20,000 more underserved people.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prospect that local officials dread.
</P>
<P>
   They say it would cost about $8.3 million over the next five
years to build houses, install sewer systems, pave roads and
provide basic services for just the town's current population. But
the current budget allows only $1.5 million in capital spending in
that time. The 500 houses under construction are being built with a
combination of grants and national and local government money.
</P>
<P>
   If they cannot serve their own people, the officials say, how
can they possibly serve 20,000 more? As it stands, the town will
have to borrow money next year to help cover operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Pretoria, national officials say they are searching for
financing to help such towns. In Stutterheim, local officials are
praying for some kind of miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could find a fairy godfather somewhere, I'd show you what
this town could do,'' says Leslie DuRandt, the town manager.
``Right now, we're not doing enough. We just don't have the
money.''

STUTTERHEIM, South Africa: the money.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the white national government's final year in power,
Stutterheim, then a white town of 5,000 people, had a municipal
budget of about $2 million, officials say. The adjacent black
township of 25,000, known as Mlungisi, had a budget of about
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The math tells the story: $400 spent on each white citizen, $24
on each black citizen. Even today, with both communities united in
one municipality, blacks peer down the hill at the brick houses and
paved roads of the white world below and shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   History still speaks through the dirt roads, the crumbling
shacks and the outhouses that sag in most backyards of the hilltop
black community. The neglect is visible in black communities across
the country, which were deemed unworthy of investment under the old
government.
</P>
<P>
   Mlungisi's black politicians share their community's
frustration. Of seven black council members, three are still
unemployed even now, four years after voters swept them into power.
Sometimes they feel ill-equipped to serve on the front lines of
their nation's transformation process, stymied as they are by
limited resources and their own inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   They are teachers, a former miner and a woman who sold goods in
the local market, many of whom took office without ever having
balanced a ledger, who must now push and prod their town out of the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming in to redistribute wealth, to make things
happen,'' said Mayor Chris Magwangqana, recalling the heady days
after the municipal elections of 1995. ``We said, ``We'll take from
the haves and give to the have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mxolisi Mbulawa, the deputy mayor: ``And get big houses
and tarred streets and all of those things. Those were dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some found their tongues twisting over the new
vocabulary of contract bidding and budgets, heretofores and
hereafters. Many felt intimidated by the two white council members,
who represent the white wards, and by the all-white staff of civil
servants who spoke the language of ordinances and bylaws as
fluently as the black council members spoke their native tongue,
Xhosa.
</P>
<P>
   The white members were determined not to let the white section
of town deteriorate, even if that meant the former township would
be upgraded only gradually, and they easily dominated the early
meetings and the first budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``White people were jumping up and talking and we were so
reserved,'' Mbulawa remembered. ``You're thinking, `What am I going
to say? Is it the correct way of doing this?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides say they now share similar goals. Councilman
Daniel A. Kropf, 65, drove to Mlungisi for the first time in his
life two years ago, to see it for himself. ``It showed me what a
mess the last government had made,'' he said recently. ``Things
should have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The black council members agree now that the town must spend
money on pruning trees, minding community gardens and repairing
roads in the white section of town if they hope to lure new
businesses and ease unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But there is painfully little money available.
</P>
<P>
   In Mlungisi, despite the prodding and pleading of public
officials, about 73 percent of the population still is not paying
water and sanitation fees. Residents currently owe the town $1
million money that could be used for capital projects _ and that
debt is increasing by about $17,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, residents owe municipalities more than $1 billion,
despite a national campaign to encourage payment. Here, when the
town cuts service to debtors, people simply reconnect their water
illegally or go without.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and unemployment are often the reason people do not pay.
But there is another reason. After years of using payment boycotts
as a way to protest apartheid, people still find it hard to see why
they should pay, especially when not much has changed in the way of
service.
</P>
<P>
   Yongama Gxowa, chairman of the council's finance committee, has
seen such doubt glimmering in the eyes of his constituents. He
remembers explaining at a community meeting that he led why people
must pay for services and how much they must pay.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd listened politely and then asked for clarification
from the white town treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like bursting,'' Gxowa said. ``You elect your own
people and the trust is still with the white man?''
</P>
<P>
   But for many poor people, it is simply hard to believe that the
white town's treasury is not overflowing with cash.
</P>
<P>
   When the council first presented its housing plan to the
community, for instance, some people complained that the two-room
houses looked like outhouses. Even the apartheid government would
have done better, they said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the process lagged for months as officials haggled with
contractors, some constituents accused their leaders of embezzling
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, you don't feel happy you're a councilor,'' Mbulawa
said. ``You get into a rowdy meeting. You hear people shouting and
singing your name. You go home. You sit down with your wife. Your
wife says, `These people are singing about you. Why are you
sticking to this council? I don't want any troubles sticking to our
children.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And you ask yourself, `What shall I lose if I give up?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the council does not give up. Instead, they designated an
employee to persuade people to pay their water bills. They buy road
maintenance equipment second-hand. They left a staff engineer's
position vacant to save on the salary.
</P>
<P>
   They offered space to a local foundation, which has financing to
build a sports center. They allowed needy black villagers to graze
cattle on council land.
</P>
<P>
   And they acknowledge that their work will not get easier any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to see what we're achieving even now,'' Kropf
said ruefully. ``We've had no road repairs for 18 months. And
definitely, there's a deterioration as far as whites are
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the black council members are concerned, the community
will have to put the big dreams on hold. But they say they will
keep searching for grants, for investors, for ways to make small
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our progress here is not in leaps and bounds,'' Gxowa said.
``It's just one step forward, one step forward. But it's moving.''

   COLOMBEY-LES-DEUX-EGLISES, France _ Coming here is a ritual of
French politics. Even some of the country's highest office holders
come to this small village, three hours from Paris by car, every
year on the anniversary of Charles de Gaulle's death.
</P>
<P>
   They go to Mass in the simple church next to the former
president's grave. They lay flowers by his modest marker in the
cemetery, which stands out mostly because of the nearly 100 other
plaques honoring him that are planted all around it.
</P>
<P>
   The general has been dead for almost 30 years. But there is
still political mileage to be gotten from being associated with his
name. In fact, a fierce battle is under way over who are the real
Gaullists.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac's party, Rally for the Republic, has
always claimed the title. But after a disastrous 1997 legislative
election and a poor showing in recent European parliamentary
elections, Chirac is now facing competition from a breakaway group
eager to claim that they are the real Gaullists.
</P>
<P>
   What is a Gaullist these days? It's hard to get an answer. Part
of the problem is that it is hard to imagine what the general might
have had to say about some of today's issues. Would he have
reproached Jose Bove, who bulldozed a McDonald's to protest U.S.
taxes on Roquefort and pate? Would he have invaded Kosovo? Bought
British beef?
</P>
<P>
   Even those who came to pay homage at his grave recently didn't
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that being a Gaullist means being devoted to French
sovereignty and French values. Others said it is more of a question
of morality. Even when he was president, de Gaulle paid the tab for
his guests at Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that the general still casts a long
shadow over French politics and remains one of the country's most
beloved figures. A new play about him, ``The Man Who Said No'' (a
reference to his refusal to accept Germany's domination of France)
was sold out for months before it opened on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The play is a gaudy two-hour-and-10-minute history lesson
without an intermission and regularly punctuated with drum rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some 3,000 people _ ranging in age from those who might have
actually been in the French resistance to those who are way past
their bedtime _ attend each show. They applaud whenever the actor
playing de Gaulle rallies the French underground, tells Winston
Churchill what he will or will not tolerate or calls for unity
among the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   The critics have applauded it as a ``spectacle.'' Many have
simply written their own odes to de Gaulle, who was a virtually
unknown rebel at the start of World War II. Yet he managed, with no
power other than his lucidity and will, to claim that he was the
legitimate voice of France.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to bully his way toward his goals, restoring France's
power, integrity and status _ even at a time when he was wholly
dependent on the good will of the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's anniversary pilgrimage to Colombey-les-deux-Eglises,
which is in the Champagne region, was more complicated than usual
because of the rivalry between the Rally for the Republic and the
breakaway group, the Rally for France, now under the leadership of
a former interior minister, Charles Pasqua.
</P>
<P>
   The day had to be carefully choreographed so the two groups
would never meet. Pasqua is seen as the kingmaker behind Chirac,
and his defection may be a serious blow to the president's
ambitions to be re-elected in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But because Chirac is still president he is able to claim
certain privileges. He came first to visit de Gaulle's grave on
Nov. 9. He observed a minute of silence and bowed from the waist
before launching into a round of handshaking and autograph signing
that was carried on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   The Rally for France supporters came next, issuing gentlemanly
jabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to look for inspiration,'' said Phillipe Pemezec,
a legislator who joined Pasqua. Chirac's supporters, he added
``were coming to confess their errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the two tour buses unloaded members from
Chirac's team. ``The general belongs to all French people,'' said
Patrick Devedjian, a long-time legislator, staring into the
television cameras. ``But some of us try to carry on with his
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle was not actually born in Colombey. He bought his house
here in 1934. After the Allies liberated Paris in 1944, he briefly
became the country's president, then returned here to live. In
1958, the French called him back to lead again, and for more than a
decade he rebuilt and dominated France.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his retirement in 1969, he returned here again and died the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   He was essentially pushed out of office after badly losing a
referendum on government structures that he had instigated. But few
French people dwell on that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who even paid his own electric bill,'' said
Jacques Alexandre, 66, the manager of a fiber optics company who
traveled several hours to mark the general's death. ``He stood for
morality. Not like today when all our politicians have their hands
in the till.''

CLINTON SIGNS $385 BILLION BUDGET MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed into law Monday the final
2000 budget bill, giving himself and Republicans a pat on the back
for reaching agreement on the massive $385 billion spending package
that he said would build a ``stronger, better America'' in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the bill makes ``real progress'' toward fulfilling his
goals of hiring 100,000 new teachers and 50,000 more police
officers, Clinton nonetheless acknowledged that the spending
measure does not provide the managed healthcare reforms he had
sought or relief for the elderly hard-hit by high prescription
costs. He also expressed disappointment at Congress' refusal to
increase the minimum wage or pass new gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to fight on for those issues when Congress
reconvenes in January. He used the White House signing ceremony to
challenge Republicans to put aside political differences in next
year's election to work on business ``left undone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the weeks and months ahead, we can achieve these vital
goals if we keep in mind that the disagreements we have are far
less important than our shared values and our shared
responsibilities in the future,'' the president said at the signing
event, where he shared a stage with teachers, police officers and a
bipartisan group of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill, which rounds out the federal budget for the
2000 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, was nearly two months late
because of disputes between Clinton and Republican leaders over
funding for new teachers and police, overdue U.S. payments to the
United Nations and provisions that would have weakened
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after both sides gave a little on some issues that a
deal was struck on the final bill funding the Departments of
Education, Labor, Commerce, Interior, State, Justice, and Health
and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton used the signing ceremony to tout his
accomplishments, such as a downpayment on the $1 billion owed to
the United Nations and $1.8 billion for the Middle East peace
process, Republican lawmakers who attended also did some boasting.
</P>
<P>
   They took credit for making Clinton agree to a 0.38 percent
across-the-board spending cut in all government departments and for
insisting that the 2000 budget not rely on Social Security
surpluses to pay for increased funding in some programs. They also
cited increases in spending for defense, veterans affairs, and
health research above what Clinton had originally requested in his
budget proposal back in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new dynamic in budgeting is not to spend the Social
Security trust fund money,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, while the president claims ... a number of victories to
his own platform, we contend we did a number of things that we
wanted to do. And most of all, and most importantly, we did not
touch the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next year, Domenici said Republicans would try
once again to pass another ``major tax cut,'' despite the fact that
their $792 billion plan last summer failed to win public support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was proud that the spending plan will maintain
``the fiscal discipline that has turned deficits into surpluses and
gives us what will be in February the longest economic expansion in
the history of the United States.''

to come is a CD of previously unreleased material by Notorious

``are'' you?) and new music from Rakim, Ghostface Killah and DMX.

his mouth is almost bleeding. Intriguing, fun stuff, but you gotta

IS RUSH TO LASER SURGERY SHOTSIGHTED?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by EYE SURGERY-HOMEWORK) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From her first losing encounter with an eye chart as a
kindergartner, glasses were Karen McCormick's constant childhood
companion. Later came contact lenses and the almost daily
irritation caused by chronically dry eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed for the Keller High School honor student one
morning this month at a posh Arlington, Texas, clinic called TLC
(The Laser Center). With the rat-tat-tat of a laser machine,
microscopic amounts of tissue were removed from the cornea of each
eye. When the $4,600 procedure called LASIK surgery was finished
after only 15 minutes, McCormick could immediately read a wall
clock without glasses or contacts, for her an almost unprecedented
feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh,'' McCormick said a few days after the surgery that
corrected her acute nearsightedness to virtually perfect vision.
``Just today I got out of the shower and went to get my glasses,
then I thought, `Wait a minute. I don't need glasses anymore.' I
tell people that it seems almost like magic. It's just incredible
in that short of time you can have that much improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Such happy incredulity is increasingly familiar in a country
where the number of LASIK patients has roughly doubled every year
for the past four. This year an estimated 1 million people will
undergo the surgery. They are people who now play tennis, jog,
water ski, see the morning alarm clock, or shave their legs in the
shower without glasses or contacts, many for the first time.
Celebrities, from Tiger Woods to Troy Aikman, have cashed in on the
LASIK craze, too.
</P>
<P>
   So why then the spate of recent articles, which, while not
exactly raining on the LASIK parade, have struck decidedly
cautionary notes? It seems that somewhere in the growing
celebration, the stories say, an important message has been lost:
With LASIK, as in any surgery, there are risks, relatively minimal
(less than a 5 percent risk of complications for experienced
surgeons using the best equipment), but risks nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   And some insist that the whole thing is moving too fast.
Inexperienced doctors eager to cash in, critics say, can be too
prone to operate on high-risk patients, who themselves are too
eager to gain the seemingly miraculous benefits. Thousands can
testify to the irksome and occasionally disabling consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Carver, an electrical engineer in Beaumont in East Texas,
said no one at a bustling Houston eye clinic warned him that his
degree of astigmatism made him a poor candidate for the procedure.
(The clinic did not return a recent telephone call inquiring about
Carver's case.) After two LASIK surgeries, in September and
December of last year, Carver's sight is much worse than it was
before. His career has been disrupted. He can no longer drive at
night. His condition, which pitched him into a severe depression
for weeks, is not correctable with available technology.
</P>
<P>
   Through an Internet site devoted to the risks of LASIK
(www.surgicaleyes.org), Carver has encountered scores of people,
many of them with LASIK outcomes even worse than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to think we're down on the surgery
itself,'' Carver said. ``For the right person with the right doctor
and right equipment, it's very good surgery. But the problem is
that the industry has gotten ahead of itself, and there are
casualties being created because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For almost a half-century, specialists around the world have
targeted the cornea, the eye's curved, transparent outer layer, in
their attempts to find surgical remedies for the most common visual
maladies. The reason is that much of the eye's refraction, or
bending of light to form an image inside the eye, takes place
through the cornea. A cornea too steeply curved commonly produces
nearsightedness, one too flat, farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1960s, specialists in Japan and the Soviet
Union reshaped corneas with a series of incisions, a procedure
known as radial keratotomy, or RK. But the surgery was painful,
generally took months to heal and was prone to complications, and
the cornea often failed to retain its new shape. Largely as a
result, RK never really took hold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the excimer laser, which was first developed in the 1970s
as a tool to etch computer microchips. The laser's precision was
such that it could cut notches in a strand of hair without severing
it. And the excimer was a cool laser, meaning it would not burn
tissue if applied to surgical use.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Trokel, a Columbia University ophthalmologist, was
among the first to realize that potential application. In the early
1980s, in a visit to a computer lab, Trokel experimented with the
excimer on the eye of a calf. A few years later at Louisiana State
University, the laser was tested on the eyes of humans whose
blindness was believed to be irreversible, said Irving Arons, a
Massachusetts-based consultant to the medical laser industry. One
of those patients had her vision restored, Arons said.
</P>
<P>
   The excimer emergence first spawned a procedure known as PRK
(photorefractive keratectomy) in which the cornea's outer layer was
gently scraped away with a scalpel and the laser then used to
reshape the tissue beneath. When the outer layer grew back, the
cornea retained its corrected shape.
</P>
<P>
   Although an improvement over RK, healing from PRK could still be
slow and painful. That changed with LASIK, (laser-assisted in situ
keratomileusis), in which pain generally abates in a few hours and
patients can gain visual benefits almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The real advance of LASIK is not in the laser itself, but in the
method of exposing the inner layer of the cornea for reshaping.
Using a device called a microkeratome, surgeons delicately peel
back a layer of the cornea about the thickness of a grape skin,
leaving one end of the layer attached to create a corneal flap.
</P>
<P>
   In Karen McCormick's recent surgery at TLC, located at The
Ballpark in Arlington, the patient's nervous parents watched on a
television monitor as the microkeratome slid across her eye,
creating a flap that her eye surgeon, Dr. Robert Gillett, gently
folded out of the way. When the computer-controlled laser treatment
was finished, Gillett teased the flap back into place on the
cornea, patting it down with several strokes of a small brush. The
burning sensation in McCormick's eyes abated in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, creating the flap is the most delicate and risky
portion of the procedure, and not until the mid-1990s, when
microkeratome technology had advanced enough to make it safe, did
LASIK begin to find an audience among eye specialists and their
patients. But once it did, because of the quick healing and almost
instantaneous results, LASIK became a snowball rolling downhill, a
phenomenon that grew, at least in the early stages, by word of
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, as LASIK advertising accelerates, the experience of
friends, relatives and co-workers often is the most powerful
endorsement. Carolyn Ender listened for months as colleagues at a
Las Colinas investment firm spoke of their LASIK miracles. At the
same time, Ender's husband, Brad, had grown weary of putting in
contact lenses for his early morning jogs, inspiring the couple to
undergo LASIK one after another, a few hours after McCormick's
surgery at TLC.
</P>
<P>
   Then they had ``miracle'' stories of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our procedure at 2, and at 8 that night my wife and I
are both sitting there watching a movie without glasses,'' Brad
Ender said. ``It's like you have a brand-new pair of contacts in,
but it's better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   But there are other LASIK stories, those of annoyance, even
heartbreak, that until recently have remained in the shadows. Just
in the last few months, those tales have begun popping up in the
American media, from The New York Times to Forbes to an Oct. 11
cover story in Time. The Time article did not ignore the successes,
quoting the typically gleeful patients after procedures that went
as planned.
</P>
<P>
   But Time also pointed out, as would good doctors, that people
requiring a high degree of correction in glasses or contact lenses,
or those with unusually large pupils, may not make good candidates
for LASIK. The story detailed the glare, starbursts and halos
around lights that sometimes afflict LASIK patients, generally at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting industry studies, Time said that an estimated 10 to 15
percent of LASIK patients must undergo a second surgery to get
their correction right. Time's LASIK package also included the
personal story of a magazine staffer, who, after her own
unsuccessful surgery, wondered whether she would ever see her
children in clear focus again.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from around the country poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People responded to the fact that there was any downside
mentioned at all,'' said Christine Gorman, who wrote the Time
article, ``that this was elective surgery on your eyes, and not
something you should jump into. ... We got all kinds of letters
from people with problems who said things like `I thought I was the
only one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also responded, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really nice array of letters, including those from
ophthalmologists who do the surgery, thanking us for piercing the
hype, so to speak,'' she said. ``Interestingly enough, some of the
more commercial doctors were not too happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from such articles, one that would not be disputed
by reputable physicians, is thus: Prospective patients, as eager as
they may be to discard glasses and contacts, need to take a deep
breath and do their homework. It is their only set of eyes, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth woman says she was sobered by her recent LASIK
surgery in which her corneas were apparently overcorrected. It
became dangerous for her to drive at night because of the myriad
circles that surrounded each lamp and headlight. She has been
assured by her doctor that the problem can be corrected with a
second surgery. But her case illustrates the fact that problems do
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to get a lot of information about what they're doing
and what options there might be,'' the woman said of her advice to
potential LASIK patients. ``But also they should ask themselves
just how uncomfortable they are with contacts. It is a big deal. I
think they are doing so many and you see so much coverage on TV
that some people think it's like going to get a hamburger at
McDonald's. And it's a serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does the LASIK truth lie?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is surgery. It's not perfect. There will be
complications,'' said Dr. Stephen Slade, a Houston surgeon who has
pioneered LASIK surgery in the United States. ``The good news is
the complication rate is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   So low, Slade says, that eye doctors are undergoing LASIK
surgery in much larger percentages than the general public. And
risk, Slade says, can be minimized by patients who recognize the
surgery's seriousness and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for a patient,'' he said.
``The patient needs to look around, talk to different doctors and
different patients, read something. The best combination is an
experienced surgeon and an experienced patient.''

<P>
   For most, LASIK surgery will be a 15-minute miracle. For a few,
the procedure can be a nightmare. But a knowledgeable patient can
dramatically reduce chances of serious complications. Some consumer
tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the many surgeons performing LASIK, find one with
experience who has performed several hundred LASIK surgeries, at
minimum. Most surgeons performing LASIK have been trained by
companies that manufacture the lasers and microkeratomes, and are
monitored by experienced physicians while performing their first
surgeries. But complication rates generally go down as a surgeon's
experience goes up. Ask about your surgeon's complication rate, and
whether he or she has performed LASIK on other eye doctors, the
most educated consumers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your eye. Many experts say that the risk of LASIK
complications increases for people suffering from severe
nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. Those with
abnormally large pupils or dry eyes can also be considered poor
LASIK candidates. Discuss this thoroughly with your physician if
any of these conditions apply to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know the equipment. Does your eye surgeon use a
state-of-the-art microkeratome, the instrument used to create the
corneal flap? Lasers manufactured by the companies Visx of
California and Massachusetts-based Summit Technology are considered
industry standards. Be wary of other brands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of bargains. The most experienced surgeons using the
finest equipment might charge more, but the extra cost will be
worth it. After all, it's your only set of eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hit the Internet. Dozens of Web sites are devoted to LASIK,
including www.surgicaleyes.com, a site composed largely of stories
of LASIK patients with bad experiences.

   Third Eye Blind, ``Blue,'' Elektra: Because band singer Stephan
Jenkins' mouth is almost as big as his ego, this San Fran pop-rock
quartet quickly gained a bum rap, causing critics to either slam or
ignore the band's excellent 1997 self-titled debut. They should
have saved the mud-slinging for ``Blue.'' What a mess: Out of tune,
out of focus and out of ideas, 3EB stumbles through ``Blue,''
offering only one or two decent moments. Here was their chance to
prove the critics wrong; they blew it.

REVAMP OF HEALTH SYSTEM NEEDED TO ROOT OUT ERRORS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rooting out deadly medical errors will require a top-to-bottom
transformation of America's health care system, including a
controversial requirement that hospitals and other providers report
their mistakes to the government, the nation's most prestigious
medical group warns.
</P>
<P>
   Prescribing the wrong drugs, removing the wrong organs, making
the wrong diagnoses and other common mistakes kill between 44,000
and 98,000 people a year at US hospitals, and many more at
day-surgery centers, nursing homes and other settings, according to
the report from the National Academy of Science's Institute of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Using even the most conservative estimate, the authors added
Monday, more people die from medical errors each year than from
suicides, highway accidents, breast cancer or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the errors especially tragic is that so many could be
prevented so easily as the Boston Globe reported in a series on
medical errors earlier this year. But since medicine is making so
little progress, the institute decided to call for an ambitious
series of steps to be taken, soon, all of which it says can cut
mistakes by 50 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   First, it called on Congress to create a National Center for
Patient Safety. Modeling itself after agencies that regulate
airlines and workplaces, the center would set national
error-reduction goals, track progress in meeting them, and sponsor
research on new safety strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also recommended laws that require hospitals and
other health care providers to report to state governments errors
that lead to serious injuries or deaths. And it called on HMOs,
corporations and the public to push health providers to design
systems that standardize procedures, simplify equipment and
otherwise build mistake-prevention into everything they do.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps would be expensive, with the Center for Patient
Safety eventually receiving upwards of $100 million a year. But
that pales next to the $15 billion to $30 billion a year that
preventable medical errors cost each year in terms of added health
expenses and lost days of work.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first in a series the institute is issuing to
improve the quality of health care in America, was prepared by the
nation's leading experts in patient safety, including several from
Boston. Massachusetts has been a leader in requiring hospitals to
report their serious mistakes and in encouraging them to implement
the kinds of error-reduction strategies outlined in the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely makes sense,'' Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice
president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association, said of the
new study. ``I think if national leaders want a model of how to
comprehensively approach the problem of patient safety and medical
errors, they ought to come and look at what we've begun in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see real results in hospitals and we're
seeing a surge of energy within the larger health care community .
. . We're doing it not government versus provider, or hospital
versus physician, but we're doing it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Corrigan, who directed the institute study, said that
while its recommendations are bold, they also ``are doable. I don't
want to say it will be easy, but it can be accomplished. It's very
reasonable to expect a 50 percent reduction in medical errors.''

ALTA VISTA ACQUIRES RAGING BULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., looking to strengthen two of its fast-growing
Internet investments, said Monday its AltaVista Web portal will
acquire Raging Bull Inc., an online investor chat forum that CMGI
helped launch.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the stock-for-stock transaction between the two
privately-held companies weren't released. AltaVista Co. is based
in Palo Alto, Calif. and Raging Bull is headquartered in Andover,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, the venture capital investment and holding company based
in Andover, whose stock has grown sevenfold in the past 12 months,
saw its shares surge again Monday, closing at 155 1/2, up 8 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   By merging Raging Bull into AltaVista, CMGI furthers its
longstanding goal of linking its Internet portfolio of companies
together to create a destination site designed to appeal to a wide
audience . By adding Raging Bull's Web surfers to its AltaVista
portal, CMGI expects to build traffic and attract significant
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's Raging Bull for investors, but we see branching out
to create other online communities, like Raging Sports, Raging
Travel, Raging Health, even Raging Recipes,'' said Stephen Killeen,
who will continue as Raging Bull president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, which raised $20 million in venture capital since it
was formed in May 1998, is 50 percent owned by CMGI. It caters to
investors looking to swap information about stocks and chat about
strategies. Free to site visitors and supported by such long-term
advertisers as Fidelity Investments, National Discount Brokers and
Morgan Standley Dean Witter, Raging Bull has attracted significant
advertiser interest because people spend more than 20 minutes per
visit.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a community for non-professional stock pickers,
Raging Bull this year has also become the second most popular
online investor forum behind Yahoo! Inc.'s stock market and finance
section. Killeen said that of the 1.76 million Raging Bull
visitors, 315,000 are registered members, enabling them to post
messages and obtain real-time quotes.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, initially created by Digital Equipment Corp. and
subsequently acquired by Compaq Computer Corp., became part of CMGI
earlier this year, when CMGI bought 83 percent of the Web portal
for $1.9 billion. Compaq is now a minority investor.
</P>
<P>
   The Raging Bull acquistion also strengthens CMGI plans for an
expected AltaVista initial public offering next year, noted some
Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raging Bull brings world-class financial content and one of
the Web's top indivicual investor communities to AltaVista,'' said
Rod Schrock, president and chief executive of AltaVista Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, AltaVista was the nation's 11th most visited site,
according to MediaMetrix, Inc. a New York-based Internet research
firm. With the acquistionn of Raging Bull, CMGI claims AltaVista
will rise to become the ninth largest portal, surpassing Amazon.com
and Time-Warner Inc.

US TO SCRUTINIZE BOEING PRODUCTION METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Aircraft-Safety)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about quality control problems at Boeing Co.
production facilities that led to parts failing flammability tests
and rivet guns left inside fuel tanks, the Federal Aviation
Administration said Monday it will begin an in-depth review of
quality assurance at the Seattle airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said there was no immediate safety concern
involving Boeing airplanes currently in service, but said the
special audit _ which will begin Thursday and last at least three
months _ will determine if the previous quality assurance slips are
isolated or something ``more systemic in nature,'' said Beth
Erickson, director of aircraft certification for the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation comes a month after EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing
767-300 aircraft, crashed off Nantucket, Mass. killing all 217
passengers and crew. The National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the crash, has found no mechanical problem
that would have caused the crash. Some investigators believe a
copilot may have deliberately caused the plane to crash.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials stressed that none of the four quality assurance
``slips'' resulted in accidents, and they believe them to be
isolated incidents. Each was discovered by Boeing or one of its
customers and the manufacturer alerted the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The review will take place across Boeing's commercial product
line. Officials could not say whether it will affect the delivery
schedule of airplanes. ``That is a secondary issue for us,'' said
Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said special evaluations ``always result in
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had a scheduled audit in May 1998, and its last special
audit was in January 1998 concerning fasteners in 737 tail
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said the current audit ``is more in-depth and focused''
than a regularly scheduled biannual audit and will look at
communication between engineering and manufacturering, and parts
receiving and manufacturing planning. ``In essence, we are checking
requirements to see that the design that is spelled out is
implemented,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you do not like to have the kinds of issues and
visibility we have had in the past few weeks,'' said Boeing
spokeswoman Susan Bradley. ``But we welcome the opportunity to
validate a system that we think works well.''
</P>
<P>
   The four recent problems that necessitated the special review
are:
</P>
<P>
   --American Airlines, in doing a heavy maintenance check of one
of its 767 aircraft discovered improperly tightened bolts in the
vertical fin of the airplane. Boeing then discovered a similar
problem in some planes in production.
</P>
<P>
   --Ventilation ducts in 737, 757 and 767 airplanes had an
adhesive sprayed on them to keep a Fiberglas wrapping in place,
rather than having the adhesive placed in strips as designed. As a
result, the excess adhesive failed a flammability test.
</P>
<P>
   --Fuel cell doors in airplanes are cleaned with a fluid and then
coated with an anticorrosive. Boeing changed the type of cleaning
solution used because of Environmental Protection Agency
requirements, and the coating no longer adhered as well. The
Associated Press reported debris such as sealant tubes and rivet
guns were left behind in some tanks.
</P>
<P>
   --Earlier this month, Boeing and the FAA said the company was
halting delivery on 747s, 757s, 767s, and 777s because a piece of
cockpit insulation was being manufactured improperly and in a burn
test ``failed miserably,'' said a high-ranking FAA official. A
different type of adhesive was used on the insulation, known as
drip shields. New drip shields were installed in planes in
production.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said the FAA is still studying how best to remedy the
problems in planes that are in service. Together, the four problems
could affect thousands of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA will have eight people working full-time on the audit
and will use the four cases as guideposts to look at how Boeing
builds airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the bolts being undertightened, we saw an
inappropriate translation from an engineering requirement to a work
instruction and that could be a similar system issue in other
areas,'' said Erickson.

INTERNS WIN RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AT PRIVATE HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board agreed Monday with a group of
Boston Medical Center interns and residents that
physicians-in-training have the right to unionize in private
hospitals across the nation _ and strike if they choose to.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans on both sides predicted the board's 3-2 decision _
overturning a 23-year-old precedent _ will be a watershed in the
relations between US teaching hospitals and the interns and
residents who provide much of their patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Many said it is also likely to boost emerging US efforts to
unionize American physicians in general. ``This changes the
climate,'' said Ross Rubin of Physicians for Responsible
Negotiations, a doctors' union recently organized by the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine that this decision won't stimulate that
kind of activity,'' agreed Dr. Jordan Cohen, president of the
Association of American Medical Colleges, which strenuously opposed
the recognition of interns' and residents' unions. ``This is not a
happy day for the medical profession.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many within the profession _ from the president of the
AMA to left-wing unionists _ were buoyed by the federal board's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Reardon, the AMA president, said in an interview that
residents and interns convinced the association that ``they were
not being heard by hospitals and deans on issues like working
hours, reimbursement, and patient care concerns.'' The AMA filed a
brief supporting the Boston doctors' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many residents will be pleased'' by the federal board's
decision, said Dr. Andrew Yacht, chief medical resident at Boston
Medical Center. ``With hospitals merging right and left and
ancillary staff being cut, I don't think anybody's happy waiting
around to see where the ax falls next.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the National Labor Relations Board decision,
Boston Medical Center must hold an election within 30 days on
formal recognition of the House Officers Association, which was
born in 1948 at Boston City Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boston Medical Center argued against compulsory union
recognition on the grounds that it would disrupt training programs,
the hospital's general counsel, Edward J. Christiansen, said in a
statement that the outcome ``will have little effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision resulted from a petition filed three years ago by
the House Officers Association at Boston Medical Center,
representing 430 interns and residents.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Boston City Council, the House Officers
Association won grudging recognition on a voluntary basis from
Boston Medical Center when the private nonprofit hospital was
created in mid-1996, through the merger of Boston City Hospital and
the private University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' group then petitioned the National Labor Relations
Board to overturn its 1976 decision, in a Los Angeles case, that
interns and residents were not entitled to collective bargaining
rights because they are primarily students, not employees.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Los Angeles decision and a similar 1977 one ``flawed
in many respects,'' the majority of the the Labor Relations Board
said it was convinced by ``the overwhelming weight of judicial and
scholarly opinion that the Board reached an erroneous conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted with the board's decision because it gives
collecting bargaining rights to over 90,000 hardworking interns and
residents on the front lines of health care,'' said Dr. Ladi
Haroona, president of the New York City-based Committee of Interns
and Residents, a national union of which the Boston House Officers
Association is a local arm.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 1976 decision, only 10,000 of the nation's
103,000 interns and residents are unionized. They work primarily in
public hospitals in states that give collective bargaining rights
to public-sector employees, but not the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levy, executive director of the Committee of Interns and
Residents, said the group, an affiliate of the Service Employees
International Union, will step up efforts to organize doctors in
private hospitals, especially in California and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there will be organizing in New York and the Boston
area,'' Levy said. ``We have had had phone calls and meetings with
residents. That will continue on a different level now that people
have rights.''
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement Monday that the federal board's
decision will change the balance of power in perennial disputes
over such issues as trainees' working hours, even in hospitals that
stave off unionization.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose organization represents US medical schools and
teaching hospitals, said he hoped his members would step up efforts
to make interns and residents feel their complaints about hours and
working conditions are being heard so they won't ``feel the need to
align themselves with traditional labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Labor Relations Board decision gives residents,
interns, and postgraduate trainees called fellows the right to
strike, that issue is a sensitive one among physician organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that issue is really a smokescreen,'' Levy said.
Official recognition of collective bargaining rights, he said,
``should decrease the chances of conflict'' between physicians and
teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In organizing interns and residents across the country, the
Committee of Interns and Residents will be competing against an AMA
spinoff, Physicians for Responsible Negotiations, which has
renounced the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are physicians first and foremost,'' said Yacht when asked
about the possibility of striking. ``I would hope and pray nobody
in our position would ever jeopardize patient care. However, we may
need to take action sometimes to protect our ability to take care
of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, members of the House Officers Association at Boston
City Hospital went on a six-day strike, but they maintained
staffing for emergencies during the job action.

CALCULATING THE WEIGHT OF NOTHINGNESS CALLED SCIENCE'S NO. 1
MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct slug on 2nd Take)  (nk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the sorcerer's apprentice, who could not banish the spirits
that his spells had conjured up, astronomers around the world have
been trying _ with increasing desperation _ to disprove an
astonishing discovery announced early last year: Distant galaxies
are being swept apart, ever faster, by a tide formed of apparently
empty space.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have long known that the universe is
expanding, they had assumed that the expansion was gradually
slowing because of the gravitational attractions of the galaxies.
Instead, scientists announced last year, some antigravity effect
seemed to be accelerating the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was such a challenge to conventional theories that
most scientists assumed they would quickly discredit the theory.
But almost two years of effort to do so has yielded observational
data that only support the conclusion. Last month, a subtle but
initially promising objection to the measurements of the
accelerating expansion by one group of astronomers was disproved by
a new analysis of that data.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, a different team of astronomers reported its
observations of ripples in the gases of the young universe, before
stars and galaxies had even formed. Though the observations
supported a favored theory of how the universe began, they also
provided fresh new evidence of the distressing finding that
something in the wastelands of space could be pushing against
gravity. So scientists are reluctantly accepting the notion that
something in the most fundamental theories of physics is terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To explain their observations, scientists say, they must answer
a question that sounds paradoxical: How much does emptiness weigh?
</P>
<P>
   Although the answer has eluded scientists since Einstein first
raised the question more than 70 years ago, physicists are
comfortable with the idea that a seemingly perfect vacuum could
weigh something. According to the theory of elementary particle
physics, even a vacuum is filled with fields containing energy and
evanescent particles that flit in and out of existence, adding heft
to nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Einstein, this ``funny energy,'' as cosmologists
have sometimes called it, would be so different from ordinary
matter and energy that it would have the opposite gravitational
effect, producing repulsion instead of attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But when physicists try to use conventional theories to
calculate how much energy should repose in emptiness, the result is
a vacuum so monstrously heavy that it would blow the universe
apart. Galaxies, stars, planets and life could never have formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest embarrassment in theoretical physics,''
Dr. Michael Turner, an astrophysicist and cosmologist at the
University of Chicago, said of the weight problem. ``Every attempt
to calculate it has gotten an absurd answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Wilczek, a particle physicist at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., called the nothingness problem
``maybe the most fundamentally mysterious thing in basic science.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeff Harvey, a physicist at the University of Chicago, said,
``Basically, people don't have a clue as to how to solve this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists have gone so far as to wash their hands of the
search for a solution, suggesting simply that all of the calculated
weight of a vacuum is the product of imperfect theories and that
some other strange inhabitant of empty space could be pushing the
galaxies apart. They call this shifting, flowing form of energy
quintessence.
</P>
<P>
   Though any weight of the vacuum should stay the same over cosmic
time, accelerating the expansion with a steady nudge, quintessence
could push more strongly at some times, more weakly at others.
Because the key to those changes may lie in the properties of
matter and space as they exist at energies that are unattainable on
earth, the universe would become in effect a giant physics
experiment, said Dr. Andreas J. Albrecht, a physicist at the
University of California in Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessence or no quintessence, until the weight problem is
solved, physicists are forced to concede that they do not have a
fully working theory of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, not only for cosmology but for elementary particle
theory, this is the bone in our throat,'' said Dr. Steven Weinberg,
a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Texas,
who shared a Nobel Prize in 1979 for his work in theories of
elementary particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the difficulties presented by the observations that
distant galaxies are flying apart faster and faster, those
observations have actually helped to solidify other cosmic
theories, especially one that predicts the amount of matter and
energy in the universe and explains how it formed large structures.
That makes the observations impossible to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   The provoking measurements were first reported last year by two
teams of astronomers, one led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and one by Dr. Brian Schmidt of the
Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The
astronomers used the unexpected dimness of exploding stars in
far-off galaxies, the dimness indicating their unexpectedly great
distance, to show that the cosmic expansion discovered decades
earlier has been speeding up over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most astronomers, it was a very uncomfortable, unsettling
thing,'' said Dr. Robert Kirshner, a member of Schmidt's group at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the new observations of cosmic acceleration were so
unsettling, said Albrecht of the University of California, that ``a
reasonable position for someone to take is that the observations
are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So astronomers have done everything they can to find a flaw. But
since the first announcements, dozens of new observations have
offered nothing but support.
</P>
<P>
   Now Perlmutter has proposed a satellite that would observe
thousands of exploding stars a year to make even more stringent
tests of the original findings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sorcerer in this tale of nothingness, it would be
Einstein, who formulated his theory of general relativity in 1915.
That theory successfully describes how gravity warps space and
moves galaxies, stars, planets and other matter around in the
cosmos. But when Einstein applied his theory to the entire
universe, which was thought at the time to be static and
unchanging, he realized that the mutual attraction of all its
galaxies would rapidly cause them to collapse together in a fiery
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   So Einstein theorized in 1917 that some other force must be
holding things apart. He called this theoretical fudge factor ``the
cosmological constant'' and thought of it as a uniform energy
permeating all of space. Because of Einstein's equation describing
the equivalence of mass and energy, E(EQ)mc2, the energy of the
cosmological constant can also be regarded as mass, or weight.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years later, though, Einstein was rethinking his
fudge factor. By then, astronomers had discovered that galaxies
were not static, after all, but were flying apart as a legacy of
what they theorize was the Big Bang explosion, to which most
cosmologists attribute the origin of the universe. Gravity would at
most slow down the expansion and cause a re-collapse hundreds of
billions of years in the future, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The fudge factor was unnecessary; in fact, Einstein renounced it
and called it his ``biggest blunder.'' Though the idea saw sporadic
revivals over the decades, it ended in obscurity. So the discovery
that Einstein might have been right in the first place has left
physicists at a loss. ``Clearly, there is something that
everybody's missing,'' said Wilczek, who happens to live in the
house Einstein once occupied in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The weight problem ``would be No. 1 on my list of things to
figure out,'' said Dr. Edward Witten, a physicist at the Institute
for Advanced Study, who leads the effort using an advanced theory
called string theory to unify what is known about the interactions
of all particles in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   That urgency has led Weinberg and others to a suggestion that
some physicists regard as desperate. He has raised the possibility
that there have been many Big Bang universes, most of which really
do have huge cosmological constants that are incompatible with
life. But by the luck of the draw, a very few would have lighter
vacuums like the one in this universe, and only in such universes
could life, and physicists, exist to ponder the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Weinberg seems convinced that this solution is the
right one. In one of his papers on the topic, he included a poem by
Hughes Mearns that captures the endless frustration that physicists
have faced in calculating the weight of emptiness:
</P>
<P>
   As I was going up the stair
</P>
<P>
   I met a man who wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there again today.
</P>
<P>
   I wish, I wish he'd stay away.

BIOETHICISTS URGE PANEL TO OVERSEE STEM CELL USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a year since scientists reported isolating ``stem
cells'' from days-old human embryos, saying it could open a new
medical frontier in which specialized cells derived from stem cells
might be used to repair almost any body part damaged by disease or
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this potential, stem cell research has lagged because of
unresolved ethical and political debates over the use of human
embryos to obtain the key cells.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three bioethicists are calling for an end to the impasse
and the establishment of a federal panel to oversee all embryo and
stem cell research, both public and private.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that research using human embryos can secure US
public support if that support is accompanied by much more explicit
and open federal regulation and oversight,'' the ethicists write in
a commentary being published Tuesday in the journal Nature
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are George Annas of the Boston University School of
Public Health, Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center, and Dr. Sherman Elias of the University of Illinois
at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, federal funds can't be used for any research in which
human embryos, such as those created by in vitro fertilization, are
destroyed. As a result, private funds were used in isolating the
stem cells, and private firms are carrying out most of the research
aimed at medical applications of stem cells. This is
``unsatisfactory public policy,'' the ethicists said, and called
for private and public embryo research to be overseen by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The ethicists specifically criticized a Massachusetts biotech
company that's pursuing stem cell research, Advanced Cell
Technology Inc. of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ACT officials said last November that they had combined adult
human cells with cow eggs that had been stripped of their nucleus.
The result, a clone made much the way Dolly the sheep was created,
was a hybrid human-cow embryo which did not, however, develop into
a fetus. Their intent, ACT officials said, was to produce stem
cells for making repair organs and tissues, not to create an
individual.
</P>
<P>
   But ACT's announcement of the human-cow embryo research was made
to a newspaper, not a scientific journal: company officials said it
was intended to spark a national ethical debate. The bioethicists
called the episode ``disturbing'' and said ethics ``must be
discussed before proceeding, not after the research is a fait
accompli.'' They also said the potential dangers of mixing human
and cow DNA are not well understood, and added, ``there is a
powerful moral case against using this source of stem cells in
human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, ACT chief executive officer Michael West said in an
interview Monday that the bioethicists' objections are moot,
because other research suggests that the small amount of cow DNA in
the laboratory-made embryo eventually vanishes, leaving a wholly
human embryo.
</P>
<P>
   West said he knew he was risking criticism by announcing the
human-cow research to a newspaper instead of reporting it in a
scientific journal, but wanted to launch a wide debate on the
ethics before going further with the project.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical dilemmas of stem cell research have been reviewed by
the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, the National Institutes
of Health, and the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. The NBAC issued a report in September saying it was
morally appropriate to take stem cells from embryos created by in
vitro fertilization for couples who decided they no longer want
them. (Such research could not be funded by the federal government
under current law.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does make sense to sacrifice some embryos'' to make
stem cell research possible, said Caplan, the Pennsylvania
bioethicist, in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Caplan said, the various parties in the controversy
have avoided facing that issue head-on. What's needed, he said, is
to have a debate in Congress on whether embryos remaining after
fertility treatments can ethically be used to obtain stem cells,
and if the answer is yes (as he and the other ethicists think it
should be), the research could go forward under the oversight of
the special federal panel they recommend.

<P>
   Thousands of heart specialists watched on closed-circuit
television monitors at the Washington Convention Center as a tiny
device was implanted in a patient's coronary artery. The doctors
heard the voice of Dr. Martin Leon, a prominent cardiologist who
was describing the operation taking place in a hospital many miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Paragon stent,'' Leon said, identifying the tiny
wire cage that can hold blocked arteries open, as the names of the
device and its manufacturer scrolled across the screen. ``It's a
very nice stent.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who conducted research on the experimental device,
enthusiastically described its soft feel, its flexibility and its
similarity to a top-selling stent. The remarks seemed the perfect
endorsement from an objective scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But Leon was anything but a disinterested observer. What he did
not tell the assembled doctors was that he was an investor in the
company that manufactured the stent. And after the company
announced a merger that same week, he would be among a group of
about 100 investors who stood to share in as much as $75 million in
stock _ provided that the company hit certain business goals,
including sales targets for the stent he had so eagerly
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Leon is not the only one to wear many hats in the world of
medical devices. There, inventors are researchers. Researchers are
promoters. Promoters are investors. And, finishing the circle,
investors are inventors. Rare is the truly disinterested
researcher, with no stake in the outcome of a study. It is a
phenomenon found in every medical treatment using devices, from
laser surgery to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, scientists on the front line of such medical
research, whose work can help determine treatment options for
countless Americans, often can earn vast wealth so long as their
results are positive. It is an immense financial pressure that
would be unacceptable in any other field of medical research.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the influence of these conflicts, The New
York Times examined interventional cardiology, a specialty where
some of the most rapid device development has occurred. The field
has emerged over the last 20 years, using tiny devices to remove
the coronary vessel obstructions that can lead to chest pain. Some
12 million Americans now suffer from coronary disease _ the
nation's top killer.
</P>
<P>
   To profit from this huge market, companies are scurrying to set
up professional and financial relationships with cardiologists who
invent and promote devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are an interventional cardiologist and you are working
hand in glove with the companies and you might have a financial
interest, what else is new?'' said Dr. David Hillis, a cardiologist
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ``If you
have no conflict of interest, then you would stand out like a sore
thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   But the examination by the Times found that those financial ties
have transformed the traditional system of objective medical
research and review. Now, the system used to determine which device
is best for heart patients can be influenced as much by personal
financial interests as by scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   This troubles some doctors. ``I treat a disease that's going to
kill half of all people in America,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, a
cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. ``How I treat that disease
ought not to be decided by who's lining someone else's pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cardiologists were less concerned and said they feared
changing the system to eradicate conflicts would slow the progress
of a field that has been a miracle, providing simple procedures
that alleviate often crippling pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know of any other option,'' said Dr. Paul S.
Teirstein, director of interventional cardiology at the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. ``If you want to
ban us from the research, that would crimp development. We supply a
lot of the creativity and push behind these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Leon expressed regret that what he described as
inattentiveness to potential conflicts would sully the reputation
of his medical specialty. Often, he said, doctors are unaware of
their own financial incentives _ for example, he said he had no
idea he was a beneficiary of a sales incentive for the Paragon
stent, and said that he later did not hesitate to present
disappointing data on the device at a medical meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to do well on the big things _ taking care of
patients,'' Leon said after being presented with findings from the
examination by the Times. ``We do less well on the fine details,
and the fine details are becoming important components as to how we
behave. It's important to re-dedicate ourselves and perhaps
redefine what the standards should be.''
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, some cardiologists fear that the influence of
potential riches has distorted medicine's search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science has been lost in the rush for money,'' Nissen of
the Cleveland Clinic said. ``We've lost our way. We've terribly,
terribly lost our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Brown could scarcely control his anticipation when the
business plan finally arrived from the company developing his new
medical device. But when he flipped through the document on that
day in 1997, he was aghast.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the 10th page, was a list of shareholders in the
company, including partners Brown had known nothing about. But he
certainly knew their names. They included Leon, who runs the
world's most prestigious educational meeting for interventional
cardiologists, and Teirstein, whose West Coast meeting is a close
competitor in influence. The two men together owned more than five
times the shares allocated to Brown, the interventional
cardiologist who had invented and patented the device, a probe
designed to detect a condition that leads to heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  What would the prominent doctors be doing for their shares?
According to the plan, they would conduct the critical clinical
trials on patients, despite owning stakes in the company, called
Medivas/Intravas. More important, they would promote the device at
the medical meetings they controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Through the two men, the plan says, the company ``has an ideal
forum to provide visibility for the projects to potential strategic
partners.'' Troubled by the ethics of the arrangement, Brown, then
at the University of California at San Diego, turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had just received a crash course in the workings of the
interventional cardiology business. With billions of dollars
pouring into the field, companies are finding ways to use prominent
doctors to promote and market their products.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Leon and Teirstein said they had no idea of the
role the business plan said they were supposed to play and that
they would not preferentially feature one company over another at
their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Carpenter, president and chief executive of Medivas,
said the business plan, which he said was confidential, was never
formally approved by the company.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with conflicts, interventional cardiologists have
adopted a loose policy of voluntary disclosure. Doctors who write
for medical journals or make presentations at educational forums
are expected to disclose to their colleagues every financial
conflict that might influence their judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But such disclosures often are haphazard and incomplete. For
example, neither Leon nor Teirstein revealed his stake in Medivas
in disclosure statements that are a routine part of medical
meetings. Many speakers, writers and investigators failed to
disclose their patents, investments and other corporate conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Teirstein said he did not mention his stake in Medivas because
there was no reason to _ the disclosure statements simply ask
doctors to tell of conflicts that are directly related to talks
they are giving, and Medivas products, a confidential list, were
not the subject of his talks.
</P>
<P>
   Leon said that even when he explicitly asked doctors to disclose
their conflicts, many did not. ``There were people who claimed no
conflict of interest who own companies,'' he said. Others, he said,
do not even return the disclosure forms they receive for his
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said such poor disclosure was a prime example of the
flaws in a system that relies on individual conscience to counter
possible scientific bias. ``Voluntary disclosure is not a very high
standard,'' said Marc A. Rodwin, an associate professor of law and
public policy at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at
Indiana University who has studied financial conflicts in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You can't have this up to the individual. The fact
that you have a conflict of interest means that you are not in a
good position to judge these kinds of issues, that your judgment is
compromised. That is the defining part of having a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial conflicts emerge at every stage of the scientific
process.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Maurice Buchbinder, then a doctor at the
University of California at San Diego, served as a principal
investigator in studies in the early 1990s examining a Rotablader,
a tiny drill used to remove plaque from arteries. But at the same
time, Buchbinder held a stake worth millions of dollars in Heart
Technologies, the company that sold the device.
</P>
<P>
   The independence of his studies eventually came under attack. A
1993 Food and Drug Administration audit of Buchbinder's research
found significant deficiencies, including failures to conduct
proper follow-up or to appropriately report problems experienced by
patients. The university subsequently banned him from other
research.
</P>
<P>
   Buchbinder, who continues to play a significant role in research
as director of interventional cardiology at Scripps Memorial
Hospital in San Diego, did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For other doctors, clinical trials can serve as a form of
investment research. For example, Dr. Richard A. Schatz, who
directs research in interventional cardiology at the Scripps Clinic
and Research Foundation, is now testing a new treatment, gene
therapy, using a method developed by a small company, Vascular
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   After treating six patients, Schatz said he was sure the
treatment was working. Now, he said, ``I've invested in the company
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vascular Genetics was founded by Dr. Jeffrey Isner, an
interventional cardiologist at Saint Elizabeth's Medical Center in
Boston. Isner, who is also a major shareholder in the company,
directs the company's clinical trials. He said his conflicts did
not pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to dismiss this out of hand,'' Isner said.
``But I'm not going to be a wimp and roll over because someone is
projecting a concern. I understand what the arguments are, but,
quite frankly, I don't agree with most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators are also on the boards of companies that
manufacture devices they are testing. For example, Leon is a
director of Angiosonics Inc., a device company based in Research
Triangle Park, N.C., while Buchbinder is on the board of Radiance
Medical Systems of Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As directors, both men have a fiduciary obligation to
shareholders. But as clinical investigators, their role is to be
neutral about the outcome of tests on the companies' products.
Those two responsibilities, experts said, cannot be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Leon said he now thought he should never have served in dual
roles, and that if he was going to be on the board, he should not
have been an investigator. ``In retrospect, that wasn't a good
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators with serious conflicts limit the amount of
research they will conduct. For example, Dr. Spencer King III,
director of interventional cardiology at Emory University and past
president of the American College of Cardiology, conducted studies
to determine the feasibility of a device he invented called the
Beta-Cath System. The device irradiates arteries to prevent the
return of coronary blockages pressed open by balloons.
</P>
<P>
   King had numerous conflicts. Besides being the inventor of the
device, he was a large shareholder in Novoste, the company that
held the rights to the product. In addition, he had a marketing
deal with Novoste that could pay him as much as $5 million if the
device was ever approved for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those conflicts, Emory ruled that King could conduct
the early studies, but could play no role in large-scale trials
that would be used by the government to determine whether to
approve Beta-Cath for sale. Still, even King's limited role brought
him potential benefits: On the day Novoste announced the results of
his study, the company's stock climbed as much as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   King acknowledged that conflicts in the field had to be handled
carefully. ``It's obviously an issue,'' he said. For trials used to
approve a device, ``you cannot have the people collecting and
publishing the data being the same people with the vested interest;
this is a conflict that is real.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The conflicts are not limited to investigators. Sometimes, the
doctors with conflicts are the same people who make presentations
at important medical meetings on the quality and importance of a
device.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Mark Wholey of the Pittsburgh Vascular
Institute was a featured speaker in September at a prominent
medical meeting, Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics,
universally known by cardiologists as the TCT. The program is the
meeting organized by Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Wholey spoke enthusiastically about using stents to open blocked
carotid arteries in the neck, in the hope of preventing strokes.
But, he cautioned, there was a danger: Shards of debris from the
procedure could lodge in the brain and cause a stroke. The way to
prevent that complication, he said, was to use a high-technology
filter.
</P>
<P>
   What he did not disclose _ in either his lecture or in the
meeting's disclosure form _ was that he had helped develop such a
filter and was a director of Angioguard, a Minnesota company
preparing to market it. The company was acquired last July by a
division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Wholey said he saw no reason to disclose his relationship with
Angioguard, in part because many companies make similar filters.
And after all, he said, his talk was about carotid stenting _ not
the filters that can make it better.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts were dismayed by the standards in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflicts are just overwhelming,'' said Dr. John Wasson, a
professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, when told
details of the findings by the Times. ``If you can't trust the
opinion leaders, and the so-called experts, and even worse, in some
cases, the studies themselves, what happens to the profession and
what happens to the patients?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julio Palmaz felt sure that his new idea could alleviate
chest pain for millions of patients _ if only he could persuade
somebody to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mid-1980s. Interventional cardiology had been
developing for less than a decade, using tiny balloons to squash
blockages against artery walls. Palmaz, a professor at the
University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, took the
idea one step further: he would use the balloon to insert a tiny,
expandable metal cage into the artery. Once the cage was opened, he
hoped, it would keep the vessel clear for far longer. But despite
his best efforts, no one was interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked really hard to get anyone to pay any attention,'' he
said in a recent interview. ``If I had not been passionate about
this idea, that idea would have gone into the trash can.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmaz finally found a financial backer _ an entrepreneur who
had built the Fudruckers restaurant chain _ and began his studies.
With support limited, he and his colleague, Dr. Richard Schatz, had
little choice but to conduct the trials themselves. The results
were strong, and soon, the Palmaz-Schatz stent was acquired by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson. The inventors became wealthy men and their story
became an inspiration to other cardiologists eager to sell their
ideas to a suddenly attentive industry.
</P>
<P>
   It is in those beginnings _ where inspired inventors struggled
to capture the attention of companies and investors _ that the
conflicts of today first found root. No longer financially
struggling, the industry has sprouted into a multibillion-dollar
business, with thousands of doctors joining the field. Yet even
though the reliance on researchers with conflicts is no longer
dictated by financial necessity, little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, medical companies realized that to develop
devices, they needed close relationships with the interventional
cardiologists _ the only people with the knowledge and experience
to come up with new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies do not have on-staff physicians,'' said Larry
Best, chief financial officer of the Boston Scientific Corp., one
of the most prominent device companies. ``We work with physicians
in partnership to pioneer new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Those collaborations began inauspiciously. In the early 1990s,
many of the companies were small and were still in the development
stage. To pay for the advisers they so desperately needed, the
financially struggling companies provided the doctors with stakes
in their companies in place of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their way of saying, `You're spending time, you're
involved in the process, you have to show some compensation for
your efforts,''' Leon said of the equity grants. ``I'm not
defending it; I'm saying that is the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the industry was transformed into a big business,
fortunes rained on corporate executives and interventional
cardiologists alike.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options once worth pennies have brought many doctors
millions. The riches helped attract an increasing number of doctors
to the field. Where once few cardiologists were available to
conduct research, now dozens are begging for a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins for the devices remained high. The price of
stents has remained an almost steady $1,500 for each of the tiny
devices even as the number being implanted, according to industry
estimates, grew to almost 1 million this year from 561,800 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a profitable market,'' said Kurt Kruger, an
industry analyst with Banc of America Securities, ``it was selling
little Bic pen springs for $1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   As the industry grew, the conflicts created by the relationships
between the cardiologists and industry quickly became important.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of drug development, companies rely on the types of
large-scale clinical trials that are intended to prevent
researchers from knowing which patients are being treated with a
new therapy and which are not. That ensures that any partiality by
researchers is less likely to affect the data.
</P>
<P>
   But the studies for devices were far looser. For years, to get a
device approved by the Food and Drug Administration, device makers
simply had to present data from a registry _ the experience of a
group of patients whom doctors, often the inventors of the devices,
had treated.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation, medical experts said, was to enroll patients in
the registry only if they appeared likely to do especially well
with the device, and to make excuses to drop patients if the device
was used on them but failed. With registries, experts said, study
results were more likely to come out positive, no matter what the
merits of a device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the clinical trials were just no good,'' said Dr.
Jeffery Brinker, an interventional cardiologist at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine who saw the data when he was
a member of an advisory panel to the FDA. ``They were observational
studies and they could easily be gamed by physicians, especially if
the doctors were using the device for competitive purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the FDA started requiring studies that were more
scientific, called randomized trials, which are intended to counter
potential bias by investigators. But by then many of the devices
were already on the market.

JUSTICES REFUSE TO REVIEW CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the objection of two justices, the Supreme
Court on Monday refused to consider the appeal of a convicted Texas
child molester who claimed he was denied a fair trial because of
the television testimony of a young accuser.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Steven Marx said his constitutional rights were violated
because a young witness to his sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl
was allowed to testify against him by closed-circuit television.
This televised testimony violated the Sixth Amendment requirement
that criminal defendants be permitted to confront their accusers in
open court, argued Marx's attorney, F.N. ``Trey'' Brown III of
Burnet, Texas, in the ill-fated appeal to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas disagreed with the
court's refusal to hear Marx's case, saying that ``the plain
meaning of the Bill of Rights'' demands that defendants have the
right to confront their accusers in person.
</P>
<P>
   Under Supreme Court practice, at least four of the nine justices
must vote to consider an appeal. The high court did not disclose
whether any other justice joined Scalia and Thomas in voting to
hear Marx's case.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to consider the appeal sets no national
precedent. But the justices' action leaves in place Texas court
decisions that allow young child-abuse witnesses to testify by
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of televised testimony arose at Marx's April 1995
Burnet County trial on charges of aggravated sexual assault. The
judge, at prosecutors' request, permitted the alleged victim and
the young witness, identified in court papers only as J.M., to
testify via closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that both girls would be ``traumatized'' if
required to testify in Marx's presence.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, after hearing all the testimony, convicted Marx of
aggravated sexual assault. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which
affirmed the conviction, 5-4. The state justices, by the slimmest
of majorities, said having the 6-year-old witness give televised
testimony did not violate Marx's Sixth Amendment right to confront
his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Texas court cited the U.S. Supreme Court's
1990 decision in Maryland vs. Craig that the Constitution permits
televised testimony in limited circumstances, such as when an
alleged victim of child abuse would suffer serious emotional trauma
if required to testify in front of her alleged attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Marx's attorney, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court,
arguing that the 1990 ruling allowed young victims _ but not mere
witnesses _ to testify outside the presence of their alleged
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, without explanation, rejected the appeal.

 UNDATED: the market.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, most studies remain small, and are often simply a
registry of the patients treated with one device by one group of
doctors. New devices that are variations of old ones often do not
require the randomized trials, even in cases where no such trials
were conducted on the original technology. Trials comparing the
devices with medical or surgical treatments _ most of which would
not be provided by the cardiologists themselves _ are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these are soapbox testimonials _ `We've put this in
26 patients and it works like a charm,''' Dr. Eric Topol, an
interventional cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said. He added
that in 20 years there had been perhaps 10 rigorous clinical trials
performed with such devices _ a number that many cardiologists
consider paltry.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong reason for the companies to avoid stricter
testing. ``Once you start a big randomized trial, it requires
rigor,'' Dr. Sheldon Goldberg, an interventional cardiologist at
Cooper Health Systems in Camden, N.J., said. ``People don't want to
do that now, because it is costly and it may turn out that your
product is not the greatest thing since sliced bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any interventional cardiologist or device company about the
future of the field, and the answer is invariably the same: The
business is headed from the heart out to the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The trend emerged as early as 1995, at the most important
meeting for many interventional cardiologists, the TCT. There,
leaders in the field enthusiastically told their colleagues that
they could use stents to open blockages in the legs, the abdomen
and even the carotid artery.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning sounded logical: The same process that clogs
coronary arteries also clogs blood vessels throughout the body. So
if a stent could open a coronary artery, why not use one to open an
artery elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Many cardiologists could hardly wait to get started. But at
least one doctor in the audience watched the unfolding proceedings
with a growing sense of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Roberts, now a professor of radiology at the University
of California at San Diego, who has also worked with the FDA,
understood one thing that was not being highlighted by the
speakers: There were no randomized trials to determine whether
these procedures were safe and effective. No one could say with
certainty whether the procedures would help people or hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that this was just incredibly terrible _ terrible to
basically promote this as something that everybody should be
doing,'' Roberts said. ``Nobody was saying, `We don't know if this
works.'''
</P>
<P>
   But registries soon were under way, and stents, approved by the
FDA for the coronary arteries and for arteries in the leg, could be
pressed into use for blood vessels elsewhere. Now Wall Street
analysts say that some of the biggest growth in the sale of devices
for interventional cardiology will come from doctors using them
outside the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many specialists who have traditionally treated these patients
are outraged. They say their new competitors are unqualified to do
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Several interventional cardiologists said the criticism was
borne of fear. The other specialists, these cardiologists said, are
afraid of losing business.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics _ including vascular surgeons; interventional
radiologists; neurologists, and nephrologists, who treat the kidney
_ said that far more was at stake. The cardiologists, they said,
may know about vessels leading to the heart but they are not
trained to decide whether or when to treat blocked vessels
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them 'ologists,'' said Dr. Samuel R. Money, chief of
vascular surgery at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans. ``One day
they are cardiologists. One day they are neurologists. Another day
they are nephrologists.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Money and other critics said, is that patients whose
conditions would traditionally be left alone, without any
treatment, are being wheeled in for unnecessary balloon procedures
and stenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know enough about the lesions, and they often end
up treating lesions that shouldn't be treated,'' said Dr. Frank
Veith, professor and chief of vascular surgical services at
Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in the Bronx. ``Their leaders are saying, `If you don't do this,
you're crazy and you're missing an opportunity.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say conclusively whether this is truly a debate
about patient safety or a turf battle between newly competing
specialties. That is because _ with the exception of treating
blocked arteries in the leg _ no randomized clinical trials have
compared stenting with traditional treatments for blocked vessels
outside the heart, including the option of doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With little good data available _ at a time when many device
companies are already including this new market in their sales
projections and business plans _ choices are being made for
treatments based on little more than anecdote and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Take carotid stenting. Surgeons had already perfected an
operation to open the carotid artery leading to the brain and to
clear it out. They had shown in a large clinical trial that the
operation could prevent strokes with low complication rates. When
cardiologists got started several years ago, they reasoned that
stents could do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   There were many failures at first. Dr. Gary S. Roubin, an
interventional cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan,
said it took him four years to discover how to do it well and which
patients would be helped and which harmed. During that initial
period, patients had major and minor strokes at almost three times
the rate that occurred with the surgery _ 9.3 percent as compared
with 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a steep learning curve,'' Roubin said. But now, he
and others say, they have become better at the technique and their
success rates are just as good as those with surgery. Their
evidence? Their own experience with registries of patients. While
the National Institutes of Health is now about to start a large
study in which patients with blocked carotid arteries will be
randomly assigned to have surgery or stents, the results will not
be known for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thousands of patients have had stents implanted
in their carotid arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The same cardiologists who helped develop devices for use in
coronary blood vessels are, meanwhile, working with companies to
develop devices for use in the carotid. Not only are they working
with makers of stents, but they are entering the newest arenas _
fine filters to catch pieces of blockage from the carotid artery
and prevent them from flowing to the brain, where they can cause
strokes, as stents are implanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflicts in this growing part of the field are not
limited to corporate relationships. The cardiologists have a large
interest in having their noncardiac patients choose the treatment
they can perform _ inserting stents. And with the cardiologists
diagnosing the blockages and treating them in their own way, there
is little chance that a patient will get the opinions of other
kinds of specialists who might recommend a standard treatment or no
treatment at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical centers are encouraging patients to request stents.
A recent newspaper advertisement placed by Lenox Hill Hospital
described stents as ``these tiny miracle devices'' and said they
could ``help prevent strokes'' as well as save kidneys from failing
and alleviate leg pain.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, some medical specialists fear, standard oversight is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our field is one where we work with other people, and we
always have people looking over our shoulder,'' said Roberts, the
interventional radiologist.
</P>
<P>
   But ``nobody is looking over their shoulder,'' Roberts said of
the interventional cardiologists. ``No one is ever checking on
them.''

   Looking for Maigret
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any tours that focus on the Parisian locations
mentioned by Georges Simenon in his Inspector Maigret novels? _
Sheila Lesser, The Bronx, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could start where the chief inspector ``lived,'' along
the Boulevard Richard Lenoir _ at 132, based on references in the
novels _ in the 11th Arrondissement. In the popular novels by the
Belgian author Georges Simenon, Chief Inspector Jules Maigret also
regularly dined at a fictional restaurant, Chez Paul, which is on
the very real Place Dauphine on the Ile de la Cite, in the First
Arrondissement. Elsewhere on the island, you'll find the
headquarters of the Police Judiciaire, at 36, Quai des Orfevres,
where Maigret (and his real-life counterparts) set to solving
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But be aware that most of Simenon's 100-plus Maigret novels and
short stories were written 30 to 60 years ago, set in a Paris of
long ago. And while Simenon was a master at capturing the feel of
the city, he did not rely on the kind of specific locations that
make it easy to assemble the kind of tour you seek.
</P>
<P>
   But there are guidebooks to provide some clues. Try ``Cafes of
Paris,'' by Christine Graf, which identifies a number of favorite
haunts. A 192-page paperback, it costs $13.95 plus $4 shipping from
The Literate Traveller, 8306 Wilshire Boulevard, No. 591, Beverly
Hills, Calif. 90211; (800) 850-2665.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an out-of-print book, ``Simenon's Paris,'' a guide
to the Paris of Maigret by the man who ought to know, Simenon
himself. This 1970 hardcover book (Dial Press, New York) is
available at www.barnesandnoble.com, at prices varying from $49 to
$63, depending on condition, or www.alibris.com, for $23. At
www.amazon.com, they'll query used-book dealers to try to find a
copy for you, too. It has maps on the endpapers and illustrations
by Frederick Franck. Just be sure (if you cannot read French) that
you buy an English-language edition.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Discovering Paris Bistros'' (Interlink Publishing Group,
Northampton, Mass.), Gaston Wijnen devotes a chapter to tiny
restaurants that the inspector would have enjoyed. This 1991 book
is out of print, but the online booksellers listed above had copies
for $10.36 to $17.
</P>
<P>
   There's an online chat room, www.trussel.com/maig/maibul.htm,
that can put you in touch with fellow Maigret fans, and you can
call up www.trussel.com/maig/marcom.htm for a discussion of Paris
addresses in Maigret novels.
</P>
<P>
   You can also contact the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau,
127, Avenue des Champs-Elysees, (33-8) 36.68.31.12.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry to Venice
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Trieste, Italy, in the spring and would like to
go to Venice by boat. Is there passenger service between the two
cities? _ Camille Hardy, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no ferry between Trieste and Venice, but if you are
determined to make this crossing of the Gulf of Venice, a 50-minute
trip south to Portoroz in Slovenia will take you to a boat that
does so.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrofoil Prince of Venice, a 128-foot vessel with 330
seats, a bar and a gift shop, operates from April 1 to Oct. 31.
Next year's schedule has not been set; this year, there were
departures from Portoroz daily at 8 a.m., with arrival in Venice at
10:30 a.m. It returned from Venice at 5:30 p.m., arriving in
Portoroz at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The one-way adult fare was $42, and round trip was $60; for ages
4 to 14, the round-trip fare was $30. For more information, contact
the Slovenian Tourist Office at (212) 358-9686 or
www.slovenia-tourism.si.
</P>
<P>
   Estate Planning
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there public transit from Paris to Vaux-le-Vicomte? What
about from London to Chatsworth? _ Lawrence J. Wathen Jr., Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A. Both of these large estates can be reached by public transit
or, in the case of Chatsworth, a package that includes breakfast,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with that one. Midland Mainline, (44-990) 125 242,
operates at least three trips a week to Chatsworth from April
through October. It begins with a train from St. Pancras station in
London to Chesterfield, the rail station nearest Chatsworth. From
there, a bus will take you to Chatsworth, where the private art
collection of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire includes
4,000-year-old Egyptian carvings and works by Rembrandt and
Gainsborough. The rates are $49.80 for standard class (including
admission to the house and garden), $54.78 for first class (with
admission to the house, garden and Regency Scots Room) and $66.40
for all of that plus a full cooked English breakfast (all prices at
$1.66 to a pound). The train leaves London 8:30 a.m. and reaches
Chatsworth by 11:30. The bus leaves Chatsworth at 4:30 p.m., and
you should be back in London by 7:45. Departures are Tuesday
through Thursday, more often if there is enough demand. Or you can
take the train to Chesterfield, then a public bus to Baslow, a
short walk from Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Vaux-le-Vicomte, the estate of Nicholas Fouquet
completed in 1661 that is considered to be the inspiration for
Versailles, you would go to the Gare de Lyon in Paris and take the
D2 line of the RER (the suburban Paris rail system) to Melun (about
a 30-minute ride). From Melun, it is about a four-mile cab ride to
the chateau.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's Other Home
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have been to Monticello, but only recently heard of
Jefferson's second home near Forest, Va. Can you tell us what is on
display and details of visiting it? _ Richard and Nancy Russell,
Jersey Shore, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. The house, Poplar Forest, is off Route 661 near Lynchburg,
(804) 525-1806, near the Blue Ridge Parkway. It is about a two-hour
ride from Charlottesville (two and a half days in 1806, when
construction began), and was a hideaway for Jefferson, where he
could read, write and play with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After Jefferson, the estate passed through several hands and was
extensively modified. About 20 years ago, it was close to being
demolished, but local residents bought the house. In 1986, it
opened to visitors and restoration work continues.
</P>
<P>
   The six-room octagonal house is undergoing renovation to bring
it back to its original condition, and watching this work is the

PROBERS SCAN BIBLE FOR CLUES TO MISSING CHILDREN

   Investigators trying to find two children missing from an
religious sect in Attleboro, Mass. are turning to the Bible for
help as they try to decode hundreds of pages of notes laden with
religious allusions.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Christian sect helped maintain copious
notes about the group's activities, according to Gerald Fizgerald,
a Bristol County assistant district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The notes, filling enough notebooks to pack a box of office
paper, ``are chock full'' of references to passages in the Bible,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously very religious people,'' Fitzgerald said.
``Each reference might be relevant, so you look it up. You've got
to, to make sure you know what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say they suspect that in September members of the
religious community buried the bodies of two children in Baxter
State Park in central Maine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the children, Samuel Robidoux, age 1 1/2, may have
starved to death because a sect member had a vision in which God
ordered that he be fed breast milk instead of solid food, according
to an entry in one of sect's journals seized by police.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's cousin, Jeremiah Corneau, was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators seized the notebooks from the group's Knight
Avenue home in Attleboro on Nov. 19 and ``went through them once
quickly,''looking for direct references to where the two boys might
be buried in Maine, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of police officers are rereading the material ``for
all the content, an extremely laborious process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a Bible as guide, it is sometimes difficult to make
sense of the notes, because they are written only for members of
the insular community, according to Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like sitting down and reading a book,'' he said.
``You can't knock it off like a mystery novel. ``The notes assume a
certain knowledge. They're not written for a second or third
party's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of information in the case was provided by a
9-year-old girl who belongs to the sect and told authorities that
Samuel ``wasn't feeding'' before he died and that the infant was
born ``without a breath.'' The girl also said that the children's
bodies were taken to Maine in a truck and buried in the state park
during a camping trip two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   A four-day search of Baxter State Park with dogs trained to
sniff for corpses was suspended a week ago after police combed the
area but failed to locate any remains.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen adults and 12 children belonged to the religious
sect, which follows a version of Christianity devised by Roger
Daneau and Samuel's grandfather, Roland Robidoux, who works as a
mason and a chimney sweeper.
</P>
<P>
   They interpret the Bible themselves and reject modern medicine,
to the point that group members could not wear glasses or seek
dental care, according to people who have dealt with the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group have refused to provide any information on
the missing children.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's father, Jaques Robidoux, is in jail on charges of
contempt of court after refusing to tell authorities the location
of his son. Karen Robidoux, the mother of the missing child, was
released from jail when she invoked her Fifth Amendments rights
against self-incrimination after investigators asked about her
son's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   David Corneau, Jeremiah's father, told authorities his son was
stillborn in August and ``never had a breath of life.'' But Corneau
refused to say where he buried the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Social Services has taken custody of the
other children belonging to the community.

IN LONDON, THE LAST `SENSATION' GIVES WAY TO THE NEXT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When you ask regulars of the London art scene what they
think of the furor caused in New York City by ``Sensation,'' the
exhibition of work by young British artists (or YBA's) at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, you get a range of reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are proud that the show packs such a wallop abroad.
Others seem taken aback by the vehemence of the outcry against it,
like the London gallery owner who exclaimed: ``My God! In the land
of the free!'' Still others cynically commend Charles Saatchi, the
English advertising executive who owns all the work in
``Sensation,'' for orchestrating further publicity for his
collection and the artists.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dinos Chapman, whose sexually mutated mannequins,
produced in collaboration with his brother, Jake, have contributed
to the Brooklyn controversy. Feigning perplexed anxiety, Chapman
asked, ``Does this mean I have to go back to being a YBA again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation'' is dead. Long live ``Sensation.'' A paraphrase of
that famous royal news flash seems to sum up the lively artistic
mood in London right now. The emergence of the YBA's _ or
``Sensation artists'' or ``Saatchi artists'' _ is a historic moment
that changed the stature of contemporary English art at home and
abroad. Yet the artists and Saatchi are being absorbed into an
expanding art scene.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of this expansion are numerous. The most prominent is the
coming of the Tate Modern, the gargantuan annex of the Tate
Gallery, which will open on the south side of the Thames next
spring. One of the world's largest museums devoted exclusively to
20th-century art, it will undoubtedly change the balance of power
in the international art world, especially among museums of
contemporary and modern art. Perhaps in anticipation, the gallery
scene is in a state of flux characterized by relocations and new
arrivals and is increasingly international. A small but telling
detail: The New York art dealer Larry Gagosian will open a London
branch next spring, something an American has not done in years, if
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The pace always quickens before the announcement of the Tate's
Turner Prize for a British artist. The work of four artists on this
year's short list has been on view at the Tate since late October.
The winner, on whom English bookies take bets, will be announced in
London on Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Turner show probably shouldn't be taken as a sign
that the reign of Saatchi is ending. Nonetheless its balance is
noteworthy. It contains only one YBA, Tracy Emin, down from a high
of three out of four in 1995, when the YBA ringleader, Damien
Hirst, won the prize, which is accompanied by nearly $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Emin is almost a caricature of YBA flamboyance. She makes
sensationally autobiographical art. (Her piece in the Brooklyn show
is a tent appliqued with the names of all the people she's ever
slept with.) By now she is as well known as Hirst; her name and
picture are constantly in the British papers, and she is said to be
idolized by teenage girls. Her display in the Tate show includes a
disheveled bed surrounded by drug paraphernalia, condoms and dirty
underwear. The day after the show opened, The Times of London ran a
cartoon with the caption: ``I don't care if it is art _ make it!''
</P>
<P>
   The other three Turner show artists all make cerebral works in
videos or photography. Jane and Louise Wilson, who specialize in
four-screen video installations of ``sites of power,'' have
unveiled a piece alternating long tracking shots of an empty Las
Vegas casino and the inside of nearby Hoover Dam. (The Wilsons also
exhibited three similar but better pieces at the Serpentine Art
Gallery this fall, including one on the Houses of Parliaments.)
</P>
<P>
   The reclusive tinkerer Steven Pippin is showing several suites
of murky photographs depicting himself or a horse in Muybridge-like
sequences, all taken and developed with washing machines that he
converted into cameras and darkrooms. Steve McQueen is represented
by three toned-down videos, including a particularly modest
1970s-style one that centers on a tape recorder emitting fast
clackity-clack sounds that is suddenly pulled heavenward by a
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   If, as is often said, London is having its New York-style 1980s
in the '90s, this gathering suggests that it is on schedule to
begin its version of the relatively dour early '90s just after
2000. Either Ms. Emin or McQueen is favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting with the dryness of this year's Turner show is the
cute and cuddly work in ``Neurotic Realism, Part II,'' the latest
offering at Saatchi's gallery on Boundary Road. Visitors there
lingered near the door to study a display of front pages from New
York newspapers featuring ``Sensation'' and related political
cartoons, all neatly framed and hanging on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Including five artists of widely dispersed sensibilities and low
quality, ``Neurotic Realism'' seems to be an attempt to collate and
name an art movement instead of just collecting new or emerging
trends. It also seems designed to showcase the work of Martin
Maloney, a painter of large, pleasantly faux-naif figurative works
who is included in ``Sensation'' and is especially close to
Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The best impression is made by Peter Davies' big, bright
paintings that entertainingly diagram the art world and also reveal
the obsessive inner workings of an artist's mind. ``The Hip One
Hundred'' charts the artists, both living and dead, whose work has
inspired Davies, listed in order of admiration, with notes.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is ``Fun With Animals: Joseph Beuys Text Painting,''
a large canvas featuring bright circles connected by dizzying
networks of lines that plot the artists and art movements of the
20th century in terms of influence, stylistic affinities,
personality traits (``machoness'' is a particularly busy juncture,
for example), subject matter (terrorism) and materials (food).
Davies' abstract paintings are similarly seriously entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The unevenness of ``Neurotic Realism'' illustrates what many
people forget about Saatchi when they froth on about his power and
influence: His purchases are almost as random and indiscriminate as
fate itself. The vast majority of the artists whose work he buys
and exhibits are quickly forgotten; those who become
internationally known are validated in many other quarters by
dealers, collectors, critics and museums. This point is further
underscored by a quick browse through a thick new book about his
British art holdings that is immodestly titled ``Young British Art:
The Saatchi Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call the decade, it will end on May 12, when Queen
Elizabeth II opens the Tate Modern, across the Thames from and to
the east of the Tate Gallery, which will be renamed the Tate
Britain in March. To measure the new museum's probable effect on
London, think of Paris with the Eiffel Tower, Centre Beaubourg and
Musee d'Orsay rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The structure has been redesigned by the widely admired Swiss
architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, who have left it
handsomely plain. With 84 galleries featuring 150,000 square feet
of exhibition space and a high frequency of tall ceilings and
natural light, it will be one of the best showcases for
contemporary art in the world and is expected to attract collectors
with works to donate or at least place on extended loan from all
over. A remnant of its days as a power station is a flatbed car and
train tracks once used to move engines around the vast Turbine
Hall; they will be used to move large sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral-size Turbine Hall is the museum's entry hall,
thrilling to walk into or to overlook from the four floors of
galleries. This space, along with the Tate Modern's riverside
location and views, should make it an instant landmark. The
two-story frosted-glass penthouse with which Herzog and de Meuron
have crowned their redesign handsomely complements the original
boxy brick monolith, and taxicab drivers already point it out. A
footbridge designed by the architect Norman Foster and the sculptor
Anthony Caro will stretch from the Tate Modern's esplanade across
the Thames to the steps leading up to St. Paul's. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   London's gallery scene is giving off several forms of heat, much
of it international. More and more London galleries are being
opened by non-British dealers and more and more are showing
non-British art, a function that Saatchi's gallery largely filled
in the 1980s. This fall's offerings included the Americans Doug
Aitken at Victoria Miro, Michael Askin at Emily Tsingou Liz Craft
and Pentti Monkkonen (two Los Angeles artists who have not shown in
New York) at Sadie Coles HQ; Tim Claasen, a Dutch sculptor, at
Stephen Friedman; and two young Italian artists, Francesco Vezzoli
at Anthony D'Offay and Stefano Arienti at Greengrassi.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly galleries are opening in or relocating to London's
sprawling East End, where artists live and work in great numbers,
and loftlike light-manufacturing buildings abound. The area already
merits its own a small bright yellow map, put out by the Pale Green
Press, which lists 22.
</P>
<P>
   One point of East End concentration is the area around the
Bethnal Green subway station, where one can find Maureen Paley's
relocated and expanded Interim Art, showing the latest video _ a
Roshomon-like tale of two drunken suburban couples _ from Gillian
Wearing, the 1997 Turner Prize winner. At the Approach, a few
minutes away above a pub by the same name, one can see big
paintinglike embroideries of glamorous action heroes by Enrico
David, an Italian artist who lives in London. Around a couple of
corners is the Anthony Wilkinson Gallery with a show of new work by
the witty neo-Conceptualist who calls himself Bob and Roberta
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   New clusters in the Clerkenwell- Shoreditch area of the East End
include the Cabinet gallery near St. John Street, Laure Gennillard
and Andrew Mummery. Perhaps the most significant sign of this drift
is the news that Jay Jopling and Ms. Miro, two of the most
prominent West End dealers in contemporary art, are opening in this
area. Jopling has bought a large building on Hoxton Square and
plans to open it in April or May. Ms. Miro is buying a 19th-century
former furniture factory off City Road near the Old Street subway
stop and plans to open in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the quietest signs of London's embrace of contemporary
art is ``Ecce Homo,'' a public sculpture by Mark Wallinger, whose
unremarkable paintings of thoroughbred horses, depicted at
life-size, are in the Brooklyn ``Sensation'' show. The London piece
is unremarkable, too, but strikingly so: it is a life-size statue
in cast and sculptured marbelized resin of Jesus standing with his
arms bound behind his back and his head slightly bowed, isolated
and alone, on a giant plinth in Trafalgar Square.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the commotion of traffic, architecture and monuments, which
include occupied plinths and of course Nelson's column, it is as
easy to miss as the plunging figure with the melting wings in
Bruegel's ``Icarus.'' But once you find it, its dramatic quiet and
smallness accentuate the grandiosity of everything around it.
</P>
<P>
   Wallinger's piece, which will come down in February, is part of
the city's millennial celebrations and the first of three six-month
installations commissioned for the square's ``fourth plinth,'' left
bare for more than 100 years because it could not be decided whom
it should honor. Works by Bill Woodrow and Rachel Whiteread will
follow. Ms. Whiteread will make a full-scale 70-ton resin replica
of the plinth that will double the plinth's height, but be
inverted. The piece will be created on the spot, with a single
giant pour of resin into a cast built atop the plinth. This should
be the kind of spectacle London is used to.

REPORT CITES LAX US ENFORCEMENT IN POLLUTION CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most US companies suspected of breaking environmental laws are
never charged with a crime, with federal prosecutors sometimes
opting to seek civil fines instead of pursuing criminal sanctions,
according to a government report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors declined to prosecute 70 percent of the
cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency and other
investigators against US companies for possible criminal
environmental violations, the study by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, corporations investigated for polluting were less
likely to be prosecuted than individuals accused of similar crimes,
according to the study. Fifty-five percent of the cases involving
individuals investigated for environmental crimes were declined by
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has been criticized by some
environmental groups for being too lenient with corporate
polluters, and for overall lax enforcement of environmental laws.
The administration has denied those charges and pointed to several
high-profile cases across the country, including recent lawsuits
brought against more than two dozen Midwest utility plants.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bundy, the US attorney for Alaska and chairman of an
environmental task force for the Department of Justice, said most
environmental cases are declined because of weak evidence or
because lawyers determine the offenses are not federal violations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, US attorneys with limited resources are careful to
concentrate on offenses that result in the most severe
environmental harm. ``We want to make sure they are the right cases
and good cases to bring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal prosecution of environmental violators is intended
to be the ultimate deterrent in the government's arsenal to enforce
pollution laws.
</P>
<P>
   The study says some US attorneys ``often decline to prosecute
organizational defendants for criminal violations in favor of civil
sanctions.'' Nationwide, one in ten criminal referrals to the
Department of Justice were declined in favor of a civil
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   For companies, a larger civil fine is often preferable to a
criminal conviction, which carries with it the stigma of being
publicly labeled an environmental felon, said John Scalia, a bureau
statistician who conducted the environmental crime study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations tend to shy away, particularly large ones, from
being convicted felons if they can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found the fines levied in civil cases averaged $2.5
million while the average fine in a criminal case was only
$308,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons companies strive to avoid a criminal
conviction for environmental offenses, including a potentially
costly prohibition from doing business with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minds of corporations and executives there is a huge
difference,'' between civil and criminal cases, said Mark Cohen, a
Vanderbilt University professor who has studied government
environmental enforcement policies. ``From the management
standpoint, you don't want to be associated with criminal charges
against the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundy said the study of environmental crimes also fails to
account for the complexity of cases today. He said US attorneys
avoid looking at their prosecution numbers and instead focus on the
kinds of cases they are bringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at how can we maximize the impact on protecting
the environment instead of developing numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics bureau is part of the US Department of Justice
and is the primary source of criminal justice statistics in the
country. Scalia said the agency decided to examine environmental
crimes after receiving many inquiries for the statistics, primarily
from defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined environmental prosecutions in 1997.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has the makings of a good story and Dr. Mark J. Plotkin
clearly relishes the beginning. If only it had a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the Amazon jungle, on a prospecting mission for Shaman
Pharmaceuticals, Plotkin was living out the romantic dream of every
scientist who studies how people use plants. The company had staked
millions of dollars on finding a breakthrough drug by sending
ethnobotanists like Plotkin to confer with shamans in the rain
forest and bring back promising plants.
</P>
<P>
   Adding poignancy to the quest, Plotkin was searching for plants
to treat diabetes, which had killed his grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin described the symptoms to a medicine man from the
Sikiyana-Chikena tribe: sores between the toes, incessant thirst,
fading eyesight. He then followed the shaman into the forest and
watched him pick a trailside herb, peel long strips of bark from a
towering tree and drain sap from a twisted vine.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the village, he boiled all the ingredients together in a
clay pot over a wood fire. That night, the shaman gave the thick
reddish-brown liquid to a young Indian woman with a nearly fatal
case of diabetes. The next morning her blood sugar level was almost
normal. Within a few days she was well enough to work in her garden
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was knocked over,'' Plotkin said. ``He literally raised that
woman from the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the medicine did not pan out back in the lab at Shaman
Pharmaceuticals in South San Francisco. And when the Food and Drug
Administration sent the company's most promising new drug prospect,
a diarrhea remedy from an Amazon tree, back for more clinical
trials, Shaman Pharmaceuticals' stock slid until it was virtually
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, the company abandoned the quest to make drugs
from rain forest remedies and decided to sell dietary supplements
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin has since severed his ties with the company, which has
changed its name to ShamanBotanicals.com. He also had the company
remove every reference to his name from its Web site. He renounced
bioprospecting, the search for medicines and other useful products,
because it had become too controversial in South America, where
indigenous tribes had complained that bioprospectors were stealing
their secrets and getting rich from them.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin said the idea that bioprospectors were profiting from
Indian knowledge also hindered his ability to raise money for his
own nonprofit organization, the Amazon Conservation Team, which
works with shamans in Colombia and other countries to preserve
their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For Plotkin, 44, this falling out represented a career crisis,
although he played down its significance. His experience is
emblematic of the changes that have occurred in a field in which
old-fashioned botanists once toiled in obscurity until saving the
rain forest became a cause celebre, and ethnobotanists like Plotkin
linked their fortunes to the pharmaceutical industry, only to
discover that medical miracles are rare, even in the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin had built his reputation on the claim that the rain
forest was a pharmacy filled with wonder drugs known to traditional
healers who were eager to share their knowledge. Shaman
Pharmaceuticals was one of many companies that wanted to find the
proof and help provide a financial incentive to save the rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had a mantra that we had to save the rain forest
because it was a repository of natural drugs,'' said Dr. Wade
Davis, who studied ethnobotany at Harvard and watched Plotkin's
rapid rise.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin had followed a roundabout path to the rain forest. The
son of a Jewish shoe salesman in a poor black neighborhood in New
Orleans, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania's biology
department after less than a year because he was more interested in
studying whole organisms than cells and microbes.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Cambridge and got a job unpacking specimens at the
Harvard Zoological Museum, and went to night school through the
university's extension program. He went on to study at Yale and
Tufts and worked as a research associate at the Harvard Botanical
Museum under Dr. Richard Evans Schultes, who inspired Plotkin and
others with his tales of Indian ceremonies and hallucinogenic
potions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't interest people in rain forests, hallucinogenic
plants, and naked people,'' Schultes liked to say, ``then you're in
the wrong line of business.''
</P>
<P>
   For his doctoral research, Plotkin cataloged the medicinal
plants of the Tirio tribe in Suriname. At the same time, he began
carving out a career away from the academic world as an
environmental activist working for Conservation International and
the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations were eager to publicize the exploits of the
dashing young ethnobotanist who was working with Indians to
discover medicines and save the rain forest. His reputation was
cemented in a 1989 Smithsonian magazine cover story that showed
Plotkin in face paint and an Indian ceremonial headdress deep in
the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Profile writers have compared him to Indiana Jones, and quoted
sympathetic colleagues who called Plotkin the Carl Sagan of the
rain forest. But there have also been strong undercurrents of
skepticism about his showmanship and his affection for feathers and
fame over peer reviewed science, where his record is thin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great stuff educating people and trying to save
indigenous knowledge,'' said a former colleague, Dr. Tom Carlson,
vice president for medical ethnobotany of the company
ShamanBotanicals.com. ``But in terms of rigorous ethnobotanical
science, very little of his work was useful. And a lot of that had
to do with sloppy research.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example Carlson cites the story of the putative diabetes
cure. Plotkin, he said, did not actually measure the patient's
blood sugar level before the shaman administered the potion in the
Amazon, and the plant specimens he sent back were poorly preserved
and incorrectly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although Plotkin concluded that the plants he sent
back from the jungle showed no effects in laboratory tests, Carlson
said that two of the plants did lower blood sugar in tests with
mice, just not enough to justify further research.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Carlson said, is developing a line of
glucose-lowering snacks for diabetics. But not with Plotkin's
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin admits that he has been less than prolific in the
scientific realm of enthnobotany. He said he had not shared his
findings or contributed many plant collections to museums, the
hallmark of a botany career in colleagues' eyes, because he does
not want people to search his writings or botanical collections for
clues to Indian medicines.``My trust with the Indians is more
important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the increasing distrust of scientists among the Indians,
in addition to the failure of the diabetes remedy, and the crash of
Shaman Pharmaceuticals that finally made Plotkin give up on
bioprospecting. But he is sticking with the shamans.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Plotkin brought a group of Colombian shamans to the
United States to protest scientific research on their plant
knowledge without their consent. Draped in necklaces of bright
beads, jungle seeds and jaguar claws, the shamans met with
activists and donors across the country.
</P>
<P>
   They presented a statement condemning ``anthropologists,
botanists, physicians and other scientists who are conducting
experiments with yage and other medicinal and sacred plants without
taking into account our ancestral wisdom and our collective
intellectual property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this trip, unlike others, Plotkin did not take the
shamans to meet with any pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues say Plotkin has contributed to an atmosphere of
distrust by promoting the potential for finding profitable
medicines in the Amazon, and then by joining the debate about
property rights and royalties for products that have yet to pan
out, even in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Plotkin is not the only one responsible for the heavy
promotion of the curative potential of the rain forest. Davis said
he also played a role. ``But the rhetoric ran away from reality,''
Davis said. ``And the whole thing has backfired. We have not found
new drugs. And the fact that the idea is deeply flawed is never
questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is pretty clear why the hypothesis was wrong,
Davis said. The field had already been closely scrutinized. The
Indians do know the forest after thousands of years of screening
plants for medicinal properties, he said. But newcomers, starting
with the Spanish conquistadors, quickly picked up the most
obviously efficacious and economically valuable medicines, like
coca, the basis for cocaine, the antimalarial medicine quinine, and
the arrow poison curare, which is the basis for a muscle relaxant
used in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Although his own bioprospecting venture was a failure, Plotkin
still believes in the magic of shamanism and the potential for new
drugs. But if the idea ever does pay off, Plotkin will not be part
of it. He is working with South American shamans to encourage them
to preserve their sacred methods of healing.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin now argues that his experience with the diabetes remedy
illustrates the limitations of what he calls a reductionist
approach: breaking the traditional jungle medicine into its
chemical constituents to test it in a modern laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the medicine works more like a magic shotgun blast, he
said, than a magic bullet. ``When they couldn't reproduce it in the
lab, it brought me up short,'' he said. ``But when I went back to
the jungle and saw the woman was still alive, it said to me, well,
maybe the lab can't do everything it needs to do.''

MANNESMANN BEGINS 5-DAY DEFENSE CAMPAIGN, CALLING VODAFONE'S BID
LOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Fighting the largest hostile-takeover attempt ever
made, Klaus Esser, chief executive of Mannesmann of Germany, began
a long-awaited defense Monday against the wireless giant Vodafone
PLC, arguing that the $127.7 billion bid was too low and
forecasting that his own company would enjoy booming growth for
years _ alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Mannesmann is significantly higher than the offer
on the table by a wide margin,'' Esser told reporters in the Savoy
Hotel ballroom here, where Vodafone began its assault on Mannesmann
almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the two companies are fighting to dominate the
lucrative European telecommunications market, both arguing that
their different strategies will reap the greatest reward from an
expected boom in voice and data transmission driven by new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Esser spoke after a four-hour meeting with securities analysts,
starting five days of efforts in Britain, Germany and the United
States to swing investors against the all-share bid, which
Vodafone, the world's biggest wireless operator, plans to send them
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mannesmann shareholders will get significantly richer by
holding onto their shares,'' Esser said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose nearly 2 percent Monday to 204.50
euros, or $206.44 _ still far below Vodafone's offer of 240 euros,
suggesting that investors had doubts about whether the deal would
succeed. Vodafone shares fell 1 percent, to 2.9525 pounds, or
$4.74, and its American depository receipts fell $2.5625, or more
than 5 percent, to $46.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who attended the presentation gave it mixed reviews.
``It didn't come out with a blastingly aggressive defense case, so
it rather helped Vodafone,'' said an analyst from a European
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian Kern, telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, called the meeting ``quite upbeat in terms of presenting
the numbers'' in key areas of Mannesmann's business.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's attempt to acquire Mannesmann has been the most
notable move in a tortuous year of shifting telecommunications
allegiances that began with the British company's $62 billion
acquisition of Airtouch Communications of San Francisco in January.
That deal propelled Vodafone into the American wireless market,
providing access to Airtouch stakes in European mobile operators
including Mannesmann's D2 network. It reinforced a partnership then
between Vodafone and Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Vodafone struck a joint venture with Bell Atlantic,
in which it took a 45 percent stake, reflecting its ambition to
cement its position as the global leader in exclusively wireless
telecommunications. Then, in October, Mannesmann moved onto the
offensive, announcing it would acquire Orange PLC, Britain's No. 3
wireless operator and a Vodafone competitor, for $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the two partners became competitors, each
voicing a sense of betrayal by the other. ``We are different
companies with different strategies and different portfolios that
just do not fit,'' Esser said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he left open the door to some kind of
future relationship with Vodafone, saying he did not want existing
partnerships between the two companies to become a ``legal issue''
and would instead look for ``additional opportunities for
cooperation'' in the mobile data business.
</P>
<P>
   In making his defense now, Esser said Mannesmann's commitment to
integrated fixed-line and wireless voice and data businesses
offered far greater prospects for growth than Vodafone's exclusive
commitment to wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strategic crisis for Vodafone,'' he said. ``Their
strategy doesn't work for the future.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, he stepped down from the podium to show
reporters a new Mannesmann product called D2-Three Pack, offering
mobile, fixed-line and Internet services _ all in a single box
prepackaged for holiday sales.

NEW US MEDICAL MARIJUANA POLICY PROTESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an indication of growing public support for legalizing
marijuana for medical use, scores of celebrities, health officials,
Congressmen, and others Monday joined in protesting a new US
medical marijuana research policy for lacking compassion and being
``too cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy spells out the conditions under which studies
involving marijuana can be conducted _ conditions that critics say
are so stringent as to make the research virtually impossible _ and
fails to expand legal access to medically approved patients through
``compassionate use'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Signing on to letters of protest Monday were such nationally
known names as actors Susan Sarandon and Woody Harrelson; comedians
Richard Pryor and Bill Maher; Harvard scientist Stephen Jay Gould;
rock band Hootie &AMP; The Blowfish; former US Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders; and former Reagan administration official Lyn Nofziger.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Democratic Congressmen Barney Frank, James
McGovern, and John Olver also joined the effort, along with US
representatives from around the country, including three
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, addressed to the US Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala, come just weeks after Maine became the
sixth state to legalize medical marijuana through a ballot
question. The other states are California, Arizona, Washington,
Oregon, and Alaska, which allow certain patients to both grow and
smoke their own, or allow them to possess it legally. Marijuana is
used medically to control nausea and other effects of cancer
treatment and ease symptoms of AIDS and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   While an attempt in Massachusetts to bring the issue to the
voters in next year's elections fell short of getting the necessary
signatures by this month's deadline, organizers of the effort vow
to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the people of Massachusetts really support doctors'
ability to prescribe marijuana,'' said Bill Downing, president and
chairman of MASS CANN/NORML, the state chapter of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws that helped get more
than 20,000 signatures in support of a ballot question to legalize
medical marijuana and change other aspects of the law, but fell
short of the nearly 60,000 required.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Massachusetts has had a research program
on the books that would allow medically approved patients to get
marijuana under controlled conditions, but the state Department of
Public Health has never been able to get legal access to the drug
from the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new US research guidelines that go into effect
Wednesday will not give patients access to the Massachusetts
program, said Paul Jacobsen, deputy public health commissioner.
``It basically doesn't provide us with an approvable source (for
the drug),'' said Jacobsen. ``We have our program. It's up, it can
run, but without a source, it's a moot point.''
</P>
<P>
   A US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson could
not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, patients like Jim Harden, 49, of Virginia, are
in pain and angry at the government policy. He was one of the
patients cited in a recent federally commissioned Institute of
Medicine (IOM) report as someone who should have legal access to
medical marijuana, as only eight other patients nationwide do right
now under a US program that stopped allowing new people in years
ago. The report, released in March, also found medicinal uses for
marijuana in treating people with AIDS, cancer, and other diseases,
and urged the federal government to expand compassionate use
programs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of the US Department of Health and
Human Services Monday _ coordinated by the Marijuana Policy Project
of Washington, D.C., to announce the letters of protest _ Harden
got up from his wheelchair, holding a copy of that IOM report, to
tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview later, Harden described his multiple
health problems over the last three years, from end-stage liver
disease as a result of hepatitis contracted from a blood
transfusion to chronic pain as a result of being crushed by a drill
while working as a state of Virginia geologist, from the nausea to
the vomiting from the medications he uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have 17-inch biceps and a 46-inch chest. Now I have
a 34-inch chest and my biceps are around 10 inches,'' he said.
``Marijuana allows me to eat,'' said Harden, who has only been able
to get the drug illegally. ``The marijuana was really instrumental
in saving my life, in allowing me to live so long.''

HOLLYWOOD GOES TO THE LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema has a recurring nightmare. The writer-director
is chatting with Jane Austen, whose novel ``Mansfield Park'' Rozema
has made into the current movie. She finally works up the courage
to ask Austen's opinion of her adaptation: ``Is this what you were
after, Jane? Is this what you meant?'' In Rozema's telling, Austen
shoots back, `` `Hell, no! Start over!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Every literary adaptation opens a similar conversation, real or
imagined, between the filmmakers and the author. But why are so
many of these conversations going on now.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has always relied on books as material for films, but
nothing compared to what's going on this season, with a whopping 20
literary adaptations coming to the screen. That's twice as many as
last winter's figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, versions of Mona Simpson's ``Anywhere But
Here,'' William Trevor's ``Felicia's Journey'' and Washington
Irving's ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' have opened in theaters.
The most prominent novels-turned-movies due out between now and
January are David Guterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' Patricia
Highsmith's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' Graham Greene's ``The End
of the Affair,'' Stephen King's ``The Green Mile'' and John
Irving's ``The Cider House Rules.'' Memoirs getting the treatment
include Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning best-seller
``Angela's Ashes'' and ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Susanna Kaysen's
disturbing account of being locked up in a mental hospital as a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   So how come Hollywood's suddenly found its library card? It all
comes down to money, says Jeff Kleeman, a United Artists vice
president who recently left the studio after supervising his third
straight James Bond film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the studios are having a crisis of confidence,''
Kleeman says. ``They don't trust their own taste, and are looking
for outside confirmation on every film they put into production.''
</P>
<P>
   Major studios these days are spending millions of dollars each
year developing scripts through draft after draft. They then wait
for a co-financing partner _ an overseas distributor, a fellow
studio _ to come along and cherry-pick the best projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios are beginning to realize that something is wrong with
this system,'' Kleeman says, ``but they can't figure out what to do
about it yet. So they decide to develop more carefully, which means
making safer bets on projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Books aren't safe, of course _ just safer. It's always easier to
say no than yes. And it's easier to say yes when somebody else has
said it first. With literary adaptations, thousands if not
generations of readers have already said yes before the cameras
ever roll.
</P>
<P>
   The prestige of major studios also figures into the equation.
The crafty Disney-owned ``minimajor'' Miramax picked up drafts of
two literary Oscar winners, ``The English Patient'' and
``Shakespeare in Love,'' in turnaround (i.e., secondhand) from the
bigger studios that originated them. This is something akin to
finding a Gutenberg Bible at a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studio execs have pride too,'' says Jack Lechner, a senior
Miramax vice president who recently took a leave of absence to
write a book about television in the '90s. ``They're tired of
watching (Miramax head) Harvey Weinstein waltz away with their
classy turnaround projects. Studios aren't putting those projects
in turnaround anymore _ instead, they're making them, and the
result is the most ambitious crop of studio movies in recent
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the side benefits of ``Harvey envy'' is that the majors _
Fox, Warner, Columbia, Disney, MGM/UA and Paramount, most of them
half a century older than upstarts like Miramax and New Line _
aren't just optioning and producing literary properties. They're
also trying to retain the original author's goodwill throughout the
process.
</P>
<P>
   That's because fans of a book want to know whether the writer
has given a film adaptation his blessing. If an author hates what
Hollywood has done to his book, an adaptation's literate target
audience will probably find out about it by reading a review or an
interview and might shun the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a cross word Guterson has to say against
director and co-screenwriter Scott Hicks' faithful adaptation of
``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is that he'd rather people read the book
first. ``I guess it's my bias as a novelist that somehow the book
comes first,'' says Guterson. ``The film is an adjunct, in certain
ways. The novel is the root.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozema's film of ``Mansfield Park'' is as freely adapted as
``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is faithful. In her defense, Rozema
says, ``Great work bears reinterpretation.'' If legions of Laura
Ashley-clad ``Jane-ites'' howl at the liberties she's taken with
their beloved Austen _ up to and including a glimpse of unbodiced
bosom _ Rozema is reconciled to it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the executives, Rozema chalks up the current vogue for
adapting the classics to the end of the century: ``It could be
that, as we approach our big birthday, we look back. We take stock.
We take comfort in the past, but we also use it to try and
understand the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, books have changed quite a bit since French film
pioneer Georges Melies adapted Jules Verne's ``From the Earth to
the Moon'' _ perhaps the oldest surviving film from a literary
antecedent. Twentieth century books have gotten more psychological,
less reliant on the stories that drew filmmakers to them in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novels and films rely on good storytelling, but there is less
good storytelling, nowadays, in both,'' says John Irving, who did
the screen adaptation of ``Cider House Rules'' himself. ``In films,
as in novels, we can only hope to see narrative return and give us
back what we've lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a novel isn't better on page 300 than it was on page 30,
the story isn't any good ... And a good film is better in the last
20 minutes than it was in the first hour _ `better' in the sense of
being more compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios, meanwhile, mainly care about ``better'' in the sense of
doing better business. New versions of ``Madame Bovary'' and
``Tender Is the Night'' top a long list of adaptations in
development, but no one believes that the iron will stay hot
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market for literary movies will go bust just as soon as
enough of them in a row tank _ whereupon a new trend will take its
place. Hollywood, as ever, is nothing if not adaptable.

   This Thursday, George W. Bush is going to emerge from his burrow
and take part in a debate with the other Republican presidential
candidates in New Hampshire. Unless, of course, he sees his shadow.
In that case we will have six more weeks of autumn, during which
the governor of Texas will have to stay home and squire his wife to
more awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming Bush does finally make an appearance, you'll notice
that he and Sen. John McCain are sharing the stage with a number of
strange men you've never seen before. This is the Republican Field,
and it consists of:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch. You may remember Hatch reading ``The
Exorcist'' at the Clarence Thomas hearings, and suggesting that
Anita Hill's story had been cooked up by ``slick lawyers'' from the
left.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristics that separate Hatch from the herd include a
tendency to refer to himself in the third person, and to call
campaign donations ``monies.'' As chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, he argues that he is best qualified to nominate new
federal judges. There are quite a few of those jobs to fill since,
under Hatch, the Judiciary confirmation pipeline has become more of
a clogged drain.

``ambassador'' in reference to his work as the Reagan
administration's representative to the United Nations Economic and
Social Council, an organization he nostalgically refers to as that
``rat hole of United Nations waste.'' His only election victory has
been in the race for president of the Ronald Reagan Alumni
Association.
</P>
<P>
   In debate, Keyes provides the critical function of scaring the
audience into wakefulness. ``We proliferate laws!'' he told a woman
in Hanover who had only asked about the war on drugs. ``We even
have started to invade property rights and do other things that are
tearing down our system of liberty! Why? Because we are out of
control!''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes. Sometimes a candidate comes along who can unite
all Americans _ rich, poor, young, old, black and white _ behind a
single thought. Forbes is such a man, and his unending race for the
presidency has caused the entire nation to join together and
calculate all the better ways they could have found to spend $54
million of their own money.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history demonstrates that Americans don't like incredibly
rich candidates who want to start at the top, but Forbes just keeps
spending along. He takes pride in the way his signature issue, the
flat-tax plan, has gotten support from other Republicans. That's
because ``flat'' sounds like a synonym for ``low.'' Rename it the
``no-mortgage-deduction tax plan'' and see how far it flies.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer is yet another of the Republican candidates who have
prepared for the presidency by never being elected to anything. The
head of conservative lobbying groups, Bauer worked for the Reagan
administration as under secretary of education. In what may be an
effort to differentiate himself from Keyes, Bauer says that the
bureaucrats working for him were ``good people,'' albeit misguided.
</P>
<P>
   With a crowd this large, Bush is not going to have much trouble
with the debates. He'll get a 15-minute rest between questions, and
it will be hard for the audience to hear him anyway, with Alan
Keyes ringing in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd like a more exclusive format _ say a debate
limited to candidates whose name you can connect to ``president''
without causing your hearers to break into laughter or faint dead
away. But nobody is leaving without a fight. Keyes and Bauer, who
travel very light, seem to regard campaigning as a career. Forbes
treats it the way his father collected Faberge eggs and yachts _ as
a hobby whose very expense makes it more desirable. Hatch, who is
running simultaneously for his Senate seat, also seems optimistic.
``In January, when voters start focusing on the race, they're going
to say: `Hey, what about Orrin Hatch?''' predicted the senator's
campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it just shows you what a great country this is. Any
middle-aged man in America can decide he will grow up to be
president, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of the people on hand for the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Sultan
</P>
<P>
   trade representative
</P>
<P>
   Djibouti, Djibouti
</P>
<P>
   Even though the World Trade Organization is all about meetings,
trade delegate Mohamed Sultan wouldn't mind a chance to explore
what Seattle has to offer. After all, he was prepared Monday with
an umbrella for the city's unpredictable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan has never been to Seattle before. The 33-year-old heard
little of the city, except that it was home to The Boeing Co. and a
large Ethiopian community. ``We'd love to go to a nightclub or
disco,'' he said with a mischievous smile. ``Are there any around
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan and his colleague, Nour Roda Daher, 30, are part of a
seven-member trade delegation from Djibouti, a developing northeast
African country that shares borders with Eritrea, Ethiopia and
Somalia, and achieved its independence from France in 1977. Because
of its strategic port location and status as a free trade zone,
Djibouti's economy is based on services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to negotiate our interest in services, such as port
and telecommunications,'' Sultan said, speaking in both French and
English outside the Sheraton Hotel where he waited to attended a
meeting of developing countries. ``We're trying to negotiate the
benefit of preferential treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still tired from his Sunday flight from Djibouti, Sultan said he
looks forward to his last day in town when he may have enough free
time to venture to the downtown shops. And, of course, the
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Westbrook
</P>
<P>
   Barista
</P>
<P>
   Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Tall drip coffees for the steelworkers. Lattes and cappuccinos
for protesters dressed as sea turtles. Emily Westbrook served up
cup after cup of java to regulars and visitors yesterday with the
charm of a classic Seattle barista.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for business,'' the tongue-pierced 21-year-old
said, behind the City Grind espresso stand near the First United
Methodist Church downtown. A sidewalk sign touting the daily mocha
special also welcomed ``union and protesters.'' The stand quickly
turned into a warming station for dozens of steelworkers and
environmentalists who rallied along the block.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook couldn't be more pleased, humming several bars from an
anti-WTO song that repeatedly blared from a parked van nearby. ``I
can sing it myself,'' she joked. A few months ago, Westerbrook had
never heard of the WTO or knew what it did. Yesterday, she proudly
wore a yellow ``woman of steel'' button on her blue fleece jacket,
a gift from another ``woman of steel,'' to show her support for the
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm against the WTO,'' she said, her consciousness
raised by recent events. ``I think it does more harm than good.
It's pro-corporations. It hurts small businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle native, Westbrook enjoyed the fact that protesters
could ``emphasize their right to free speech.'' ``I think it's
great that they're here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   George Hylkema
</P>
<P>
   Wooden boat builder
</P>
<P>
   Balboa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   George Hylkema sees power in information so he wants people to
be informed about the World Trade Organization. Every opportunity
he gets, he passes out taped lectures and discussions on issues
relating to trade, the environment and human issues. ``We get info
and we pass it on to everyone,'' the white-bearded 63-year-old said
as he held a painted anti-WTO sign high above his head to protest
the conference. ``I carry these tapes with me and hand them out to
anyone who will listen,'' said Hylkema, a former engineer and
physicist who now builds wooden boats. The tapes are Hylkema's way
of counteracting the forces of the WTO, which he said makes
decisions in secret that affect the rest of the population. ``It's
multinationals going for the gold,'' he said. ``This is a power
grab. Who loses out? All third-world countries. And we lose out.''
Hylkema and his friend, Coeli Nenzes, the artist who painted the
protest sign, decided a month ago to fly to Seattle to take part in
the forums. They wanted to learn more about the event, and they
wanted to hobnob with other liked-minded protesters. ``This is
perhaps the event of the century,'' said Hylkema, who arrived from
Southern California on Friday. ``If it goes as the planners hope,
we'll have out major work cut out for us in restoring the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Lu-qui
</P>
<P>
   Television reporter
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour after landing in Seattle for her first-ever visit,
Hong Kong television reporter Rose Lu-qui had already staked out
her spot on the corner of Pike Street and Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   As WTO delegates, protesters and Seattle police were jostling
each other for space outside the Washington Trade and Convention
Center, Lu-qui was in the midst of the crowd. With microphone in
hand and a cameraman nearby, the cropped-haired broadcaster waited
anxiously as the action unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sleepy,'' she said, with a weak smile, appearing
decidedly fresh and composed after a flight from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Lu-qui and her colleagues from STAR TV _ a Mandarin-language
television station based in Hong Kong but broadcast all over Asia _
watched as small pockets of protesters marched to the intersection
and chanted anti-WTO statements. Nearby a phalanx of police
officers kept the protesters at bay while neatly groomed delegates
waited to enter the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what will happen,'' she said. ``We knew coming
that there were protesters but we didn't imagine that there would
be any bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old reporter is one of an estimated 2,500
journalists in town to cover the WTO trade conference. A reporter
who covers trade and politics, Lu-qui plans to focus on trade
relations between the United States and mainland China. Her
broadcasts will reach more than 100 million people in China and
other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chorush
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activist
</P>
<P>
   Seattle
</P>
<P>
   If there is a rule somewhere that says you cannot dress as a sea
turtle and simultaneouly cruise the streets of Seattle in
inline-skates, then Bob Chorush sure doesn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   After four months of planning, the 52-year-old animal rights
activists hit Fifth Avenue, wearing black inline skates and a sea
turtle outfit artistically fashioned from a refrigerator box. ``The
strangest thing I've seen?'' Chorush asked. ``It's that people
understand why we're out here as sea turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   Chorush and a brigade of protesters wearing bright sea-turtle
outfits, painted in cool shades of aqua, forest green and teal,
walked in front of the First United Methodist Church yesterday to
prove a point. ``I'm very concerned about the way the WTO responds
to animal and environmental issues ... and there's hardly any area
for human issues,'' he said. ``It feels like government without
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of that, Chorus said, ``This is it. We're taking to
the streets. That seems to be the only way.'' Chorush hopes the
city shuts down as the demonstrators hit the streets in the next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who are tired of politics realize that it's
important and the impact that this has on everything,'' he said,
before skating off to see a fellow sea turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pendergrass
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Police Officer
</P>
<P>
   South Seattle
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good'' is what Seattle police officer Paul
Pendergrass thought yesterday morning as he directed tinted vans
and luxury sedans through a vehicle checkpoint set up at Sixth
Avenue and Pike Street. This is the role Pendergrass played as the
theatrics of the World Trade Organization unfolded in Seattle, one
block from his traffic post. Wearing fluorescent orange and yellow
vests and gloves, Pendergrass had a seemingly simple task: make
sure only vehicles with the proper credentials were allowed to pass
up along Pike Street. This is life on the WTO detail.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Pendergrass helped monitor more than 400 street
theater performers and protesters as they marched from Capitol Hill
to the downtown shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what to expect as the demonstrators are expected to
descend on Seattle this week. ``Today is not over yet,'' cautioned
the 37-year-old, as the streets remained relatively quiet for much
of yesterday morning. ``I don't know what to expect,'' said the
15-year police veteran, who had been on duty since 6:30 a.m. ``It's
one of these wait-and-see types. Everything so far has been
orderly.''

 &HT;    Commissioner Kramer coy about possible disciplinary actions
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer said Monday he will not
disclose whether the officiating crew that worked Saturday's
Georgia-Georgia Tech game will be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Gaston, the SEC supervisor of football officials, conceded
Sunday that his crew had missed the call at the end of the game.
The ruling was that Georgia's Jasper Sanks had fumbled at the
Georgia Tech two-yard line with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 48-48 when the ball was awarded to Georgia
Tech, which went on to win the game in overtime, 51-48.
</P>
<P>
   The officiating crew, rated as the SEC's best, was scheduled to
work the SEC championship game Saturday night at the Georgia Dome.
Kramer would not say if the crew would be prohibited from working
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer also said that any discipline of the officials would be
handled internally and that no public announcement would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have policies in place where we rate officials and, if the
need arises, we discipline them,'' Kramer said. ``One of those
policies is that we do not discuss those things in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials who are found in error can be disciplined with
suspensions that range from one game to a permanent ban from
working for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   QB questions
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches are keeping everyone guessing about the quarterback
rotation for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida, Steve Spurrier alternated Doug Johnson and Jesse
Palmer every play during the loss to Florida State on Nov. 20.
Spurrier said that both quarterbacks would be ready for Saturday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make an announcement about Thursday so these guys don't
get bombarded with questions all week,'' said Spurrier, who has not
ruled out the possibility of rotating the quarterbacks again.
</P>
<P>
   At Alabama, coach Mike DuBose said that both Andrew Zow and
Tyler Watts will would play. Zow is still recovering from an ankle
injury, but in the 40-39 win at Florida on Oct. 2 he threw for 336
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DuBose wasn't ready to say that Zow would start. ``I
think I want to keep everybody guessing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We meet again
</P>
<P>
   Alabama running back Shaun Alexander said that, even after the
Crimson Tide won at Florida, he expected to meet the Gators again
in Atlanta. Florida, he said, also expected a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game they congratulated us, but they all said, `See
you in Atlanta,'' Alexander said. ``They had already beaten
Tennessee and knew that nobody else in the conference could beat
them. So they've been thinking about this game as long as we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida tailback Robert Gillespie, who has been out since
breaking his right hand in the Georgia game, will not play
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida linebacker Keith Kelsey, who sprained an ankle against
Florida State on Nov. 20, is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   _ This game will be the fifth that Florida and Alabama have met
in the SEC Championship Game. Florida leads 3-1, winning in 1993
(28-13), 1994 (24-23) and 1996 (45-30). Alabama won the first SEC
championship game in 1992 (28-21) and went on to win the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time since 1994, the SEC title game will have no
bearing on who plays for the national championship. Florida played
for the national title after winning in 1995 and 1996, Tennessee
the last two seasons.

COMMENTARY: GEORGE W'S ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A small incident may give us crucial insight into the
character of a presidential candidate. That happened last week when
George W. Bush appeared on the NBC television program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Russert asked Governor Bush whether he would meet with the
Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of gay Republicans. ``Oh,
probably not,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? ``I don't believe in group thought,'' Bush said,
``pitting one group of people against another ... I mean, it's as
if an individual doesn't count, but the group that the individual
belongs to is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Bush refusing to meet with other groups? Jewish
Republicans, say, or the Christian Coalition, or Hispanic
organizations? Of course not. No one can run for president, or
governor, without meeting all kinds of groups _ ethnic, economic,
religious, ideological.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for Bush's decision to shun the Log Cabin
Republicans is plain. He does not want to offend the Christian
right and other conservatives. It would have been easy for him to
say, ``I'll meet anybody.'' He didn't have the courage to say it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell had a well-publicized meeting with gay
leaders. Sen. John McCain met the Log Cabin Republicans. But not
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   His answer was especially disappointing because of his admirable
record as governor on two sensitive issues: immigration and race.
He steadfastly refused to follow the example of his fellow
Republican governor Pete Wilson of California, who used them as
wedge issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never appealed to xenophobic fears of Mexican immigrants,
as Wilson did. Nor did he copy the Wilson attack on affirmative
action. When the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached out
beyond the precedents to block state universities from considering
the race of applicants, he supported a substitute plan to admit all
Texas high school graduates in the top 10 percent of their class _
a plan that has had considerable success in maintaining student
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions took considerable courage: more, one would have
thought, than a willingness to meet the Log Cabin Republicans.
Could Bush's backbone be softening as he tries to please a national
audience?
</P>
<P>
   But in his record as governor there was one similarly troubling
episode. Bush showed an insensitivity to the need for elementary
fairness in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Texas executes more people than any other state: 195 since
executions were resumed in this country in 1977, 31 so far this
year. Most capital defendants are too poor to hire their own
lawyers; under the Constitution the state must provide one. But
some of the lawyers appointed to represent Texas defendants have
done notoriously incompetent jobs. At least three slept while their
clients were on trial for their lives. Others were drunk.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the failures of indigent defense in Texas appears
to be a cozy relationship between certain judges and the lawyers
they appoint as counsel. Judges have to run for re-election every
four years. Their campaigns cost thousands, even millions of
dollars, and much of the money is contributed by lawyers. Judges
have appointed contributors as defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Texas Legislature passed _ unanimously in both
houses _ a bill to reform the system for providing counsel to poor
defendants. Because it has sometimes been weeks before an accused
person even saw a lawyer, the bill also required that one be
provided within 20 days. Most states put that limit at 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation brought an outcry from judges. Bush vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   Those accused of crime have little public sympathy or political
influence. For that very reason their fair treatment _ the
treatment required by the Constitution _ is a telling test of
political character.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton told us much about himself in 1992 when he flew
home from the New Hampshire primary to see to the execution of
Rickey Ray Rector, a brain-damaged Arkansas prisoner. If we look
for courage in presidents, as we should, we want someone who will
stand up for fairness despite political risk.

 &HT;    Another game, another right knee injury for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons learned Monday that strong safety
and leading tackler Marty Carter might miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who suffered a partially torn medial collateral ligament
in his right knee, is expected to miss four to six weeks; five
games remain.
</P>
<P>
   He will not need surgery, but the Falcons will miss his 109
total tackles, which lead the team by 24.
</P>
<P>
   The injury happened when the LaGrange, Ga., native took on
Panthers fullback William Floyd, who was leading a running play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like on film . . . , as I was stumbling back, I
tried to put my foot down and it buckled,'' Carter said. ``It kind
of looked funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter had signed a five-year, $15 million contract last
offseason after four years with the Bears and four with the Bucs.
Running back Gary Downs and rookie center Todd McClure were lost
for the season to right-knee injuries on the second day of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson suffered a season-ending right-knee
injury in the second game, and linebacker Keith Brooking missed
three games with a right-knee injury similar to Carter's.
</P>
<P>
   A nagging right thigh muscle of reserve cornerback Michael
Booker, who plays on nickel and dime defenses, could leave the team
short two defensive backs. The Falcons might not wait for Carter
and instead put him on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Teams out of the playoffs this late in the season often activate
players from their practice squad, or from another team's,
sometimes at a different position.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have no defensive backs on the practice squad. The
practice squad also has no running backs, where their lack of depth
is most glaring, especially with the ongoing left-knee problems of
Byron Hanspard.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons could sign a free agent. One possibility is rookie
cornerback Derrick Gardner, who began the season on the Falcons'
practice squad and saw action in two games before being waived.
</P>
<P>
   Booker hobbled off Sunday night, shortly after he was beaten
down the left sideline by Panthers wide receiver Donald Hayes
Sunday night on a 37-yard pass play that set up a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   He first tore the muscle in his right thigh Aug. 7 in a
scrimmage against Jacksonville and missed the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is continuing to be a problem,'' coach Dan Reeves said.
``We have got to look at that very seriously, too.''

MONEY'S FORMER MANAGING EDITOR NAMED EDITOR OF GEORGE MAGAZINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Undaunted by the prospect and challenges of stepping
into a role established by John F. Kennedy Jr., Frank Lalli, a
former managing editor of Money magazine, has agreed to take over
as editor in chief of George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Jack W. Kliger, the chief executive of Hachette-Filipacchi
Magazines, a unit of the Lagardere Group, announced Monday that
Lalli, 57, would begin his new job immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The position of editor in chief at George has probably been the
most difficult job to fill in the magazine industry this year, if
not this decade. after all, who would want to step into a role
established by a favorite son of America? Who would want to tackle
the formidable editorial and business problems facing the magazine,
issues that may have been glossed over precisely because of its
famous editor?
</P>
<P>
   Kliger said he waited several months to hire an editor because
he wanted to do so only after Hachette had bought out the Kennedy
family's 50 percent stake in the magazine, which the company did in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first focus was on getting George magazine into
Hachette-Filipacchi as a full and viable property,'' Kliger said.
``I was not comfortable hiring an editor until we owned the
magazine outright.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lalli is a seasoned editor, he is relatively
inexperienced in the political arena. He was managing editor of
Money magazine, which is published by the Time Inc. unit of Time
Warner, until July 1998, when he became a senior executive editor
at Time Inc., which he left last year to start a magazine
consulting firm. He was president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money certainly wasn't a political magazine, but it certainly
dealt with public issues,'' Lalli said. ``It dealt with people who
have the power to change America. For George, that currency is
political power.''
</P>
<P>
   Kliger said that he did not consider Lalli's relative
inexperience in political reporting a liability. ``At the end of
the day, Frank's a great editor, and that's what this magazine
needs,'' Kliger said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, George needs more than stellar editorial
skills. The magazine has been without a publisher since March, when
Stephen McEvoy resigned. Until his death, Kennedy had been acting
as publisher and editor. Advertising pages have dropped drastically
over the last year despite an uptick in the October issue that
served as an homage to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Total advertising pages for the issues from January to October
this year were 377, down 28 percent from 525 in the period a year
earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
Advertising revenue fell 18 percent for the same period, to $12.8
million from $15.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   George editors attributed the decline to the departure of
several members of the sales staff, which left the department with
only three full-time sales people.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation has also fallen. Newsstand sales have fallen 11
percent for the six-month period that ended in June, and overall
circulation has dropped to 405,000 from 420,000 for the same
period, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, several members have left the small editorial staff,
including Kennedy's longtime assistant, her assistant, an associate
editor, the magazine's chief copy editor, a member of the research
staff and the photo editor.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members said that Richard Blow, the executive editor who
has been running the magazine since July, would resign before the
end of the week. Blow declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media at the
advertising agency McCann-Erickson, said that the magazine needed
to clearly and quickly redefine its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is potential, but it's got to go almost
more Vanity Fair, more the gossipy side of political,'' Ms.
Garfinkle said. ``If that is the direction they take it in, I think
there is the potential both reader-wise and advertiser-wise for
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalli, whose resume does not exactly evoke the word gossipy,
said that he had no immediate plans for the magazine and was
waiting to meet the staff, which he did Monday afternoon, and
discuss changes with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this job because I believed in John's mission,'' Lalli
said. ``I think it is a challenge, but I would not be sitting here
today if in that sense I did not have a very direct connection with
George.''

SATELLITE TV FIRMS GET OK TO BROADCAST LOCAL CHANNELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Satellite television systems can begin providing subscribers
with local channels for the first time, boosting their ability to
compete with cable TV, under legislation President Clinton signed
into law Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Echostar's Dish Network service planned to begin beaming six
Boston stations to subscribers by Tuesday as part of a 13-city
nationwide rollout of local channels. Its bigger rival, DirecTV,
which has nearly two-thirds of the 11 million US digital dish
customers, planned a quick rollout to seven US cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to begin the next stage of the video
revolution,'' said US Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the House telecommunications
subcommittee, a top proponent of the new law. ``Many people have
not subscribed to satellite TV because they have not been able to
get local channels. Today that choice becomes possible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far satellite dishes have proven highly popular in rural
areas without cable. But they have also begun making inroads in
areas served by cable by offering hundreds of channels and
extensive packages of football games and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Echostar, which has just under 4 million customers nationally,
plans to charge $5 a month for local channels, on top of basic
monthly packages that start at $20.
</P>
<P>
   While cable TV has a huge lead over satellite dishes _ 66
million customers nationwide compared to 12 million for digital and
older C-band dishes _ being able to carry local channels could make
dishes a more viable alternative to cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away a barrier, but it doesn't necessarily cause
people to flock to digital broadcast satellites,'' said Bruce
Leichtman, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In part because many communities have cable franchises that
offer dozens of channels, Massachusetts ranks last among all US
states in the rate of households signing up for TV dishes, with a
total of 108,000 compared to 1.7 million cable homes, Leichtman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Leichtman said, ``People that have DBS really like it, and
our surveys show 85 percent of people say they would recommend it
to a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows prohibits satellite firms from carrying a
distant network affiliate to homes within a radius of approximately
50 to 75 miles from the site of a local affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Jenkinson, spokesman for MediaOne Group, said ``of course
we're concerned'' about the prospect of stronger competition from
dishes, but added, ``We still feel that our product provides better
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the typical $100 up-front cost for buying or renting a
dish and having it installed, satellite dishes generally work only
on one television set per house without expensive extra wiring,
while a cable hookup can serve multiple sets.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving out the installation fee for dish TV, cable and direct
broadcast generally charge about $30 a month for 60 channels,
although dish companies offer plans with up to 500 channels and
more pay-per-view offerings than cable.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite TV plan, which was approved by the House and
Senate separately, was included in the budget bill Clinton signed
Monday. It allows satellite TV systems to begin rebroadcasting
local channels immediately and at no expense for 6 months before
they must negotiate rebroadcast pacts with local stations.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 2002, satellite TV systems will be subjected to
the same ``must carry'' provisions that cable systems face to offer
all the channels serving a local viewer's area, Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   Leichtman cautioned that ``it's not going to be easy'' for the
dish companies to negotiate deals to carry local channels, and they
will be motivated only to pick up local stations in big markets
like Boston before the 2002 deadline takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   Under a system comparable to what governs the retransmission of
over-the-air stations on cable, stations will be able to require
dish companies to pay or barter for the right to rebroadcast their
stations.
</P>
<P>
   WCVB-TV (Channel 5) general manager Paul La Camera said station
owner Hearst Argyle Corp. will allow dish companies to carry the
station in Greater Boston markets if they also agree to carry a new
Lifetime channel Hearst partially owns. It made a similar deal with
cable companies trading rebroadcast rights for a promise to carry
the EPSN-2 channel, another Hearst investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously in our interest to get our signal up on these
things,'' La Camera said. But given that more than 80 percent of
homes in the local viewing area have access to cable, La Camera
said he thinks the chief market for dish systems to expand locally
will be among people ``who want to watch eight NFL games on a
Sunday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goldman, general manager of WBZ-TV (Channel 4), said the law
would spare his station an administrative headache of dealing with
``quite a few'' requests from people in remote parts of
Massachusetts who could not get Channel 4 over the air and so
wanted permission to get a CBS-affiliate station from another city
included in their satellite package.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV president Eddy W. Hartenstein said his company plans to
make local channels available to 50 million US homes, beginning in
New York and Los Angeles, moving to Denver, Detroit, Miami, San
Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as it aims for 24 major
metropolitan markets.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of heart specialists watched on closed-circuit
television monitors at the Washington Convention Center as a tiny
device was implanted in a patient's coronary artery. The doctors
heard the voice of Dr. Martin Leon, a prominent cardiologist who
was describing the operation taking place in a hospital many miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Paragon stent,'' Leon said, identifying the tiny
wire cage that can hold blocked arteries open, as the names of the
device and its manufacturer scrolled across the screen. ``It's a
very nice stent.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who conducted research on the experimental device,
enthusiastically described its soft feel, its flexibility and its
similarity to a top-selling stent. The remarks seemed the perfect
endorsement from an objective scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But Leon was anything but a disinterested observer. What he did
not tell the assembled doctors was that he was an investor in the
company that manufactured the stent. And after the company
announced a merger that same week, he would be among a group of
about 100 investors who stood to share in as much as $75 million in
stock _ provided that the company hit certain business goals,
including sales targets for the stent he had so eagerly
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Leon is not the only one to wear many hats in the world of
medical devices. There, inventors are researchers. Researchers are
promoters. Promoters are investors. And, finishing the circle,
investors are inventors. Rare is the truly disinterested
researcher, with no stake in the outcome of a study. It is a
phenomenon found in every medical treatment using devices, from
laser surgery to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, scientists on the front line of such medical
research, whose work can help determine treatment options for
countless Americans, often can earn vast wealth so long as their
results are positive. It is an immense financial pressure that
would be unacceptable in any other field of medical research.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the influence of these conflicts, The New
York Times examined interventional cardiology, a specialty where
some of the most rapid device development has occurred. The field
has emerged over the last 20 years, using tiny devices to remove
the coronary vessel obstructions that can lead to chest pain. Some
12 million Americans now suffer from coronary disease _ the
nation's top killer.
</P>
<P>
   To profit from this huge market, companies are scurrying to set
up professional and financial relationships with cardiologists who
invent and promote devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are an interventional cardiologist and you are working
hand in glove with the companies and you might have a financial
interest, what else is new?'' said Dr. David Hillis, a cardiologist
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ``If you
have no conflict of interest, then you would stand out like a sore
thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   But the examination by the Times found that those financial ties
have transformed the traditional system of objective medical
research and review. Now, the system used to determine which device
is best for heart patients can be influenced as much by personal
financial interests as by scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   This troubles some doctors. ``I treat a disease that's going to
kill half of all people in America,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, a
cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. ``How I treat that disease
ought not to be decided by who's lining someone else's pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cardiologists were less concerned and said they feared
changing the system to eradicate conflicts would slow the progress
of a field that has been a miracle, providing simple procedures
that alleviate often crippling pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know of any other option,'' said Dr. Paul S.
Teirstein, director of interventional cardiology at the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. ``If you want to
ban us from the research, that would crimp development. We supply a
lot of the creativity and push behind these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Leon expressed regret that what he described as
inattentiveness to potential conflicts would sully the reputation
of his medical specialty. Often, he said, doctors are unaware of
their own financial incentives _ for example, he said he had no
idea he was a beneficiary of a sales incentive for the Paragon
stent, and said that he later did not hesitate to present
disappointing data on the device at a medical meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to do well on the big things _ taking care of
patients,'' Leon said after being presented with findings from the
examination by the Times. ``We do less well on the fine details,
and the fine details are becoming important components as to how we
behave. It's important to re-dedicate ourselves and perhaps
redefine what the standards should be.''
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, some cardiologists fear that the influence of
potential riches has distorted medicine's search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science has been lost in the rush for money,'' Nissen of
the Cleveland Clinic said. ``We've lost our way. We've terribly,
terribly lost our way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To deal with conflicts, interventional cardiologists have
adopted a loose policy of voluntary disclosure. Doctors who write
for medical journals or make presentations at educational forums
are expected to disclose to their colleagues every financial
conflict that might influence their judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But such disclosures often are haphazard and incomplete. Many
speakers, writers and investigators failed to disclose their
patents, investments and other corporate conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said such poor disclosure was a prime example of the
flaws in a system that relies on individual conscience to counter
possible scientific bias. ``Voluntary disclosure is not a very high
standard,'' said Marc A. Rodwin, an associate professor of law and
public policy at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at
Indiana University who has studied financial conflicts in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You can't have this up to the individual. The fact
that you have a conflict of interest means that you are not in a
good position to judge these kinds of issues, that your judgment is
compromised. That is the defining part of having a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many doctors, clinical trials can serve as a form of
investment research. For example, Dr. Richard A. Schatz, who
directs research in interventional cardiology at the Scripps Clinic
and Research Foundation, is now testing a new treatment, gene
therapy, using a method developed by a small company, Vascular
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   After treating six patients, Schatz said he was sure the
treatment was working. Now, he said, ``I've invested in the company
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vascular Genetics was founded by Dr. Jeffrey Isner, an
interventional cardiologist at Saint Elizabeth's Medical Center in
Boston. Isner, who is also a major shareholder in the company,
directs the company's clinical trials. He said his conflicts did
not pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to dismiss this out of hand,'' Isner said.
``But I'm not going to be a wimp and roll over because someone is
projecting a concern. I understand what the arguments are, but,
quite frankly, I don't agree with most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators are also on the boards of companies that
manufacture devices they are testing. For example, Leon is a
director of Angiosonics Inc., a device company based in Research
Triangle Park, N.C., while Buchbinder is on the board of Radiance
Medical Systems of Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As directors, both men have a fiduciary obligation to
shareholders. But as clinical investigators, their role is to be
neutral about the outcome of tests on the companies' products.
Those two responsibilities, experts said, cannot be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Leon said he now thought he should never have served in dual
roles, and that if he was going to be on the board, he should not
have been an investigator. ``In retrospect, that wasn't a good
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, medical companies realized that to develop
devices, they needed close relationships with the interventional
cardiologists _ the only people with the knowledge and experience
to come up with new products.
</P>
<P>
   Those collaborations began inauspiciously. In the early 1990s,
many of the companies were small and were still in the development
stage. To pay for the advisers they so desperately needed, the
financially struggling companies provided the doctors with stakes
in their companies in place of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the industry was transformed into a big business,
fortunes rained on corporate executives and interventional
cardiologists alike.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options once worth pennies have brought many doctors
millions. The riches helped attract an increasing number of doctors
to the field. Where once few cardiologists were available to
conduct research, now dozens are begging for a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But that demand has not been matched by a drive to narrow the
potential conflicts between the cardiologists and the industry.
Some experts remained dismayed by the standards in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflicts are just overwhelming,'' said Dr. John Wasson, a
professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, when told
details of the findings by the Times. ``If you can't trust the
opinion leaders, and the so-called experts, and even worse, in some
cases, the studies themselves, what happens to the profession and
what happens to the patients?''

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE IN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown went on the attack against challenger Tom Ammiano in a
debate that left little doubt: The race for mayor of San Francisco
is between a consummate machine politician and an outsider eager to
shake up the status quo.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking the tenor of mayoral debates to a new level of animosity,
Brown used Sunday's forum in Bayview-Hunters Point to paint
Ammiano, president of the Board of Supervisors, as an ineffective
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can only get one other vote on any issue at the board...
maybe two,'' Brown said. ``The other eight members of the board
will not follow his leadership, unlike when I was in the (state)
Legislature, when everyone followed my leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who landed in the runoff with a last-minute write-in
campaign, defended his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different styles of leadership, and I think
that the 120,000 votes I got for president of the board shows the
kind of leadership that I have. It's not always about numbers at
the board: I've been able to turn to the public to get many issues
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Brown continued to lambaste Ammiano as
``totally and completely ineffective in everything he undertakes -
and he whines about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With this tactic, Brown is taking a chance with voters. Polls
show that voters see Brown as a strong leader but are wary of what
they perceive as his arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Ammiano has criticized Brown for running
roughshod over the 11-member Board of Supervisors, six of whom were
appointed by Brown since he took over the mayor's job four years
ago. Early in his administration, Brown boasted of his ability to
secure a majority of votes on the board whenever he wants and
sparked controversy by referring to legislators as ``mistresses''
that needed to be ``serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano often has found himself at odds with the board majority,
seeing many of his legislative initiatives stymied.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his proposal to enact a living wage in San
Francisco, which would boost them wage for employees who
work for city contractors or businesses that lease property from
the city to $11 an hour plus benefits, has been put on the slow
track by his opponents on the board who are closely allied with the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been stalled at the board while a task force
reviews the plan. Ammiano said the legislation has been
stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Brown's support, the board blocked Ammiano's plan to
ban banks from double-charging customers to use ATMs. However,
Ammiano took the plan to the voters earlier this month, winning
overwhelming support.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who served as the powerful speaker of the California
Assembly before running for mayor and has the endorsement of most
of San Francisco's elected officials, pointed to the living wage
issue as one of Ammiano's failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make speeches; I act,'' Brown said. ``I don't complain
that somebody is blocking me. If you want to be mayor of this city,
you've got to be able to produce the leadership to get things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who said he represents an independent voice for San
Francisco, suggested that Brown's style of governing may not be
what's best for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board of Supervisors and the mayor are co-equal and they
shouldn't be beholden to each other,'' Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' one-hour debate touched on several other issues,
most of which focused on Bayview-Hunters Point - an economically
depressed neighborhood with a large population of African
Americans, and one of Brown's traditional strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, was not
broadcast on television or radio, but was held in front of a live
audience heavily weighted toward the mayor.

TRADE AGREEMENT SPURS STOCK BUYING IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a dark, cavernous room literally tucked under the
seats of the Beijing Workers Stadium, hundreds of Chinese spend
time sitting on coarse wooden benches squinting to see red and
green numbers march down an electronic display screen half as long
as a football field.
</P>
<P>
   In groups of two or three, the spectators, all men, chat and
joke. They smoke and drink tea. Occasionally one grabs his wallet
and rushes to the transaction terminals under the screen, anxious
to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   With its smoky haze and cement floor littered with butts, the
room has the look of a subterranean Off Track Betting office. In
fact, it is an office of the Beijing International Trust Investment
Co. and Security Exchange _ one of China's many new stock
brokerages for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Small Chinese investors and would-be investors have been
converging at such places all over China, particularly in the past
couple of weeks since China and the United States signed a trade
agreement that is expected to lead to China's membership in the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A slice of urban China, they have come filled with hopes and
worries, theories and predictions about the economic impact of the
deal, which theoretically will give foreign companies far greater
access to China's markets and give Chinese companies increased
opportunities to sell goods overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard the thing was signed I put all my money
in,'' said Liang Yongbin, a cheerful 31-year-old chef, who stood
before a screen of computer graphics at the brokerage one recent
day, studying the saw-tooth path of Chinese stock-price behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade pact was signed Nov. 15, the domestic stock
markets have seesawed, rising and falling on shifting opinions and
rumors about winners and losers among Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 135-nation trade group's ministerial meeting
in Seattle, some of the investor euphoria surrounding the prospect
of China's membership seems to have abated. Part of the reason may
just be a broad realization that China will not officially join the
trade group until sometime next year, and that its power to
influence the meeting is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But for long-term investors, the more important fact is that
China and the United States have a significant trade agreement that
is likely to greatly expand their commercial relationship and could
make some Chinese stocks very attractive several years from now.
And it should lead eventually to a major overhaul of China's
bloated state-owned companies, freeing up economic resources for
more efficient use.
</P>
<P>
   Liang said he started buying stocks _ textiles mostly _ when he
first heard that the long-stalled negotiations appeared to be
making progress a week or so before the pact was signed. And when
prices fell dramatically for some stocks just after the pact was
announced, he threw in his entire fortune, buying stocks he
considered undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think WTO will have a big impact here, but I think many
stock buyers in China are not experienced enough to understand
it,'' he said. ``And everyone here has a different idea.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the behavior of the stock markets in China, which
are barely a decade old, is not necessarily a reliable barometer of
investor opinion or a forecaster of China's economy. Although the
trade pact has been celebrated as a triumph in the state-controlled
press, Chinese investors have little concrete information, since
only sketchy details of the agreement have been presented in
newspapers and the television news.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following news of the trade deal, many Chinese
investors quickly dumped the stocks of car makers and
telecommunications companies, industries they believed were poorly
equipped to handle foreign competition. The two Chinese markets,
one in Shanghai and the other in the southern city of Shenzhen,
both fell about 1.5 percent that day.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next few days the same markets surged, as the press
aggressively touted the advantages of the deal. ``Investors are
becoming convinced that China will gain more than its loses from
WTO, thanks to the upbeat media coverage,'' an article in the China
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that week the market had fallen again, with
investors _ on further reflection _ unsure. The same pattern of up
one day, down the next prevailed last week as well. As of the end
of today both the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had basically
returned to where they were a few weeks ago, off only about 1
percent from their closing levels the day the trade deal was
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the initial excitement that the trade deal caused among
the growing populace of stock-market dabblers in China provides
some insight into how far the art of investing has come in this
nation, which once regarded financial markets as contemptible tools
of greedy capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came right over when I heard prices were low and today I'm
buying medicine and information stocks,'' Yu Xiyong, a 30-year-old
in a tweed jacket who works as a clothes seller near the Beijing
Workers Stadium, said one day last week as the market was falling.
He explained that he hoped a WTO agreement might in some way help
traditional pharmaceutical firms export their products and make
more investment available to China's fledgling high technology
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ups and downs, there have been some clear winners
and losers.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles were almost universally seen as a good buy, since the
trade deal requires the United States to remove import tariffs on
Chinese garments within five years. Among the biggest gainers in
the days immediately following the trade deal were Shanghai's No. 3
Woolen Mill Co., partly owned by the state, which rose nearly 23
percent, and China Garments Co., a maker of silks fabrics and
artificial fur, which rose 8 percent. Shares of Jingwei Textile
Machinery Co. rose more than 50 percent, though they have since
relinquished much of their gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese automotive industry, on the other hand, suffered
dearly: many of the big losers on both exchanges were companies
which manufacture cars, busses or trucks. Nanfang Motors Co., for
example, which makes small and midsized cars, motorcycles and auto
parts, has fallen more than 10 percent and Monday reached a 52-week
low. Jinan Diesel Engine Co. has fallen 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trade pact, China has promised to drastically reduce
its 80 to 100 percent import duties on foreign-made vehicles _
duties that have forced China's emerging middle class to chose from
a rather sorry range of domestic cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold cars and bought textiles and electronic equipment the
day after the agreement,'' said Wei, a gnarled unemployed man in a
rust-colored jacket with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. He
predicted that many state enterprises could go bankrupt from the
effects of membership in the WTO.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a country where information is scarce and so much of the
economy is still ultimately under government control, playing the
stock market requires diverse skills: scavenging for financial
facts, watching corporate profits and loss and also trawling for
hints of the government's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the market jumped immediately following news
of the trade pact, many who follow the stock market suspected that
large investment companies partly owned by the state were buying
stocks at the government's behest to energize a market that had
been sagging.
</P>
<P>
   There are many imponderables in the Chinese stock market. And at
places like Workers Stadium stock exchange, many people play it
safe, wandering in to watch the big board rather than to buy. It is
at once a stock exchange, social club for middle-aged men,
gathering place for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's purpose here is different,'' said Liang, the chef,
who bought Internet stocks when the market slumped a week ago.
``Some come here to make money. Some to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Liang said that in the last three years he had made enough money
with stocks to pay for his wedding and a small apartment. And he
feels that in the long term, membership in the trade organization
would be good for Chinese business and that stock prices would
rise.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he explained, ``I know the stock market here is still a
kind of gambling. But I'm young and earning money, so it's OK.''

 &HT;    With Thrashers slumping, GM listening for right offers
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thrashers general manager Don Waddell got calls Monday
morning from four counterparts. A newspaper story had suggested
that the struggling expansion team might be preparing to clear
roster space by cutting loose veteran players. ``I think a lot of
GMs, like me, bookmark newspaper Web sites,'' Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   At least six teams have contacted Waddell since he said last
week that a number of rookie recalls from the minors and early
evaluation of veterans could lead him to ``move some veteran guys
out of here.'' Waddell took the response as good news. If a general
manager wants anything, it's a bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   But no deals had developed as of Monday. The Thrashers made only
one roster move, reassigning goalie Rick Tabaracci to Orlando,
ostensibly to get him into a game Wednesday at Kansas City while
the Thrashers have a four-day break. Tabaracci played strong hockey
for two periods Sunday against Dallas, then allowed three goals in
the third period of a 4-2 loss, the team's 11th in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaracci's return before Friday's game against Florida hinges
on the health of Damian Rhodes and Norm Maracle, both
rehabilitating from ankle sprains. Maracle, who has been practicing
and appears to be ahead of Rhodes, could be activated before
Friday. If neither makes it back, Tabaracci will return. The
concussion suffered Saturday by right winger Nelson Emerson, out at
least two weeks, might have bought some time for a Thrasher. When
defenseman Petr Buzek was activated from injured reserve, Emerson
went on IR to make roster room. Otherwise, Buzek's activation would
have taken up a spot.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one move will have to be made when left winger
Jason Botterill is recalled from Orlando, possibly before the team
leaves on a West Coast trip next week.
</P>
<P>
   Botterill was recalled Oct. 30, played three games, missed three
with a back injury and was sent back down for two weeks of
conditioning. But he suffered a concussion in his first game with
the Solar Bears. He returned Friday and has a goal and two assists
in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential moves in the near future include activating
defenseman Maxim Galanov from injured reserve and recalling
defenseman Brett Clark from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said only that he is ``on the phone every day'' and
would not speculate on roster changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel like we can improve the team, we'll trade for a
player or draft picks or create room on the roster for young
players to get more ice time,'' he said. ``But I'm not going to
make a deal to hurt anybody. I'm only going to make a deal if
something makes sense.''

PLANNED EXXON-MOBILE MERGER TO BRING 2,000 WORKERS TO HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON_ More than 2,000 workers are expected to relocate to
Houston in the wake of Exxon Corp.'s planned $83.5 billion purchase
of its longtime rival Mobil Corp., sources close to the merger
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state regulators are poised to approve that merger
Tuesday, after wrenching promises from the oil giants during
pain-staking, yearlong negotiations to sell off or end contracts
with more than 2,400 service stations nationwide, including about
84 Mobil-branded stations in the Greater Houston area, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been like an elephant giving birth,'' said Fadel Gheit,
an oil analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Exxon and Mobil first announced plans a year ago to pull
off the largest industrial merger to date, they envisioned slashing
9,000 jobs worldwide as part of the consolidation effort.
</P>
<P>
   Now industry analysts expect those job cuts to be even deeper.
But the influx of new jobs to the Houston area is expected to
offset those losses and provide a net employment gain for the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   This combined company, to be known as Exxon Mobil Corp., plans
to consolidate its exploration and production business as well as
its chemical operations in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 2,000 employees relocating to Houston will
be pulled from Mobil's offices in Dallas, as well as Mobil's
corporate offices in Fairfax, Va., and even from operations
overseas, sources close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon employs about 12,800 workers in the Greater Houston,
including 4,000 at the company's refinery in nearby Baytown. Mobil
has 575 workers in the area, and another 2,300 in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, the
city's business booster, said consolidations occur in the energy
sector ``Houston seems to come out O.K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals from Texas,
California and a number of other states are expected to approve the
merger Tuesday. Regulators from the European Union, Canada,
Australia and several other countries have already signed off on
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn ``is optimistic that the
conditions of the merger will preserve a competitive marketplace
for Texas,'' said Cornyn spokesman Ted Delisi.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has voiced
concerns about the merger, but he does not have the power to block
a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a consent decree to be unveiled Tuesday,
Exxon and Mobil will sell more than 2,400 service stations,
representing about 15 percent of the companies' stations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Those locations are primarily in the Northeast and California,
sources said. In Texas, the agreement will affect more than 330
service stations, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of those locations are owned by Tetco Stores, a joint
venture between Mobil and San-Antonio-based Tetco, which operates
service stations stretching from San Antonio to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil also will pull out of a joint venture with Dallas-based
Southland involving 10 stations under the 7-Eleven banner in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Gheit said he was somewhat surprised by the number of service
stations the combined company will be expected to sell. ``I thought
it would cost a pound of flesh, and it cost a pound and a half,''
Gheit said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with regulators is expected to allow the new
owners to continue selling gasoline under the Exxon and Mobil names
for the next decade. Motorists could continue to use their Exxon
and Mobil credit cards and could continue to purchase gasoline
feature Exxon and Mobil proprietary detergent packages, the
features that distinguish one brand from another.
</P>
<P>
   Service station dealers, meanwhile, are fearful regulators _ in
their zeal to find buyers large enough to represent real
competition for Exxon Mobil in the retail business _ will try to
circumvent a regulation that gives independent owner operators the
right of first refusal in the case of a sale. They have threatened
to sue if the consent decree does not give them that option.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also insisted the combined company sell a
129,500-barrel-a-day refinery owned by Exxon in Benicia, Calif., in
the northern part of that state. Mobil owns the 130,000
barrel-a-day Torrance refinery near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Those refineries serve different parts of the state. And Equilon
Enterprises, the Houston-based refining, marketing and
transportation joint venture between Shell Oil Co. and Texaco,
already controls a greater share of the refining market in
California than a combined Exxon and Mobil would.
</P>
<P>
   But California only has a handful of refiners supplying its
special blend of gasoline, and regulators feared any consolidation
would send already high California pump prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Exxon Mobil also will control about 18 percent of the
refining capacity along the Gulf Coast, with Exxon's Baytown and
Baton Rouge, La., plants, and Mobil's Beaumont refinery and joint
venture with the Venezuelan state-owned oil company in Chalmette,
La.
</P>
<P>
   Many refining analysts had expected regulators to force the new
mega-giant to sell off one of these plants. Instead, government
officials were satisfied with promised changes in the lube oils
business.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing Mobil, Exxon not only will secure its position as
the largest publicly traded oil company in the world but also _ at
least for now _ become the largest corporation in the United States
as measured by revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many have raised concerns about regulators allowing these two
companies to stitch together two of the main pieces of the old
Standard Oil Co. broken up nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Roosevelt, where are you when we need you,'' Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., lamented recently, referring to the president
who took on Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Wenonah Hauter, an activist with Public Citizen, called the
merger ``terrible news for consumers, because it is likely to lead
to higher prices at the gas pumps and decreased competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new oil company is expected to have staggering annual
revenues, possibly larger than the economies of Denmark, Austria or
Greece,'' Hauter said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, combining these two oil majors will not
recreate the kind of monopoly enjoyed by Standard Oil. The two
companies' combined oil production in 1998 _ 2.5 million barrels a
day _ is only slightly more than the 2.3 million barrels a day
Mobil produced in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Merging the companies is not expected to be simple or easy. When
British Petroleum merged with Amoco, a culture clash took place and
the same is expected to occur at Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two excellent companies with strong heritages which
makes for very strong cultures,'' said Jonathan Crystal, senior
director with the Houston office of executive search firm Spencer
Stuart. ``Anytime you try to combine such strong cultures, it will
be more difficult than less difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal's office has already begun working to find new jobs for
current or former Mobil employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon shares rose 1 3/8 Monday to close at 79 3/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange, while Mobil's stock rose 9/16 to close at 103
1/2.

HOLIDAYS BRING UP A SINGLE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is a plea to Mom, Dad, Grandma, Titi, Nana,
Auntie and all the uncles from Andre to Jarrel to Zach this holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask. Don't hint. Don't tell.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when in the presence of single people, think twice
before starting any question that begins with the word,
``Soooooooooooo?''
</P>
<P>
   The word can make even the calmest single jump.
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``Soooooooooo, is there someone special?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Soooooooooo, how do you like my dentist's nephew who I
invited for dessert and sat next to you even though it meant
rearranging the whole table and making your Uncle Lou sit in the
kitchen?''
</P>
<P>
   And the cut to the chase, ``Soooooooooo, grandchildren?''
</P>
<P>
   Jumpy. Very jumpy. Stomach-turning-can't-hold-the-pumpkin-pie
jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself in their shoes for a second.
</P>
<P>
   The single person in your life comes over for dinner and is
hugging a table leg between his three married sisters and their
husbands. Or maybe your sister, who just broke up with her fiance,
flies in to spend the holiday with you and your poodle, Boom Boom.
Or your daughter takes a break from her 70-hour-a-week job to bake
with you for an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Holidays are filled with expectations. Everyone is in love.
Families (read large groups of couples linked by blood and more
importantly MARRIAGE) are perfect. Turkeys are juicy.
</P>
<P>
   Nagging about someone's love life during the holidays is like
reminding them that life didn't turn out like all those holiday
movies. And it is their fault.
</P>
<P>
   I asked singles to write about their visits home for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that they're trying to show their interest in me,
but it makes me feel like I'm not living up to what they expect of
me,'' wrote one woman from Troy, N.Y. ```So, seeing anybody
special? When's the wedding?' It's gentle pressure toward their
idea of a good life, which involves marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If instead they asked, `How are you? What's new and exciting?'
they'd show their interest in my life, being completely supportive,
without putting pressure on me about my love life.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of your single relatives actually want to talk about
their love lives, they will. As one man _ who welcomes his mother
collecting phone numbers on his behalf _ wrote, ``I can use all the
help I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest, here's how it looks.
</P>
<P>
   If they have a ``special someone'' and are ready to talk about
it, they would have been gushing on the phone a week ago. Asking
over the mashed potatoes just makes them feel embarrassed when they
have to answer, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help if you follow this up with, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   And the real topper is, ``Well, when I was your age ...''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning your prayers, lit candles and imminent death is not
helpful either.
</P>
<P>
   As one 36-year-old University at Albany grad student said, ``If
you have to ask, do it while your child has a mouth full of sweet
potatoes and marshmallows so they can't yell immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodding, she said, just makes her think about the differences
between the time when her father was in his 30s and married with a
circle of married friends and her own generation in which she and
most of her friends are single.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman e-mailed me with her family's annual holiday
question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hear, `Do you have a boyfriend yet?''' she wrote. ``I
always answer, `No,' and I can see the fear on their faces that I
will never marry. That I will only amount to a miserable, old,
single woman for my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't the turkey _ juicy or dry _ be nicer without that?

COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER BOYCOTT LAW INTERFERES WITH U.S. POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
Massachusetts intruded too far into the realm of foreign policy
when it adopted a law requiring state agencies to boycott companies
that do business with the military regime in Myanmar, formerly
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   So-called Burma laws _ descendants of the numerous state and
local laws that barred trade with South Africa during the era of
apartheid _ have proliferated in the last few years. This case,
with its overtones of federalism and with billions of dollars in
public purchasing power at stake, is likely to be one of the most
closely watched disputes on the court's docket.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and more than two dozen localities have barred
their departments and agencies from buying goods and services from
companies that trade with Burma, Cuba or other authoritarian
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last June, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in
Boston, declared the Massachusetts law unconstitutional as an
``impermissible intrusion into the foreign affairs power of the
national government.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld an earlier ruling by a federal district
judge in Boston, in a lawsuit challenging the 1996 law filed by the
National Foreign Trade Council, an association of companies that do
business overseas. Thirty-four of the group's member companies were
on the state's ``restricted purchase'' list. The European Union
filed a brief in the district court opposing the law, and both the
European Union and Japan brought formal complaints about the law to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Striking down the law in an opinion by Judge Sandra Lynch, the
appeals court said that while there was no debate over the
existence of ``deplorable'' conditions in Myanmar, a state had no
constitutional authority to regulate conduct beyond its borders.
Judge Lynch said the law was a ``direct attempt to regulate the
flow of foreign commerce,'' a sphere of activity she said was the
exclusive province of the federal government under the foreign
commerce clause of the Constitution. That clause of Article I gives
Congress the power to ``regulate commerce with foreign nations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the state's Supreme Court appeal, filed by Andrew Natsios,
the Massachusetts secretary of administration and finance, the
state makes the contrary argument that ``not one constitutional
grant, prohibition, or command requires the states to trade with
dictators.'' Noting that 23 states and 80 cities had once had
``selective purchasing'' laws aimed at South Africa, the
Massachusetts brief said that ``nothing in our federal Constitution
denies to the states the right to apply a moral standard to their
spending decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad spectrum of groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs
urging the justices to hear the Massachusetts appeal, Natsios vs.
National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474. A group of state and
local governments as well as nonprofit and human rights
organizations told the court to overturn the appeals court's
decision, while business groups including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers said the
justices should take the case in order to affirm the appeals court
and make its decision binding on the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, Judge Lynch, noting that there are 39,000
different governments in the country, said there was the potential
for cacophony if many others followed the Massachusetts model. She
observed that there were substantial differences between the
Massachusetts law and the more flexible approach the federal
government took almost simultaneously in imposing trade sanctions
on Myanmar. ``In the federal Burma law, Congress has chosen to rely
on both carrots and sticks'' while ``Massachusetts uses a cudgel,''
Judge Lynch said, adding that the state law ``interferes with the
ability of the federal government to speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In another significant development at the court Monday, the
justices agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to New Jersey's
hate crime law. That law provides enhanced sentences for crimes
that a judge finds were committed ``with a purpose to intimidate an
individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey's Ethnic Intimidation Act, enacted in 1990, a
jury determines whether a defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt of the underlying offense. The judge then decides, by the
lower standard of ``a preponderance of the evidence,'' whether the
defendant had a ``purpose to intimidate.'' If so, the sentence can
be doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, is an appeal by a
white man who received an enhanced sentence, 12 years instead of
10, after pleading guilty to firing a rifle into a nearby house
owned by the only black family in his Vineland neighborhood. While
Charles Apprendi did not dispute that he fired the eight bullets,
he did dispute the judge's finding that he was motivated by a
desire to intimidate the residents because of their race; he
asserted that his act was provoked by an obsessive-compulsive
disorder, aggravated by medication and heavy drinking, and that the
victims' race was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Jersey Supreme Court, he argued that in any event,
his motivation was an element of the offense that the prosecution
was constitutionally obliged to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt. The judge's determination, by a lower standard of proof as
part of the sentencing phase, deprived him of his Sixth Amendment
right to trial by jury, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court rejected the constitutional
challenge and upheld Apprendi's sentence in a 5-2 decision last
June. For its part, the U.S. Supreme Court has indicated
considerable doubt, in other contexts, about the constitutionality
of treating questions about a defendant's state of mind as simple
sentencing factors rather than as essential elements of the offense
that need to be proved to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the hate crime context, the approach of providing increased
penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice has won wide acceptance
since it was proposed in the 1980s by the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith. Michael Lieberman, a lawyer here for the
Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview Monday that 40 states
and the District of Columbia have enacted some version of the
organization's model statute. He said the majority of these laws
would not be affected by the Supreme Court's decision in the New
Jersey case because, unlike the New Jersey law, most of the laws
make the defendant's motive an element of the offense that a jury
has to find beyond a reasonable doubt.

HACKER NAILS STAPLES ONLINE AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping on line may be the best way to avoid holiday crowds,
but customers visiting Staples' Web site one day last month
encountered a unique problem when they unwittingly found themselves
in a competitor's store.
</P>
<P>
   A hacker broke into the Framingham, Mass. office supply
retailer's Internet site, www.staples.com, on Oct. 9 and posted
advertisements for one of the company's major competitors, Office
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers clicking on Office Depot products were immediately
linked to the home page of Staples' major competitor, which is
based in Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Unamused officials at Staples, Inc. filed a lawsuit in US
District Court in Boston Monday charging that ``John Doe,'' the
unidentified hacker, illegally accessed the company's Web site and
damaged the company by stealing e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the hacker is believed to live in or near
Massachusetts and that the company expects to identify him shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it highly unlikely that one of our competitors
were involved in any way,'' said Shannon Lapierre, public relations
manager of Staples, speculating that the changes to the Web site
may have been a prank.
</P>
<P>
   But Staples, which just announced third-quarter Internet sales
revenue of $24 million, is taking the Web-site intrusion seriously
and is determined to identify the culprit and report him to federal
authorities, Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal authorities have been on the lookout for
Internet fraud. Federal law prohibits unauthorized access to a
computer and calls for up to 10 years in prison if damage is
recklessly caused as a result of the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously e-commerce is a very important part of our business
and very important to the company,'' said Lapierre, noting that
Staples' goal is to have a million on-line customers and a billion
dollars in Internet sales by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, which did $7 billion in sales last year and operates
more than 1,000 office superstores, launched its Web site a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   While monitoring the site Oct. 9, officials noticed that
products advertised throughout the Web site had been deleted and
replaced with products bearing the Office Depot logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dead giveaway,'' Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the Office Depot advertisements contained links to
the Florida company's Web site, meaning Staples visitors who
clicked on the illegally advertised products were redirected to the
competitor's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers were diverted from Staples to Office Depot for about an
hour before the problem was corrected, Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lost business, Staples alleges it cost the
company time and money to repair its Web site and determine the
extent of the security breach.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Office Depot, the world's largest seller of office
products, were referred to the company's vice president of public
relations, who couldn't be reached for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lapierre said the problems created by the hacker were had never
happened to Staples before. ``It's an interesting time we live
in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Staples' stock rose 1/4 Monday to close at 23-13/16 in trading
on the Nasdaq market. Office Depot closed at 11 1/2, down 1/8, on
the New York Stock Exchange.

E-SHOPPING'S GREAT FOR MANY, BUT NOT FOR ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON SHERON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For the cyber-savvy, there will be no last-minute
crisis over holiday gift-giving. For them, there will be no
frenzied trips to the malls, no fighting traffic, no midnight
gift-wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   They know that dolls, baseball gloves and computer software are
just a mouse click away and very far from crowded parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Clement of San Antonio is just the kind of online shopper
that dot-com companies cherish. Clement, a parent who has
discovered the joys of shopping online, plans to do at least some
holiday shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an efficiency freak,'' said Clement, senior vice
president, corporate development for American TeleSource
International Inc., a San Antonio-based telecommunications/Internet
software company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being the typical man. I know what I want. I get it (from
the online store) and get out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season isn't the only time people shop online,
however. ``I can do it late at night or whenever I want,'' said
Doug Weatherston, a restaurant owner in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He has bought for himself a 1976 Rolls Royce from the eBay
auction site, as well as replacement china, a jacket, jewelry and a
CD player from online retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherston views online shopping much like shopping by catalog,
only easier. ``I don't have a stack of mail-order catalogs at home,
but I have the equivalent with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done more shopping online during the past six months than
I have by catalog during the past six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions who have joined Clement and Weatherston to
shop online, Internet retailing remains an infant industry compared
to its brick-and-mortar sibling. Consumer e-commerce in the United
States now generates less than 1 percent of the nation's overall
retail sales of $2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But holiday sales and Internet commerce are getting greener,
much greener.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people plan to do at least some holiday
shopping online this year, according to some surveys. They are
forming a growing part of e-commerce that will explode from sales
of $20.5 billion this year to $147 billion by 2003, according to
Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.-based market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season some of the hottest retail categories, as
measured by one firm, are expected to be beauty products, toys and
video games. For these products, online buying will be twice was it
was last year, according to the international marketing information
company, NPD Group, based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   NPD Group estimates that 68 percent of the Internet users it
surveyed plan to buy something from an Internet site during the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But not clothing. NPD said last week that a majority of people
polled for a recent study - 85 percent of 2,399 respondents - said
they were concerned that they would not be able to try on a piece
of clothing before buying it. Half of the Internet users surveyed
said they never plan to buy clothing online.
</P>
<P>
   For other goods, though, the growth in e-commerce cash will
parallel the increase in the number of e-commerce sites. Today,
there are more than 2 million sites, four times the number last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just increasing at an amazing rate,'' thanks to
e-commerce sites becoming easier to create, said Carol Ferrara,
senior analyst in San Jose with the Stamford, Conn.-based
GartnerGroup, which owns Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   And while Web sites may proliferate, they have to be able to
pull in online shoppers. Some e-retailers, for example, are
offering consumers the opportunity to cash in coupons or collect
``rewards'' such as gift certificates just for surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, for example, has been offering its customers a $10
gift certificate for any toy or video game in its online bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In e-commerce, it's a very big trend,'' said Hilary Billings,
president and chief executive of RedEnvelope Gifts Online,
originally called 911gifts.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incentives are important to get new buyers to come in.
Then the pressure is on you to make sure that (shopping) experience
is going to keep them coming back,'' Billings said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, San Antonio retailers are expecting a strong shopping
season this year. TeleCheck Services, a check approval company,
estimates that retail sales nationwide will jump 3 percent to 5
percent over last year's holiday season. In San Antonio, sales may
climb 4 percent to 5 percent higher than last year, said economist
Keith Phillips at the San Antonio Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers know that online sites can't give consumers the direct
contact with products they get in a traditional store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it as a picture, but you can't test drive it,''
said Clay Killinger, a San Antonio-based partner and retail analyst
with the national accounting firm Arthur Andersen. ``You really
need to know what you're buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than competition, traditional retailers see the Internet
as an additional marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that it (online selling) doesn't have a
tremendous impact on our stores,'' said Rob Wallstrom, general
manager of Saks Fifth Avenue in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But Saks, like many well-known names in retailing, won't ignore
online selling. The New York-based retailer plans to launch its own
Internet site in the spring. ``It becomes an enhancement to
brick-and-mortar stores. It's more branding for the store,''
Wallstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks will be joining high-end retailer Nordstrom, which has more
than one Web site, including the new Nordstromshoes.com, along with
such other well-known retailers as the Gap, Lands' End and outdoor
apparel and equipment seller REI.
</P>
<P>
   Brick-and-mortar stores and Internet retailers may be chasing
after the same dollars, but they aren't necessarily treading on
each others' toes. To survive, retailers will need to offer
consumers multiple shopping options, whether in traditional stores,
by catalog or over the Internet, says Dataquest's Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   Having multiple shopping options means that savvy consumers can
compare prices and check up on the best Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot more effective research on the Internet,''
Killinger said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the online version of Consumer Reports began this
month evaluating Web sites just as it has for traditional stores.
Consumer Reports Online's e-Ratings is available to members at:
</P>
<P>
   www.consumerreports.org
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Forrester Research, an independent research firm
based in Cambridge, Mass., also ranks top commercial Web sites for
apparel, computing, books, toys, flowers, health and general
merchandise at:
</P>
<P>
   powerrankings.forrester.com When shopping online, however,
consumers should watch what they are doing. In other words,
practice safe shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association has created a new Web site with a
tip list to help consumers. It's at: www.safeshopping.org
</P>
<P>
   These tips include:
</P>
<P>
   Trust your instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Be knowledgeable about Web-based auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Double-check pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Review the return, refund, shipping and handling policies and
other legal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Check to make sure that the Web site is using security software
to protect your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Pay by credit card, so if there is a problem later on you can
dispute it more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Print out a copy of the terms and conditions of the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Ensure the safe delivery of your purchased items.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect your purchase.
</P>
<P>
   If a consumer has a complaint about an online vendor or needs
free information about how to spot or avoid a fraudulent business
practice, call the Federal Trade Commission, toll-free, at (877)
FTC-HELP (382-4357), or visit the FTC Web site and click on the
link to Consumer Protection at:
</P>
<P>
   www.ftc.gov
</P>
<P>
   Safe shopping is only part of the online adventure. Consumers
want a Web site that is easy to access and download.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web right now is more of a transactional medium than a
relationship-building medium,'' said Ferrara, the GartnerGroup
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers still have a ways to go to providing customer
service and establishing better relationships with customers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service issues such as on-time shipping and the
consumers' ability to return merchandise just now are becoming
integral in business-to-consumer e-commerce. Such services may be
fully in place within the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   That's because online shoppers are expecting to have some of the
same conveniences as if they were shopping in person, she added.
``The online population is beginning to mirror the offline
population.''
</P>
<P>
   For any number of goods, customers still will walk into
brick-and-mortar stores rather than shop for these items online or
through a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clement of San Antonio admits that most of his Christmas
shopping will be done in the old-fashioned brick-and-mortar
environment.

RESIGNATION SHAKES UNITED ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Turmoil rocked United Asset Management Corp. Monday as
the troubled investment management firm saw its number two leader
resign suddenly and its longstanding top executive and founder
announce he would retire soon.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise changes, which some industry analysts said
reflected fundamental problems with UAM's core strategy, left a
question mark over the company's immediate future and prompted talk
that UAM might undertake a dramatic restructuring or spin off some
of its languishing assets.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 18 months after joining the company, president Charles E.
Haldeman Jr. said he was leaving to head the Philadelphia-based
investment management arm of Lincoln National Corp., a leading life
insurer. Haldeman, 50, rose through the ranks of a UAM affiliate
and had been charged with turning around the parent's cash-flow
problems.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation, which he said was for personal reasons,
prompted Norton H. Reamer , UAM's 64-year-old chief executive,
board chairman, and founder to announce he would step down once a
new leader was found to assume both Reamer's and Haldeman's duties.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had functioned as co-leaders, and Reamer, who had
not publicly discussed retiring until Monday, said it would be
easier to recruit a single new top executive rather than try to
fill two slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing Ed (Haldeman) and we wish we weren't, but we
still have five out of six of the main people here,'' said Reamer.
</P>
<P>
   Haldeman was born and raised in Philadelphia and spent 23 years
at Philadelphia-based Cooke &AMP; Bieler, a UAM affiliate, before
moving to the parent company last year.
</P>
<P>
   UAM stock fell 1/4 Monday to close at 19 3/4. It is down about
24 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   UAM is a publicly-traded umbrella organization for 50 investment
management, marketing and distribution companies throughout the
United States and abroad. At a time when booming stock markets have
enriched money management companies, UAM has seen large outflows of
money. UAM, which oversees $193.6 billion in assets, saw clients
pull $19.8 billion in assets last year _ about 10 percent of its
asset base _ and $16 billion in 1997. The company lost about $11.5
billion in assets so far this year, but outflows had slowed in the
past two quarters to half the rate of previous periods.
</P>
<P>
   UAM has said it is the victim of a successful stock market in
which pension fund clients, its core customers, do not have to put
fresh money into plans run by UAM affiliates. UAM argues that the
market is giving them good returns and enabling them to forgo
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts cite poor investment performance and flaws in
UAM's basic strategy. UAM owns 100 percent of its affiliates, a
structure some observers have said leaves little incentive for the
subsidiaries to boost business. ``Ed (Haldeman) was there to try to
turn things around, and there was not terrific evidence that it was
working,'' said James P. Hanbury of Schroder Securities. ``The 100
percent equity ownership has proven to be faulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Reamer said UAM would continue a revamp launched last year under
which the company will selectively finance only its top businesses,
rather than offer equal support to all affiliates, and create
incentive plans linking compensation to cash flow improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our turnaround strategy is unfolding fairly well and
will continue with that strategy,'' Reamer said, adding that the
company was putting $25 million a year into its top 18 firms.
</P>
<P>
   UAM tried last year to sell a once-ailing affiliate, Pilgrim
Baxter &AMP; Associates, but the deal fell through when the buyer,
Nationwide Financial Services, backed out. Earlier this year, a
noted Pilgrim Baxter fund manager, James McCall, moved to Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. UAM tried but failed through a lawsuit to force him to
stay under a non-compete clause in his employment contract. A UAM
spokesman, Tucker Hughes, declined to say whether UAM would seek a
new buyer for Pilgrim Baxter now that the unit's assets are up to
$14 billion from $10 billion at the start of the year.

AMERICAN, CONTINENTAL AND UNITED REVERSE COURSE ON FARE INCREASE _
FOR NOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - FARES-NYT   By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 3 percent increase in air fares last week was quietly rolled
back when American Airlines, Continental Airlines and United
Airlines threw in the towel _ American on Sunday, Continental and
United on Monday. But analysts say that sooner or later, probably
sooner, the airlines will try to raise fares again.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation appeared almost inevitable when Delta Air
Lines, which had followed American's lead in raising fares across
the board eight days ago, decided on Thursday to rescind its raise
``to remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an apparent reference to the refusal by Northwest
Airlines, US Airways, Trans World Airlines and America West
Airlines to go along with the increase.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face by Delta, the third biggest airline, put pressure
on United, the unit of the UAL Corp. that is the leading carrier;
American, the AMR Corp. unit that is No. 2; and Continental, No. 5,
to reverse as well.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines attributed the proposed increases to rises in the
cost of aviation fuel, their second biggest expense after labor.
Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, said Monday that the
3 percent fare rise was intended to help offset a fuel-cost
increase of 15 percent in the third quarter over the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That increase, he said, resulted in a $456 million fuel bill for
the quarter, up from about $400 million in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.,
said, ``With profits expected to be down 20 to 30 percent this
year, mostly because of fuel costs, you would figure it would be
easy to pass on part of the fuel increase. What the cancellation
shows is that this is an industry that still cannot cover its cost
of capital or adopt rational pricing, even in a strong economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said, expect the carriers to return to the
issue. ``Higher fuel prices impact airlines across the board, so to
the extent that you see oil at elevated levels for an extended
period of time, we'll certainly see airlines come back with another
increase,'' Sam Buttrick, an analyst for Paine Webber, said.
</P>
<P>
   David Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport
Association, the industry's trade group, said that although there
have been several substantial fare increases this year,
``Passengers are paying eight-tenths of 1 percent less this year
than a year ago, because they have shopped for better bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick agreed, saying that while posted leisure fares are up
15 percent this year, the actual fare paid is down almost 1
percent. ``Posted fares are increasingly irrelevant,'' he added,
``as leisure and business travelers shop for and find lower fares,
aided by the Internet.''

 &HT;    Bradley outlines inclusive, general foreign policy
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ Democrat Bill Bradley pledged Monday to return
bipartisan consensus to American foreign policy decisions if
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an old saying that political divisions stopped at
the water's edge,'' Bradley told students and faculty at Tufts
University. ``Sadly, that consensus has vanished. Foreign policy
has become more of a political football or is made through polling
or focus groups to score domestic political points. I deplore
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech and in response to questions afterward, Bradley
offered few specific solutions to hot spots around the world.
Instead, Bradley sought to cast himself as a principled leader who
understood the changing global economy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three goals of foreign policy in his administration
would be to act to protect U.S. national security, maintain
America's leadership position in the world and ``talk honestly to
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed himself as a strong internationalist who would rely
heavily on help from organizations such as the United Nations to
quell unrest abroad before those conflicts became major threats to
world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called for a new round of nuclear arms reduction talks
between the United States and Russia. The United States should
pursue the negotiations, he said, even though Russia has not
ratified the last negotiated treaty, START II.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the goal of the third round of START talks should
be to reduce the number of nuclear warheads on each side to between
1,000 and 2,000, down from a level of 6,000 warheads per side
established under the first START treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the threat posed by Russia's aging arsenal of
nuclear warheads, Bradley also listed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein,
instability on the Korean peninsula and international terrorists as
the major threats to U.S. security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the multinational response to bloodshed in East Timor
and the 1991 intervention in Kuwait as examples of how nations can
work together to defend American interests. Bradley voted against
the 1991 Senate resolution authorizing President Bush to use force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser later described the vote as an
effort to give economic sanctions more time to work, and said
Bradley supported the use of U.S. troops in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Republican front-runner George W. Bush spelled out his foreign
policy vision in a speech Nov. 19 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Bush called for a foreign policy of
moderation in which the United States is not the world's cop but is
not afraid of wielding its clout, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush keyed on Russia and China, adding a nod to India's growing
importance.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday, Bradley took no direct shots at the
Clinton-Gore administration. But he criticized the United States'
handling of Russia since the fall of communism, saying a succession
of American leaders had failed to leverage weapons reductions out
of Russia in exchange for economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also sought to draw attention to his experience in
foreign policy. In his 18 years as a senator from New Jersey,
Bradley served eight years on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He
also belonged to the congressional task force that helped launch
the round of trade negotiations that led to the creation of the
World Trade Organization in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech Monday came as the Clinton administration is
hosting world leaders in Seattle to launch a new round of world
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, an ardent free trader, did not talk about the WTO
summit in his remarks. But in response to a question he said
changes should be made to the world body's controversial conflict
dispute resolution mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the WTO, which has been criticized for ignoring the
environmental impact of rulings, should have greater input from
interest groups and open more of its proceedings open to the
public. He also called for temporary wage supplements to U.S.
workers who lose their jobs because of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all things we can try to do to mitigate the negative
impact aspects of international trade, while keeping in full view
the overwhelmingly greater positive aspects of international
trade,'' Bradley said.

HOLIDAY SEASON MAY BE THE RIGHT TIME TO GET CLUTTER OUT OF YOUR
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If your daily bread is hard to spot beneath the
piles of clutter in your house, how will you ever find your
Christmas pudding?
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are a microcosm of your whole life, experts say. If
it's a muddle, odds are the holidays will be, too. But there's good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the best time to simplify.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, now. Especially now.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this the worst time to plunge into a new habit? Hardly. If
you don't, remember, you'll be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of the things you can control helps you cope with
those you can't, like the stack of invitations in the mail or the
line of traffic snaking ever slower. Or Mother Nature dropping a
foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it snow!'' you exclaim as you go through your happy tasks.
I am organized!
</P>
<P>
   To help, local clutter-buster Helen Volk has written a 33-page
booklet that highlights the key steps a person can take to handle
the holidays. Titled ``Organize and De-Stress the Christmas
Season,'' it costs $8.50 and is available on Volk's company Web
site, http://www.beyondclutter.com.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a step back, Volk said. An attitude check. If
you're whining, or bah-humbugging, stop.
</P>
<P>
   All those tasks you gave yourself? They're choices. View them as
such. After all, you selected them. Do them with a sense of fun and
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop telling yourself you must get ready for the next
happening,'' said Volk. ``Deal with each event as it arrives. Don't
worry about next week's party while you're picking out a Christmas
tree -- it won't make the party any better or help you enjoy
tree-selecting now.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, people are too stressed out to read a
200-page book, said Volk, a former pack-rat attorney who quit her
job to de-clutter her life and create the consulting firm Beyond
Clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so busy paying bills and keeping the house clean,
they don't ever stop and ask, 'What do I want to do with my
life?''' adds Janet Luhrs, a fellow ex-lawyer and Seattle
simplicity guru. ``They're unhappy, they want meaning in their
lives, they're stressed, so they just keep going in lockstep.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests calling a family meeting to talk about what the
holidays mean to you and how you'd like to celebrate. ``Once you've
got that umbrella of values in place, things can fan out from
there,'' she said. ``The point is to focus on people, not things.''
</P>
<P>
   Set a holiday budget. Remember, money does not equal love. ``I
don't want people to work extra hours and go into debt to get me a
gift,'' said Luhrs, author of ``The Simple Living Guide'' (Broadway
Books 1997), which has a chapter devoted to the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Luhrs' final bit of advice: Quit shopping.
</P>
<P>
   It took several years for simple-living advocate and author
Elaine St. James to bow out of the holidays, she recalls in her
book, ``Simplify Your Christmas: 100 Ways to Reduce The Stress &AMP;
Recapture the Joy of the Holidays'' (Andrews McMeel 1998).
</P>
<P>
   First, she advises, figure out what is complicating your
holidays. You don't need to change everything. It might be just
Christmas cards, or preparing family meals, or attending office
parties, or giving too many gifts.
</P>
<P>
   St. James and her husband stopped trimming a tree (whenever they
did, the cats trashed it anyway). They limited gift-giving to those
young children in their lives who still believed in Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   St. James offers alternatives. Focus on the solstice, for
example. Watching the sun rise and set each day with your children
will give them a sense of the seasons. Have them keep a chart of
the times as they watch the days quickly get longer. Or take walks
in the woods or mountains. ``Adopt'' an endangered species by
giving to a conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, experts agree, is this: Simplifying is not
organizing. Organizers often shuffle the same list of things. When
you simplify, you actually eliminate things you feel you have to
do.

YELTSIN IS HOSPITALIZED WITH SUSPECTED PNEUMONIA  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin was hospitalized Monday for the
second time in less than two months after doctors detected possible
pneumonia during a checkup, his press secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yakushkin, the press secretary, said that Yeltsin was
taken to the elite Central Clinical Hospital after doctors examined
him at his country residence. Yeltsin, 68, spent two days in the
hospital in October with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   He was reported ill with acute bronchitis last week. His ailment
led to the postponement of the signing of a treaty for union with
Belarus that is unpopular with some Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin on Monday denied once again conjectures that the main
purpose of signing such a treaty would be to enable Yeltsin to run
for president of a new union.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian Constitution, he can serve only two terms, and
his second term will end next July.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's plans are ``absolutely unambiguous,'' Yakushkin said.
``He leaves office in the summer of next year and intends to serve
out his presidential term and hand over power to the next
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Yakushkin reported that Yeltsin was still being
treated for a cold at his country residence and that his voice ``is
still hoarse.''
</P>
<P>
   Television footage was shown that was described as a meeting
Monday with Alexander Voloshin, his chief of staff, and it showed
Yeltsin looking alert and well, but later, Yakushkin reported that
Yeltsin had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has disappeared from public view at critical junctures a
number of times. He was reported to be having minor nose surgery in
December 1994, just as Russian troops first invaded Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, shortly after his re-election to a second
term, Yeltsin had quintuple bypass surgery. The Kremlin later
admitted that his disappearance just a week before the critical
vote against the Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, was because he
had a series of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been hospitalized four times this year, spending a
total of nearly six weeks in the hospital and much of the rest of
the time recuperating in his country residence or in a sanitorium
outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the public reaction to Yeltsin's ailments no longer
causes the panic it did even a year ago. On the one hand, he is
often ill. On the other hand, his chosen successor, Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin _ whose appointment this summer when he was the
little-known head of the Federal Security Service elicited
puzzlement _ appears to be firmly in control.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, not Yeltsin, is the one who is by all appearances in
charge of the current Chechen operation. The prime minister's
approval rating is higher than that of any other candidate to
succeed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his popularity seems to have reduced the chances of the
man who was thought to be the strongest competitor for the job,
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been known to grow jealous of the popularity of his
own appointees, though. He has fired two prime ministers this year,
but so far, there have been no signs of Putin's imminent removal.

GIVE TV A LITTLE CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the thanks being given these days, spare a little for
the state of television, will ya?
</P>
<P>
   We're in a kind of creative boom economy on television. There
are riches all around us. It's the kind of environment in which,
even if you decide to give up on ``Once and Again'' just for the
week, you find that time-slot mate and fevered competitor,
``Judging Amy,'' delivered a wonderful Thanksgiving episode that
was superb enough to make you think, ``Perhaps I'm watching the
wrong show.'' Or, at the very least, ``I need to figure out this
VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you as giddy and angelically naive as
Jennifer Love Hewitt. Everywhere you turn, there's something of
interest. Every night. Often in the same time slot. An
embarrassment of riches. Boy, life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Except that if you look a little closer, you can tell that the
TV networks are not feeling comfortable with success, that they are
tampering in the worst kind of ways and that, cynically, you could
say a major blunder across the board is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   But let's take a look at this one moment. On Tuesday, ABC is
expected to make an announcement about the state of ``Who Wants to
Be A Millionaire.'' When the network unleashed this game show on
the country, everybody went berserk. Then, after the initial run,
the network took it off the schedule and put it on the Big Guns
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   You know, as a kind of security. Then, this sweeps month, it
brought it off the shelf and fired the dang thing at all the other
networks. Down they fell, along with their ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Did you love ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire'' the second time
around? Most people did. But it grated on you a little, too, didn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   Just when you were losing faith, out popped the first
millionaire in the show's history. That's why this British show was
imported in the first place. Nobody in England was greedy enough to
go for the really big bucks. But in America, everybody wants to be
a millionaire, and damn if we didn't get somebody all the way to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's regroup. ABC has to make a decision about the show.
Put it back on the Big Guns shelf or make it a staple on the
schedule - two, maybe three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Red flags should be popping up everywhere if you really, dearly
love TV. Because ABC has no idea what to do with success. That it
couldn't manage to bring ``NYPD Blue'' back in the fall - because
``Once and Again'' was a hit - proved yet again that the
decision-makers there have spilled their little box of clues.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but ABC seems perplexed on how to turn ``Sports
Night'' into a hit. Pulling it from sweeps, as the network did, is
not the answer. And now, the befuddled folks at the Mickey Mouse
network face a decisive moment: How to handle this luxury of having
so many good shows.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it decides to dump a couple of ``20/20'' nights - don't
count on it - something will have to give. The fear here is that a
good show (or shows) will be scuttled to make room for a game show
that could prove little more than a fad. Yeah, it's hot now but the
format is so limiting and Regis Philbin is so annoying that, soon,
people will tune out. And by then, good comedies or dramas may have
been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Put your hand on the ground and divine what lays ahead. Meditate
on where things are going. Are you nervous? You should be. What
started in September as a season that looked chock full of good
quality the likes we haven't seen in perhaps a decade is slowly
devolving into game shows, sweeps stunts and the persistent
survival of newsmagazines (and here cynics thought at least one
evil, game shows, would supplant another - but they foster each
other, like weeds).
</P>
<P>
   An argument also could be made that wrestling, which dominates
cable and has resuscitated UPN, is a blight that shows no sign of
abating. In fact, look for additional wrestling shows to pop up
soon - potentially displacing sitcoms or dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't we have been given most of the TV season to simply
enjoy and, yes, give thanks for this bounty? Even UPN, when it's
not showing wrestling, has good shows. Most fans of TV have
complained that there's almost too much quality now, and no time to
watch all the shows. That's why we needed time to grow into the
fall schedule. Some people are only now appreciating ``That '70s
Show'' from last season, turning it into a hit. Sometimes, when the
``The X-Files' seems too scary or confusing, ``Snoops'' is a light,
weightless alternative - like a greasy burger that tastes great
even if you're watching your fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   When you're constantly forced to choose between two good shows
in the same time period, it's kind of nice to skip your usual one
night and sample something else. But all of this is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real killer: January.
</P>
<P>
   You know what this January thing means, right? To make room for
those new shows, the networks will have to cut loose some old ones.
Unfortunately, old never seems to mean really bad shows such as
``Jesse'' or ``Two Guys and A Girl,'' but old in the sense of ``new
fall shows that people couldn't support because there were so many
other fine offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, just around the corner could be a rush of fresh sitcoms and
dramas that may catch our imaginations, prick our intellect and
give us soaring hope in television. If you lost ``Sports Night'' or
something else, would that be a fair trade? Could you give up on
``Action'' or maybe a ``Felicity'' to take on something new? What
if that new Levinson-Fontana cop show were really great - could you
drop ``Law &AMP; Order'' or ``The Practice''?
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even brought ``The Sopranos'' into the equation.
Lord help us.

DRUNKEN DRIVING ARRESTS DIP SHARPLY IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Close enforcement of tougher laws and a shift in
culture have led drunken driving arrests to drop dramatically,
falling by more than half in the past 13 years, according to
figures released by the Boston Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp decline, from 1,357 arrests in 1986 to 397 to date,
comes as Boston Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans says overall
traffic stops and citations by officers have reached an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge, which mirrors a national trend of fewer arrests and
drunken-driving-related deaths in the same time period, follows a
1985 law that made Massachusetts the first in the nation to ban
``happy hours'' in bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and others also attributed the falling rates to the slow,
less perceptible work of advocates who have transformed perceptions
around drinking and driving, bringing stiffer punishments and
strong cultural shame to behavior once more widely tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, before groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving
and others, the criminal justice system didn't really treat driving
under the influence the way it's being treated today,'' said Evans.
``Now there is a lot more public awareness, and a justice system
that does not tolerate repeat offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the spiraling numbers were encouraging, particularly
since his patrol officers are busier than ever. They have logged
141,414 traffic stops and citations so far this year, Evans said, a
record number for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we getting all the offenders out there? Of course not,''
Evans said. ``But the numbers being down is a positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the heels of a Mothers Against Drunk Driving ``Rating the
States'' report that gave Massachusetts a C- for its record on
combatting drunken driving, MADD officials and other advocates said
Monday the city and the state still have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the 1985 ban on happy hours and other significant
legislation, MADD Massachusetts executive director Barbara
Harrington said the laws still are not tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that more people should be arrested and more people
should be effectively prosecuted, and we are trying to make changes
so that will happen,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 192 people died statewide in alcohol-related
accidents, according to Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   According to FBI crime statistics, drunken driving arrests
nationwide jumped in the mid-1970s and continued to rise during the
1980s to about 1.9 million. Since then, the numbers have steadily
fallen, to about 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   But drunken driving still leads all categories in total traffic
arrests: About 10 percent are for impaired driving, according to
Ralph Hingson, professor at Boston University School of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me says it's good that the arrests are going down,
because it also reflects a decline in deaths,'' Hingson said. ``But
we still have a huge problem, in Boston, Massachusetts, and across
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, close to 40 percent of all traffic deaths are
alcohol-related, Hingson said.

RAIDERS FALL ON THEIR SWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Wait. Weren't we just here six days ago?
</P>
<P>
   You know, at that point where the Raiders' season couldn't sink
any lower, at that point where an excruciating, description-defying
loss to a hated AFC West rival took a crowbar to the kneecaps of
their season?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we were. Except this time, the only snowball is the
Raiders' runaway season, tearing downhill, careening out of
control. And out of the playoffs, most likely.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was ancient rival Kansas City providing the
breaking of hearts, the shredding of Raider souls. This time, on an
overcast Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum, it was the Chiefs who
somehow overcame a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit, who somehow
willed Raiders kicker Michael Husted to miss a 44-yard field goal
attempt with 2:56 left, who somehow then gained the requisite
yardage to set up their own kicker, Pete Stoyanovich, to make the
same 44-yard attempt with no time left on the clock for a 37-34 win
that has to rank among the Raiders' five most bitter losses since
their return to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Didn't we just say that last week, in Denver, after the
now-legendary snowball overtime loss at Mile High Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we did.
</P>
<P>
   That makes for a tough six-day stretch in Raiderland, a six-day
stretch in which the Raiders transformed from a talented, hopeful,
playoff contender on the rise into a team that can't finish, can't
get lucky and can't win.
</P>
<P>
   It gets so that even brilliant young talents like Raiders
cornerback Charles Woodson are faced with the ugly mug of truth.
Asked if he thought the 5-6 Raiders - who trail Buffalo (8-4) by
21/2 games for the third and final wild-card spot in the AFC, and
who trail the AFC West-leading Seattle Seahawks by three games with
five to play - still could think about the playoffs, Woodson didn't
bother with any false hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Woodson said. ``Not losing games like we're losing.
We've been in every game and we have found a way to lose. No team
going to the playoffs can do that. Now our season is dependent on
other teams losing. We have to win out and we haven't proven we can
win two or three in a row. At this point, it doesn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did any Raiders who struggled to explain this, their
18th loss in 20 tries to Kansas City in the 1990s. If the Monday
night loss at Denver was the punch to the stomach that doubled them
over, Sunday's loss to the Chiefs was the uppercut that sent them
reeling into oblivion from that doubled-over state. All over the
locker room, Raiders grappled with what had just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Jon Ritchie tried to describe the pain, but wound up
chuckling in disbelief. It was either that or start crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. ... I don't know how to describe this. ... it's
utter disappointment, utter disbelief,'' Ritchie said. ``I'm having
a hard time swallowing what went down out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So was coach Jon Gruden, whose postgame face looked like a
combination of a man who drank a pint of castor oil through a beer
bong and a guy who had a blast of sand blown into his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am again,'' Gruden said, as if he didn't know what else
to say. ``Obviously, that's a difficult loss. ... Obviously, our
playoff aspirations aren't as bright as they would be if we had
won.''
</P>
<P>
   All over the locker room, the Raiders grappled with the fact
that quarterback Rich Gannon, the ex-Chief who burned to beat his
old team, threw two interceptions in the third quarter, one that
led to a Stoyanovich field goal and another that was returned by
Cris Dishman 47 yards for a touchdown and a 20-13 Chiefs lead. They
grappled with the fact that Gannon then led a nifty 60-yard TD
drive to tie the game, capped by his 6-yard scramble.
</P>
<P>
   They especially grappled with what happened at 20-20: how Chiefs
quarterback Elvis Grbac threw an interception to Raiders linebacker
Greg Biekert, who returned it to the Raiders 3-yard line to set up
a Gannon-to-Ricky Dudley touchdown pass and a 27-20 lead; and how,
just four minutes later, Woodson made his first interception of the
year and returned it 15 easy yards for a score and a 34-20 lead as
the third quarter ended.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-20 lead when the fourth-quarter opened! How could the
Raiders blow that one?
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, eerily, knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is about the Raiders,'' Grbac crowed,
``but when we play them, no matter how many points we're down, we
believe we can come back to win. Fourteen points is nothing. We had
15 minutes left.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable, but true: Grbac hit tight end Tony Gonzalez on a
play-action that deked everyone and went for a 73-yard score when
Gonzalez ran away from a zone defense that bit on the run fake. It
was 34-27, Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the play of the game: With six and a half minutes left, a
waggle pass from Gannon to another ex-Chief, tight end Derrick
Walker, went for what looked like a nine-yard gain and a first down
as Walker was tackled by safety Jerome Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! There went Dishman, scooping up the ball and running,
untouched, into the end zone, for a Chiefs touchdown. You could
almost hear Raider Nation gasp: What? How could it have happened?
And then the instant replay forced into play by the Raiders, who
challenged the call, showed what happened: Walker fumbled the ball
just before hitting the ground and Dishman gobbled it up for the
game-tying score.
</P>
<P>
   For Gannon, who lost the game he so badly wanted against his old
teammates, there was only truth as stark as the sight of
Stoyanovich's field goal sailing through the south side goalposts:
``We've played 11 games and we've been in every one. Unfortunately
for us, we didn't get it done again. We have to live with
ourselves, we have to live with our 5-6 record, and we have to live
with the fact that we're not considered very good by league
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Again.

 &HT;    Prevention still the wisest path to good health
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As director of a leading national women's health office, Yvonne
Green encourages women to take more responsibility for their own
health by eating more fruits and veggies and fewer chips and fries,
being physically active and getting regular check-ups for heart
disease, cancer, and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But Green, 46, admits she was ``the average woman'' when it came
to incorporating healthy habits into her daily life as a younger
woman. ``I didn't think much about it in my 20s,'' she said. ``Then
in my 30s, I started thinking more about it. Then in my 40s, I
actually started doing more about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, she was appointed director of Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention Office of Women's Health after
working 15 years for CDC reproductive health programs. Green is a
certified nurse midwife by trade and a gardener by hobby. She spoke
recently about preparations for the Dec. 6 SciTrek invitation-only
presentation on African-American women's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: African-American women hear they are more at-risk for certain
diseases, but often hear different statistics and don't know what
to believe. What diseases do they most need to worry about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The leading cause of death for black women is the same as for
white women _ heart disease _ but African-American women are more
than 50 percent more likely to die than white women of heart
disease. Also, lung cancer is the leading cancer among black women
just as it is among white women, and breast cancer is the
second-leading cause of cancer death. In 1999, over 18,000
African-American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and
5,600 will die from it. Stroke is the third-leading cause of death
among African-American women and diabetes the fourth-leading cause.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can women do to keep themselves out of these statistics?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``There's a saying by an African-American woman, Fannie Lou
Hamer (a civil rights worker in Mississippi), now deceased, that
many know and I use when I talk to women's groups: `I'm sick and
tired of being sick and tired.' Finally, in the last year of the
1900s, women are taking more responsibility for their health ... We
could significantly reduce mortality and morbidity of major killers
with lifestyle changes to diet, exercise, nutrition, not smoking,
reducing stress as well as with early detection and screening for
diseases. Prevention is really the key. Many leading causes of
death are preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard about the high rate of death of black women during
pregnancy and childbirth. What are the differences between black
and white women when it comes to maternal mortality?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pregnancy complications are a big deal among African-American
women. They are three to four times more likely to die in
childbirth than white women. Little or no prenatal care can explain
some of it, but it doesn't fully explain the disproportionate risk
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do to keep healthy and in shape?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a big gardener. I garden sometimes for hours, digging
holes, moving logs, it's a workout and great for stress. And I try
to find as many walks that are raising money for health causes and
enter them, such as breast cancer walks, AIDS walks. I did one
recently for the brain injury foundation. I'm not one to walk
around a block 100 times so this a good way to inspire me. It
accomplishes three things: I get in a good walk, I'm financially
contributing to a worthy cause, and it's usually a walk in a
neighborhood where I haven't been so I see a different part of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   AT GREATER RISK
</P>
<P>
   African-American women have extra worries when it comes to heart
disease, stroke, cancer and childbirth. That's because they are
much more likely to die of these conditions than white women.
Social factors, such as lower income, less education and less
access to medical care, are some of the reasons for the disparity
but they don't explain them all. Some of the added risks of
African-American women when compared to white women:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Heart disease: 70 percent greater risk of death.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hypertension: Twice the risk.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diabetes: Twice the rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pregnancy, childbirth: Fourfold risk of dying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Breast cancer: 20 percent higher risk of death.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stroke: 70 percent higher risk of death.Sources: Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health,

 &HT;    Demand for alternative medicine knows no limits
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers' appetite for information about alternative medicine
seems to know no limits _ and publishers are eager to feed it. Some
recently published books on the subject:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dr. Duke's Essential Herbs'' by James A. Duke, Ph.D. (Rodale
Reach, Emmaus, Pa., $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The longtime chief of medicinal plant research at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Duke is one of the foremost American
experts in botanical medicine. In this follow-up to his
million-seller, ``The Green Pharmacy,'' the 70-something scientist
discusses the ``13 vital herbs'' that he most often recommends.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The People's Pharmacy Guide to Home and Herbal Remedies'' by
Joe Graedon and Teresa Graedon, Ph.D. (St. Martin's Press, New
York, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   The husband and wife pharmacologist-anthropologist team who
wrote one of the original consumer guides to prescription drugs
apply the same formula to ``grandmother medicine'': herbal formulas
and old-wives-tale remedies. It includes an alphabetical listing of
common herbs, appropriate doses and potential interactions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The American Pharmaceutical Association Practical Guide to
Natural Medicines'' by Andrea Peirce; introduction by Andrew T.
Weil, M.D. (William Morrow, New York, $35).
</P>
<P>
   An expensive, hefty (728 pages) and thorough encyclopedia of
plant and herbal remedies. It draws on other sources, such as the
British Herbal Compendium and the books of James Duke and Varro
Tyler, but delivers their information in accessible language under
headings such as ``Will it work for you?'' and ``Will it harm
you?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements and
Herbs by Nicola Reavley (M. Evans and Co., New York, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   A paperback behemoth at 792 pages, this thorough reference by an
Australian nutritionist goes beyond herbal remedies to explore
therapeutic uses of minerals and other supplements. It includes
careful cautions about interactions with other drugs and negative
effects on existing medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _M.A.J. McKenna
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Complete Guide to Herbal Medicines,'' by Charles W.
Fetrow, Pharm.D., and Juan R. Avila, Pharm.D. (Springhouse
Publishing, Springhouse, Pa. $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   A layperson's version of an earlier book by the same authors
called ``The Professional's Handbook of Complementary and
Alternative Medicines,'' this paperback has the virtue of being
written and compiled by pharmacologists. Thus close attention is
paid to the chemical constituents of herbs and their interactions
and contraindications. References after each chapter, to specific
articles in medical and pharmacological journals, suggest that the
contributors did their homework.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   You know why your doctor gave you the drug she just prescribed
for you. You know what's on the list of warnings that the
pharmacist presented. But reactions to drugs can differ by
individual. What can you actually expect when you start taking it?
</P>
<P>
   No one can guarantee how you'll react to a drug, but the
Internet Drug Index (www.rxlist.com/) can help. Among the features
of this long-standing site is RxBoard, a set of bulletin boards
where people trade descriptions of their experiences with the 20
drugs most frequently prescribed in the United States, as well as
some alternative medications. Among the entries: arguments over
whether Prozac causes weight gain, testimonials to the new
painkiller Celebrex and a report of fever and headache after taking
ginkgo biloba.
</P>
<P>
   The site was originally created as a public service by
pharmacist Neil Sandow. Recently it began being hosted by
HealthCentral, a medical-themed Internet portal that, like many
medical gateways these days, includes a link to an online pharmacy.
As with all sites on the Net, exercise caution and judgment.

<P>
   You know why your doctor gave you the drug she just prescribed
for you. You know what's on the list of warnings that the
pharmacist presented. But reactions to drugs can differ by
individual. What can you actually expect when you start taking it?

<P>
   No one can guarantee how you'll react to a drug, but the
Internet Drug Index (www.rxlist.com/) can help. Among the features
of this long-standing site is RxBoard, a set of bulletin boards
where people trade descriptions of their experiences with the 20
drugs most frequently prescribed in the United States, as well as
some alternative medications. Among the entries: arguments over
whether Prozac causes weight gain, testimonials to the new
painkiller Celebrex and a report of fever and headache after taking
ginkgo biloba.

BRADLEY HOPES TO GAIN REAGAN MANDATE FOR CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Bradley Monday sketched a portrait of the kind of
leader he hopes to be _ and the kind of candidate he hopes he never
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of leader to emulate? Ronald Reagan, for his potent
appeal to American optimism and his skill in building a mandate for
the big changes he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator parts ways with Reagan on most
issues of substance _ though he voted for Reagan's 1981 spending
cuts _ but he covets a popular mandate for his own big policy ideas
and says he hopes to win one by speaking to the idealistic
instincts of American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You explain these things in dangerous detail in the middle of
the campaign,'' said Bradley, during a meeting with editors and
reporters at The Boston Globe. ``You lay it out specifically. If
you win by a sizeable margin, the people have given you a mandate
to do big things and then the opposition will not be as strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the kind of candidate he hopes never to become? That
would be Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, who has been
sharply critical of Bradley's proposal to reform the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has mostly refused to return the darts, but he also said
Monday he won't be pummeled indefinitely without a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep things on a positive level,'' he said, ``but
you don't keep taking elbows. . .I'm not about to leave myself
defenseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued his assault Monday, saying that Bradley's array
of policy initiatives would squander the federal surplus, driving
up interest rates and harm the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add up the proposals Senator Bradley has made, he
spends more than the surplus,'' Gore said in an interview. ``That's
why his plan would drive up short-term interest rates from car
loans to mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scoffed at Gore's math, and his methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you turn around there's another attack and
personally I think people are fed up with these attacks,'' Bradley
said. ``I suppose one of the things you might want to ask him is
what is the total amount he's committed to spend, because we're
keeping a running tally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refused to divulge any further details or offer up any
numbers. He also said Gore's analysis of his own proposals is
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to tell you what the surplus is going to be five
years from now or 10 years from now?'' he said. ``I just reject the
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gore is making up facts to support his charges, Bradley
said, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ranged over many topics during the 75-minute session at
the Globe, from his broad policy hopes, at home and abroad, to his
style of leadership to the nitty-gritty of presidential politics
and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   On his leadership style, Bradley said he learned his core
lessons on the basketball court, during his days with the New York
Knicks, and in Congress. In both settings, he said, he wasn't an
out-front ``leader'' but he said he learned how to make the system
work to achieve his goals, from championships to tax reform
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On politics, he was confident, saying his campaign is meeting
its goals, in terms of voter support and fundraising, and that he
feels certain he can win the nomination over Gore even if he
doesn't win either of the upcoming contests in Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which holds the first caucuses on Jan. 24, and New
Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1,
have traditionally weeded out candidates who do not win or do well
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that either are a must win, but I do think that
it is important to do well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he's got his eye on the primaries that come March 7
-- which he called ``take-off time'' -- as the decisive phase of
the campaign. Those primaries include California, New York,
Missouri, Ohio and Massachusetts, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been premised and the resources have been
amassed to go through the spring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he will win significant support among the
so-called ``super-delegates'' _ party leaders and office-holders
whose votes could tip the balance at the Democratic National
Convention. Gore currently enjoys significant support among the
super-delegates, but Bradley said that pattern won't hold after he
starts beating the vice president in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On policy, Bradley was most pointed in his desire to use the
power of the presidency to promote improved race relations. He said
the most dismaying thing he has encountered on the campaign trail
is the persistence of a segment of voters ``who don't accept
differences of race and gender and sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Bradley said he would devote himself to setting the
tone for the country on issues of race by appointing a diverse
cabinet and hiring people of different backgrounds throughout the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, Bradley complimented President Clinton for having
done a good job of bringing people of different racial and ethnic
backgrounds into the federal government. And he cited Ann Richards,
the former governor of Texas, as an example he would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ann Richards was Governor of Texas, she had a position
she wanted filled by an African American and her staff came in and
said `No, we can't find anybody to do that who's African American,'
'' Bradley recounted. ``And she said, `Well, this will stay open
until you do.' Three weeks later, they had several candidates for
the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that a president should not run away from
affirmative action, and should try to help create a multi-racial
coalition to fight injustice, such as child poverty. He also said a
president has a duty to talk about the difficult subjects that
spring from race, including the fact the whites often get unfair
advantages because of their race _ a phenomenon which Bradley said
is better described as ``white skin privilege'' than racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president has a unique role to challenege people
to honor their better selves and sometimes that means simply being
very direct with them,'' he said. ``Sometimes that means talking
about things that are unpleasant to some people.''
</P>
<P>
   come to terms with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he believes that Americans want racial unity
because of the reactions he has gotten from talking to white
audiences. He said his candidacy could live or die on whether he is
reading Americans right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm wrong, I'm toast,'' he said. ``If I'm right, we can do
something about it.''

AMERICANS NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FROM CYNICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By Stephanie Salter   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Irony has only emergency use. Carried over time, it's the
voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy their cage.'' - poet
Lewis Hyde
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Paul Loeb was researching his latest book,
``Soul of a Citizen,'' he came upon an ad for Microsoft's online
magazine that seemed to epitomize what people of conscience are up
against these days.
</P>
<P>
   Touting Slate as a forum for ``what everyone is talking about,''
the ad promised that the magazine would deliver information ``with
a certain insouciant smirk that thinking people find compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   What, asks Loeb, is so attractive about a smirk - insouciant,
certain or otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   ``People smirk when they're full of themselves, smiling
arrogantly...'' he writes. ``All of us, the ad suggests, should
approach life with such hip detachment... We simply need to
acknowledge that the world is inherently corrupt, bought and paid
for, and that all talk of changing is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``culture of contempt,'' says Loeb, has been embraced by
much of the news, ad and entertainment media; it contributes
mightily to despair and a social paralysis that threaten our moral
core.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did so many of us become convinced that we can do nothing
to affect our common future?'' he asks. ``And how have some other
Americans managed to remove the cataracts from their vision and
work powerfully for change?''
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``Living with conviction in a cynical time,'' Loeb's
book is like a 362-page pep rally for the soul. It should be
mandatory reading for anyone over the age of 12 - especially every
woman or man who has traded ``I give a damn'' for ``I give up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul of a Citizen'' is packed with wise thoughts from an
eclectic array of philosophers and social activists - Rainer Maria
Rilke to Marian Wright Edelman. It also offers real-life examples
of ordinary people who made extraordinary things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Most are like Virginia Ramirez, a San Antonio wife and mother of
five, who went from making cookies and punch for her kids' PTA
meetings to testifying before the U.S. Senate about an innovative
job-training program she and other neighborhood activists created.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like civil rights activist Rosa Parks, are well known
now. But they weren't when they took their first step (and the
first thousandth) on the path of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What always gets lost in the telling of the Rosa Parks story -
one day she refused to give up her seat to a white person and move
to the back of the bus - is all the commitment and hard work she
put in before that day,'' said Loeb by phone from his Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her decision didn't come out of nowhere. She'd spent 12 years
before that, helping to lead her local NAACP and learning about
labor and civil rights activism. To ignore that is to demean her
accomplishments and those of the people who came before her in the
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   An associated scholar at Seattle's Center for Ethical
Leadership, Loeb is the author of three previous books, a
commentator for print and electronic news media and a lecturer at
more than 200 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to candy-coat things in this book. Social
activism is frustrating and not always easy,'' he said. ``But I
honestly believe it's a richer way to live, even if it's hard.
People say, 'I just don't have time,' but we spend plenty of time
and work hard for lots of trivial, unsatisfying things. Isn't it
better to work for something that's worthwhile? To be glad we
aspire to make things better instead of being ashamed that we
try?''
</P>
<P>
   In some 30 years of researching citizen responsibility, Loeb
says he has observed countless people ``getting stuck'' in social
and moral circumstances they despise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stay trapped, but not because they don't care,'' he said.
``It's because they believe that nothing they do will help. The
landscape they see is pretty bleak; the voices of doubt and 'why
bother?' are powerful. So they retreat. But by retreating we don't
escape from the world's problems so much as submit to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one activist in his book puts it: ``There's a process of
dying that happens when you shut yourself off to the inequalities
and injustices in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most effective ways to break out of the torpor is to
follow the advice of a 101-year-old activist friend of Loeb's named
Hazel Wolf: ``Get out of yourself and focus on what needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   As Loeb writes in ``Soul of a Citizen'':
</P>
<P>
   ``We liberate ourselves from cynicism by replacing the
all-knowing but soul-destroying smirk with compassionate curiosity
about our fellow human beings. When we do so, we find ample reason
for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   And when we hope, we find the time and energy to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All around us, every day, are people who do act,'' said Loeb.
``They had to overcome the doubts and recognize, 'If not me, then
who?' And, at some point they all had to give themselves permission
to not know everything. We don't have to have all the answers. We
just have to get out there and engage with our fellow human beings.
It's a great antidote to despair.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After two months of steady advances into Chechnya's
heartland, the Russian military said on Monday that it is beginning
to encounter serious resistance from Islamic militants, and that
the fighting is likely to intensify in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance is growing day by day,'' Col. Gen. Georgy
Shpak, the commander of Russia's airborne troops, said in an
interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After retreating from the Russian onslaught, Russian officials
said, Islamic fighters are fortifying their positions in the
Chechen capital of Grozny and the towns of Urus-Martan, Shali and
Argun.
</P>
<P>
   And Salman Raduyev, the warlord who led a daring hostage-taking
raid into Russia during the last Chechen war, is commanding a band
of militants in Novogroznensky, a settlement in eastern Chechnya,
according to Russian military officials.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the battles that may lie ahead came on Monday
when the Russian government belatedly acknowledged a firefight on
Nov. 17 that decimated a Russian reconnaissance patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A macabre video of the corpse-laden battlefield was supplied by
Islamic militants to Russian television networks, which broadcast
much of it during their prime-time news programs on Monday night.
And Russia's generals seemed to be trying to prepare the nation for
some tough clashes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize that there will be no peace negotiations, and
that we are determined to complete this operation,'' Shpak said of
the militants. ``So they are trying to generate huge losses on our
side to get us to change our mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phases of the offensive have gone very well from the
Russian military's point of view. After a ferocious air
bombardment, Russian troops began by seizing the plains north of
the Terek River, good terrain for armored vehicles and a region
with a largely pro-Russia population.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Russian forces were on the southern bank of the river
as well. Moving eastward from Ingushetia and westward from
Dagestan, Russian forces also advanced into Chechnya's lowlands,
making their way toward Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   There have been vocal protests from Western governments about
the risk to civilians. But the Russian military's casualties have
been low _ at least compared with the last war. As of Friday, 305
Russian soldiers and Interior Ministry troops were reported by the
government to have been killed since the Islamic rebels ignited the
war in August by invading neighboring Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers say there are several reasons for their gains.
Instead of charging into Chechnya's cities and engaging in
casualty-inducing urban warfare, they have laid siege to the cities
and demanded that local elders evict the rebels and let in the
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of being pummeled into submission by Russian bombs and
artillery, local leaders in Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest
city, and the town of Achkhoi-Marten, complied.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up morale among the troops, the Russian government has
promised to pay its soldiers in Chechnya a hefty bonus that could
bring their monthly pay to as high as $1,000. Income of that level
would amount to a substantial sum in Russia's depressed economy.
The military has also sought to use volunteers and experienced
soldiers, though with some 100,000 soldiers in the field it has
also been relying on relatively green conscripts with as little as
six months military service.
</P>
<P>
   But the militants have not given up the fight. Russian generals
estimate that the rebel force numbers some 15,000 and say there are
an equal number of Chechen sympathizers also fighting. And the
winter weather will make it harder for Russian air power to target
its enemy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Their resistance is on the rise,'' Shpak said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, much of the fighting is concentrated around Grozny,
which Russian forces are bombarding with aircraft and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai P. Koshman, the Russian government's representative to
Chechnya, said on Monday that the militants are hoping to lure
Russian soldiers into the city so that they could turn it into a
killing field, complete with minefields and vats of burning oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to turn it into the Last Day of Pompeii for our
assault troops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military seems determined to keep its distance for
now and rely on its long-range firepower. Some 45,000 to 50,000
civilians, however, remain in Grozny, according to Koshman and
their plight is worsening by the day.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has sought to arrange an escape route to
the north, but many of the civilians are sick, infirm and wounded.
And Koshman charged that the rebels were preventing some civilians
from leaving so that they could use them as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   As Moscow tried to blame the rebels for the civilians'
predicament, it rebuffed an request by the chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to visit
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians promised at the summit meeting in Istanbul this
month that they would allow a visit to the region by the Norwegian
foreign minister, Kurt Vollebaek, who is chairman of the OSCE. But
after meeting with Russia's foreign minister in Moscow on Monday,
Vollebaek said no visit has been arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be honest if I said I was wholly satisfied or that
I had achieved the results I came for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another battleground lies to the south and east of Grozny. And
the newly disclosed firefight in southeastern Chechnya gives a
sense of some of the resistance the Russians may face _ especially
if they fulfill their vow to chase the rebels into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The episode occurred on Nov. 17 when a 14-man patrol left
Botlikh in Dagestan and crossed into Chechnya. After spying a
convoy of rebel trucks near the town of Kharachoi, the patrol
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol reported the fighting, but its radio went dead after
an hour of shooting. Shpak's men dispatched reinforcements, but the
ground troops could not make it through the heavy snow and Russian
helicopters turned away after being fired at.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic fighters were more successful. More than a 100 of
their reinforcements arrived in Kamaz trucks, according to Shpak.
</P>
<P>
   Russians officials said that 12 of the patrol were killed and
two captured.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians claim that more than 50 rebels were killed in the
Kharachoi clash, but it is difficult to confirm that since the
fighters took their dead with them. To get its dead back, the
Russian military is now negotiating to exchange bodies with the
militants, on the basis of two Chechens for one Russian.

SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW MASS. LAW BANNING TRADE WITH MYANMAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a move that could have far-reaching implications for
states that seek to punish human rights abuses abroad, the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed Monday to review the Massachusetts law that
restricts state purchases from companies doing business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to rule on the constitutionality of the
1996 law comes a year after U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro
in Boston struck down the statute on the grounds it interfered with
the federal government's sole authority over foreign policy. An
appeals court upheld Tauro's decision last June.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the efforts by states and local governments to take
stands on controversial international human rights issues with
sanctions against companies that do business with repressive
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said state Representative Byron Rushing,
the Democrat from the South End, who guided the bill through the
Legislature. He noted the very strong odds that petitioners
normally face in asking the Supreme Court to review a case.
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed in response to widespread human rights
violations by the military regime in Myanmar -- formerly known as
Burma. In effect, it prohibited the state from buying goods and
services from companies that conduct business with Myanmar, unless
the firm submitted a bid 10 percent lower than all other bids.
</P>
<P>
   The law immediately set off a storm of protest from America's
trading partners, including Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, noting that the court review comes at a time of
mounting tensions in Myanmar, said the court is obviously intrigued
by the constitutional issues. Over 30 other jurisdictions have
adopted similar so-called restrictive purchasing laws, most of them
targeting Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court decides will make clear whether
American citizens who are concerned with human rights violation
will have an ally with local governments,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, whose office will prepare the
appeal, said he expects a decision by June and feels Massachusetts
has a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature spoke very clearly, saying it doesn't want the
state to be doing business with his regime,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by the National Foreign Trade Council, a group
that represents U.S. businesses that operate overseas, said they
welcome a Supreme Court ruling because it will clarify what has
become a confusing legal landscape.
</P>

important trading relations and we believe a Supreme Court ruling
is the best way to get an authoritative national decision,''

SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW MASS. LAW BANNING TRADE WITH MYANMAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ In a move that could have far-reaching implications for
states that seek to punish human rights abuses abroad, the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed Monday to review the Massachusetts law that
restricts state purchases from companies doing business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to rule on the constitutionality of the
1996 law comes a year after U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro
in Boston struck down the statute on the grounds it interfered with
the federal government's sole authority over foreign policy. An
appeals court upheld Tauro's decision last June.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the efforts by states and local governments to take
stands on controversial international human rights issues with
sanctions against companies that do business with repressive
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said state Representative Byron Rushing,
the Democrat from the South End, who guided the bill through the
Legislature. He noted the very strong odds that petitioners
normally face in asking the Supreme Court to review a case.
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed in response to widespread human rights
violations by the military regime in Myanmar -- formerly known as
Burma. In effect, it prohibited the state from buying goods and
services from companies that conduct business with Myanmar, unless
the firm submitted a bid 10 percent lower than all other bids.
</P>
<P>
   The law immediately set off a storm of protest from America's
trading partners, including Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, noting that the court review comes at a time of
mounting tensions in Myanmar, said the court is obviously intrigued
by the constitutional issues. Over 30 other jurisdictions have
adopted similar so-called restrictive purchasing laws, most of them
targeting Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court decides will make clear whether
American citizens who are concerned with human rights violation
will have an ally with local governments,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, whose office will prepare the
appeal, said he expects a decision by June and feels Massachusetts
has a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature spoke very clearly, saying it doesn't want the
state to be doing business with his regime,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by the National Foreign Trade Council, a group
that represents U.S. businesses that operate overseas, said they
welcome a Supreme Court ruling because it will clarify what has
become a confusing legal landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Kittredge, the president of the business council, said 30
of his members do some business with Myanmar and have landed on
Massachusetts' restrictive purchasing list as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a longstanding issue that affects many of our

Kittredge said.
</P>

ALAIN PEYREFITTE, 74, FRENCH CONSERVATIVE WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alain Peyrefitte, a French journalist, best-selling author,
former cabinet minister and confidant of Gen. Charles de Gaulle,
died Nov. 27 in Paris. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the staff of Le Figaro, the
conservative daily paper where he was editorial director.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the French Academy since 1977, Peyrefitte was close
to three French presidents: de Gaulle, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and
Georges Pompidou. He served for many years in the national assembly
and later, the senate.
</P>
<P>
   As minister of information from 1962 to 1966, he alienated parts
of the public by strictly enforcing de Gaulle's wish to keep voices
critical of the government off the air waves. ``Press freedom
cannot take precedence over truth or the general interest,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was minister of education during the violent student
demonstrations in 1968. His police beat students at the Sorbonne,
even some who were not demonstrating.
</P>
<P>
   A car bomb blew apart his car in 1986, killing the driver, who
was to take him to Provins, the town east of Paris of which he
became mayor in 1965. A shadowy extreme-left terror group was
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the symbol of the simple idea that there is no liberty
without order in a society,'' he said at the time. He had been a
law-and-order justice minister from 1977 to 1981 and sponsored
legislation to strengthen police powers.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Peyrefitte was born in Najac, in the Aveyron department,
and graduated from the Sorbonne and the elite Ecole Normale
Superieure and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. He joined the
Foreign Ministry in 1947; his first posting was as an embassy
secretary in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   He held other diplomatic positions before being elected to
parliament for the first time in 1958. He received his initial
cabinet appointment in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   His writings included French and Chinese histories, and ``The
Adventure of the 20th Century,'' which he illustrated and updated
regularly with newspaper clippings and photographs. He became
chairman of Le Figaro's editorial board in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Peyrefitte was married to Monique Luton in 1948, and they had
five children.

NLRB RULES INTERNS AT PRIVATE HOSPITALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO JOIN
UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board ruled on Monday that interns
and residents at privately owned hospitals have the right to form
unions under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders immediately applauded the board's decision, saying
it could lead to improved conditions for hospital interns and
residents. They said they would seek to unionize many of the
nation's nearly 100,000 interns and residents, who often complain
about notoriously long work weeks. Union officials predicted that
interns and residents at many of the nation's 400 teaching
hospitals would use the ruling to push for shorter hours and
lighter workloads.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital officials attacked the decision, which involved the
Boston Medical Center, saying that it would fuel tensions at
hospitals and that collective bargaining would interfere with the
educational mission of teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In its 3-2 decision, the labor relations board reversed a 1976
ruling that interns and residents at private hospitals were
students, rather than employees, and thus did not have a right to
unionize and bargain collectively. That ruling did not apply to
interns and residents at public hospitals, who in many states have
the right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   To defend its conclusion that interns and residents are
employees, the labor board noted that they work long hours, handle
many medical decisions themselves and receive salaries and fringe
benefits, including vacations and workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That house staff may also be students does not thereby change
the evidence of their `employee' status,'' the board's three-member
majority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The two dissenters argued that the interns and residents were
more students than they were employees.
</P>
<P>
   The case pitted the AFL-CIO, the American Medical Association
and the American Medical Students Association, which all filed
briefs on behalf of the interns, against the Association of
American Medical Colleges, the American Hospital Association and
the American Council on Education, which filed a brief on behalf of
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical
Colleges, which represents 125 medical schools and 400 teaching
hospitals, said the decision would hurt teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are periods of medical training,'' Cohen said. ``For
these educational programs to fulfill their social obligation and
to prepare students optimally for their future practice, it's
critical that the educational aspects of these programs be the
primary issues. The notion of collective bargaining and the threat
of strikes or binding arbitration on issues that are fundamentally
educational is an abhorrent idea that we believe will potentially
violate the trust that must exist between learner and teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and union officials estimate that more than 80 percent
of the nation's 100,000 interns and residents work at private
hospitals. About 10,000 interns and residents are already
unionized, but almost all of them work at public hospitals. Close
to 1,000 residents at private hospitals are unionized because their
hospitals voluntarily agreed to bargain with them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ladi Haroona, president of the Committee of Interns and
Residents, a New York-based group that represents nearly all of the
nation's unionized residents, said, ``This decision gives us the
power to negotiate better conditions for the nation's residents and
to advocate better for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a time when the American Medical Association
and many unions are stepping up efforts to persuade tens of
thousands of salaried physicians around the nation to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stems from a case involving a residents' union at
Boston City Hospital, a public hospital that merged in 1996 into
the Boston University Medical Center Hospital. The combined
hospital, which serves as the main teaching facility for the Boston
University School of Medicine, is private, but it voluntarily
recognizes the union of residents and interns that has existed at
Boston City Hospital since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   That union, part of the Committee of Interns and Residents, was
worried that there might be a subsequent merger and that the
resulting hospital might refuse to recognize or negotiate with the
union. Thus, the union asked the National Labor Relations Board to
find that the workers had a federally protected right to unionize
and bargain collectively, a right that would require a hospital to
negotiate with a union if a majority of the employees voted to
unionize.

PROTESTERS DOMINATE ON EVE OF WORLD TRADE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- So far, the protesters have unfurled banners from
rooftops and taken over an abandoned building. They have marched
through the downtown area, gray-haired grandmothers alongside
college students with pierced eyebrows, scientists in suits beside
demonstrators dressed as sea turtles. Together they have built
giant puppets and packed classes in non-violent protest tactics.
They've braced themselves for arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Representing scores of countries and hundreds of organizations,
they have descended on Seattle by the thousands to oppose the World
Trade Organization, the international body that they accuse of
favoring trade expansion over all else. With its powers to decide
issues affecting the globe, the Geneva-based WTO has spurred union,
environmental and human rights activists to band together in one of
the largest protest efforts in recent history -- and the first ever
for many of the younger demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in protesting the Vietnam War and this is way
bigger because it affects the entire world,'' said Dennis Jennings,
46, an Alameda, Calif., firefighter who paid his own way to Seattle
to join the protest. ``The decisions they make affect every aspect
of our lives. It's a way of controlling us, our food supply, you
name it, through transnational corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest round of talks, which open Tuesday, are not
expected to end in anything more than an agreement for the 135
member nations to keep talking, past rulings have convinced
activists from around the world that the WTO is indifferent to
their concerns. And those rulings, they complain, are made by
unelected ministers who answer to no one but themselves. The entire
process, they say, is not only dangerous but undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically like a New World Order, and that scares
me,'' said Michael McKinnon, 20, a first-time protester who
delivers pizza for a living in Eugene, Ore. ``It's not thinking
about human beings or the environment. It's all about how
corporations can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembled Groups range from the unknown to the securely
established _ the Raging Grannies and the Sierra Club, respectively
_ and from the radical left to conservatives like Patrick Buchanan,
who also reviles the WTO. They see the ministerial meeting as a way
to get word out about an organization that many people are unaware
of and relatively few can define. To that end, Seattle has been
turned into a massive stage for street theater intended to
counterbalance the panel discussions, and concerts also taking
place around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, a coalition of groups that included the Humane
Society sent more than 2,000 marchers into downtown, many of them
banging drums, all of them chanting anti-WTO slogans. A block over,
a smaller group led by demonstrators from Korea held a march of its
own, this one featuring a building-sized Satan puppet to represent
the trade group. After holding a mock trial, a group calling itself
the Global People's Tribunal issued a citizens arrest warrant for
the trade ministers from the seven leading industrialized countries
and marched over to the convention center to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad message we're trying to send is: review and
repair,'' said Mary Botarri, an official with the non-profit
organization Public Citizen, based in Washington, D.C. ``Before we
do any launching of new talks, we need to take a hard look at the
WTO's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrea Durbin, an official with Friends of the Earth,
``We're not at all opposed to the idea of the WTO. Our concern is
that the trade rules right now are so strongly biased against the
environment. The rules themselves flatly need to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, member nations have taken 167 trade disputes to the WTO
since it was created in 1995 as a formal judicial body, replacing
the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. GATT, as its
predecessor was known, had heard 300 disputes in its entire 47-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with tariffs mostly cut, the WTO has been grappling with
more complicated issues, such as whether a nation can set tough
food-safety, child-labor or environmental laws that might bar
imports from a nation with lower standards. The debate is not
abstract. The United States has already been forced to defend its
laws before the WTO, and sometimes it has lost.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases that galvanized environmental and animal
activists, in 1991, Mexico won a ruling from the WTO's predecessor
challenging a US ban on tuna imports from producers who killed too
many dolphins. Then three years ago, the WTO ruled against a US law
that required gasoline to meet cleanliness standards. At the same
time, US farmers complain that other nations use health concerns to
bar or limit US imports of hormone-fed beef and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   On a more local level, Robert Stumberg, a Georgetown University
law professor, said the WTO could trample empowerment zones,
``buy-American'' programs and other laws that favor the United
States over others.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You should care because the Seattle negotiations
could change the rules of democracy, and you would see the
difference in terms of the capacity of your state or local
government to pass laws that affect how your tax dollars are spent
on purchasing, or how your state can pass laws to promote economic
development, or your state's authority to protect the environment
or manage it's own resources.''
</P>
<P>
   To show his support for the WTO, President Clinton is expected
to be in town. A rumor that may be little more than wishful
thinking has it that Fidel Castro will arrive later in the week to
voice his opposition. With the help of a Bay Area group called the
Ruckus Society, which held two camps specifically to train
protesters for the WTO meeting, the activists say they are ready
for anything, including arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Leone Reinbold, a 22-year-old spokeswoman for protest umbrella
group Direct Action Network, said police should expect low-tech
blockades (people) and lock downs (people chaining themselves to
eachother or objects). The goal, she said, is to shut down the WTO
-- and the hundreds of mostly young people sitting on the floor of
the network's headquarters, eating macrobiotic food and learning
how to resist arrest peacefully, sounded prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole effort just shows that things can be run by the
community and now how they are run now; this all took place from
the bottom up,'' said Melanie Grubman, 20, who flew in from
Connecticut, where she attends Wesleyan University and is active in
grassroots organizing. ``I couldn't miss everything that's
happening. This is right on stuff and it could change our future.''

 &HT;    NFL NOTEBOOK: Cowher names Tomczak as QB for next game
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With five games left this season and his team fading from the
playoff race, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher is facing
increasing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (5-6) has lost six of its past seven games at home
and is three victories behind Buffalo in the AFC wild-card race.
After losing to the expansion Cleveland Browns in Three Rivers
Stadium earlier this season, the Steelers lost to the lowly Bengals
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this: I think we have more talent than
Cleveland and Cincinnati,'' said Tom Donahoe, the team's director
of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher benched struggling quarterback Kordell Stewart in the
second quarter of last weekend's game, replacing him with
journeyman Mike Tomczak. Tomczak, who becomes a free agent next
year, completed 19 of 35 attempts for 264 yards, almost rallying
the Steelers from a 21-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher said Tomczak will start Thursday's game at Jacksonville.
Stewart will return to his ``Slash'' role of wide receiver and
part-time quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak might be Pittsburgh's quarterback now, but Stewart's
days under center probably aren't over. He was given a $27 million
contract extension in the offseason, including an $8 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this from a team standpoint,'' Cowher said.
``That's the most important thing to look at. I'm not getting
involved with how much a guy makes or what a guy doesn't make. When
you start getting involved with that stuff, it's not coaching. It's
managing. I want to coach players.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher also is denying a published report in the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, which detailed three media reports that had him
looking to
</P>
<P>
   leave the Steelers. The reports said Cowher was considering a
job as a television analyst with Monday Night Football, or coaching
the new Houston franchise, which will begin play in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher has three years left on his contract with the Steelers at
$2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   King's opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer will be sidelined 4-6 weeks
with a broken right collarbone. Backup Eric Zeier, the former
Georgia star, still hasn't recovered from a rib injury, so rookie
Shaun King will start against Minnesota on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer, who played well in four games after being benched a
month ago, was hurt when he was sacked by Phillip Daniels in the
third quarter of a 16-3 victory over the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   King, the team's second-round pick from Tulane, completed three
of seven passes for 32 yards, including his first touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   With only five games remaining, Dilfer could miss the rest of
this season. If King or Zeier plays well, the team might not extend
Dilfer's contract after this season. The Bucs also must decide
whether to bring Dilfer back if they're still in the playoff
race.Dishing it out
</P>
<P>
   After Raiders receiver Tim Brown beat Kansas City cornerback
Cris Dishman on a 31-yard pass Sunday, Chiefs coach Gunther
Cunningham told his assistants he was going to bench Dishman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `Do we go with (backup Eric) Warfield right now?'''
Cunningham said. ``I asked (secondary coach) Ron Zook, `Do you
think Dishman's going to get it done?' and he said, `Absolutely.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman responded with the two biggest defensive plays of the
Chiefs' 37-34 victory over the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   He intercepted Rich Gannon's pass in the third quarter and
returned it 47 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 20-13
lead. In the fourth quarter, Dishman recovered Derrick Walker's
fumble and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown to tie the score
34-34.
</P>
<P>
   A second chance
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough weekend for Washington's Brett Conway, the former
all-state kicker from Parkview High.
</P>
<P>
   Conway missed a 28-yard field goal on the final play of
regulation, forcing the Redskins into overtime against the
Philadelphia Eagles. But Washington won the coin toss and drove to
his 27-yard field goal for a 20-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a kick I'm going to make 999 times out of 1,000,''
Conway said. ``I can't explain how I missed it. If I hadn't had
that week last week, we'd be laughing about that 28-yarder. Now,
I'm worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who also missed a 43-yarder against the Eagles, is 17 of
25 this season. He missed three of six attempts against the New
York Giants the previous game. Five of his eight misses have been
from 50 yards or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Conway was booed by the home crowd when he walked out to kick
the game-winner against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of them are drunk and don't know what they're talking
about anyway,'' he said. ```And to add to that, if I had been part
of that crowd, I would have booed, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for Bears' mark
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering 23 points for the second consecutive week hurt the
Jaguars' chances of breaking the NFL record for fewest points
allowed in a season. Having given up 125 points in 11 games, an
11.36 average, the Jaguars still are ahead of the pace of the 1985
Chicago Bears record of 187 points in a season. The Bears held
opponents to an average of 11.7 points a game.

JUSTICES REJECT DOCTORAL CANDIDATE'S CLAIM OF BIAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: optional ending included) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday dealt a blow to a white
Texas doctoral candidate who claimed the University of Texas at
Austin rejected him for admission because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in an unsigned opinion, rejected the bulk of
Francois Lesage's argument that the school violated his
constitutional and federal statutory rights by maintaining an
admissions policy that favored minority applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The high court returned to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
only Lesage's claim that the university continues to operate a
discriminatory admissions process, an argument the state rejects on
behalf of its school.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the justices overturned a 5th Circuit decision
in favor of Lesage's claim that he was a victim of illegal reverse
discrimination. A federal district court had earlier dismissed
Lesage's lawsuit, saying he was rejected because he was an inferior
candidate, not because he is white.
</P>
<P>
   Texas urged the high court to reverse the 5th Circuit, saying
the university would have rejected Lesage's application even
without a race-conscious admissions policy, which the school has
since abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, agreeing with Texas, declined to address Lesage's
claim that his rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, where a plaintiff challenges a governmental
decision as being based on an impermissible criterion (such as
race) and it is undisputed that the government would have made the
same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting
relief'' under federal law, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court noted that the school accepted only about 20 of
the 223 candidates who applied to its doctorate counseling
psychology program for the 1996-97 academic year. At least 80
applicants had higher undergraduate grade-point averages than
Lesage's, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Lesage's case is reminiscent of the lawsuit Cheryl Hopwood
brought in 1992 against the University of Texas law school,
alleging that the institution rejected her because she is white.
The 5th Circuit agreed with Hopwood, saying the university's policy
of favoring minority candidates violated the constitutional right
to equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, without comment, let that decision stand in
1996. In response to the court action, Texas universities stopped
consideration of race as a factor in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other action Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The justices, without comment, cleared the way for two
Victoria High School teachers to sue the Victoria Independent
School District board in Texas for allegedly violating their First
Amendment right to free speech. Teachers Dwight Harris and Gene
Martin were reprimanded and transferred to other schools after
publicly calling for the principal to be replaced and warning that
faculty members would revolt if action wasn't taken.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed the teachers' lawsuit, saying they
were employees and not entitled to criticize their boss. But the
5th Circuit reversed, saying Harris and Martin's statements were
constitutionally protected comments on a ``matter of public
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Delving into the issue of hate crimes, the high court agreed
to decide whether judges, rather than juries, can decide whether an
attack was motivated by prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Apprendi Jr., who is white, pleaded guilty to a firearm
violation and bomb possession in connection with shots fired into
the home of a black family in Vineland, N.J., in 1994. The crimes
carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, acting at prosecutors' request, sentenced
Apprendi to the enhanced 12-year prison sentence available under
the state's hate-crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, who is appealing his sentence, argues before the high
court that a jury, not a judge, must decide whether a crime was
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The justices agreed to decide whether states and local
governments can restrict their purchases from companies that do
business in foreign countries with poor human-rights records. The
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Massachusetts law
that limited foreign purchases, ruling that it interfered with the
federal government's authority to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state law, Massachusetts could not buy products from
companies doing business with Myanmar _ formerly called Burma _
unless the company's bid was 10 percent lower than anyone else's.

REVOLUTION TURN TO CLAVIJO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution have yet to establish a
viable on-field identity after four Major League Soccer seasons.
But the naming of head coach Fernando Clavijo Monday gives an
indication of the team's intended direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Day 1 of the league, we have made a commitment to
entertaining and attacking soccer,'' said Sunil Gulati, managing
director of Kraft Soccer Properties. ``We will make every effort to
make this team successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo and Gulati will have some difficult decisions to make
before training camp begins in January. They want to build the team
through the middle _ goalkeeper, central defense, central midfield,
and striker. But they appear to be counting on only two current
Revolution players in those positions _ Leonel Alvarez and Dan
Calichman.
</P>
<P>
   So significant changes should be expected, starting with the
addition of a proven midfield choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player I always appreciated an up-front and honest
coach,'' Clavijo said. ``I don't mean someone who is always nice,
but who speaks to my face without bending the truth. Players might
not accept it right away but in the end they realize it is better
this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work ahead of us. We have to look to the long
term and where we want to go with long-range goals. But it is
crucial we start to win right away, and this team is not too far
away from being able to do that. We need players who are committed,
who are willing to sacrifice for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Three previous Revolution head coaches have made similar
statements. But the Revolution have failed miserably on the field,
winning a total of only 12 games in regulation time with a playoff
berth at stake in the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo and Gulati shouldn't be expected to make the Revolution
title contenders immediately. This will be Clavijo's first attempt
as head coach of an outdoor team. But Clavijo has had success
coaching professional indoor teams, and he performed at a high
standard for the US national team, retiring as a player after the
1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo has potential advantages over previous Revolution
coaches. Clavijo, 42, is the oldest and, theoretically, most mature
coach the team has had. He is also a contemporary of many of the US
players, though his life experience is different from most.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo retired from soccer after playing for Atenas in Uruguay
and moved with his wife, Martha, to Elizabeth, N.J., where he found
a job cleaning floors in a factory in 1979. But there was a lively
semi-professional soccer scene in the New York area, and Clavijo
was soon recruited by a wealthy restaurateur/team owner.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo then carved out a successful career with the Golden Bay
Earthquakes of the North American Soccer League and prominent
indoor teams such as the New York Arrows and San Diego Sockers.
Clavijo earned US citizenship in 1987, and Bora Milutinovic brought
him into the national team program at age 34. Remarkably, Clavijo
then played 61 times for the US national team, retiring after a 1-0
loss to Brazil in a second-round match of the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clavijo kept a relatively low profile with the national
team, he was one of its most effective players. He then began
coaching indoor teams, and last year was an assistant to
Milutinovic with the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do whatever it takes,'' Clavijo said. ``This is my
reputation, my life, on the line. We can be a contender for the MLS
Cup. And if we get the players we want, we can be a good contender
for MLS Cup 2000. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure everyone believes in what we are working
for. Winning is a habit. We might have to change some attitudes.
You can be a winner or a loser but what we have to do is
concentrate on winning and we will be all right.''

GOLF CLUB FACES STEEP PENALTIES IN SEX BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARCIA CHAMBERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Massachusetts attorney general's office has asked a state
judge to appoint a monitor to take over a private country club,
after a jury in Boston found that the club had systematically
discriminated against a group of female golfers and awarded them
$1.9 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover, if approved, would mark the first time that a
court has taken direct control of a private country club because it
had discriminated against women. Court-appointed monitors are a
familiar remedy in many other types of legal cases, ranging from
court-ordered school desegregation to union locals accused of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against the Haverhill Golf and Country Club was
brought by nine women, nearly all of them spouses of members, who
accused the club of sex discrimination for denying them full
membership and equal access to the golf course. At Haverhill, which
is 30 miles north of Boston, only male club members were permitted
to tee off at prime times, like weekend mornings, a common practice
at many country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   After a monthlong trial in State Superior Court in Boston, a
jury decided unanimously late last month that the club had unfairly
manipulated waiting lists and denied the women primary memberships
with full access to the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that the plaintiffs were correct on a
crucial legal point _ that Haverhill, although a private club, had
conducted its membership and business practices in ways that
qualified it as a public accommodation and thus made it subject to
state antidiscrimination laws. As a result, the jury was entitled
to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of country club discrimination cases, the
$1.9million jury award for compensatory and punitive damages is a
landmark both in its size and its message. And it may get worse for
the club's members if Judge John C. Cratsley, who presided over the
trial, also accepts a pending consumer protection claim that, under
Massachusetts law, would let him triple the award.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Rodriguez, a deputy state attorney general who helped
try the Haverhill case, said the verdict had set a significant
precedent. ``Country clubs are on notice now that they will be
accountable for their policies and practices under civil rights
laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some golf officials agreed that the decision would affect
country clubs as they consider questions of equal access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the impact is going to be felt not only by clubs in
this state, but also nationally,'' said Thomas E. Landry, executive
director of the Massachusetts Golf Association. ``If clubs haven't
been reviewing their bylaws and membership policies and privileges,
the size of this award will certainly put them on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, though, that the case will set precedents in
cases that involve allegations of racial discrimination in
admissions to country clubs. When a club admits a man, whatever his
race, color or national origin, he usually receives full membership
rights, including full access to the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But clubs sometimes grant only limited memberships to women who
apply for full memberships. These women then receive limited access
to the golf course and many other club facilities. It is this
practice that the jury found illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, private clubs in the United States are being held
to be public accommodations and therefore subject to
antidiscrimination laws. Typically, a private club may be defined
as a public accommodation if it advertises its facilities for
rental by outsiders, is less rigorous than other clubs in its
selection criteria for membership or leases itself out for business
and other purposes to nonmembers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months alone, a number of private country clubs
have found themselves before state human rights commissions accused
of sex discrimination. In New York, an administrative law judge for
the State Division of Human Rights is currently hearing a
10-year-old case that pits Nancy Saunders, a commercial real estate
agent in Greenwich, Conn., against the Westchester Country Club in
Harrison, N.Y. Saunders says she lost her own membership in the
club because she married a member.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadowlands Golf and Country Club in Blue Bell, Pa.,
recently acknowledged as part of a settlement that it was a public
accommodation. And last week in Ohio, the State Human Rights
Division held that the Tippecanoe Golf and Country Club in
Canfield, Ohio, was a public accommodation and therefore subject to
the state's antidiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the Haverhill case, the nine women filed suit in 1995, and
the Massachusetts attorney general's office joined the lawsuit the
following year on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial Marsha Vs. Kazarosian, the plaintiffs' lawyer,
presented evidence that the country club's top officials had
manipulated waiting lists or destroyed them altogether so that only
a few women achieved full membership. One woman, Nancy Peterson, a
member who was called to testify by the club to show that it had
not discriminated, learned under cross-examination that men who had
applied after she had were admitted before she was.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the deputy state attorney general, asked the judge 10
days ago to appoint a monitor to run the Haverhill Golf and Country
Club. He also asked the judge to permanently ban the club from
manipulating the waiting list ``to the detriment of women
applicants.'' He also asked that the club be barred from offering
junior membership to boys and not to girls.
</P>
<P>
   To make the club fully accountable, Rodriguez contended that an
independent monitor should be appointed to oversee the club's daily
operations and decision making for five years. If Cratsley agrees,
the monitor would oversee club policy, rewrite the club's bylaws
and investigate any complaints involving sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Under the request, the Haverhill club would be required to elect
a new board by next April. All current and former board members
would be ineligible to run for the board for six years. All board
members, heads of the major committees and club employees would
have to undergo sensitivity training for the next six years. The
training would address sex discrimination under state and federal
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the golf season winds down in the East, the country club
world is abuzz about the jury's decision. At Haverhill the club's
members, who are called bondholders, have called a series of
meetings to discuss their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The club's lawyer, Henry Owens 3rd, said the club disagreed with
the jury's verdict and would appeal. He contended that the club's
bylaws were neutral with respect to sex and that the women who
filed suit simply did not want to pay new initiation fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, the plaintiffs won the first half,'' Owens
said. ``We are confident we will prevail in the second half. This
is a very complicated case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the verdict, the plaintiffs have been
shunned; club members refuse to talk to them or play golf with them
or their spouses, they say.

PATTERSON THRIVING AS SONICS' BOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ruben Patterson has burst onto the Seattle scene as a
high-flying scorer and rebounder. But as a Los Angeles Lakers
rookie last season, he left teammates with a different kind of
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Painful, lasting impressions. Bruises. Scrapes. Cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly dubbed ``Wild Thang II'' by teammates for his
reckless hustle and the bodily damage he did in training camp. No
one left unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   But in Seattle, Patterson's called ``Sky Pilot.'' In 14 games,
all as the starting small forward, he's averaged 14.6 points and
7.1 rebounds a game. All from a player considered a defensive
specialist by the Lakers, who let him leave as a free agent this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Patterson's emergence is surprising no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when he was here I was very very impressed with him,''
said executive vice president Jerry West, who drafted Patterson in
the second round in 1998. ``I thought he had the ability to be a
player in the league, and under the right circumstances will be a
real fine player.''
</P>
<P>
   The right circumstances didn't exist in L.A. Patterson was
blocked at small forward by Glen Rice and Rick Fox. He started the
season third at shooting guard, behind Eddie Jones and Kobe Bryant,
but even after Jones was traded, Patterson rarely got off the
bench. He played in 24 of 50 games, averaging 2.7 points in 6.0
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers drafted another swingman, Devean George, whom
new coach Phil Jackson viewed as a better fit in the triangle
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very tough for him to be in our kind of offense,''
Jackson said of Patterson. Because of the emphasis on passing and
moving? ``Shooting,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not surprised Patterson is thriving on a running,
gunning unit paced by Gary Payton, Brent Barry and Horace Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs well, scrums the ball out, good offensive rebounder,
got a lot of hustle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a lot of mouth, too. Upon signing a three-year deal
with the Sonics in August, Patterson promptly proclaimed himself
the ``Kobe Bryant stopper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dominated Kobe, and everybody knew it,'' Patterson said.
``They called me the Kobe stopper (in practice). He hated when I
guarded him _ all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers guard Derek Fisher chuckled at those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read some of that stuff. I was at practice every day, and
for the most part you guys (reporters) were here from time to time,
so you don't even really have to think about what he's saying,
really,'' Fisher said. ``It's good that he has that type of
confidence, but there's no one guy in this league that can stop
Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson will have to wait to test that theory _ Bryant's out
at least another week while rehabbing a broken right hand.
</P>
<P>
   As for Patterson's sudden burst from obscurity to front-line
player, Fisher is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what he does best, and that's go out and play hard
and make hustle plays and things like that,'' he said. ``Seattle is
a basketball team that plays with reckless abandon, sometimes on
offense but definitely on defense, and Ruben has made the best of
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Guard Brian Shaw (sprained ankle) returned to
practice Monday and is expected to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Tyronn Lue also practiced but Jackson said he's not ready
to be activated from the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is scheduled to have his hand re-examined today.

   Kazarosian, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said the club's actions
after the judgment could only harm it further. ``I see how the
Haverhill Country Club has reacted to this judgment,'' she said,
``where 14 jurors have pointed the finger at this club and said,
`You can't do that anymore,' and they have gone the other way and
said, `No one is going to tell us what to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides will argue the attorney general's request
for a court monitor at a hearing scheduled for Dec. 10. Owens said
last week that he would not comment on his response until he files
it with the court, but he is expected to oppose or seek to modify
the broad scope of the request.
</P>
<P>
   In court, the Haverhill women described vindictive conduct
toward them by the club's top officers. It was this conduct that
prompted the high punitive damages, which make up the bulk of the
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Richardson, this year's Massachusetts Women's Open winner,
testified that in the summer of 1995 she and the Haverhill women's
association were in conflict with the men's golf committee over how
to run a weekend tournament at the club.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament had been run by the women in the past. The board
accused Richardson of insubordination and suspended her from the
club for 21 days. The suspension came just as Richardson and the
other women were filing their lawsuit and as she was preparing for
state championship tournaments. The jury awarded Richardson
$342,000, its highest single award, of which $250,000 was in
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Brochetti has been a member of Haverhill for 20 years with
her husband, Jim. On a Sunday in 1995, Brochetti said that she, her
husband and two of their three sons were standing on the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to wait until 1 p.m. to tee off, even though there
weren't many people out there,'' she said. ``One of my sons was
playing as a guest and the other was a junior member. They could
have gone off, but we had to stand there because I was with them.
My oldest son said, `Mom, I can't believe you let them treat you
this way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the plaintiffs' husbands said they have paid a
price for the lawsuit. Richardson's husband, Chet, said his name
was crossed out on the pairings sheet for his usual four-ball
competition just one day after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame this had to happen, because it never had to get
to this point,'' Chet Richardson said. ``They could have settled
this four years ago. It would have saved them a lot of money and
everyone a lot of grief.'' &QL;

PROTESTERS DOMINATE ON EVE OF WORLD TRADE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- So far, the protesters have unfurled banners from
rooftops and taken over an abandoned building. They have marched
through the downtown area, gray-haired grandmothers alongside
college students with pierced eyebrows, scientists in suits beside
demonstrators dressed as sea turtles. Together they have built
giant puppets and packed classes in non-violent protest tactics.
They've braced themselves for arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Representing scores of countries and hundreds of organizations,
they have descended on Seattle by the thousands to oppose the World
Trade Organization, the international body that they accuse of
favoring trade expansion over all else. With its powers to decide
issues affecting the globe, the Geneva-based WTO has spurred union,
environmental and human rights activists to band together in one of
the largest protest efforts in recent history -- and the first ever
for many of the younger demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in protesting the Vietnam War and this is way
bigger because it affects the entire world,'' said Dennis Jennings,
46, an Alameda, Calif., firefighter who paid his own way to Seattle
to join the protest. ``The decisions they make affect every aspect
of our lives. It's a way of controlling us, our food supply, you
name it, through transnational corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest round of talks, which open Tuesday, are not
expected to end in anything more than an agreement for the 135
member nations to keep talking, past rulings have convinced
activists from around the world that the WTO is indifferent to
their concerns. And those rulings, they complain, are made by
unelected ministers who answer to no one but themselves. The entire
process, they say, is not only dangerous but undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically like a New World Order, and that scares
me,'' said Michael McKinnon, 20, a first-time protester who
delivers pizza for a living in Eugene, Ore. ``It's not thinking
about human beings or the environment. It's all about how
corporations can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembled Groups range from the unknown to the securely
established _ the Raging Grannies and the Sierra Club, respectively
_ and from the radical left to conservatives like Patrick Buchanan,
who also reviles the WTO. They see the ministerial meeting as a way
to get word out about an organization that many people are unaware
of and relatively few can define. To that end, Seattle has been
turned into a massive stage for street theater intended to
counterbalance the panel discussions, and concerts also taking
place around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, a coalition of groups that included the Humane
Society sent more than 2,000 marchers into downtown, many of them
banging drums, all of them chanting anti-WTO slogans. A block over,
a smaller group led by demonstrators from Korea held a march of its
own, this one featuring a building-sized Satan puppet to represent
the trade group. After holding a mock trial, a group calling itself
the Global People's Tribunal issued a citizens arrest warrant for
the trade ministers from the seven leading industrialized countries
and marched over to the convention center to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad message we're trying to send is: review and
repair,'' said Mary Botarri, an official with the non-profit
organization Public Citizen, based in Washington, D.C. ``Before we
do any launching of new talks, we need to take a hard look at the
WTO's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrea Durbin, an official with Friends of the Earth,
``We're not at all opposed to the idea of the WTO. Our concern is
that the trade rules right now are so strongly biased against the
environment. The rules themselves flatly need to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, member nations have taken 167 trade disputes to the WTO
since it was created in 1995 as a formal judicial body, replacing
the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. GATT, as its
predecessor was known, had heard 300 disputes in its entire 47-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with tariffs mostly cut, the WTO has been grappling with
more complicated issues, such as whether a nation can set tough
food-safety, child-labor or environmental laws that might bar
imports from a nation with lower standards. The debate is not
abstract. The United States has already been forced to defend its
laws before the WTO, and sometimes it has lost.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases that galvanized environmental and animal
activists, in 1991, Mexico won a ruling from the WTO's predecessor
challenging a US ban on tuna imports from producers who killed too
many dolphins. Then three years ago, the WTO ruled against a US law
that required gasoline to meet cleanliness standards. At the same
time, US farmers complain that other nations use health concerns to
bar or limit US imports of hormone-fed beef and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   On a more local level, Robert Stumberg, a Georgetown University
law professor, said the WTO could trample empowerment zones,
``buy-American'' programs and other laws that favor the United
States over others.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You should care because the Seattle negotiations
could change the rules of democracy, and you would see the
difference in terms of the capacity of your state or local
government to pass laws that affect how your tax dollars are spent
on purchasing, or how your state can pass laws to promote economic
development, or your state's authority to protect the environment
or manage it's own resources.''
</P>
<P>
   To show his support for the WTO, President Clinton is expected
to be in town. A rumor that may be little more than wishful
thinking has it that Fidel Castro will arrive later in the week to
voice his opposition. With the help of a Bay Area group called the
Ruckus Society, which held two camps specifically to train
protesters for the WTO meeting, the activists say they are ready
for anything, including arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Leone Reinbold, a 22-year-old spokeswoman for protest umbrella
group Direct Action Network, said police should expect low-tech
blockades (people) and lock downs (people chaining themselves to
eachother or objects). The goal, she said, is to shut down the WTO
-- and the hundreds of mostly young people sitting on the floor of
the network's headquarters, eating macrobiotic food and learning
how to resist arrest peacefully, sounded prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole effort just shows that things can be run by the
community and now how they are run now; this all took place from
the bottom up,'' said Melanie Grubman, 20, who flew in from
Connecticut, where she attends Wesleyan University and is active in
grassroots organizing. ``I couldn't miss everything that's
happening. This is right on stuff and it could change our future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing studies that show that medical malpractice
causes tens of thousands of deaths each year, the National Academy
of Sciences called Monday for a new federal agency to protect
patients and said that Congress should require all health care
providers to report medical mistakes that cause serious injury or
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the academy's Institute of Medicine said that
``health care is a decade or more behind other high-risk industries
in its attention to ensuring basic safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In hospitals alone, the report said, research suggests that
medical errors kill 44,000 to 98,000 people a year. This exceeds
the number of people who die annually from highway accidents (about
43,450), breast cancer (42,300) or AIDS (16,500), the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the panel that conducted the study, William
Richardson, said, ``These stunningly high rates of medical errors _
resulting in deaths, permanent disability and unnecessary suffering
_ are simply unacceptable in a medical system that promises first
to `do no harm.''' Richardson is president of the W.K. Kellogg
Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that safety experts could prevent many of the
injuries and deaths if they systematically collected and analyzed
data on medical errors, to identify the causes. Accordingly, the
panel said that the United States should strive, as a ``minimum
goal,'' to reduce medical errors by 50 percent in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To err is human, but errors can be prevented,'' the report
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is a federally chartered but
independent organization of scientists that studies scientific and
technical issues for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member panel said that Congress should create a new
federal agency, a Center for Patient Safety, to set detailed
national goals for reducing medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency would be part of the Public Health Service and
would initially need $30 million to $35 million a year in federal
money, but its budget should eventually reach at least $100 million
a year, the panel said. That is slightly more than 1 percent of the
$8.8 billion a year in health care costs that can be attributed to
preventable medical injuries, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the proposed new Center for Patient Safety
could learn some lessons from other government agencies like the
Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration. The chance of dying in a domestic airline
flight or at the workplace has declined sharply in recent decades,
in part because of the efforts of these agencies, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant recommendation, the study said that
Congress should require health care providers to inform state
governments of any medical errors that cause serious harm to
patients. The requirement would apply first to hospitals, then to
doctors, clinics, outpatient surgery centers, nursing homes and
others who care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many states don't have any mandatory reporting,'' said Janet
Corrigan, the director of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that reports on medical errors that cause serious
harm to patients should be available to the public. Ms. Corrigan
acknowledged that such information might be used against doctors
and hospitals in lawsuits filed by injured patients or their
survivors. ``That's certainly possible with a mandatory reporting
system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From the reports filed with state agencies, Ms. Corrigan said,
consumers could identify hospitals where patients have been injured
as a result of medical errors. But she said that the panel had not
specified whether the names of individual doctors should be
disclosed.

NASA SPACECRAFT NEARS ITS LANDING ON MARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After an 11-month journey from Earth, the squat Mars
Polar Lander, NASA's boldest attempt to find water on Mars, will
begin a searing, 4-mile-per-second plunge into the Red Planet's
atmosphere Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with everything working to perfection, the landing will be
risky.
</P>
<P>
   A jarring parachute descent and a final drop of nearly a mile
controlled by untried pulsing thrusters must unfold precisely to
ensure the spacecraft reaches the Martian surface intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 23 loss of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, a $151 million
mission that was to study the planet's weather and act as a
communications relay for the Polar Lander, is proof that less
challenging missions can go awry.
</P>
<P>
   A navigational error later attributed to an embarrassing mix-up
among ground controllers over the use of metric and English
measurements led to the Climate Orbiter's demise. Faced with less
demanding maneuvers to place it in orbit around Mars, the Climate
Orbiter instead dived too steeply into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that landing is a more challenging job than going
into orbit,'' said Edward Stone, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which manages both missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have successfully landed before. We know how to do it,''
said Stone of the $221 million Polar Lander mission. In the wake of
the Climate Orbiter loss, Stone scrambled to improve communications
between overworked operations and navigation personnel, to augment
their ranks and to institute new checks and balances for the
procedures leading to the lander's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants something to go unnoticed,'' said Stone. ``My
team is very focused on landing on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, of 29 previous missions launched to Mars over the last
four decades by the United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia
and Japan, fewer than a third can claim full success. But among the
most recent was NASA's successful Mars Pathfinder mission. After
reaching the planet July 4, 1997, the camera and rover-equipped
Pathfinder lander revealed an ancient equatorial watershed strewn
with sedimentary rocks.
</P>
<P>
   With the Polar Lander, NASA's destination is a 124-mile by
12-mile corridor of gracefully rolling terrain on the northern
fringes of the previously unexplored Martian south pole. Layered
accumulations of dust and ice in the barren, windswept north and
south polar regions of Mars began to pique the attention of
scientists more than 25 years ago when images were transmitted to
Earth by the U.S. Mariner 9 orbiter. Among Mariner 9's revelations
was a dust storm, reversing a prevailing notion that there was
little dynamic about the Martian weather.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by findings from bygone missions and those of NASA's
camera-laden Mars Global Surveyor, which began orbiting the planet
in 1997, scientists say the region may hold proof that the Martian
poles function as geologic sponges, retaining frozen reservoirs of
underground water.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say water once flowed and pooled on the now arid
surface of Mars. According to a competing theory, the water is
released periodically in response to warming events linked to Mars'
orbital track and subtle changes in the tilt of the planet's axis.
Both factors could alter the amount of sunlight and heat reaching
the polar caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big question is whether there is water present. The
second is can the surface and ground act as a big sponge that holds
lots of water,'' said Richard Zureck, NASA's chief scientist for
the Polar Lander mission. ``If so, that really strengthens the
arguments that the water that was present early in Mars' history on
the surface is still on the planet, it's just under the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding would also bolster the 1996 claims of a small team
of NASA scientists that a meteorite of Martian origin harbors the
fossilized remnants of microbial life. A frozen reservoir would
become a target for robotic rock and soil sample return missions
that the space agency is planning soon after the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   If the Polar Lander reaches its destination safely, NASA ground
control teams will transmit commands that awaken a 6.5-foot-long
mechanized arm tipped with a clawlike scoop and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Climate Orbiter's relay function will force
ground controllers to communicate directly with the Polar Lander,
slowing the exchanges of images and other data from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   During a process that could be drawn out for two to three
months, Polar Lander's arm will dig for ice. A trenching procedure
would enable the digging tool to reach depths of up to 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is equipped with a small oven designed to receive up
to eight tiny samples of excavated material. As samples weighing no
more than a tenth of a gram are heated to temperatures of nearly
1,900 degrees, laser-driven sensors have been calibrated to detect
the presence of escaping water and carbon dioxide vapors.
</P>
<P>
   If the hunches of scientists are correct, Polar Lander will land
atop relatively young terrain, possibly only several million to a
hundred million years old and more than 1 1/2 miles thick. This
layered terrain was built as the water on Mars dried up, and winds
swept dust into the atmosphere, where it mixed with water vapor in
the planet's thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   When the crystals of frozen water and dust got big enough, they
fell to the surface at the poles.
</P>
<P>
   The robot arm and the cameras of the Polar Lander will work
hand-in-glove, allowing scientists to expose and examine the
layering much as a climatologist would survey the rings of an old
tree for clues about past weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As the carefully screened samples are heated, the quantity of
moisture released will be closely assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can estimate the volume of water the surface holds, the
total size of the reservoirs, by how much these mineral samples
hold,'' said Zureck.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander also carries two softball-size probes, dubbed
``Deep Space 2'' by NASA. The microprobes were designed to separate
several minutes before the Polar Lander begins its plunge into the
Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Without parachutes or braking rockets, the microprobes will dive
into the atmosphere, encased in protective shells about the size of
basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   Their trajectory should direct them toward the same layered
terrain as the Polar Lander. Engineers calculate they will hit
about 50 seconds to 85 seconds ahead of the Polar Lander within 60
miles of the main spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the 400-mph impact will shatter the protective
shell and separate the rugged microprobes into components.
</P>
<P>
   The impact will drive a bullet-shaped penetrator three feet into
the subsoil. The aft-body will remain on the surface linked by a
Kevlar communications tether to the penetrator.
</P>
<P>
   Within the penetrator is a tiny drill and oven. In response to
commands from Earth, the drills on the penetrators will gather a
tiny sample of the subsoil and warm it. The aft-body will radio the
vapor analysis to the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor, which will
relay the results to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency considers Deep Space 2 an experiment that could
pave the way for cheaper planetary probes and as a small insurance
policy for the Polar Lander.

SUPREME COURT HEARS VERMONT CASE TESTING FEDERAL WHISTLE - BLOWER
LAW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finding itself with a far-reaching constitutional
challenge to the federal whistle-blower law suddenly on its hands,
the Supreme Court appeared uncertain Monday about how to proceed
through a jurisdictional thicket of its own making.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days ago, the justices unexpectedly converted a narrower
case into a major test of a law that dates in one version or
another to the country's earliest days. Congress passed the False
Claims Act in 1863 as a tool against widespread fraud against the
government by Civil War contractors; it authorizes private
individuals to bring suits on behalf of the government and to
receive as their reward a share of any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The case argued before the court Monday had raised only the
issue of whether states could be made defendants in False Claims
Act suits by private plaintiffs, a significant but scarcely
earth-shaking question. Then on Nov. 19, the justices, without
explanation, ordered the parties in the case to address the
question of whether private plaintiffs have standing to bring False
Claims Act suits _ against states or anyone else. That question
goes to the constitutional heart of the law, and if the answer is
no, the False Claims Act will essentially be a dead letter.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Vermont, the defendant in the case before the
court, was quick to take up the justices' invitation in the
argument Monday. An employee of the state's Agency of Natural
Resources brought a False Claims Act suit alleging mismanagement by
the agency of federal grants under the Clean Water Act and the Safe
Drinking Water Act. With triple damages under the False Claims Act,
the state's potential liability of $25 million is more than the
agency's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim is that the United States has been damaged,'' J.
Wallace Malley Jr., Vermont's deputy attorney general, told the
justices, while the plaintiff himself suffered ``no greater injury
than any other taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a generalized injury, Malley continued, did not meet the
``irreducible minimum of standing,'' which the court has long
defined as ``injury in fact,'' meaning an individualized and
specific injury to be redressed by a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of receiving up to 30 percent of the government's
recovery provides private plaintiffs with a strong incentive,
Malley said, but a litigant's ``fervor'' alone is ``not enough to
grant standing.''
</P>
<P>
   In its new form, this case, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources
vs. United States, No. 98-1828, presents the justices with a
dilemma. Ordinarily, the court strives to decide cases on narrower,
statutory grounds if at all possible, avoiding unnecessary
constitutional decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the court has put the question of standing in play,
it would appear to have no alternative but to decide that most
far-reaching question of all, despite indications Monday that a
number of justices think that Vermont might well be entitled to
immunity on the narrower ground that Congress, when amending and
broadening the False Claims Act in 1986, never meant to include
states as possible defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the court's doctrine of standing serves as a
barrier to entry into federal court in the first place, a hurdle
that recent decisions have raised higher and higher. If there is no
standing, then as a constitutional matter there is no jurisdiction
at all, and the court's own precedents indicate that the justices
cannot now simply vault that hurdle to decide the easier question
first.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the state on behalf of the federal government, Edwin S.
Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general, said that the plaintiff in
this case, Jonathan Stevens, did have standing to bring his
lawsuit. While Stevens had no prior injury, Kneedler said, ``once
he files his suit he has in effect distinguished himself from every
other taxpayer and gained the exclusive right to bring the state to
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler added: ``Congress has created a concrete private
interest in the outcome of the suit, a prospect of recovery that is
sufficient for standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer for the plaintiff, used his
argument time to address what has now become the secondary question
in the case: whether states are immune from False Claims Act suits.
Vermont argued unsuccessfully, in an effort to get the lawsuit
dismissed in the lower federal courts, that private False Claims
Act suits are barred by the 11th Amendment, which provides states
with immunity from suits in federal court not brought by the
federal government or explicitly authorized by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has enlarged
the states' 11th Amendment shield and made it much harder for
Congress to abrogate state immunity. By agreeing last June to hear
Vermont's appeal, the justices had appeared to signal that they
were about to extend these immunity decisions to include the False
Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   But because these suits are brought ``in the name of the United
States to redress an injury to the United States,'' the 11th
Amendment immunity should not apply, Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your position seems to require quite a few props,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist said drily.
</P>
<P>
   In his few minutes of rebuttal time at the end of the hour,
Malley, the Vermont lawyer, summarized the challenge facing his
opponents, as well as the conundrum for the court. On the one hand,
he said, the government conceded that the plaintiff had no prior
injury ``and if that's the case, there is no standing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Malley continued, the government's view was
that once the suit was filed, the private plaintiff ``captures it
and makes it his own.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he concluded, the barrier to proceeding was the
11th Amendment.  &QL;

LANDER'S `BUGS' EXPECTED TO GIVE NEW INSIGHT INTO MAKEUP OF MARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Using camera-equipped space probes, scientists have
gradually pieced together a picture of Mars as a cold, arid realm
with rugged geological features that suggest the planet once had
flowing water.
</P>
<P>
   Not once in those four decades, though, have the experts
attempted to listen to the Red Planet's sounds.
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   With parachutes and a braking rocket to slow its descent, NASA's
Mars Polar Lander is on course to touch down near the Martian south
pole Friday, ending an 11-month journey from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Lander carries the first microphone ever dispatched to the
Red Planet, a $100,000, privately financed device, weighing less
than two ounces and fashioned from hearing aid components and
computer audio chips.
</P>
<P>
   If the Polar Lander survives a high-velocity plunge through the
Martian atmosphere, it will use a small robotic arm to dig for
evidence of frozen water in the subsoil, photograph the rolling
terrain that surrounds the landing site and collect weather
observations.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Mars microphone,'' developed by scientists at the
University of California at Berkeley and paid for by the Planetary
Society, a nonprofit pro-space organization, the lander will
attempt to tune in its alien surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear Mars,'' said Janet Luhmann, a space plasma
physicist at the California school who studies planetary
atmospheres and participated in the initiation of the unusual
project several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extending our sense of hearing for the first time to
planetary exploration,'' said Kevin Polk, the Planetary Society's
science and technical coordinator. ``This is bound to give us some
surprises and that is what exploration is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with an atmosphere so thin it would mute the tones of
normal human conversation to a soft whisper, Mars could have
something interesting for audiophiles.
</P>
<P>
   Luhmann's favorite candidates are the crackle of Martian
thunder, the roar of swirling dust devils, and wind gales that
whistle across the desertlike terrain with the velocity of a weak
hurricane. Something as exotic as a meteor streaking through the
Martian sky could announce its invasion with a sonic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, however, those involved in the microphone project
hope the first sounds of Mars relayed to Earth will help bring the
alien realm to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine putting on a pair of good ear plugs and walking around
for a day. You would experience your world differently,'' said
Luhmann as he drew a terrestrial analogy. ``So, I think by taking
the ear plugs out _ basically by having this microphone _ we will
be appreciating things in a slightly different way on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the sounds of Mars could also have a sobering
influence on the design of human and robotic spacecraft launched to
the planet in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent features of Martian weather are raging dust
storms and feverish whirlwinds. Like the rainstorms of Earth, the
dust storm of Mars may discharge thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these dust clouds charge and discharge, they probably would
not discharge in quite the same way as a rain cloud on Earth,''
Luhmann said. ``There might be more of a crackle than a boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even the soft crackle of thunder on the Red Planet
could be cause for alarm to those on Earth responsible for plotting
the future exploration of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you send humans, then it's one thing to have some dust blow
by you. It's another thing if it's charged and discharging to your
equipment, your space suit and yourself,'' Luhmann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the electrical environment there in dust clouds and
outside the dust clouds is of interest to (NASA's) human
exploration experts as well as the people who are planning various
robotic activities.'' Luhmann said. ``This could impact their
operations significantly, their planning and design of their
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ground control teams for the Polar Lander at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., plan to activate the
recording device soon after the spacecraft lands.
</P>
<P>
   The history of space microphones is sketchy. The late astronomer
Carl Sagan, among the founders of the Pasadena, Calif.-based
Planetary Society, proposed that NASA include them on its twin
Viking probes in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The missions, which included orbiters and landers, were a
success, but the space agency nixed the microphones.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the Russians incorporated a microphone in a
robotic mission to Venus, detecting sounds that some interpreted as
thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Luhmann and colleagues in her university's space
physics research group proposed the use of microphones on a Mars
mission to measure wind velocities.
</P>
<P>
   When the proposal was rejected on meteorological merits, it
found support as a public relations and educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   The Planetary Society will copyright the sounds it obtains with
the microphone but will make the sound bites available to the
public over the organization's Internet site:
http://www.planetary.org.

BRADLEY SPEAKS OUT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Senator Bill Bradley launched a scathing attack
on US policy toward Russia &UR;  &LR; Monday, charging that mistakes made by
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have alienated the
Russian people and created direct dangers to American security.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech sponsored by the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University, the Democratic presidential
contender said that instead of acting in the self interest of the
United States, Clinton and Gore ``acted more as missionaries for a
particular type of international economics,'' and created an
atmosphere in which ordinary Russians think the United States wants
them to be poor and weak.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should have moved more strongly to reduce
nuclear armaments, to support Russian nuclear scientists and
eliminate the danger of them going to work for unfriendly
governments, and to help Russia replace dangerously outdated
nuclear plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has been deeply involved in developing the
administration's Russia policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's sharp and sustained criticism of that policy, in what
aides billed as his first major foreign policy appearance of the
campaign, was elaborated upon later in the day during a meeting
with Globe editors and reporters. The emphasis was unusual in that
Bradley has generally avoided directing barbs at Gore while the
vice president's camp has taken numerous shots at Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Monday, during the meeting at the Globe,
Bradley named some of the people with whom he has consulted on
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to call them foreign policy advisers, Bradley
said that he ``is close to (President Reagan's Secretary of State)
George Shultz, I have talked with (President Nixon's Secretary of
State Henry) Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   He also named former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger;
former World Bank managing director Jessica Einhorn; Jessica
Tuchman Matthews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace; R. Fred Bergsten, longtime director of the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank, and
John Galvin, dean of the Fletcher School and former supreme allied
commander of NATO in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often these days, our policies, even our military, are
designed for a world that no longer exists,'' Bradley told the 550
students and professors at Tufts who were able to get tickets for
his talk.
</P>
<P>
   In what he called a disturbing paradox, he said that ``we are
more powerful than ever before, but more vulnerable than we have
ever been'' to new threats such as Russian missiles which may not
be under firm control, to the dangers of war on the Korean
peninsula, and to international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States can be a policeman to the
world. We don't have the resources or the wisdom,'' he said,
advocating that the 32 conflicts he said are currently raging in
the world be handled in cooperation with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Were he president, said Bradley, who as a senator voted against
use of the US military to eject Iraq from Kuwait, ``it would have
to be in the national interest for intervention to take place, and
it would have to be consistant with our values.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions at the Globe, he acknowledged that the
intervention in Kuwait ``succeeded and it succeeded quickly,'' but
he declined to say he would vote differently if he had it to do
over again.
</P>
<P>
   The war ``was a risk, and in retrospect a risk worth taking,''
he said, acknowledging that it now seems unlikely that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein would have yielded to sanctions short of
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley mourned the loss of collegiality between Democrats and
Republicans in foreign affairs, an understanding once symbolized by
the Senate's embrace of Michigan Republican Arthur Vandenberg's
adage that ``politics stops at the water's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, that consensus has vanished,'' he said. ``Foreign
policy is more of a political football'' now, with positions
influenced by polling or focus groups that indicate how candidates
might score political points.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of his Boston stops did Bradley attempt to cover the
hotspots of the world. At each he was asked a question inviting
criticism of Israel and responded in a staunchly pro-Israel vein.
He also reiterated his support for the US embargo against Cuba _
another issue with a major domestic constituency _ though he
acknowledged that the embargo is not very effective.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of China policy _ a major problem for the Clinton-Gore
team _ only when asked, and then only to say that he agreed with
the current stance _ that ``China should be in the (World Trade
Organization). . . where they are subject to international rules. .
. and not outside the system cutting their own deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He was vague regarding what he would have done differently
regarding the wars which broke out in the Balkans with the
disintegration of Yugoslavia, though he faulted President George
Bush for failing to prevent German recognition of Croatian
independence, which was a watershed event, and Clinton for not
leveling with the American people about the depth and likely
outcomes of interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, ``the question was not can you win the war, but can
you win the peace,'' Bradley said, stressing that today ``the peace
is far from won,'' 100 Serbs a week are being killed, and the NATO
allies are in effect presiding over the creation of an autonomous
Kosovo rather than restoring a multi-ethnic society, as was
promised to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley named the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula as the
regions of the world where the United States has a national
interest and where real dangers persist. While the importance of
the gulf is widely recognized, he said that ``the Korean peninsula
is more dangerous than we read. There is an arms race there that
can get out of hand quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said trying to undo US mistakes in Russia would be ``like
coming in in the last five minutes of the play and saying `rewrite
the plot,''' but warned that the United States should proceed
cautiously with any further expansion of NATO, which the Russian
would take as ``putting the stick in their eye.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that further deterioration of Russia's situation, into
a morass such as that which brought down the Weimar Republic in
Germany and paved the way for the rise of Hitler and the Nazis,
``is not an impossibility.''

PROTESTERS DOMINATE ON EVE OF WORLD TRADE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- So far, the protesters have unfurled banners from
rooftops and taken over an abandoned building. They have marched
through the downtown area, gray-haired grandmothers alongside
college students with pierced eyebrows, scientists in suits beside
demonstrators dressed as sea turtles. Together they have built
giant puppets and packed classes in non-violent protest tactics.
They've braced themselves for arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Representing scores of countries and hundreds of organizations,
they have descended on Seattle by the thousands to oppose the World
Trade Organization, the international body that they accuse of
favoring trade expansion over all else. With its powers to decide
issues affecting the globe, the Geneva-based WTO has spurred union,
environmental and human rights activists to band together in one of
the largest protest efforts in recent history -- and the first ever
for many of the younger demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in protesting the Vietnam War and this is way
bigger because it affects the entire world,'' said Dennis Jennings,
46, an Alameda, Calif., firefighter who paid his own way to Seattle
to join the protest. ``The decisions they make affect every aspect
of our lives. It's a way of controlling us, our food supply, you
name it, through transnational corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest round of talks, which open Tuesday, are not
expected to end in anything more than an agreement for the 135
member nations to keep talking, past rulings have convinced
activists from around the world that the WTO is indifferent to
their concerns. And those rulings, they complain, are made by
unelected ministers who answer to no one but themselves. The entire
process, they say, is not only dangerous but undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically like a New World Order, and that scares
me,'' said Michael McKinnon, 20, a first-time protester who
delivers pizza for a living in Eugene, Ore. ``It's not thinking
about human beings or the environment. It's all about how
corporations can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembled Groups range from the unknown to the securely
established _ the Raging Grannies and the Sierra Club, respectively
_ and from the radical left to conservatives like Patrick Buchanan,
who also reviles the WTO. They see the ministerial meeting as a way
to get word out about an organization that many people are unaware
of and relatively few can define. To that end, Seattle has been
turned into a massive stage for street theater intended to
counterbalance the panel discussions, and concerts also taking
place around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, a coalition of groups that included the Humane
Society sent more than 2,000 marchers into downtown, many of them
banging drums, all of them chanting anti-WTO slogans. A block over,
a smaller group led by demonstrators from Korea held a march of its
own, this one featuring a building-sized Satan puppet to represent
the trade group. After holding a mock trial, a group calling itself
the Global People's Tribunal issued a citizens arrest warrant for
the trade ministers from the seven leading industrialized countries
and marched over to the convention center to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad message we're trying to send is: review and
repair,'' said Mary Botarri, an official with the non-profit
organization Public Citizen, based in Washington, D.C. ``Before we
do any launching of new talks, we need to take a hard look at the
WTO's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrea Durbin, an official with Friends of the Earth,
``We're not at all opposed to the idea of the WTO. Our concern is
that the trade rules right now are so strongly biased against the
environment. The rules themselves flatly need to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, member nations have taken 167 trade disputes to the WTO
since it was created in 1995 as a formal judicial body, replacing
the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. GATT, as its
predecessor was known, had heard 300 disputes in its entire 47-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with tariffs mostly cut, the WTO has been grappling with
more complicated issues, such as whether a nation can set tough
food-safety, child-labor or environmental laws that might bar
imports from a nation with lower standards. The debate is not
abstract. The United States has already been forced to defend its
laws before the WTO, and sometimes it has lost.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases that galvanized environmental and animal
activists, in 1991, Mexico won a ruling from the WTO's predecessor
challenging a US ban on tuna imports from producers who killed too
many dolphins. Then three years ago, the WTO ruled against a US law
that required gasoline to meet cleanliness standards. At the same
time, US farmers complain that other nations use health concerns to
bar or limit US imports of hormone-fed beef and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   On a more local level, Robert Stumberg, a Georgetown University
law professor, said the WTO could trample empowerment zones,
``buy-American'' programs and other laws that favor the United
States over others.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You should care because the Seattle negotiations
could change the rules of democracy, and you would see the
difference in terms of the capacity of your state or local
government to pass laws that affect how your tax dollars are spent
on purchasing, or how your state can pass laws to promote economic
development, or your state's authority to protect the environment
or manage it's own resources.''
</P>
<P>
   To show his support for the WTO, President Clinton is expected
to be in town. A rumor that may be little more than wishful
thinking has it that Fidel Castro will arrive later in the week to
voice his opposition. With the help of a Bay Area group called the
Ruckus Society, which held two camps specifically to train
protesters for the WTO meeting, the activists say they are ready
for anything, including arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Leone Reinbold, a 22-year-old spokeswoman for protest umbrella
group Direct Action Network, said police should expect low-tech
blockades (people) and lock downs (people chaining themselves to
eachother or objects). The goal, she said, is to shut down the WTO
-- and the hundreds of mostly young people sitting on the floor of
the network's headquarters, eating macrobiotic food and learning
how to resist arrest peacefully, sounded prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole effort just shows that things can be run by the
community and now how they are run now; this all took place from
the bottom up,'' said Melanie Grubman, 20, who flew in from
Connecticut, where she attends Wesleyan University and is active in
grassroots organizing. ``I couldn't miss everything that's
happening. This is right on stuff and it could change our future.''

   Were he president, said Bradley, who as a senator voted against
use of the US military to eject Iraq from Kuwait, ``it would have
to be in the national interest for intervention to take place, and
it would have to be consistant with our values.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions at the Globe, he acknowledged that the
intervention in Kuwait ``succeeded and it succeeded quickly,'' but
he declined to say he would vote differently if he had it to do
over again.
</P>
<P>
   The war ``was a risk, and in retrospect a risk worth taking,''
he said, acknowledging that it now seems unlikely that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein would have yielded to sanctions short of
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley mourned the loss of collegiality between Democrats and
Republicans in foreign affairs, an understanding once symbolized by
the Senate's embrace of Michigan Republican Arthur Vandenberg's
adage that ``politics stops at the water's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, that consensus has vanished,'' he said. ``Foreign
policy is more of a political football'' now, with positions
influenced by polling or focus groups that indicate how candidates
might score political points.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of his Boston stops did Bradley attempt to cover the
hotspots of the world. At each he was asked a question inviting
criticism of Israel and responded in a staunchly pro-Israel vein.
He also reiterated his support for the US embargo against Cuba _
another issue with a major domestic constituency _ though he
acknowledged that the embargo is not very effective.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of China policy _ a major problem for the Clinton-Gore
team _ only when asked, and then only to say that he agreed with
the current stance _ that ``China should be in the (World Trade
Organization). . . where they are subject to international rules. .
. and not outside the system cutting their own deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He was vague regarding what he would have done differently
regarding the wars which broke out in the Balkans with the
disintegration of Yugoslavia, though he faulted President George
Bush for failing to prevent German recognition of Croatian
independence, which was a watershed event, and Clinton for not
leveling with the American people about the depth and likely
outcomes of interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, ``the question was not can you win the war, but can
you win the peace,'' Bradley said, stressing that today ``the peace
is far from won,'' 100 Serbs a week are being killed, and the NATO
allies are in effect presiding over the creation of an autonomous
Kosovo rather than restoring a multi-ethnic society, as was
promised to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley named the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula as the
regions of the world where the United States has a national
interest and where real dangers persist. While the importance of
the gulf is widely recognized, he said that ``the Korean peninsula
is more dangerous than we read. There is an arms race there that
can get out of hand quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said trying to undo US mistakes in Russia would be ``like
coming in in the last five minutes of the play and saying `rewrite
the plot,''' but warned that the United States should proceed
cautiously with any further expansion of NATO, which the Russian
would take as ``putting the stick in their eye.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that further deterioration of Russia's situation, into
a morass such as that which brought down the Weimar Republic in
Germany and paved the way for the rise of Hitler and the Nazis,
``is not an impossibility.''

CASTRO, CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ARRESTED, OPTS OUT OF SEATTLE VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A campaign by a Cuban-born U.S. congressman to have
Fidel Castro arrested if he set foot in the United States is being
credited _ or blamed _ for Castro reluctantly deciding to skip this
week's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Castro announced Monday in a six-page letter to Rep. Jim
McDermott that he would not come to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel ``had to do with his concern about the
request by the congressman that he be arrested here for crimes,''
said McDermott, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincold Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., had written letters to
thousands of prosecutors urging them to charge Castro, if he came
to the United States, with the murders of four Americans killed in
1996 by Cuban fighter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, D-Wash., in July had invited the Cuban leader to
Seattle for the WTO conference.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Castro wrote that he wanted to attend to the
meeting and had ``feverishly'' prepared for the trade summit.
However he feared that if he were arrested, there would be a
``bloody armed conflict'' between the United States and Cuba,
beginning in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first battle would immediately erupt, much to our regret,
in that peaceful, cultured and hospitable city, the very moment the
U.S. authorities treacherously attempted to arrest me in Seattle in
line with these despicable pretexts and outrageous lies,'' Castro
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said a delegation headed by ``our young and combative foreign
minister, engineer Felipe Perez Roque,'' would attend in his place.
</P>
<P>
   For Diaz-Balart, Castro's cancellation was a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for the rule of law in the U.S. despite
President Clinton,'' said Diaz-Balart. ``Even though Clinton was
giving all sort of guarantees (that Castro would not be arrested),
he could not risk that any of the 3,000 prosecutors would charge
him with the murder of American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Diaz-Balart said he would have preferred that Castro
had come to Seattle and been arrested, rather than cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think capital crimes should have impunity,''
Diaz-Balart said.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott argued that Castro could have made a valuable
contribution to the trade conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very articulate spokesman for the developing
countries,'' McDermott said. ``I don't agree with everything that
Castro's done, but on the other hand we've got to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro had made tentative plans to meet with students, academics
and local church leaders. More than 1,200 tickets had been printed
and a room reserved for a talk at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' said UW Vice Provost Steve Olswang. He
said the university community had been excited about Castro's visit
and that it would have provided ``an opportunity for our students
to learn directly from an international figure.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said people deserved the chance to have an exchange
with Castro and ``make up their own mind.'' He said it was
unfortunate that some have reacted so strongly in opposition to the
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it we're so inflamed by Castro?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott also questioned the inconsistencies of foreign policy
and the selective demonization of Castro and Cuba. He questioned
whether Cuba was any worse than the China in regard to human rights
violations, treatment of the environment and labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said Castro was not the only leader concerned about
criminal prosecution when travelling abroad, citing the 1998 arrest
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what happened to Pinochet in Great Britain, a lot world
leaders are going to be careful about where they go,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: be disclosed.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday's recommendations appear to have a good chance of being
put into effect because they coincide with efforts by the Clinton
administration and members of Congress from both parties to define
patients' rights and enhance the quality of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was initiated by the academy because of growing
evidence _ and a growing perception among experts _ that the
quality of medical care falls far short of what it could be. The
study, unlike many projects of the academy, was not commissioned by
Congress or by any government agency.
</P>
<P>
   While the public has a right to know about errors causing
serious harm, the panel said, Congress should protect the
confidentiality of information about less serious mistakes. This,
it said, would encourage doctors and hospitals to report such
incidents voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, former president of the American Medical
Association, said, ``Any error that causes harm to a patient is one
error too many.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Dickey expressed concern about mandatory reporting and
public disclosure of serious medical errors. ``On the surface,''
she said, ``it appears to be a relatively straightforward step, but
actually it engenders all sorts of problems with confidentiality
and liability. Doctors find themselves in a real bind. We
understand the importance of investigating errors early on, while
everybody has a fresh memory. But there are still insurance
companies that would advise a physician not to tell anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the academy said that federal and state
government agencies should pay more attention to the safety of
patients when they license, evaluate and regulate health care
providers. Likewise, it said, employers should focus on these
issues when they buy health care for employees, and private
accrediting organizations should devote more attention to medical
errors when they assess the performance of hospitals and other
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report said, state licensing boards should
periodically re-examine doctors and nurses to check their
competence and knowledge of safety practices.

   ATLANTA _ After a body slam by Coke, the World Wrestling
Federation is cleaning up its act.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF _ whose shows have drawn fire for foul language and lewd
story lines _ promised late Monday it will tone down its
performances, starting with Thursday's ``Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a kinder, gentler WWF follows the announcement
that Coca-Cola had severed its two-year advertising relationship
with the federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good business people, we are willing to initiate change,''
said Jim Byrne, senior vice president of marketing for the WWF. The
shows will contain ``less use of colorful language and less
sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke said earlier Monday it pulled its advertising because the
WWF ``no longer was an appropriate environment for advertising our
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed the line in terms of content _ language and
character portrayals,'' Coke spokesman Bob Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said it would continue to advertise with WWF's main rival,
World Championship Wrestling, a subsidiary of Time Warner's
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the same content issues with the WCW at this
time,'' Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial response by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon was to blast
Coke's decision as ``discriminatory, hypocritical and an affront to
free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke is not the first advertiser to jump out of the WWF ring.
Earlier this year gum maker Wrigley said it would not renew its
contract with WWF because of the content of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   And the WWF has been under pressure from the Parents Television
Council to clean up its ``Smackdown'' broadcasts on the UPN
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Bertini acknowledged having received complaints
from the Parents Television Council, but they were not what caused
the soft-drink company to yank its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's sex-and-violence content has turned off more than just
Wrigley and Coke: Last month, four retailers _ Wal-Mart, Target,
Toys R Us and Kmart _ pulled a WWF action figure off their shelves
because of complaints that it was in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WWF is riding high. Ratings for its ``Raw'' and
``Smackdown'' shows are far ahead of WCW's ``Monday Nitro'' and
``Thunder,'' giving it an edge in the battle for $200 million in
annual TV wrestling advertising, and its toys are hot sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the WCW has begun styling its shows more like
the WWF's.
</P>
<P>
   ``WCW is changing its shows, making them more adult-oriented,''
said Bill Apter, editor-in-chief of World of Wrestling Magazine.
``The necklines on women's dresses are getting lower, and the
bikinis are getting smaller.''

SCUTTLED BY WARY PUBLISHER, BUSH BIOGRAPHY FINDS NEW ONE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Soft Skull Press, an irreverent micro-publisher that
got its start in a Kinko's copy store, is reviving a disputed
biography of George W. Bush that was recalled last month amid
revelations that the author had a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Soft Skull's founder and senior editor, Sander Hicks, 28,
announced Monday that his company had struck a deal with J.H.
Hatfield to reissue Hatfield's book, ``Fortunate Son: George W.
Bush and the Making of an American President,'' a book that the
original publisher, St. Martin's Press in New York, had discarded
as ``furnace fodder.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who wears his hair in a mohawk cut and describes himself
as the ``punk of publishing,'' said that in January he would
publish 25,000 copies of an updated version of the biography of
Bush, the Texas governor who is seeking the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The book will still contain its more controversial accusations,
from anonymous sources, that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine
possession, a record supposedly expunged by a judge as a favor to
Bush's father, former President George Bush. They are accusations
that both Bushes have denied.
</P>
<P>
   Some bookstores, like the Borders Group chain, have quietly
continued to sell the biography despite the recall by St. Martin's
Press. St. Martin's dropped the book in October, saying Hatfield
could not be trusted after he lied to the company repeatedly about
a report in The Dallas Morning News, which revealed his conviction
11 years ago for hiring a hit man in an effort to kill his boss in
a car bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, though, said he had faith in Hatfield, who he said had
``lied about his prison record because he was under extreme
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   For Soft Skull, publishing the Bush biography is a grand gamble
because it has never printed so many copies of a title. Hicks
started the press seven years ago behind the counter of a Manhattan
Kinko's shop where he was a shift manager. Its backlist of books
ordinarily caters to more eclectic, less commercial tastes,
including ``Jesus Was Way Cool'' by John S. Hall, the leader of the
art-house rock band King Missile, and ``Ripe Tomatoes,'' billed as
a novel of love, politics and a sexy red tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush biography will include a new introduction, possibly
some explanation from Hatfield about his predicament, and a new
cover, with a photograph of Bush and a red band boasting ``The Book
They Burned Is Back!''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hatfield has refused even to admit that he is the
same Hatfield with a prison resume. Monday, the author continued to
maintain his silence, saving his version of events for a prime-time
news program, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's told me now that he will tell everything when the time is
right,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not know the names of Hatfield's three
anonymous sources, but he noted that he had confidence in the
information, partly because he said Hatfield had telephone records
that documented his calls to people to research the biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event that we're ever taken to court,'' Hicks said,
``those sources would likely be subpoenaed. And what we're counting
on is that this is so volatile for the candidate and that it points
to the truth so that the candidate will not want to take us into
court.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Martin's Press, where an editor in chief quit in protest
over the book's publication, there was little interest in
revisiting the subject. This despite the fact that Soft Skull
issued a packet of information that compared its new cover with the
St. Martin's version with the tart observation: ``Original cover
here from St. Martin's. Sure is ugly, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, a spokesman for St. Martin's, issued a one-sentence
statement: ``We really don't comment on what other publishing
houses decide to publish.''

A TRAP IN SUDAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The omnibus spending bill President Clinton signed Monday
contains a poison pill. There is a provision that would allow the
administration to give direct food assistance to rebels in Sudan
who have been fighting the government for 16 years. The new law
overrides previous legislation that forbade US government food aid
to combatants.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is tempted to back the rebels because it
suspects that Sudan's Islamic government supports terrorism. Last
year the United States attacked a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's
capital, Khartoum, that may or may not have been making chemical
weapons for the terrorist Osama bin Laden. Some members of Congress
favor the bill because the rebels are mostly Christian while the
Sudanese government is Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   There are four good reasons why the administration should not
use its newfound option.
</P>
<P>
   (1) Using food as a weapon is a bad principle and will undermine
efforts by the United Nations and nongovernmental agencies to get
food to starving civilians caught up in war.
</P>
<P>
   (2) The United States should not take sides in civil wars or in
Christian crusades against Muslims, nor should it revive the Cold
War practice of using surrogates to undermine governments unless
there is an overarching national security reason for doing so.
Sudan is a nuisance, not an Iraq-sized menace to world peace.
</P>
<P>
   (3) The Sudanese government has behaved abominably against the
Christian and animist south, but the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army is equally ruthless and brutal and unworthy of US support. Our
own State Department has denounced rebel atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   (4) Any move to support the rebels directly will most certainly
hamper efforts to bring peace to the troubled country and may make
things worse for Christians in the south as well. The Sudanese
government would be able to portray its fight as an
anti-neocolonial struggle as well as a defense of Islam and
national sovereignty.

BOEING'S UNAPPROVED DESIGNS LEAD TO FEDERAL SAFETY REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration will conduct a
special three-month safety audit of Boeing's factories, after
learning that the company built hundreds of airplanes that did not
meet approved designs, the agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The errors do not pose an immediate safety threat but the agency
wants to determine if they are ``indicative of systemic issues in
the production system,'' said Beth Erickson, the agency's director
of aircraft certification.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Erickson said Boeing had reported four ``slips'' in its
quality control system recently. It delivered a 767 with a bolt
that was not tightened enough, and for years it has been building
planes with air ducts and moisture barriers that fail flammability
tests because they have too much glue, she said. In addition, at
the urging of the Environmental Protection Agency, Boeing switched
the cleaner it uses to scrub fuel tank parts before anti-corrosion
coatings are applied to them, she said, but as a result, pieces of
the coating have been peeling off into the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Erickson said that starting early next month, about eight
inspectors would try to determine whether these were isolated
problems. They should finish by the end of February, and the agency
will make recommendations by spring, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA does not plan to fine Boeing for any of the problems
found thus far, she said, but could do so if it finds more
problems. ``We're going to take appropriate action if necessary, to
make sure the system produces airplanes that can be flown safely,''
Ms. Erickson said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Boeing, Yvonne Leach, said the problems were
isolated and had been corrected in the factories. ``We're producing
conforming parts,'' she said, although she noted that the company,
the FAA and the airlines were still discussing what to do about the
hundreds of planes already in service that were not built according
to specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the audit comes at a time of heightened
scrutiny of one Boeing plane, the 767, after the crash on Oct. 31
of EgyptAir 990, with the deaths of all 217 people on board. But
safety investigators are leaning toward the idea that that crash
was caused by a pilot's suicide, not a mechanical problem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bolt problem, although it was found on only one airplane,
could represent a broader problem, Ms. Erikson said. In that case,
the engineering department specified a requirement for tightening
the bolt, but the tooling department gave ``an inappropriate
translation'' in telling workers precisely which wrench to use, and
how to use it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit will examine production systems for nearly the whole
range of airliners _ 737s, 747s, 757s, 767s and 777s _ in Everett,
Renton and Auburn, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA conducted a similar special audit in January 1998, after
investigators said that a 10-month-old 737 that crashed in
Indonesia appeared to be missing bolts in its tail. But the
inspectors found that planes then under construction had all the
required fasteners, and aviation experts later said that the
missing bolts were probably a result, not a cause, of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of the moisture barriers above the cockpits of 747,
757, 767 and 777 jets was detailed before.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the audits could delay delivery schedules, which have
been a problem recently for Boeing, Ms. Erickson said: ``When we do
an evaluation like this, the FAA's concern must be that we focus on
what we're doing with the evaluation. Their ability to deliver
aircraft comes as a secondary issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has insisted that no airplanes be delivered with parts
different from those specified when it approved the plane's design.
But the agency and the company are still discussing what to do
about planes that have already been delivered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When one of the people in my department made a huge mistake
on a project, I screamed at him. He went to my boss and I was
formally reprimanded. The problem is that when I make a mistake, my
boss yells his head off at me, and he's not the only one around
here who yells. Does this sound fair and what should I do? P.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Working at your company sounds like a real scream. In this
kind of environment, it is not surprising that you yelled at your
employee.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, it seems like the company has a culture that
condones yelling, berating and other forms of verbal abuse. When
there are screamers at the top of an organization, it is not
surprising to see and hear others emulating their behavior at all
job levels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many people learn much about managing from their
own managers. In a word, if you report to a screamer, the odds are
that you will be a screamer too.
</P>
<P>
   As for being reprimanded for screaming in an organization that
has seemingly turned yelling into a normal and acceptable practice,
it is understandable that you are upset. However, rather than being
upset about being punished for a behavior that others commit with
impunity, you should take a step back and recognize that this
organization is not only abusive, it also has a serious case of
inconsistency, inequity and nastiness, and it is infecting you.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes with all the screaming going on, it may be hard to
hear the real message: Does this literally sound like the right
organization for you?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have worked in a family-owned business for several years.
Last year, the firm's president took ill and his son, the vice
president, took over. Recently, he began a sexual relationship with
one of his direct reports, a woman who separated from her husband
because of this affair. She oversees an important department.
Because of the lack of professionalism and judgment of these two
individuals, productivity has slipped, clients are being lost and
many good employees are thinking about quitting. Should I talk to
the president, who is healthy today but not involved in the
day-to-day business? S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: This mess is certainly not going to do much for the
president's health, but he does need to know that things are a
little sick in his company. Not only is his son engaging in
improper behavior, but sonny's actions are arguably driving the
business right into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   These types of situations do not resolve themselves and simply
disappear one day. Rather, they tend to intensify. Although no one
has a crystal ball here, the odds are that this relationship will
collapse, the president's son will most likely cast his nets for
another catch and his present paramour will probably start thinking
about making a claim against sonny boy and the company.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the president is a ``like-father-like-son'' kind of
leader, he will be interested in learning about any problems that
are interfering with the success of the organization. He needs to
see that there is a big problem, namely his son. &QL;

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley sketched out a vision
for foreign policy on Monday that would try to resolve global
conflicts with trade and diplomacy instead of force, reduce the
threat of a new arms race and set clearer limits on American
military intervention in the world's many ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University, Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, said that global trade, technology and the end of the
Cold War had created new opportunities for global prosperity, but
also new threats from terrorists and rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American policy makers had not kept pace with the change, he
asserted. ``Too often today, our policies, even our military
policies, are designed for a world that no longer exists,'' he
said. ``The world today is a very different place than it was only
20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose strong support for free trade has put him at odds
with many core Democratic voters who support more protectionist
policies, also used his event to urge the World Trade Organization
to make workers' rights and environmental issues a more important
part of global trade agreements. The trade organization is meeting
in Seattle this week, amid protests by a number of labor and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the best answer for the long-term health of the
world and the United States is a rule-base multilateral trade
organization, with clear rules that are applicable to everyone,''
Bradley told more than 500 students at the Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``But the right of people to be
represented by unions is a very important right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also told the students that he would favor limiting the
role of the American military in fighting the drug trade in Latin
America, saying he would rather focus resources on reducing drug
use in the United States through expanded education and treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   And he emphasized his support for making Jerusalem the capital
of Israel. But he said it was up to the Israelis and Palestinians
to resolve the issue though negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The event was Bradley's the first significant attempt in the
campaign to outline his views on foreign policy, and he sprinkled
it with anecdotes about meetings with foreign leaders during his 18
years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the 90-minute appearance _ which featured a short speech
followed by a question-and-answer period _ was not intended to be
his definitive statement on foreign policy. His staff said he would
deliver a major speech in the coming weeks designed to fill in some
of the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Like his lone Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, Bradley
asserts that the free exchange of goods, capital and ideas can
spread prosperity to poor countries and help reduce global
tensions. But their positions have angered many labor unions and
environmental groups, both core Democratic constituencies, who
contend that global economic competition has encouraged some
countries to block unionization and pollute the environment with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to address some of those concerns on Monday,
saying the World Trade Organization should allow environmental
groups to participate in resolving trade disputes and try to
prohibit the sale of goods produced by forced child labor. Gore has
outlined similar positions in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said on Monday that he would push for programs that
would reduce the impact of global trade on American workers,
including retraining laid-off workers and providing universal
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade will benefit more people than it will hurt, but some
people will be hurt,'' he said. ``Some people will lose their jobs.
And I think we have to have in place a set of security measures,
personal security measures, for those people.''

   Nevertheless, Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that
had endorsed Bradley, criticized him on Monday for not pushing for
stronger labor and environmental protections in trade agreements.
The group also attacked him for supporting China's entry into the
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that he didn't step out further from the
administration's positions,'' said Mark Whiteis-Helm, a spokesman
for Friends of the Earth. ``And it's disappointing that he would
welcome China into the WTO when its record on human rights and the
environment are dismal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Long a critic of the Clinton administration's Russia policies,
Bradley on Monday spread his criticism across three
administrations. He asserted that Presidents Reagan, Bush and
Clinton all shared responsibility for policies that had failed to
encourage economic reforms in Russia and that had not reduced the
threat of Russian nuclear weapons spreading to other nations. Gore
has played a major role in overseeing administration policy toward
Russia, but Bradley did not mention the vice president on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the result has been that as the economy has sputtered,
we have not made as much progress on these issues,'' Bradley said.
``And we are left with a situation in Russia where in the best of
worlds we're seen as irrelevant to the average Russian, and in the
worst of worlds, we are blamed for their economic circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would support the United States entering into
Start III negotiations with the Russians to reduce both countries'
nuclear stockpiles, even though the Russian parliament has yet to
ratify Start II. He also said he would support a modification of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, signed with Russia in 1972, to
allow the United States to develop a defense system against a
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not say whether he would be willing to withdraw from
the ABM treaty if the Russians refused to amend it, a position
taken by the Clinton administration. And he did not say what, if
anything, he would do to stop the Russian military from bombing
civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As he has many times on the stump, Bradley said he would try to
limit the use of American military force in regional or ethnic
conflicts overseas. The criteria for intervention, he said, should
be that those conflicts affect vital American interests _ such as
the oil supply _ and that core American values _ such as human
rights _ be at stake. But he said he would prefer that the United
States work through the United Nations to resolve regional
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is to have multilateral partnership to intervene
before it is too late,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a more oblique criticism of Congress and the administration,
Bradley complained that partisanship and politics in Washington
were clouding foreign policy decisions more than ever. He did not
offer any specific examples, although his aides said later he may
have been referring in part to Congress' rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign policy has become more of a political football, or is
made through polling or focus groups to score domestic policy
points,'' he said. ``I deplore that. One of the things I will try
to restore if I become president is a bipartisan foreign policy
consensus.''

A CHINA DISSIDENT'S ORDEAL: BACK TO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese political dissident who was held for more
than seven years in a psychiatric hospital after he unfurled a
protest banner in Tiananmen Square in 1992 has been reincarcerated,
prompting human rights advocates to call for a United Nations
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an unusual but alarming example of the misuse of
psychiatric facilities by Chinese authorities to silence a
political opponent, human rights advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest in June 1992 for his protest, Wang Wanxing was
placed in the Ankang psychiatric hospital near Beijing, which is
operated by the Public Security Bureau for those deemed criminally
insane or a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   His wife says she has never been given any official diagnosis of
a psychiatric disorder. In early 1997, in response to international
concern about the case, a government report said Wang had been
determined to be ``suffering from paranoid delusions'' that caused
``his attempt to disturb the social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any open legal process, Wang was held in the hospital
continuously from 1992 until last Aug. 19, when he was given a
three-month trial release.
</P>
<P>
   But last Tuesday, the police took Wang, who is now 50, back to
the Ankang hospital for ``further observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's wife, and others who have met or spoke with Wang, say he
is rational, organized and restrained in his behavior. They believe
he was confined again last week because he had declared his
intention to hold a news conference to describe his experience as
an unwilling psychiatric patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel now is just an indescribable sense of pain and
injustice,'' his wife, Wang Junying, said Monday in an emotional
interview. ``I feel that the government has totally betrayed its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel they had any basis at all for sending him to a
psychiatric hospital,'' said Ms. Wang, 50, who teaches at a local
college and is a Communist Party member. ``He has no family history
of mental illness and he never showed extreme behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was because of his call for justice that they sent him to
the hospital,'' she said, referring to a public letter and banner
Wang carried in Tiananmen Square on June 3, 1992, calling for
redress for the violent crackdown on the student-led demonstrations
there in 1989. Wang's short-lived 1992 protest received
considerable attention in the foreign press, angering government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The use of psychiatric pretexts to imprison dissidents is rare
in China, especially by comparison with the former Soviet Union,
where they were frequently used, corrupting the mental health
profession. But a few other cases are known, said Liu Qing,
president of the New York-based Human Rights in China, which is
starting a new appeal on Wang's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, a labor activist named Wang Miaogen, 46, has been
confined in another psychiatric facility of the Public Security
Bureau since 1993, though his wife insists he is mentally stable,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, himself an exiled dissident, said it was important to
expose such cases so similar methods would not be used against
other political and religious dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling for the United Nations Human Rights Commission
to send doctors to carry out an independent examination of Wang
Wanxing's condition,'' Liu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case throws a spotlight on a secretive system of psychiatric
hospitals around the country that are affiliated with local public
security bureaus and not answerable to the government's mainstream
medical and psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Their main purpose is apparently to care for the criminally
insane. But without accountability even to the health ministry,
which has worked to improve the country's mental health system, let
alone to the public, such facilities can easily be misused by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, there is no evidence of the kind of systematic abuse
through psychiatry that was seen in the former Soviet Union,'' said
Arthur Kleinman, a medical professor and specialist in Chinese
mental health at Harvard University. In the Soviet Union, he noted,
a nonsensical diagnosis of ``sluggish schizophrenia'' was
officially applied to the politically deviant, whereas such phony
diagnoses are not an official part of recent Chinese psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know nothing about the operations of the Public
Security Bureau's psychiatric hospitals,'' Kleinman said. Many
Chinese psychiatrists, he said, believe that the standard of
training inside such hospitals is low.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During Wang's three months at home, Liu of the rights group in
New York spoke with him three times by telephone. He said he found
Wang ``sane, rational and entirely in control of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In one lengthy talk, which Liu taped, Wang said of the democracy
movement, ``I believe it is possible for us to slowly move
forward.'' But he also said, ``I see myself as living under a
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   His schooling disrupted by the turmoil of the 1960s, Wang never
finished high school, and he later worked as a laborer. His family
and acquaintances say he is definitely sane, but he does have a
record of stubbornness when he thinks he is right.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1976, still living in northeastern China where he
had been sent to work during the Cultural Revolution, and where he
met his wife, he was jailed for a month for criticizing Mao. The
following year he was sent to prison for 17 months for his
outspoken support for protests in Beijing in 1976 that took place
in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   After he and his wife moved to Beijing, Wang was active in the
Democracy Wall movement of 1979. A decade later, he aided the
student-led democracy demonstrations that culminated in the
military crackdown of June 4, 1989. Three years after that, his
brief protest in Tiananmen Square on the eve of the anniversary of
that crackdown led to his psychiatric confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang said Monday that when she first tried to check on her
husband after his detention in June 1992, police officers shouted
at her to agree that he was mentally ill, but she refused. What she
did eventually sign, she said, was not a release for his commitment
to a hospital, but rather a transcript of her interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   She had told the police that her husband was intensely
interested in politics and monopolized the family television,
always watching news and public affairs programs. She had once,
jokingly, told her husband, ``Don't watch that stuff all the time,
you're sick,'' she recalls telling the police.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed the record of the interview, she said Monday,
she again insisted that her husband was not mentally ill. Officials
told her that Wang would be sent to a hospital for half a month, a
full month at the most, for evaluation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two months passed, then half a year, I started visiting
different government offices to inquire,'' she said Monday. ``I was
never able to get an answer out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's release in August was accompanied by a series of rules
the couple had to follow, including no contacts with the press. Ms.
Wang said they had carefully followed the conditions, although her
husband did say he planned later on to hold a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The hoped-for hospital discharge papers never came and, last
Tuesday, Wang was taken back to the Ankang hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ms. Wang was still reeling from her husband's renewed
incarceration. ``I've never wanted to bring any trouble to the
government or the party or the country, but now I don't know what
to do,'' she said. ``I no longer feel I can believe them. This is
something that's very difficult to explain to my relatives and my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has an 18-year-old daughter who recently graduated
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the Ankang hospital's monthly visiting day, but Ms.
Wang said she was so distraught that she did not go. ``I just
didn't know what I would say to my husband, or what I would say to
the hospital officials,'' she said. ``They've forced me to make
impossible choices.''

FINKEL IN SOLID POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By virtue of being in charge of Mike Tyson's career, Shelly
Finkel has solidified his position as one of the most powerful
figures in the turbulent world of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lofty plateau he's been hovering around since the 1984
Olympics when he and Main Events formed a partnership and began
signing up such future champions as Evander Holyfield, Pernell
Whitaker, Meldrick Taylor and Mark Breland.
</P>
<P>
   But Finkel's alliance with Tyson just might be the most unlikely
this side of Susan Faludi and Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is a malevolent fellow with an explosive temper who
did a four year stretch for rape, a street-hardened felon with a
lengthy history of anti-social behavior, a junior high school
dropout who long has settled differences with his fists and has a
lengthy rap sheet reflecting his violence.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel is a mild-mannered, articulate graduate of New
York University, a devoted family man of 23 years who has two
daughters and a son, a professorial-looking person with a bald pate
who affects the intellectual persona of a physics teacher rather
than a fight manager and wages his battles with rhetoric rather
than fists.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is the 55-year-old Finkel is now calling the shots
for Tyson, and he will be the one who ultimately decides if Lennox
Lewis realizes his ambition of facing Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they say opposites attract,'' laughs Finkel, who this
Saturday night will be at the Chinook Winds Casino in Lincoln City,
Ore., to watch another one of his fighters, the heralded IBF junior
middleweight champion, Fernando Vargas, defend his title against
Winky Wright in match that will be shown on HBO. ``I've known Mike
since 1982, and always got along with him. When he needed help, he
called me and I was there for him. Mike's obsessed with becoming
the heavyweight champion again.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lennox Lewis is obsessed with Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment it was announced that Lewis was a unanimous
winner over Evander Holyfield and the undisputed world heavyweight
champion, Lewis has been loudly clamoring for a showdown with
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   No financial dummy, Lennox Lewis realizes that Tyson is the only
megabuck gate attraction in the division.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that the public won't be storming the turnstiles to
see him defend his title against one of the alphabets' No.1
challengers the WBA's Henry Akinwande, the WBC's Johnny Ruiz and
the IBF's David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Lewis-Tyson fight is going to happen late next
year,'' says Finkel. ``Tyson called me a couple of times during the
Lewis-Holyfield fight, and kept saying, `I wanna fight Lewis. I
know I can beat him.' But Mike realizes he's going to have to have
a few warmups before he faces someone the caliber of Lewis. After
all, Mike's only fought six rounds in the past three years. He
needs some work.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel says he has a fight lined up for Tyson on Jan.22 in
Europe, but an opponent hasn't yet been found.
</P>
<P>
   There, of course, is no finishing school that prepares you for
the wacky, unpredictable, bizarre, weird orbit of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Don King spent his youth running numbers in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum was a tax attorney in the Bobby Kennedy justice
department.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel?
</P>
<P>
   He spent his younger days operating a Long Island nightclub
called the Action House, and booked into it such groups as The
Doors, Cream, the Little Rascals and Mitch Ryder and the Detroit
Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget one time after an early performance by The
Doors, Jim Morrison came up to me and said, `Look how good I did.
Why don't you buy me a drink?''' relates Finkel. ``I told him,
`Jim, the bar's yours. Have all you want.' I soon found out what a
mistake that was and how much he liked to drink. Jim was totally
drunk for the second performance and fell off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also was managing a band called The Pigeons. I took them
over to Columbia Records, and they told me it was the worst band
they ever heard. I then took them over to Atlantic, and they said
they'd record their song if they'd change their name. Well, they
changed it to Vanilla Fudge and their song, `You Keep Me Hanging
On' went gold in four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel soon became one of the biggest promoters in rock
music, working with Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, The Who and many
others before staging the legendary Watkins Glen, N.Y., concert in
July of 1973 in which more than 600,000 fans showed up to observe
the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and The Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was even bigger than Woodstock,'' says Finkel. ``Only four
hundred thousand attended Woodstock. Unfortunately, there is no
film footage of Watkins Glen like Woodstock because the Grateful
Dead wouldn't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel over the years has done concerts with the Rolling Stones,
Elton John, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Bruce Springsteen, Led
Zepplin, the Eagles, Van Halen, the Beach Boys, Crosby, Stills &AMP;
Nash, Fleetwood Mac, U2, and countless other high-profile acts.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1977 a neighborhood boy lost his father, and Finkel and
his wife began taking the youngster to the movies and to Central
Park and to amateur fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started following the career of a young amateur named Alex
Ramos,'' says Finkel. ``I started to go to more and more fights,
got to know people like Lou Duva, and before you knew it I was
involved in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   It would become a full-time vocation after he and the Duvas'
Main Events consummated their L.A. Olympic coup that also included
the signing of Tyrell Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tyson and Vargas, Finkel is now supervising the
IBF's No. 1 ranked junior welterweight, Zab Judah, the talented
welterweight Vernon Forrest and David Tua, who scored a 20-second
knockout over Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Mike Tyson who has vaulted Shelly Finkel into the
glaring spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't know about Mike Tyson is that he's a true
historian of boxing and understands the sport fully,'' says Finkel.
``All he keeps telling me is, `Lennox Lewis is a good fight for
me.' And it will happen.''

LOUISIANA GRAND JURY INDICTS FORMER HOUSTON MAYOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz was indicted Monday on
federal charges that he made $2 million in payoffs to a
``high-level public official in Louisiana'' in an effort to win
public contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana rancher Cecil Brown and Texas businessman Guy Thompson
were also named in the nine-count indictment returned by a grand
jury in Baton Rouge, La. _ part of the broad-ranging probe of
alleged corruption in former Gov. Edwin Edwards' administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz would not comment Monday, but he had said Sunday he had
been informed of his indictment and that the allegations are untrue
and stem from the government's decades-long attempt to convict
Edwards of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter would not be happening if not for the U.S.
attorney's interest in Edwin Edwards,'' Hofheinz said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was acquitted twice on federal racketeering charges
during the 1980s. When he retired from politics in 1996, he
estimated he had been before 22 grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz and Brown are each charged with conspiring to
``corruptly influence'' a public official and three counts of
interstate travel to aid an unlawful activity.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was also charged with four counts of extortion and Thomson
with being an accessory in interstate travel to aid an unlawful
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from three business ventures in which Hofheinz
was the principal partner in companies vying for contracts in
Louisiana. Those ventures were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Viewpoint Development Corp.'s plan to develop a juvenile
detention facility in Jena, La.
</P>
<P>
   _ A plan by Top Rank Inc. to lease an arena and bring a
professional basketball team to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   _ A plan by Bayshore Environmental Inc. to obtain municipal
waste disposal contracts for a Texas company called Evergreen
Global Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Although Edwards, already facing charges in two cases resulting
from the investigation, was not named in Monday's indictment, U.S.
Attorney Eddie Jordan of New Orleans said he believes that the
former governor was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He profited in the sense that he received the money, we
believe,'' Jordan told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Brown, a longtime friend of Edwards,
extorted money from Hofheinz for payment to ``a high-level public
official.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allegedly used his company, Lousiana Consultants, to
receive bribe money meant for the official. Brown even threatened
Hofheinz, telling him the official could call members of the
Legislature to stop funding for certain projects even after leaving
office, prosecutors allege.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the activities detailed in the indictment relate to the
contract to build the juvenile detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy count alleges Hofheinz made payoffs to Brown from
1993 through April 1997, giving him $245,000 in cash in September
1993 from Viewpoint Development. That money was meant to pave the
way for Viewpoint's participation in developing the $35 million
detention facility, prosecutors allege.
</P>
<P>
   Although Viewpoint ultimately signed an agreement with the
Louisiana Department of Corrections to build the facility, it could
not come up with the money to finance the deal and eventually sold
its rights to the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges Top Rank and Viewpoint gave Brown
four checks totaling $599,000 in June 1994 _ also as part of the
conspiracy. However, prosecutors said Brown returned $400,000 by
cash and wire transfers the following month because Top Rank was
having difficulty in its bid to move the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA
basketball team to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In the bribery counts, Hofheinz allegedly gave $600,000 to Brown
on behalf of Top Rank in December 1994; $100,000 in checks in April
and May 1995 in behalf of Bayshore and signed a ``lobbying
contract'' with Louisiana Consultants, agreeing to pay a $1.3
million fee when funding was secured.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz, who served as Houston mayor from 1974-77 and still
resides here, has said that he and others became involved in
several business ventures at the behest of brothers Michael and
Patrick Graham, whom he believed to be legitimate businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz said he later learned the two were convicted felons who
had cheated a number of people out of money, and that he _ and the
FBI _ are victims of an elaborate con.
</P>
<P>
   The Grahams are the chief witnesses against Hofheinz, according
to court documents filed in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wholly and totally unreliable,'' Hofheinz attorney
Michael Ramsey said Monday. ``They have been found to be forgers,
guilty of theft, tax evasion, civil fraud and falsification of
documents. I was informed today that they _ at least Patrick _ are
on the government's payroll. If I pay a witness, it's called
bribery. If the government pays a witness, it's called justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz and Brown could get five years in prison on the
conspiracy count and on each of the three bribery counts.
</P>
<P>
   Brown could get 20 years in prison on each of his four extortion
counts, Thompson 2 1/2 years in prison on his accessory to bribery
count.

ANDERSON MUST FACE INFLAMMATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Clippers history reminds us the alphabet is
responsible for such franchise terrors as A-C-L (anterior cruciate
ligament) damage and B-S (bad shooting) sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be trifled with is S-T-E-R-L-I-N-G, which spells doom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Clip letter bomb is a new one on us ... F-M-I. It stands
for Facial Muscle Inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   The victim is shooting guard Derek Anderson, whose status for
tonight's game with the Phoenix Suns at Staples Center is listed as
an emphatic ``day to day.'' According to trainer Jasen Powell,
Anderson's response to a medication change will determine his
availability.
</P>
<P>
   What previously was believed to be a lingering sinus infection
seemingly matured into great discomfort for Anderson during
Saturday's loss to Portland. After scoring 52 points in his first
two games back from a concussion-related three-game absence,
Anderson was limited to 29 minutes and 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   He's missed the last two days of practice and regardless of how
he handles the new meds figures to be far below peak efficiency if
his condition improves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't assume anything until I get the report back from the
doctor,'' said Clippers coach Chris Ford, who has been forced to
wear out that sentiment in the last two weeks. Eric Piatkowski
figures to start at shooting guard, with Tyrone Nesby pulling on
the leash as sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   The good karma is represented by Maurice Taylor, who appears to
be playing without pain after missing two weeks with a foot sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to play ... mentally,'' Ford said. ``We'll see how
he is after a couple of trips up and down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor will march back into the starting lineup, with Brian
Skinner who was heroic in Taylor's absence going back to his role
of low-post sub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get Brian back to his comfort zone,'' Ford said
of the power forward/center who had just 4 points and 7 rebounds
combined in two weekend losses after posting a string of
double-doubles on the road. ``He had been playing a lot of minutes;
I think it affected him over the last two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, bad numbers: The good number is 11 _ that's how many
Clippers suited up for Monday's practice at Veterans Park
SportsComplex in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two days in a row we've had enough guys to scrimmage,''
said Ford, whose team hadn't been in that predicament for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day streak includes participation from point guard Eric
Murdock; the crafty veteran did provide a few swell moments on the
team's five-game road swing, but chronic knee pain has limited his
contributions since.
</P>
<P>
   The bad number is 32.9, the team's field-goal percentage in
Saturday's loss to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   After all the strategic dress rehearsals, medical reports and
psychological Ping-Pong is examined, Ford believes the scoreboard
dilemma can be traced to marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to shoot the ball much better,'' he said. ``You
can't shoot 41 percent and win a lot of games. Our defense, at
times, hasn't been that bad, but we're not nearly good enough
defensively to get by with the way we've been shooting.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Janet Reno declined to block the
release Monday night of an Egyptian man who had been held for three
and a half years in a New York jail on secret evidence that the FBI
had said linked him to terrorists in the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   With the attorney general not intervening in the case of Nasser
Ahmed, Ahmed was allowed to leave the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in lower Manhattan Monday night, and was met by his wife,
Salwa Elbayadi, and their three children. In a brief statement,
Ahmed thanked his lawyers for his freedom and lashed out at his
accusers in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liars, and they know they are liars,'' Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision came 10 days after the INS commissioner, Doris
Meissner, took the unusual step of citing ``national security
implications'' as a basis for asking Reno to order that Ahmed not
be released on bond while his case was reviewed by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service, based on classified evidence, had been
seeking to deport Ahmed, who is seeking political asylum. Ahmed,
39, had worked as a legal assistant to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the
blind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring to blow up the World
Trade Center and other New York landmarks. Although Ahmed has
admitted to being an admirer of Abdel Rahman, he has denied any
involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ahmed's lawyers, David Cole, said Monday night that with
Reno's decision, he is now ``very optimistic'' that Ahmed will be
granted political asylum, which he has been seeking for more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the attorney general rejected the immigration
service's argument that he is a threat to national security should
dispose of this case,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had said she would decide whether to intervene in the case
by 5 p.m. Monday, and with no action by her as the deadline neared,
the INS said that ``upon further review'' it was withdrawing its
request that Ahmed continue to be held.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ahmed's case is not yet over _ he remains free on bond
pending a final ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals on
whether he should be granted asylum _ Reno's decision not to
intervene is likely to be seen as another major blow to the use of
secret evidence by the INS in deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has the authority to review and overturn
decisions of the immigration courts, which are part of the Justice
Department. Last summer, an immigration judge, after reviewing the
government's classified evidence against Ahmed, concluded that it
was weak, that he was not a threat to national security, and
ordered that he be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The INS then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which
recently ordered Ahmed released on bond pending its review of his
case. It was that decision to free Ahmed that the INS then appealed
to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant, a
federal district judge in New Jersey ruled, for the first time in
the United States, that it was unconstitutional for the government
to detain an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence. Shortly
thereafter, the INS dropped its efforts to hold Hany Kiareldeen,
who had also been accused of terrorism and had been held for 19
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno nor Meissner would respond to questions through
spokesmen about the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed's lawyers and others who have sharply criticized the
practice of using secret evidence as a violation of due process,
said they hoped that the decision indicated a rethinking of the
practice at the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that he's released,'' said Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., who has introduced legislation to ban the use of
classified evidence in deportation proceedings, ``but we still have
about 20 others who are being held, and it's a travesty of justice
that this continues in our country without people having the right
to face their accusers.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of Ahmed was also hailed by Arab-American groups
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council in Washington, said: ``Three and a half years is a long
time to wait. Should we celebrate tonight, or should we decry the
fact that in America, a man was behind bars for so many years on
the basis of secret evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Abuzaakouk charged that secret evidence was unreliable, unjust
and unconstitutional, and added: ``The only thing that keeps secret
evidence alive is the politics of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who was taken into custody in April 1996, had been held
longer than any others who have been detained on classified
evidence. Some, like Ahmed, have been held for long periods in
solitary confinement.

CLINTON SIGNS FINAL BUDGET BILL AND TURNS TO NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly two months after the start of the
government's fiscal year, President Clinton signed the last piece
of the federal budget into law Monday, saying the agreement that he
worked out with the Republican-led Congress had been worth the
weeks of tortured negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a budget for a government that lives within its means
and lives up to the values of the American people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he was signing the bill, which covers $390 billion
of spending on education, law enforcement, foreign aid, health care
and the environment, the president was turning his attention to
next year's budget and the continued political battle over
apportioning projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held his first meeting with his aides on the
administration's spending and tax proposals for next year, and he
used Monday's bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden to set out
an agenda for his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we celebrate what we've accomplished, I ask us all to be
humble and mindful of what we still have to accomplish,'' Clinton
said as he offered a list of initiatives, including giving patients
more protection in dealing with managed care companies, putting new
restrictions on gun sales, bolstering Social Security's financial
strength and adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much progress Clinton and Congress will make
on those and other issues in an election year. The budget fight in
particular seems likely to be as hard fought as it was this year,
with Republicans in Congress vowing Monday to pass another big tax
cut over Clinton's objections and Republican presidential
candidates proposing tax-cutting plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner in the race for
the Republican presidential nomination, is expected to lay out his
plan this week to reduce income tax rates, provide tax breaks for
the working poor and some married couples, and phase out the
inheritance tax. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut
passed this summer by the Republicans, saying it would endanger the
nation's newfound fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore attacked Bush's approach Monday, and also
criticized a plan by his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, to devote a big chunk of the
surplus to making health care more accessible. Both plans, Gore
said, would risk plunging the government back into deficit and do
nothing to address the long-term problems facing Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, the economic future of the country is put at
risk because of higher interest rates and ignoring the lessons of
the last seven years,'' he said in a conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   If there is hope for a compromise that gives both sides some of
what they want despite election-year politics, it stems from the
possibility that the projected budget surpluses will grow as the
economy roars along and tax revenues flow into the Treasury. ``I
expect the surplus projections to be up significantly,'' Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
said as he left the White House ceremony. ``We will be back next
year with another major tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides emerged from the standoff over this year's $1.8
trillion budget with enough of what they wanted to claim victory.
Domenici said Republicans had achieved their main goal of limiting
spending sufficiently to avoid dipping into the portion of the
surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll taxes, an
assertion that may or may not prove true depending on how fast the
surplus grows this year.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the legislation signed Monday, which rolled
together five spending bills that had proven particularly difficult
to pass, contained money for most of the programs he had said were
his priorities. Surrounded by police officers and teachers, Clinton
said the budget would help reach his goal of hiring 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades and would help
communities hire another 50,000 police officers in neighborhoods
with high crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires federal agencies to trim their
spending by 0.38 percent this year, a total of $1.2 billion. And it
contains myriad provisions for special interests and narrow issues,
including one authorizing but not requiring the president to
provide food aid to rebels fighting the government in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   As they start planning for next year, Congress and the
administration are in something of a hole. To avoid spending any of
the Social Security surplus, their self-imposed standard for fiscal
discipline, the two parties agreed on a number of budget gimmicks,
including deferring more than $20 billion that would otherwise have
been spent this year onto the next fiscal year's books.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they have that much less room to propose new
spending or tax cuts for next year, having already allocated more
than half of the $38 billion non-Social Security surplus projected
for next year by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus projections themselves are in flux. Both the budget
office and the White House have so far based their forecasts on the
assumption that spending would remain within tight caps required by
the 1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the two parties have shattered the caps for two years in a
row _ by about $30 billion this year _ and future surpluses could
be substantially smaller than projected if spending continues to
grow faster than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy remains strong, however, the surplus for this
year and next could be revised upward. And because government
economists are increasingly convinced that the economy's growth
potential is higher than they previously believed, they are
considering increasing their economic growth estimates for the next
decade, a step that would generate a corresponding increase in
estimated tax revenues and therefore in the size of the surplus.  &QL;

200 REPORTED BURIED IN MASS GRAVES NEAR U.S.-MEXICO BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexican authorities, working with a team from the FBI, began on
Monday to excavate sites near the U.S. border that they believe may
hold the bodies of scores of Mexicans and Americans killed over the
last several years as a part of a campaign by drug traffickers
seeking to eliminate their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies, an American law enforcement official
said, was spurred by a tip from an informant recruited by the FBI
who acknowledged complicity in several murders and identified the
locations of at least two mass graves on the outskirts of Ciudad
Juarez, the Mexican city just over the border from El Paso, Texas.
The informant, who officials said has passed a polygraph, or lie
detector exam, said as many as 200 people may be buried in several
graves.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the digging began Monday and that, as
yet, no complete human remains had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, prosecutions of Mexican drug traffickers along
the Texas border have been hindered by the disappearance of
witnesses and informants, some of whom have been kidnapped from
American soil. Dozens of people have disappeared from the Juarez
area without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   According to American officials, some of these people had been
informants for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Others had no apparent connection to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican attorney general's office, the country's chief
federal law enforcement arm, issued a statement Monday confirming
the search for bodies, which was first reported Monday night by CBS
News.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation is focused on resolving a series of
assassinations and disappearances related to drug trafficking,
perpetrated against Mexican and United States citizens, apparently
by members of the so-called cartel,'' the statement said. ``Over
the last four years and possibly longer, in Ciudad Juarez,
Chihuahua, citizens of both nationalties have disappeared without a
trace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities said they have set up toll-free telephone
lines in both countries for relatives and others with information
on missing people.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by citizens groups in Juarez and other parts of
Chihuahua state, the Mexican authorities carried out a lengthy
inquiry into the disappearances, but had little success.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,
acknowledged that drug traffickers had infiltrated a police agent
into the special unit which was investigating the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The informer who described the killings to the FBI said some
were carried out by Mexican federal policemen who working as hired
assassins for the drug gangs that operate from Juarez, one of the
main gateways for cocaine and other drugs being shipped north
through Mexico into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that a team of FBI specialists is
waiting in El Paso to receive and examine any bodies recovered in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they have been working closely with Madrazo,
who is a former human rights lawyer. Officials said the FBI began
quietly examining the case several months ago. The Mexicans were
informed about three weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they have established a joint base for
the inquiry in El Paso.

CABINET MEMBERS NAMED FOR NEW NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Leaders from pro-British Protestant and pro-Irish
Catholic parties took a major step Monday night in moving their
age-old conflict into the political arena, naming the members of
the cabinet that will run the new power-sharing Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The action in the Stormont parliament chamber in Belfast, held
off for many months while negotiators labored to break a deadlock
over guerrilla disarmament, puts Sinn Fein into the government of
the British province, which Sinn Fein's paramilitary wing, the
Irish Republican Army, fought a decades-long war to abolish.
   ``Whatever you think about their past, they are people now
committed to politics, not to violence,'' Peter Mandelson,
Britain's Secretary for Northern Ireland, said of the Sinn Fein
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The new ministers, chosen in keeping with the strength shown by
their parties in the June 1998 election of the assembly's 108
members, reflected the Protestant-Catholic division of authority
that is the hallmark of the new government. The voting rules for
the assembly require the support of both Protestant and Catholic
communities for decisions to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the enormity of the challenge facing the North's
politicians in converting their angry disputes into civil ones and
cohabiting the same political institutions was the naming of Martin
McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and a past IRA commander,
to the same cabinet that includes Nigel Dodds, a member of the
hardline Democratic Unionist Party who was the target of an IRA
assassination attack three years ago in the corridors of a Belfast
hospital where he had gone to visit his sick son.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds and the deputy leader of his party, Peter Robinson, who
also gained a cabinet seat, are opponents of the April 1998 peace
agreement that created the legislature. In accepting their posts
Monday night, they vowed ``every ounce of our power and influence
to frustrate and thwart Northern Ireland being pulled into a united
Ireland.'' Unionists favor keeping Ulster British while republicans
and nationalists want to see it eventually incorporated into the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., the son of the leader of the Democratic
Unionist party and a member of the assembly, said, ``We will not be
sharing power and making collective decisions or indeed, coming to
a collective policy with gunmen or their representatives who will
be in this government.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, the preacher-politician who is a lifelong foe of
sharing power with Catholics, delayed proceedings for nearly three
hours with a series of motions, objections and adjournment
recommendations aimed at excluding Sinn Fein from the body and at
denying Seamus Mallon of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party the right to take up his position as deputy to the
legislature's first minister, David Trimble of the Protestant
Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon had resigned that position in anger last July when the
Ulster Unionists torpedoed an earlier attempt at naming the
ministers to the assembly. An 11-week rescue mission by former U.S.
Sen. George Mitchell succeeded in ending the stalemate standing in
the way of Monday's action and persuading Mallon to rescind his
resignation. The assembly Monday night turned aside Paisley's
blocking motion by a 71-28 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was understated for such an important event in the
troubled history of Northern Ireland. Most of the exchanges were
about procedural matters, phrased in the formal language of
legislative rules. The members of Paisley's party threw out
combative asides, and there was hissing from the public balcony at
the mention of the Sinn Fein nominations, prompting Lord Alderdice,
the presiding officer, to threaten to clear the gallery. The Sinn
Fein speakers all introduced their comments with words of greeting
in Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's development followed a vote by the Ulster Unionist
party on Saturday to abandon its insistence on IRA disarmament
before entering government with Sinn Fein. Trimble secured the
support of 58 percent of the party's ruling council by promising to
reconvene in February to test the Sinn Fein commitment to
nonviolence by seeing if there had been adequate turnover of IRA
weapons by then. If not, he said, he and his colleagues in the
assembly leadership would resign their positions, thereby bringing
the legislature to an end.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness complained that the added condition departed from the
Mitchell review's conclusion that disarmament must be voluntary. He
argued that the new pressure tactic and the implied deadline would
make the job of getting the IRA to abandon its arms more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The new cabinet draws its occupants from four parties.
</P>
<P>
   In two days the British parliament is to pass legislation
transferring home rule authority from London to Belfast. Thursday
sees the first meeting of the fully empowered Northern Ireland
Assembly. On that same day, an IRA official will be appointed as a
representative to the commission charged with disarming Northern
Ireland's paramilitary forces by next May.

NO MORE GIVEAWAY COMPUTERS AS FREE-PC'STO BE BOUGHT BY E-MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it turns out, there is no such thing as a free PC.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC.Com, one of the most audacious experiments in
advertising, said Monday it would no longer give away free
computers and Internet access. Rather it has agreed to be acquired
by eMachines, a maker of low-cost personal computers that intends
to use Free-PC's software to put advertising on the screens of its
computers and to collect data about what users do.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC's original business plan was to give away computers in
exchange for being allowed to target on-screen ads to its users and
to gather data about users' Internet surfing and PC usage habits.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Both Free-PC and eMachines
are private, although eMachines has filed for a public offering
that it hopes to complete early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The sale reflects a sharp turn around for Bill Gross, the
chairman of IdeaLab, a Pasadena, Calif., company that has launched
dozens of Internet start-ups, including eToys, Goto.Com and
Ticketmaster-Citysearch, as well as Free-PC.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, a peripatetic entrepreneur, once boasted that Free-PC
would someday be bigger than Microsoft, according to people he had
tried to recruit as investors. His idea was to turn the computer
from an appliance into an advertising-sponsored medium, much like
network television.
</P>
<P>
   To get a computer from Free-PC, users were to fill out a
detailed financial and demographic survey. Then strips on two sides
of the screen were always filled with advertising. And everything
they did with the computer, including which Internet sites they
used, would be monitored so that advertisers could target ads.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Free-PC needed to take in $30 a month per
user in advertising to cover the cost of providing the computer and
Internet access. That is a high hurdle, particularly with such a
small base of users. More than a million people applied to get the
free PCs, but as of Monday the company had delivered only 30,000
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said that he had not been looking to sell the company, but
that when eMachines approached him he decided that selling would be
more lucrative than a business model that was developing slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that to get the business model to work we needed
at least one million users,'' he said. ``We were scaling as fast as
we could, but at 10,000 a quarter, we couldn't get to one million
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since it sold its first computer, eMachines has
become one of the largest PC makers in the country by focusing on
machines in the $400 to $800 price range. Since several Internet
service providers are now offering $400 rebates for people who
commit to three-year contracts, its lowest-cost models appear to be
free. Of course, the user then must typically pay $22 a month for
Internet service. Free PC's Internet service was also free.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Dukker, the founder and chief executive of eMachines,
said the company had no interest in giving away computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business model has caused people like Packard Bell and IBM
to throw in the towel,'' he said, alluding to recent decisions by
those companies to pull out of the low-end PC market.
</P>
<P>
   In October, eMachines was the No. 3 computer maker, after Compaq
Computer and Hewlett-Packard, with 12.4 percent of the market,
according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, eMachines figured that the market for computers
would come to resemble wireless telephones, where the phone is
typically given away and subsidized by the monthly fees. But in
recent months, it shifted its strategy to focus more on
opportunities to use computers as an advertising medium. Already,
it charges advertisers to put icons on the computer desktop or even
buttons on the keyboard that link to a certain Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eMachines will use the Free-PC software to place
advertising on users' screens as well.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising will take up less screen space than it does the
Free-PC computers, and unlike with Free-PC, users will have the
option to not see the advertising. However, eMachines hopes that
they will keep the ads in place, however, by linking them to a
``tool bar'' with buttons that will make it easy for new users to
navigate the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This software, moreover, will send data about the computer users
back to eMachines to use for advertising selection. The company
declined to say what data would be collected but said that at first
it would be less than Free-PC had gathered. Ultimately, however,
the company says it hopes to persuade at least some of its users to
allow their activities to be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even if the user does not agree to have any data
collected or any advertising on the screen, eMachines will still be
able to profit. Whenever the user connects to the Internet, its
software will still be able to place new advertising icons on the
desktop or to change the advertiser linked to each keyboard button.
</P>
<P>
   The company is largely controlled by two Korean electronics
makers, the TriGem Corp. and Korea Data Systems. In the first half
of the year, it lost $3.9 million on sales of $351 million. &QL;

CAMPAIGNS ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle among advertisers for eyeballs is not
limited to the Internet. There is still warfare being waged street
by street as more marketers _ including dozens of dot-coms _ turn
to outdoor advertising to increase awareness of their products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of the outdoor medium, particularly in
urban centers where consumers are concentrated, is underscored by
two ad blitzes scheduled to begin Wednesday. One is for
Powerstreet, the new brand for the online brokerage services of
Fidelity Investments, and the other is for Moe Ginsburg, the
venerable apparel retailer. Both are spending extensively in the
next four to eight weeks to blanket cityscapes from subway
platforms to telephone kiosks to bus shelters with pitches meant
for mass consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, the goal is to cut through the clamorous
clutter that bewitches, bothers and bewilders passers-by on crowded
streets. But those who recall the Yogi Berra-ism about nobody going
to a popular restaurant anymore because it's too crowded may wonder
whether nobody will see the signs because there are so many of
them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree that it's getting a little cluttered,'' said
Steve Cone, president for corporate and retail marketing at
Fidelity in Boston. ``On the other hand, I've never seen Times
Square busier, and Broadway is rocking and rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We created Powerstreet to remind people that we are a major
player in the online brokerage business,'' he added, and the
``broad reach'' that outdoor ads provide ``is a critical part of an
integrated media plan.'' His reference was to the television, radio
and print campaign for Powerstreet _ formally known as Powerstreet
Online Trading at Fidelity.com _ that continues as the outdoor
advertising arrives in Boston, New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the wallpaper effect,'' said Rob Hofferman,
vice president and account director at Korey Kay &AMP; Partners in New
York, the Ginsburg agency. ``You want something that could generate
not only visibility but also impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Korey Kay has arranged with Outdoor Systems, which sells ad
space for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to replace all
the signs on the uptown and downtown sides of the N and R subway
station at 23rd Street and Broadway in Manhattan with Ginsburg
displays.
</P>
<P>
   The ``brand station,'' as it is called, is intended to
complement the ``brand trains'' sold by Outdoor Systems, limiting
ads in subway cars to one or two advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clutter is an issue,'' said Sheri Baron, president of Gotham
Inc. in New York, the Powerstreet agency, ``but what this is about
is presence and dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In locations where people are out and about,'' she added,
``there's no better way to own `share of mind' than this use of
outdoor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotham, part of the Interpublic Group of Cos., plans to
virtually cover the five boroughs of New York by peddling
Powerstreet with pithy posters on 6,000 displays owned by TDI
Worldwide. The signs are to be posted on buses, phone kiosks,
commuter rail stations and walls. They will carry headlines like
``Ask New Yorkers for personal info, and they'll tell you where to
go'' and ``New Yorkers take everything personally. Why not online
trading?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's New York bravado,'' Don Allman, president at TDI, said,
laughing, ``New York as the center of the universe.'' There will be
similar displays, though not Big Apple-centric, on TDI ad space in
Boston and at the Embarcadero station of Bay Area Rapid Transit in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The New York portion of the campaign is ``the largest
concentration in one market we've ever done,'' said Allman, whose
company is the outdoor advertising unit of Infinity Broadcasting,
majority owned by the CBS Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree it's akin to a television roadblock,'' he
added, using the term for a commercial that runs at the same time
on numerous networks or stations so viewers perceive it to be
inescapable. ``In a word, it's going to be awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's also going to be, in three words, ``the most
expensive'' campaign TDI has ever sold to a single advertiser in a
single market, Allman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is estimated to be paying $2.5 million for ad space
valued at about $5.5 million. The discount is part of a deal
Fidelity signed under a program named CBS Plus that packages
sponsorships among CBS media outlets. The total budget for the
Powerstreet introduction is estimated at $50 million to $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the brand station was estimated at $20,000 by
Harve Ganz, manager for New York transit at Outdoor Systems, which
is coincidentally being acquired by Infinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, people have asked about buying a whole
station, so this is an experiment,'' Ganz said. ``The brand train
was slow to take off, but once people started seeing it, it caught
fire.'' Brand train advertisers include the Bronx Zoo, Kenneth
Cole, New York University, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Seagram. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Ginsburg station, which a half million people are
estimated to use each month, ``it would be a lot cheaper and easier
to run the same ad or two over and over,'' Hofferman said. ``But to
keep people involved and engaged, we're going to run every ad we've
done'' since landing the account in September.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to 12 to 14 ads, which carry cheeky headlines like
``You didn't spend two years at Wharton to get noticed for the
latest trend in pleats'' (for the retailer's traditionally styled
suits) and ``You're too sexy for glen plaid, too sexy for two
buttons, too sexy to blend in'' (for designer suits).
</P>
<P>
   Consumers concerned about ad clutter outdoors may want to hide
indoors for the next month, especially if they traverse Times
Square. To capitalize on the throngs expected to celebrate the
arrival of 2000, gathering in front of sites including 1 Times
Square and 2 Times Square _ where ad space is sold by Sherwood
Outdoor _ marketers are rushing to affix additional signs to
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers to Times Square are De Beers, JVC and the
World Wrestling Federation. &QL;

REGINA SLATKIN, A SPECIALIST IN ART, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regina Shoolman Slatkin, a dealer in old master
drawings and a writer and specialist on the 18th-century French
painter Francois Boucher, died Nov. 25 at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in Manhattan. She was 92 and had homes in Manhattan, Essex,
N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Born in what was Austria-Hungary and reared in Quebec, Mrs.
Slatkin graduated from McGill University. She went to Paris on a
French government fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts, and became interested in French art. She also
studied at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to Canada she worked as a journalist on The
Montreal Star and for the Jewish Welfare Board. She also published
poetry and collaborated with the ethnologist Marius Barbeau on a
government-sponsored project, later made into a book, to collect
and translate the folk songs of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 she married Charles E. Slatkin, a New York
schoolteacher, and moved to Manhattan. Slatkin worked as a liaison
between the public schools and the city museums from an office at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Slatkin worked as an editor
and for several years as executive director of the Iranian
Institute of Art and Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the couple opened a gallery in their apartment on East
92nd Street that specialized in old master drawings and
Impressionist painting and sculpture. Their exhibitions were often
accompanied by scholarly publications, like the 1962 show of
Rodin's sculptures and watercolors whose catalog included essays by
Leo Steinberg and Albert Elsen.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Slatkin, who published numerous articles on Boucher in
Burlington magazine and other journals, was instrumental in
organizing the National Gallery of Art's 1974 exhibition of Boucher
drawings, the first major show of its kind in North America, for
which she wrote the catalog introduction and entries. With her
husband she wrote ``The Enjoyment of Art in America'' (1947) and
``Six Centuries of French Master Drawings in America'' (1950). Her
last article, ``A Note on a Boucher Drawing,'' was written and
published in Master Drawings magazine in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death in 1977 Mrs. Slatkin became interested
in the decorative arts, building a collection of early-American
glass that she donated to the State University of New York at
Plattsburgh. She also donated 19th- and 20th-century prints.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Slatkin is survived by two daughters, Carole Slatkin of
Plattsburgh and Laura Slatkin of Chicago.

DOW OFF 40.99 ON WORRIES ABOUT FAST PACE OF ECONOMY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Worries that the economy is showing few signs of
slowing despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve swept through
the bond market Monday, pushing interest rates sharply higher.
Stock prices, which have been on a torrid run, fell in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Important reports on the economy are expected later this week,
including November employment data on Friday. But as bond traders
returned to work after the Thanksgiving weekend Monday, anecdotal
evidence of a strong start to the Christmas shopping season was a
fresh source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the early reports on Christmas have been gangbusters,''
said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset
Management. ``There is scant information the economy is slowing
down, and the bond market is getting really nervous about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling began in the morning and continued throughout the
session. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond had fallen 31/32, to 97 19/32. The bond's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.30
percent, from 6.23 percent on Friday. It was the worst one-day
performance for the bond market in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Led by interest-rate sensitive financial service issues, stock
prices moved lower. Technology shares, which have jumped sharply
this month, moved higher early in the session, but faltered later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the market has been dominated by technology, and
people are willing now to lock in some gains and get defensive
going in to Y2K,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``The unfriendly bond
market gave an excuse for investors to take profits.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 40.99
points, or 0.37 percent, to 10,947.92. American Express, General
Electric and J.P. Morgan were big contributors to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader averages, the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks fell 8.79 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,407.83. The Nasdaq
composite index dropped 26.44 points, or 0.77 percent, to 3,421.37.
Nextel, Qualcomm and Intuit were among the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Small company stocks also fared poorly. The Russell 2000 index
slipped 1.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 456.95.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Turner, chairman and chief investment officer at
Turner Investment Partners Inc. with $4 billion under management,
said the slight decline in technology shares could prove
transitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit Suisse First Boston is sponsoring a technology
conference this week, and I have to believe that many of these
stocks will benefit from that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pretty optimistic about tech stocks from here on out. For
the most part, fourth quarter earnings, which we won't see for
another 45 days or so, are going to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, General Electric, whose GE Capital
subsidiary is the largest nonbank finance company, fell 2{, to
133[. American Express fell 4 13/16 to 147 13/16. J.P. Morgan
dropped 2 1/16 to 131{. Bank of America, a component of the S&AMP;P
500, fell 3 9/16, to 56 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among technology stocks, Intel fell 2 13/16, to 78 11/16 after
Advanced Micro Devices, its biggest rival in the microprocessor
market, announced a new chip that it contends is faster than
Intel's most advanced design. Shares of Advanced Micro gained 1
9/16, to 29\.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took profits in Qualcomm. The stock fell 13 13/16, to
371 3/16. Since Nov. 17, Qualcomm stock had risen 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, another good performer recently, fell 2~, to 80
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel dropped 3, to 90. Intuit shed 7 3/16, to 52 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were among the day's winners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, a Dow component, gained 1~, to 105 5/16.
Pfizer was up 1 7/16, to 37 7/16. Eli Lilly gained 3 1/16, to 75].
Warner-Lambert rose 2], to 91].
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T gained 2 7/16 to 59~, after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst
raised his rating on the telephone company to ``buy'' from
``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports about strong holiday sales helped retailers.
</P>

JUDGE DISMISSES LIBEL SUIT BY FORMER MEDICAL EXAMINER AGAINST THE
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.J., Ind., Ohio)  (Eds: Elliot - with one `t' - is cq for Gross, and Elliott is cq
for Wilk. ) 
(ms) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A State Supreme Court judge has dismissed a
longstanding libel suit against The New York Times by Dr. Elliot M.
Gross, a former New York City chief medical examiner, who said he
was defamed in a series of articles in 1985 and 1986 that quoted
pathologists and others who accused him of inaccurate or misleading
autopsy reports.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Elliott Wilk, in a pretrial ruling, did not address
Gross' conduct or competence but held that he had failed to show
that the Times and the reporter who wrote many of the articles,
Philip Shenon, had acted with ``actual malice'' or ``a reckless
disregard for the truth,'' a high standard of proof required of
public officials in defamation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The justice noted that Shenon had interviewed more than 250
people and had ``sought out sources who were friendly with or
neutral toward plaintiff.'' And in four interviews with Shenon
before publication of the articles, the justice said, Gross
``declined to speak about most of the allegations'' and did not
challenge sources he later accused of bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record does not support plaintiff's thesis that Shenon or
any other Times defendant published any of the statements at issue
with knowledge of their falsity or serious doubts as to their
truth,'' Wilk declared in a ruling dated Nov. 18 and made public
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tortuous, 14-year history of motions, dismissals, a
reinstatement and numerous appeals, the case has never gone to
trial, moving from the state's lowest court to its highest and back
again. And the latest ruling by Wilk, who originally dismissed the
case in 1991 on different ground, did not appear likely to end the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we will appeal _ there is no question,'' Leon Segan,
Gross' lawyer, said Monday. ``We have a good case. We felt we had a
good case from its inception. My client went through all kinds of
torment because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, as Gross has all along, that the Times articles
were factually biased and based on interviews with sources who were
biased.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, 65, who was dismissed as the city's medical examiner by
Mayor Ed Koch in 1987, later became a pathologist in Indiana and
Ohio, and is now the coroner for Cape May and Cumberland Counties
in New Jersey. He said in a telephone interview that he was
``obviously disappointed'' by Wilk's ruling but declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, assistant general counsel for The New York Times
Co., hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did Justice Wilk find, as was clear, that there was
no actual malice, but just as importantly he recognized Phil
Shenon's diligent and fair journalism in the reporting of the
articles,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The articles quoted pathologists, colleagues of Gross and others
who accused him of inaccurate or misleading forensic reports in
several high-profile cases of people who died in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Gross denied the allegations, and four investigations _ by the
state Board of Regents, the state Board of Professional Medical
Conduct, a mayoral panel and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan _ found
no professional misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 lawsuit, Gross contended that a series of Times
articles defamed him and were based on false information from
one-sided sources and published with reckless disregard for the
truth. That is the higher standard of proof prominent people in
libel cases must meet, a test which gives the media greater leeway
in reporting on governmental activities; ordinary citizens need
only prove that defamatory statements are false and were
negligently published.
</P>
<P>
   The Times argued that the articles reported expressions of
opinion about the conduct of a public official in the performance
of his duty and that as such they were constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   A series of pretrial rulings ensued. In 1991, Wilk agreed with
the Times and dismissed the complaint. Gross appealed and in 1992
the state Appellate Division in Manhattan upheld Wilk. The Court of
Appeals, the state's highest tribunal, reinstated the suit, saying
the articles contained enough statements presented as facts to
warrant further proceedings. The case was then sent back to Wilk,
who after depositions of Times reporters and editors, granted the
most recent Times motion and dismissed it again.

NEW HOME FOR SCIENCE IN DOWNTOWN COLUMBUS  
 PAN AM STRATEGY: ALTERNATIVE AIRPORTS  
 COVENT GARDEN REOPENS WITH A FLOURISH  
 THE GEORGE V REOPENS, AS A FOUR SEASONS HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, has moved
to a new home on the banks of the Scioto River after 35 years on
the other side of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which opened Nov. 6 in a fancy new building designed
by Arata Isozaki and incorporating part of a former high school,
has two theaters, two large spaces for temporary exhibitions, a
restaurant and seven permanent exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   One of these seven is the Ocean Learning World, entered through
a simulated shipwreck. Visitors then pass a dive tank 30 feet wide
and 14 feet deep, where a dive show is held, with a discussion of
such things as the effects of pressure and why people go under
water; a diver in scuba gear performs various tasks, including
working with a mechanical arm. Submersible vehicles and other tools
of sea exploration can be operated. Other interactive stations
include fountains and laserlike squirt guns that explore the
physical properties of water.
</P>
<P>
   Progress, another exhibit, allows visitors to walk down the same
street at two different periods in American history. The worlds of
1898 and 1962 come head to head and show technological advances and
how people have responded to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The other Learning Worlds include I/O, an extensive arcade that
explores the way electronic games have evolved in the last few
decades, and Life, a look at health, medicine and living things on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The center, at 333 West Broad St., is open daily. The entrance
fee is $12, $16 with admission to one theater, $19 with admission
to both. Children 2 to 12 pay $7, $11 and $14. Information: (877)
257-2674.
</P>
<P>
   PAN AM STRATEGY: ALTERNATIVE AIRPORTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to capture a share of some big markets by flying out of
smaller airports nearby, the newly revamped Pam Am Airlines has
begun flying 727s _ carrying between 25 and 50 passengers daily
except Tuesday _ between Portsmouth, N.H., 66 miles from Boston,
and a little airport north of Orlando, Fla., in Sanford. The fare
advantage is that a traveler can buy a ticket and fly the same day
with no penalty. The typical walk-on round-trip fare is $216, as
opposed to about $975 between Boston and Orlando without the 14
days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The airline started its second route _ between Sanford and Gary,
Ind., right outside Chicago _ in October. The comparable walk-on
fares are $168 and $1,295. Sanford will be a mini-hub for the
airline, which is looking at starting other flights into St. Louis,
San Juan and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The old Pan Am went into bankruptcy in 1991, and the name was
revived by Guilford Transportation Industries, which dominates the
freight railroad system in New England. To lure Pan Am, the small
Sanford-Orlando International Airport waived landing fees for six
months and persuaded it to move its 15-member maintenance staff
from Fort Lauderdale. The airport is building a new terminal that
is expected to open in June.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 1,000 passengers rode the Boeing 727 on the
Sanford-Portsmouth route in October, the startup month, the airline
was able to boost its income by shipping 16,000 pounds of fresh
Maine lobsters for Florida restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   COVENT GARDEN REOPENS WITH A FLOURISH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backstage tours, exhibitions and free concerts will be offered
by the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden when it reopens Dec. 6
after a two-and-a-half-year, $360 million renovation, which
included a new 420-seat studio theater, a rooftop terrace and
reconstruction of the cast-iron floral hall.
</P>
<P>
   The new Amphitheater Bar and Restaurant will be open daily from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and a coffee shop and Royal Opera House Shop,
both new, will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. There will be free
lunchtime concerts and other events starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute backstage tours begin Dec. 6, and will be
conducted three times a day from Monday to Saturday. Visitors will
see the costume department, the props and scenery-making area, and
the new wagon system that shifts scenery from storage onto the
stage. There will also be a chance to visit a ballet studio. The
refurbished main auditorium and the new Linbury Studio Theater will
be included on the tour if they are not in use for rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Tours (limited to 25 people) will take place at 10:30 a.m.,
12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. and will cost $9.95 ($8.25 under 18 and
seniors). Reservations: (44-171) 212-9389.
</P>
<P>
   THE GEORGE V REOPENS, AS A FOUR SEASONS HOTEL
</P>
<P>
   Upon its opening, in 1928, the George V was hailed as the last
word in opulence. World affairs were conducted at the grand hotel
on the Avenue George V in Paris' 8th Arrondissement (it became an
official branch office of the League of Nations), and during the
liberation of Paris, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower made it his
headquarters. Yves Saint Laurent, among others, presented his
collections in its grand ballroom. The dining was, even in Paris,
renowned; the vast wine cellar is a former quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Now owned by Prince Al Waleed, a member of the Saudi Arabian
royal family, and officially named Four Seasons Hotel George V,
Paris, it is the first property in France to be managed by the Four
Seasons. The hotel was named for King George V of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Closed for two years for renovation and modernization, the hotel
is scheduled to reopen Dec. 18. Two-line speakerphones come with
every room, as do high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   For less businesslike pursuits, there are two restaurants and a
bar serving lunch and snacks; the wine cellar can be reserved as
its own dining space. The cuisine is overseen by Philippe Legendre,
the former chef at Taillevent.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation has reduced the number of rooms and suites from
300 to 245, 30 of which come with terraces or balconies with a view
of the Eiffel Tower, the Pantheon and Notre Dame. Original wood
paneling and fireplaces have been kept. Rooms range in size from
420 to 4,000 square feet. The largest is one of two Presidential
Suites, which comes with its own workout room and sauna. The
hotel's health club includes an indoor pool, exercise equipment,
whirlpools and a staff of pamperers.
</P>
<P>
   The George V is an easy walk from the Louvre, the Jardin des
Tuileries and the ``Golden Triangle'' of haute couture shops around
the corner on the Avenue Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   Double-occupancy rooms start at $535 a night, and one-bedroom
suites at $1,310. The most expensive suites are $7,200 a night.
Hotel George V, 31 ave. George V, 75008 Paris; reservations: (800)
332-3442 in the United States, (33-1) 53.53.28.00 direct to the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A CORRECTION
</P>
<P>
   The Practical Traveler column on Nov. 28, about the cost of
travel-package components, misstated the level of lodging used by
Petrabax Vacations in Spain. By the Spanish government rating
system, they are mostly four-star hotels, not two-star.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Holocaust survivors from around the world implored a
federal judge in Brooklyn on Monday to quickly distribute the
proceeds of a $1.25 billion ettlement between Swiss banks and
Holocaust survivors, and to block lawyers from collecting what the
survivors called exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
   Yakov Goodman, president of a group representing Jews from
Belarus, delivered some of the most pointed remarks of a day filled
with the grim memories and anxious pleas of aging Holocaust
survivors who said they had waited a half-century for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman urged Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court
to quickly distribute the settlement money before more Holocaust
survivors died, and criticized the half-dozen lawyers in the case
who are requesting $12.5 million in fees for their work. Two dozen
other lawyers representing Holocaust survivors, their relatives and
Jewish groups are working on the case at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those gold rings and gold teeth which were taken from the
Jews were placed here on the table, I don't think any of the
attorneys would reach for them,'' Goodman said. ``Maybe I'm naive,
but that's what these attorneys are reaching for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swift, one of the lawyers requesting payment in the case,
said the criticism was unfair. He said the lawsuit was a tremendous
success and warned that qualified lawyers would not take on similar
cases if they went unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the comments I heard about fees were repugnant,''
Swift said. ``We worked extremely hard at great risk to accomplish
a world-class result.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's daylong session was the first of several hearings that
allow public comment on the precedent-setting 1998 settlement, the
first to involve a major European industry paying damages for the
seizure or looting of Holocaust victims' property during World War
II. The settlement has helped spawn a series of similar lawsuits
against European banks, insurance companies and manufacturing
companies accused of profiting from Holocaust victims' looted
assets or from using slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   More than 440,000 people from around the world have applied to
be included in the settlement, which is intended to resolve
thousands of claims that Swiss banks kept the money of Jews and
others killed in the Holocaust. How the money will be divided is
still being disputed. Some survivors contended on Monday that the
money should be paid directly to them and their relatives. But
Jewish groups have called for some of the money to be used to
establish Holocaust studies or religious education programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, a special master appointed by Korman will release an
initial plan on how to distribute the money, said Burt Neuborne,
the lead lawyer for Holocaust survivors and a professor at New York
University Law School who is working on the case at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing allowing public comment on that proposal will be held
in May. A final ruling by Korman is scheduled for June. If no
appeals are filed, the distribution of the money will begin next
summer.

TRADE TALKS START IN SEATTLE DESPITE A FEW DISRUPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A week of talks aimed at expanding global trade got
off to something well short of a smooth start here Monday. The
disruptions included a brief bomb scare, the smashing of a window
in protests at a McDonald's restaurant and a takeover of a vacant
three-story building by a self-described group of anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, though, the protests against the meeting of the
World Trade Organization were peaceful, with 2,000 demonstrators
marching through downtown to proclaim their view that the trade
group, in the name of lowering trade barriers, actually undermines
health, safety and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators continued to stream into town, and a much larger
protest, backed by union groups and timed to coincide with the
official opening of the trade talks, is expected on Tuesday.
Chanting, ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, the WTO has got to go!'' many
protesters said they had traveled here to spread a message that
globalization and unfettered free trade were simply bad for the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat's off course, and everyone knows it,'' said Arthur
Freyer, 49, an electrician and a member of the Sierra Club, who
marched Monday. ``If we can't decide what's going into our own food
anymore, then something's very wrong. We've got to get the boat
back on course.''
</P>
<P>
   The director general of the trade organization, Mike Moore, a
former prime minister of New Zealand, at a meeting of some protest
groups Monday, said that the opposition was misguided. Free trade
brings prosperity that, he said, could address some of the problems
the groups were complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there could be up to 50,000 demonstrators against
us'' on Tuesday, Moore said. ``But remember, in over 30 countries,
1.5 billion want to join the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   He was describing those nations, including China, that have
applied to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from 135 nations are meeting here hoping to hammer out
an agenda to lower tariffs and remove other trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the downtown convention center, the main site for
the talks, was conducted early Monday morning by the Secret Service
and the Seattle police. It was set off by what the police
described, without elaboration, as a ``possible security breach.''
The search kept several hundred delegates out of the building and
forced the rescheduling or cancellation of briefings planned by
several countries. No bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a McDonald's five blocks from the convention hall,
protesters cheered as Jose Bove, a French farmer who drew worldwide
attention this year when he was arrested for driving a tractor
through a McDonald's in France, condemned bioengineered and
genetically altered food as ``Frankenfoods.'' ``We don't want to
eat any more of that kind of food,'' Bove told the crowd. ``You've
got to throw it into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was closed as a precaution, and one person was
arrested after a window was smashed. Elsewhere downtown, two other
people, whose names were not released, were arrested on charges of
assault and obstruction after they had tried to break through a
police cordon and serve ``arrest warrants'' on officials of the
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to arrive here early Wednesday
morning, and he is expected to use his visit to promote the
benefits of free trade and to prod delegates to smooth out
disagreements and listen to the protesters' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials, including the trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary William M.
Daley, and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, spent much of the
day in forums where they heard the complaints of nongovernmental
groups that have called for reform of the international trading
system to incorporate stronger protections for workers and the
environment.

   ``It's important that the views of civil society be heard,'' Ms.
Barshefsky said at a news conference. ``But more than heard, they
must be integrated into the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had tried and failed to persuade other world leaders to
go to the meeting in an effort to advance trade agreements. The
only other national leader who said he might just go was one whom
the president presumably did not wish to see in Seattle, President
Fidel Castro of Cuba. But Castro announced Monday in Havana that he
would not make the trip.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Janet Reno declined to block the
release Monday night of an Egyptian man who had been held for three
and a half years in a New York jail on secret evidence that the FBI
had said linked him to terrorists in the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   With the attorney general not intervening in the case of Nasser
Ahmed, Ahmed was allowed to leave the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in lower Manhattan Monday night, and was met by his wife,
Salwa Elbayadi, and their three children. In a brief statement,
Ahmed thanked his lawyers for his freedom and lashed out at his
accusers in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liars, and they know they are liars,'' Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision came 10 days after the INS commissioner, Doris
Meissner, took the unusual step of citing ``national security
implications'' as a basis for asking Reno to order that Ahmed not
be released on bond while his case was reviewed by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service, based on classified evidence, had been
seeking to deport Ahmed, who is seeking political asylum. Ahmed,
39, had worked as a legal assistant to Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the
blind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring to blow up the World
Trade Center and other New York landmarks. Although Ahmed has
admitted to being an admirer of Abdel-Rahman, he has denied any
involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ahmed's lawyers, David Cole, said Monday night that with
Reno's decision, he is now ``very optimistic'' that Ahmed will be
granted political asylum, which he has been seeking for more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the attorney general rejected the immigration
service's argument that he is a threat to national security should
dispose of this case,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had said she would decide whether to intervene in the case
by 5 p.m. Monday, and with no action by her as the deadline neared,
the INS said that ``upon further review'' it was withdrawing its
request that Ahmed continue to be held.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ahmed's case is not yet over _ he remains free on bond
pending a final ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals on
whether he should be granted asylum _ Reno's decision not to
intervene is likely to be seen as another major blow to the use of
secret evidence by the INS in deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has the authority to review and overturn
decisions of the immigration courts, which are part of the Justice
Department. Last summer, an immigration judge, after reviewing the
government's classified evidence against Ahmed, concluded that it
was weak, that he was not a threat to national security, and
ordered that he be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The INS then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which
recently ordered Ahmed released on bond pending its review of his
case. It was that decision to free Ahmed that the INS then appealed
to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant, a
federal district judge in New Jersey ruled, for the first time in
the United States, that it was unconstitutional for the government
to detain an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence. Shortly
thereafter, the INS dropped its efforts to hold Hany Kiareldeen,
who had also been accused of terrorism and had been held for 19
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno nor Meissner would respond to questions through
spokesmen about the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed's lawyers and others who have sharply criticized the
practice of using secret evidence as a violation of due process,
said they hoped that the decision indicated a rethinking of the
practice at the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that he's released,'' said Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., who has introduced legislation to ban the use of
classified evidence in deportation proceedings, ``but we still have
about 20 others who are being held, and it's a travesty of justice
that this continues in our country without people having the right
to face their accusers.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of Ahmed was also hailed by Arab-American groups
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council in Washington, said: ``Three and a half years is a long
time to wait. Should we celebrate tonight, or should we decry the
fact that in America, a man was behind bars for so many years on
the basis of secret evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Abuzaakouk charged that secret evidence was unreliable, unjust
and unconstitutional, and added: ``The only thing that keeps secret
evidence alive is the politics of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who was taken into custody in April 1996, had been held
longer than any others who have been detained on classified
evidence. Some, like Ahmed, have been held for long periods in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed had sought asylum on the ground that he would be
persecuted and possibly tortured if the INS succeeded in deporting
him to Egypt. As well as being a close friend of Abdel-Rahman, who
has called for the overthrow of the Egyptian government, Ahmed was
accused in the INS proceedings of belonging to an Egyptian
terrorist group, of which Abdel-Rahman is the spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although parts of the case against Ahmed remain secret, a
recently declassified summary of the evidence shows that the
immigration judge, Donn Livingston, sharply criticized the
government's case, calling it ``double or triple hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the reliability of some government sources,
and said one was described as ``a friendly foreign intelligence
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had a ``very real concern'' that the Egyptian
government might be the source of secret evidence against Ahmed,
Livingston cited ``the very real danger that the Egyptian
government'' was seeking to silence Abdel-Rahman, one of its
harshest critics, by persecuting Ahmed.

BETHEL LESLIE, 70, AN ACTRESS IN THEATER, TELEVISION AND FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bethel Leslie, a lifelong presence onstage and on
television whose final Broadway performance earned her a Tony
nomination, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Leslie McCullough Jeffries, her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a lawyer and a socialite, Ms. Leslie was a
15-year-old student at the Brearley School on the Upper East Side
of Manhattan when she was discovered by the producer George Abbott
and cast as the girl next door in the 1944 Broadway production of
``Snafu,'' a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The role began Ms. Leslie's career, which included appearances
in 10 Broadway plays before she was 25 and which had her acting
alongside the likes of Fredric March (``Years Ago,'' in 1946), Sam
Wanamaker (``Goodbye, My Fancy'' in 1948) and Helen Hayes (``The
Wisteria Trees,'' in 1950).
</P>
<P>
   Her breakthrough came in 1955, in ``Inherit the Wind,'' in which
she played the conflicted daughter of a Bible-wielding reverend.
The part earned Ms. Leslie strong reviews, and she soon headed to
Hollywood. There she found steady work in television, parlaying her
dark good looks into roles on shows like ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Perry
Mason'' and ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1965 press biography listed some of her character roles as ``a
cheating wife, a husband-framing mistress'' and ``the wife of a
confessed murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leslie made her film debut in 1964 in ``Captain Newman,
MD,'' as the wife of a traumatized Air Force pilot, played by
Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965 she had returned to New York and to the theater, though
appearances on soap operas helped support that passion. As a side
pursuit Ms. Leslie began to write, eventually becoming a head
writer for the daytime drama ``The Secret Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1986, however, that she scored her biggest
triumph, appearing as the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night,'' a performance that
Frank Rich of The New York Times called ``exceptionally
beautiful.'' Her work earned her a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she appeared Off Broadway in productions with
the Signature Theater Co. and most recently with the Women's
Project, where she won praise this spring for her work in Joan Vail
Thorne's play ``Exact Center of the Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York, Ms. Leslie
is survived by a brother, Warren Leslie, also of New York, and two
grandchildren.

EXCERPTS OF BRADLEY'S FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BRADLEY-FOREIGN-POLICY) 
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ Following are excerpts from the prepared text
of Bill Bradley's speech on foreign policy on Monday at Tufts
University:
</P>
<P>
   I, for many years, as I've illustrated, thought about foreign
policy from the standpoint of the United States Senate. Now I'm
thinking about it in a different way. A president has a singular
role when it comes to foreign policy where only he can lead. The
next president must be able to help America and all Americans
navigate in this new world that I've described. That in itself
won't be easy. A president also has some very basic and fundamental
things that he must always manage. You might call it the
president's job description. He must first protect our national
security, maintain our leadership in the world, and talk honestly
with the American people. That is always the president's job.
</P>
<P>
   But in this new world the next president has an even heavier
burden, which is to try to create a comprehensive framework for
peace, security, and prosperity that's not only in the interests of
America, but everyone, everywhere. And it's not simply an American
project, nor is it something we can impose on the world like we
were able to do after World War II. We can help mold this new
international system and it will emerge from international
institutions, new and old, from partnerships and alliances whose
resources and efforts are going to be essential. It's not anything
we can do by ourselves, for its very nature is cooperative. This is
one of the big and essential jobs of the next president, and it's
one we must do well.
</P>
<P>
   This new world that's taking shape is not always clear. For
example, there's a disturbing paradox. We are more powerful than
ever before, yet we are also more vulnerable to a variety of
threats. The great risk of nuclear holocaust with the Soviet Union
has receded but there are a multitude of smaller threats, from a
troublemaking dictatorship like Iraq to the poorly safeguarded
nuclear warheads in Russia to the increasingly dangerous situation
on the Korean peninsula to transnational terrorists who view the
U.S. as their No. 1 enemy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the next president must have a few principles to
guide him to manage these new threats and new opportunities. He
must understand how to protect our security in response to our
growing interconnectedness. He must have a policy countering small
threats so they don't grow into larger ones. He must maintain a
strategic stability in the world that prevents the start of a new
and deadly arms race around the world. He must gear our policies to
the world as it is, not the cold war world that no longer exists.
And finally, he must understand our deep American attachment to
human rights and that our values and our interests are very often
one and the same.

PRACTICAL TRAVELER: MAJOR CITY HOTELS ARE MOBBED, BUT A BIT LESS
SO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 5) 
(ms) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've tried to book a hotel room in a major American city
lately, you may have trouble believing this. The latest figures
from the hotel industry, covering the first nine months of this
year, show that occupancy rates are still in decline, continuing a
trend that began in 1997. In fact, occupancy through September 1999
was down from the same period last year in 17 of the nation's 25
biggest markets, according to Smith Travel Research, the
scorekeeper for the United States hotel industry. And industry
analysts project falling occupancy for each of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be lulled into thinking that it is now easier to book
the room of your choice at the last minute, or that room rates will
plummet to reflect lower demand. The nine-month occupancy rate,
65.2 percent, is still slightly above the 25-year industry average
of 65 percent. And unless you are willing to stay in the boondocks
or at the Hotel Last Resort, city-center hotels, luxury and full
service hotels may be as tough as ever to get into, while room
rates, which have averaged $81.06 so far in 1999, are likely to
continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider this: while occupancy rates have
slipped this year in New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
Miami-Hialeah, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, San Diego and Washington, occupancy in all those markets
remains in the 70-percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the slippage in those cities has ranged from less
than 2 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul (1.7 percent, to be exact)
to a minuscule 0.1 percent in Philadelphia. And in most of those
cities, rooms that are centrally situated or in trendy outlying
neighborhoods are still scarce unless booked well in advance.
(There is another possibility for reserving a desirable hotel on
short notice, but you'll have to read on to learn how.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, occupancy rates have been virtually flat in the most
expensive markets _ those with average room rates over $100 a night
_ so the pattern is much the same as in each of the past several
years. For example, occupancy is down only 0.6 percent in New York,
where the average room rate is a whopping $178.60; 0.4 percent in
San Francisco ($135.01 a room); 1.0 percent in Boston ($131.36),
0.4 percent in New Orleans ($113.94), 1.0 percent in Chicago
($109.51), 1.6 percent on Oahu ($107.54), 0.9 percent in
Miami-Hialeah ($107.40) and 0.5 percent in San Diego ($103.23). So
far this year, only Washington has had room rates averaging above
$100 ($108.90) as well as increased occupancy (up 1.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of a glut of new hotels, after seven consecutive
years of good financial news for the industry, even hotels in
cities with big drops in occupancy this year have raised room rates
modestly. These include Houston (a drop of 5.4 percent), Dallas
(down 5.3 percent) Seattle (5.3) and Orlando (3.4). A notable
exception is Denver, where occupancy has fallen 3.8 percent this
year, to 69 percent, but where room rates have also declined a
smidgen, to $78.68 from $78.80.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in only 2 of the top 25 markets have room rates
dropped at least 0.5 percent this year: Phoenix, where rates
dropped 1.6 percent, to $98.35, and occupancy fell 4.1 percent, to
62.9; and Oahu, where despite a slight rise in occupancy, room
rates fell 4.1 percent, to $107.54. While Phoenix was affected by a
10.3 percent increase in available rooms, Oahu's prices were driven
down largely by the perception that too many of its hotels are
overpriced and in need of refurbishment.
</P>
<P>
   The industry expects a boost in occupancy and room rates in the
fourth quarter, a period that includes multitudes in search of fall
foliage, the Thanksgiving holiday, legions of fans following
college and professional football teams, as well as the runup to
Christmas and New Year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, room rates nationwide have risen each year since 1995,
when the average was $66.11, to $81.06 through this September, and
according to a forecast two months ago by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
rates will rise to $84.15 next year and to $87.25 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But even hotels in cities outside the top 25 markets _ including
Cleveland, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Providence, R.I. _ are having
banner years. A recent survey by PKF Consulting in San Francisco
turned up occupancy rates above 70 percent this year in Austin,
Tex.; Baton Rouge, La.; Nashville; Boise, Idaho; Colorado Springs;
Portland, Ore.; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Sacramento. Salt Lake City's
occupancy is 71 percent for this year so far, 4.1 percent less than
the 74 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting occupancy rates is at a single
hotel, the New York Marriott Brooklyn. When it opened in July 1997,
it was the first new hotel in Brooklyn in almost 70 years, and the
hotel, which has 376 rooms, had an occupancy rate of almost 83
percent during the first six months of this year. Marriott expects
it to hit 85 percent by year-end, driven by the high holiday demand
in New York and the fact that it is the only notable hotel in the
borough.
</P>
<P>
   This year's overall occupancy rate of 65.2 percent is all the
more significant (especially to hotel owners) in view of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers finding that United States hotels had
achieved a record low break-even occupancy rate, the rate at which
expenses and revenues are equal. From a 62.6 break-even rate in
1992, it is now down to 55.5 percent. That lower rate, according to
Bjorn Hanson, chairman of the lodging and gaming group of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, is attributable to the rising room rates,
lower debt and equity costs for the industry, and more emphasis on
revenue from rooms than from low-margin food and beverage
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers are likely to be surprised to hear ``low margin''
used to describe hotel food and beverage, especially in view of the
trend even in upscale restaurants toward breakfast and lunch
buffets, which require far less labor than traditional menus. And
anyone who has eaten in luxury hotel restaurants, or ordered room
service, is almost sure to regard ``low margin'' with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hanson said that at the same time that top chefs
with celebrity status are in greater demand than ever at luxury
hotels, the food and beverage share of overall hotel revenue has
fallen from as much as 50 percent in 1960 to about 20 percent
today. And after subtracting the cost of credit card commissions,
insurance, energy, marketing and other expenses, he said, ``food
and beverage operations usually result in a financial loss for
hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Turkel, a hotel consultant in New York, also said that
hotels lose money on food and beverages, except for banquets.
``Even Las Vegas, where they used to practically give rooms and
food away, is now trying to make food and beverage profitable,'' he
said. (Las Vegas, the No. 1 hotel market in the United States, is
not included in Smith Travel Research reports because of its unique
attractions and reliance on gambling, but its 120,444 rooms, the
most of any city, have averaged a torrid 89.2 percent occupancy so
far this year.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet is having a growing impact on hotel
bookings, especially in enabling potential guests and travel agents
to view guest rooms, lobbies and hotel exteriors. Hotel
Reservations Network, a Dallas-based consolidator that sells
discount rooms in 38 cities worldwide, said that it derived more
than 85 percent of its revenues from the 1.2 million room nights a
year that it books on the Web, and Priceline.com and some other Web
discounters are sprouting up.
</P>
<P>
   Internet bookings are poised to soar _ to some $3.1 billion in
revenues by the year 2002 from less than $100 million in 1997,
according to a forecast by Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``The introduction
of toll-free telephone service in the 1960s was the last great
technology innovation to greatly affect the economics of hotel
booking, and that's nothing compared with the mighty punch of the
Internet,'' said Jason Ader, who heads the Bear, Stearns hotel,
gaming and leisure research group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, so far the Internet has had little overall impact on room
rates or availability.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about booking a hotel room on short notice: the surest
way is to plan your stay for Sunday night, because it is the
slowest day of the week. Try for an upscale chain hotel, the
segment with the biggest falloff in occupancy on Sunday, according
to Smith Travel Research. The drawback is that you will probably
have to vacate your room the next morning; but you might get a
break on the price, which gives a thrifty traveler a chance to
enjoy a different lodging experience.

A $42.5 BILLION ROYAL BANK COUNTEROFFER FOR NATWEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Bank of Scotland announced a $42.5 billion
hostile bid Monday for National Westminster Bank, Britain's third
largest, touching off a potentially bruising bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which had been expected, pitted the Royal Bank against
its crosstown rival in Edinburgh, the Bank of Scotland, which has
made two of its own bids for Natwest, both of them rebuffed. The
Royal Bank's bid underlines the pressure on European financial
institutions to bulk up or risk being left on the sideline as
marginal competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile bid Monday sets the stage for a brawl that is likely
to further shake the staid culture of the City of London, Britain's
financial center.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Royal Bank's bid is so close to that of the Bank of
Scotland _ it had offered $41.3 billion _ that analysts said the
battle to persuade shareholders would be less about arithmetic and
more about the management teams that run the two Scottish
institutions. They suggested that the battle could easily turn
nasty as both banks consider personal attacks on each other and
plead with shareholders to avoid being left out of the takeover
attempt, the largest in British banking.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank's bid values Natwest at 15.90 pounds a share _ in
all 26.5 billion pounds, or $42.54 billion, $1.24 billion more than
Bank of Scotland's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank is offering 0.968 share and a 3.05 pound note for
each share of Natwest stock. The Bank of Scotland's recently
increased bid is for 14.57 pounds a share and a special dividend
that could be worth 1.20 pounds a share.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolicited offer by the Royal Bank came 24 hours after a
long negotiating session with Natwest, aimed at brokering a
friendly merger, had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   After dismissing the Royal Bank's informal offer over the
weekend, Natwest withheld judgment on the new bid until late Monday
afternoon, when its board rejected the offer as ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland also started its assault on the Royal
Bank's bid, calling it ``inferior,'' and taunted its rival by
saying that its counteroffer came after ``months of
procrastination.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and stock traders, who had higher expectations for the
offer, sent shares of Royal Bank down 87 pence, to 12.41 pounds.
That cut the value of the offer by 4.9 percent, to 25.1 billion
pounds, or $40.3 billion. But the Bank of Scotland got a lift from
investors, who sent its shares up 4.5 pence, to 7.285 pounds, on
expectations that it might prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is saying that Royal Bank is paying too much,''
said John Tyce, an analyst at SG Securities here. ``I certainly
thought Royal Bank would win, but now I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was shared by institutional investors, which were
also surprised by the Royal Bank's offer. The Royal Bank's bid
``doesn't give it much room to fiddle about,'' Tyce said, echoing
the thoughts of several institutional investors. ``For Royal Bank
to make this happen, it has to go like clockwork. It has to be
perfect; otherwise it'll be a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank said it could squeeze 1.18 billion pounds in
annual savings from a combined company, more than the Bank of
Scotland's pledge to cut costs by 1.02 billion pounds. Royal Bank
said it would not close any branches but would eliminate 18,000
jobs. Natwest has said it will cut 15,000 jobs by 2002 as part of
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank also said it would sell Natwest's fund management
unit, Gartmore Investment Management, and its investment banking
unit, Greenwich Natwest. The Bank of Scotland said it would also
sell Natwest's venture capital unit, Natwest Equity Partners, and
Ulster Bank in Ireland. Natwest has said it would dispose of all
those assets as part of its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank would still need regulatory approval to move
forward with a bid. Britain's panel on takeovers has until Dec. 6
to decide whether Royal Bank's offer should be referred to the
Competition Commission. Last Thursday, the panel ruled that the
Bank of Scotland's bid would not be referred to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its bid, the Royal Bank has enlisted the support of
Banco Santander Central Hispano and the Royal Bank's largest
investor. The Spanish bank said Monday that it would buy 1.2
billion pounds of Royal Bank shares. The agreement would give
Santander a 6.5 percent stake in a combined company. A British
insurer, CGU PLC, said it would buy 300 million pounds of Royal
Bank shares and acquire a 50 percent stake in the Royal Bank's life
insurance unit, Royal Scottish Assurance.

 AFTER SECURITY SCARE, WTO GETS AN EARFUL FROM NGO'S
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While anti-WTO activists took to Seattle's streets
Monday, members of the trade orgainzation held a unique complaint
session inside the besieged convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some quarters, the WTO has become the institution that
people love to hate,'' British Development Minister Clare Short
told a symposium at which environmental, labor and other
organizations were allowed to voice concerns about world trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this criticism is misplaced,'' she said in her
keynote speech to representatives of so-called non-governmental
oganizations, or NGOs.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the symposium was to encourage an informal
dialogue between members of the five-year-old World Trade
organization, which sets the rules for world trade, and the more
than 700 non-governmental organizations that have been accredited
to the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the Geneva-based WTO places global trade
liberalization above other legitimate interests such as human and
worker rights and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Short, those who spoke included Mike Moore, the
WTO's new director general, Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's
commissioner for trade, and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   They got an earful of criticism once the session was opened to
three-minute comments from representatives of the many
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Khor of the Third World Network, based in Penang,
Malaysia, called the program ``less of a dialog and more of a
lecture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said numerous groups have decided they want no new round of
issues _ not investor rights, procurement, competition, biotech,
environment or labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These would put the developing countries to further
disadvantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rich countries have broken their promises to gradually open
their market to textiles and to reform their anti-dumping laws,
Khor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is not willing to do these things, one does not have
the right to portray one's proposals as a `development round.'''
Khor said. ``It is a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist group,
also said the NGO Day had been ``you speaking and us listening.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Canadian government had given out a list of private
sector news sources on WTO issues, and that they were all employer
confederations or wealthy men. ``They didn't give any of our
names,'' she said. ``We were not welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would express her opinions Tuesday, in the street.
</P>
<P>
   There was no clear theme to the voice of protest inside the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for sweeping changes of the WTO and its trade
policies; others were more measured in their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium got off to a slow start when Seattle police shut
down the convention center because of security concerns. It was not
opened until about 10:30 a.m., which delayed by a couple hours the
start of the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending had to pass through metal detectors and at one
point a parade of protestors that included the Sierra Club, members
of labor unions and animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the WTO director general, said he hoped the protests
would not overshadow the WTO's good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there could be up to 50,000 demonstrators against
us,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember: In over 30 countries, 1.5 billion want to join
the WTO,'' he said, referring to the 30 nations including China
that have WTO membership applications pending.
</P>
<P>
   He said the WTO will listen to its critics. Economic growth that
has resulted from free trade policies, he acknowledged, has caused
``pain and problems'' for many people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``freedom fighters'' of the past of now protersting the
WTO in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we goign to tell hem the old ways are best?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the WTO was in Seattle to ``open the door to working
families everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In her keynote speech, Short said liberalized trade will benefit
developing countrues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the WTO and its rules, the rich and powerful could
bully the rest as they used to,'' she said. ``Let's face it, no
rules is when the rich and powerful do bully the poor.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I find it difficult to sand ornamental or carved moldings
because there are often grooves and narrow spaces that sandpaper
won't reach into or around, even when the paper is folded into
narrow strips.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried using steel wool, but this still doesn't always
conform to the shape and can often leave a residue of fine metal
shavings that is almost impossible to clean off _ which is
important if I am preparing it for a clear varnish or lacquer
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an easier way to sand and smooth such curved or carved
surfaces?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most common method for sanding and smoothing such
surfaces is to use a sanding sponge. This is a small sponge covered
with fabric-backed sandpaper on all sides. The sponge can be
squeezed into various shapes and thus permits sanding inside curves
and grooves or rounded edges.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have a sanding sponge, or you find that even this
won't reach into some places, then an alternate method is to use a
deck of cards with a sheet of sandpaper folded around the edge as
shown here. The edges of the cards can be forced into almost any
curve or shape to reach into grooves and nooks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently bought a house that has moss growing on one side
of the roof. Should we remove this moss and, if so, how do we do
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should remove the moss as it can eventually damage the
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   There are chemical products sold in some home centers and garden
supply stores for getting rid of moss (one widely sold brand is
De-Moss), or you can use a copper sulfate solution (one-half ounce
to 10 gallons of water).
</P>
<P>
   Scrub on, then wash off the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that these chemicals can damage metal and some
shrubbery, so be careful about the runoff and flush away all
drippings with plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We want to remove some very old linoleum that was put down
over a solid hardwood floor years ago. Can you tell us how to do
this without damaging the wood flooring?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linoleum has not been made or used in this country for many
years, but if the material is real linoleum (not some type of
vinyl, which seems more likely) then a linoleum paste was probably
used to put it down.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of paste can be softened with hot water. However, if
this doesn't work, then scraping will be your only solution.
</P>
<P>
   A heat gun will usually help soften the flooring material and
thus will make it easier to pull up, but be careful to avoid
scorching the wood or starting a fire, and keep an extinguisher
handy _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our bathtub has a lever on the overflow plate near the top of
the tub to open and close the drain.
</P>
<P>
   We flip it up to close the drain and push down to open it. There
is no stopper or drain cover visible.
</P>
<P>
   The drain leaks and allows water to drain out even when the
lever is pulled all the way up.
</P>
<P>
   How can I fix this without calling in a plumber?
</P>
<P>
   A: This type of drain stopper usually has a brass plug on the
inside which drops down onto an internal seat to seal off the drain
when it is lowered.
</P>
<P>
   However, when this drain plug accumulates a build-up of
oxidation, or an accumulation of soap and hair or lint, then the
stopper will not seat properly. You have to clean the linkage and
the brass stopper at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Start by removing the screws that hold the overflow plate and
its lever in place, then carefully pull out the linkage which has
the brass stopper attached at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these may have lock nuts for adjusting the length, so
first see if these have loosened or need realigning.
</P>
<P>
   Then clean all parts with fine steel wool and wipe on a light
coat of waterproof grease before reassembling the linkage.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Dell focuses on style, simplicity with webpc
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp., the No. 1 personal computer
maker in the United States but still a relatively small force in
the consumer market, unveils a new family of computers today that
is designed to get consumers on the Internet quickly and demystify
PC use.
</P>
<P>
   The webpc is Dell's entry into an emerging era in which sleeker
looking computers conform intuitively to users' wants, thus sparing
them from having to master technical details.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for people who are less concerned about the
technology,'' said Dell spokesman Tad Druart. ``They just want a
machine that gets them on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's new PCs, which will be officially announced by Chief
Executive Michael Dell and others in a 11 a.m. Webcast, will sell
for $999, $1,099 and $1,499. The prices include monitors, but
including a flat-panel monitor with the most expensive webpc would
bring the total cost to $2,349, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   All the major PC makers are working on Internet-driven PCs that
have been stripped of features that added cost and complexity to
the traditional beige boxes. They come only with easy-to-use USB
ports for connecting keyboards and peripherals such as printers, a
trend started by Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell acknowledges that Apple's stylish iMac, which began
selling in August 1998, has been a wake-up call for the personal
computer industry to build good-looking, easy-to-use products that
are less intimidating to average users.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers are not designed to be opened by their owners
to upgrade components such as adding memory, special purpose cards
or faster microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need expandability anymore, because all the
functionality is embedded in,'' said Roger Kay of International
Data Corp. ``This small generation of boxes is going to become
predominant in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dell, other major PC makers such as Compaq Computer
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM Corp. plan to target corporate
customers when they begin shipping their Internet-driven PCs next
year. Compaq, which lost money in the commercial category this
year, sees its IPaq as a weapon to recover accounts lost to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Dell hasn't talked about plans for a similar PC for commercial
customers, but analysts believe such a product is in the works.
Still, Dell's success in that market frees the company from a sense
of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell's bread-and-butter is the commercial market,'' said Ashok
Kumar of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based securities
firm. ``They don't want to loot the revenue potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dell has little to lose and much to gain in the consumer
market, it will face a different challenge if it introduces
something like webpc for commercial customers, Kay said. ``I think
everybody risks cannibalizing their corporate business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's webpc keyboard has dedicated buttons for Internet access,
opening an e-mail account and launching Web searches. It also
includes an ``e-support'' button that sends the customer to Dell's
interactive technical-help Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers want, essentially, plug-and-play,'' said Kumar.
``(Vendors) want to minimize the potential for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with monitors included in the price, Dell still is avoiding
the low end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell was slow to aggressively court the broad consumer market,
because inexperienced buyers can be costly when they tie up
customer help lines.
</P>
<P>
   With razor-thin profit margins on low-cost computers, just two
calls to the PC company help desk can turn a profitable customer
into an unprofitable one, Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell says its newest PCs will produce fewer problems for
consumers. Moreover, the ``e-support'' button on the keyboard takes
customers through a variety of solutions to common problems that
many users will be able to fix themselves. If that fails, they can
get online help from someone at Dell 24 hours a day, Druart said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell leads the industry in shifting technical support to the
Web, Kumar said. The company's recent and extensive redesign of its
Web pages was driven in large part by its desire to encourage even
novice users to go online for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell says its hourglass-shaped webpcs can be unpacked, plugged
in and clicked on to the Internet in about 10 minutes with
pre-loaded software for access to DellNet, the company's
Internet-access service.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's major competitors are not expected to ship their
commercial, Internet-driven PCs until next year, Dell will have
immediate competition from customers of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
AMD, whose Athlon processors have passed Intel Corp.'s Pentium III
in speed, is licensing its EasyPC design to a variety of
manufacturers, mostly overseas. It will be available in December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the buzz about the new designs, the new era presents
new challenges for PC makers, said Kay of IDC. Style is an obvious
way to distinguish PCs that essentially are the same inside and
cost about the same. But consumer tastes can be fickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into style, you really play a very interesting
game, because you've got to `hit it','' said Kay. ``iMac hit it,
but the Wintel guys are sort of feeling their way through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Druart said the webpcs, designed mostly by Dell, will be
assembled in Huntsville, Ala., by SCI Systems Inc., a large
contract electronics manufacturer. The new family is available only
the United States now, but may be rolled out overseas next year.

JOSE BOVA GETS THE STAR TREATMENT IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Walking through the streets of downtown Seattle
Monday, Jose Bove got the type of treatment usually reserved for
rock stars on tour: cameras flashed, hands jockeyed to tug his
leather jacket and young women shrieked ``Jose! Jose! Jose!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a farmer,'' Bove whispered softly, shrugging as he
cut through a throng of supporters that included people wearing
black hoods, businessmen in elegant suits and folks costumed like
sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   But the 46-year-old sheep farmer from the south of France, who
sports a handlebar mustache and carries a tobacco pipe, is a
national hero in his homeland for having taken a big stand against
a food Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by Monday's public reaction, Bove's potential for
folk hero-dom on this side of the Atlantic _ at least during this
week's World Trade Organization gathering _ is red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Bove was arrested this summer for vandalizing a McDonald's
restaurant under construction in Millau to protest U.S.-imposed
tariffs on Roquefort cheese and other products. The WTO had
authorized the tariffs in retaliation for the European Union's
refusal to import hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocquefort was taken hostage by hormone-treated beef,'' Bove
explained Monday as he made his way to a downtown McDonald's for a
rally to criticize the chain he says symbolizes the reach of
multi-national, industrial food concerns.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's hurts small farmers worldwide, he believes, and
spreads ``mal bouffe'' _ French for ``bad eats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bove also sounded off against Monsanto and large companies
that create genetically modified foods _ known as GM foods or
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove hoped the 2 p.m. rally would unfold without a violent
hitch, as press from all corners of the world cataloged his every
breath.
</P>
<P>
   He had to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Push back, push back,'' he told the crowd of more than 500,
urging the masses to step a few feet away from the fastfood
restaurant where a large, homemade sign urged people to ``Resist
McDonaldization.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally had one lone flashpoint: a few anxious seconds in
which a window was shattered and someone tagged the building with
obscenity-laced graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Managers temporarily closed the eatery, locking uniformed
restaurant workers inside as people outside banged drums, cheered
and _ in one case _ deposited an uneaten hamburger at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant manager said no customers or workers were injured.
No one was sure exactly how the glass was shattered, a McDonald's
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief speech, Bove stood before a blue picnic
blanket, spread in front of the McDonald's, adorned with three lit
candles, French bread, American cheddar cheese, Gabriel Court
Roquefort, grapes and bottles of French wine _ Cabernet Sauvignon,
vintage 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lambasting fast food, Bove said: ``People don't want this kind
of food ... the food of WTO. They want safe food.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later Bove, trailed by dozens of pushing,
shoving, anxious newspeople with cameras _ clambered to the roof of
a white van parked in the middle of an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by farm representives from the United States and
India who voiced support of Bove's criticisms of the globalization
of agriculture, which they said WTO policies encourage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the van-top speakers, Prof. Nanjunda Swamy of India, drew
thunderous applause when he mentioned India's successful efforts to
keep fast food chains out of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Bill Christison, president of the National
Family Farm Coalition, said global agriculture was ``killing'' the
small farmer worldwide. ``Corporate food is bad food,'' he said
later in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to early media characterizations, Bove said he is not
anti-American. He said French farmers and American farmers share
similar concerns. ``We are in this together,'' he said, noting that
global trade waters down cultural diversity and lowers quality.
</P>
<P>
   For Bove, who looks like a college chemistry professor, Monday
was deja vu. In August, he organized the vandalization of the
McDonald's in France because the tariffs were hurting farmers like
himself who sell sheep's milk to make Roquefort cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bove faces state criminal charges next year in a French court;
McDonald's decided against filing for civil action in part because
they did not want to make him a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Before drifting off to an interview with a stand-up comedian and
satirist for British television yesterday, Bove laughed at a
suggestion he would have a Big Mac for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way!'' he said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, however, did prove handy. Protestors asked for
plastic knives to cut the French bread and spread the cheese.

 &HT;    Something to crow about: A big flock flies and power dies
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKEECHOBEE, Fla. _ A flock of startled crows caused a freak
mishap that left nearly 2,000 central Florida homes without power
for much of the day Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,961 homes lost power when a flock of crows in western
Okeechobee County flew away en masse, causing the 1,500-foot-long
ground wire they were sitting on _ and bending _ to snap upward
like a giant bow string, strike a live wire, and short out.
</P>
<P>
   When workers arrived, wires were wrapped around each other.
About 700 of the homes in the area got power back shortly after the
8 a.m. incident, but the rest didn't until 6 p.m., said Ed Henne,
Florida Power &AMP; Light's Treasure Coast area operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   His company is used to problems caused by all kinds of wildlife,
but the crow problem is a new one, said Henne, a 36-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's unique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The birds couldn't have found a more delicate spot to land,
Henne said. The long wires extend over the Kissimmee River and,
under an environmental permit, the poles they connect to have to be
110-feet tall, he said. So fixing the problem was serious business,
complete with a 142-foot crane, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've assembled a 10-man crew. There's a lot of rigging to fix
that wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials never would have known how the outage happened
if it weren't for a fisherman casting a line off the State Road 70
Kissimmee River bridge, who told workers about the crows, Henne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, animals cause problems only by actually touching the
electric generators, not indirectly as in the crow incident, Henne
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they'd quit but I guess we should thank our lucky stars
that we don't have those pterodactyls that they had flying around a
million years ago.''

 By PETER HUDSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carlos Menem has long been a headline act. Whether driving fast
cars or pushing seemingly outlandish policies, the charismatic
president has made his share of both friends and enemies, but he
never fails to entertain.
 &HT;    As he exits the presidency _ though assuredly not the political
stage _ after the October elections, Menem defends his policies and
his legacy in a conversation with LATIN TRADE correspondent Peter
Hudson.
 &HT;    Excerpts from the interview:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: Will the peso devalue?
 &HT;    MENEM: No. One candidate mentioned this. I've said that it would
be suicide.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    How serious is your proposal to make the dollar Argentina's
official currency?
 &HT;    If the dollar were the common currency in the region, we
wouldn't have seen the devaluation in Brazil or Mexico, with all
its consequences. Seventy percent of the world economy is
negotiated in dollars, the same is more or less true within
Argentina. We continue to negotiate with the U.S. authorities to
realize this dream. But if not the dollar _ that will take more
time _ then we need a common regional currency.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Don't many people see using the dollar as an attack on
sovereignty?
 &HT;    Sovereignty is not what people here used to believe:
administering the railroads, gas, electricity or telephones. That
was an illusory sovereignty. The only oil company in the world that
made a loss was YPF under state control. Our telephones didn't
work. In summer, there was no power for light, or air-conditioning
or refrigerators. In winter, there was no gas. That was Argentine
sovereignty.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What is the future of Mercosur?
 &HT;    Brilliant. Many of the problems that have arisen as a result of
the current crisis are being resolved by the private sector: the
dairy producers, the automotive industry, textiles and footwear
producers. And now the presidents are in permanent contact. Before
two presidents would meet in impressive ceremonies. Now we talk by
phone and we sort out the problems.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Does Brazil act unilaterally in trade matters?
 &HT;    No, we take each other into account when we are going to take
action.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Yet when Brazil devalued, Argentina was as shocked as the rest
of the world.
 &HT;    There wasn't much warning. They announced the devaluation at the
last moment and we helped Brazil so that the results were not too
dramatic.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What about the idea that unfinished business _ especially labor
reform _ is the real root of Argentina's current economic woes?
 &HT;    I was going to mention that subject. The labor reform does not
just depend on the president. We sent a bill to Congress, which has
to approve the reform. But in Congress there are a range of vested
interests.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Other presidents _ Peru's Alberto Fujimori and now Hugo Chavez
in Venezuela _ followed your path of reforms, but they've been
criticized for breaking the rules. What's your view?
 &HT;    Figures like (Chavez) arise because of the need to implement
reforms to get their country out of trouble.
 &HT;    Years ago, Venezuela was the most powerful country in Latin
America, with an impressive wealth from oil. It was also a huge
importer because it had the resources. Then it plunged into
decadence. When Chavez took power, 80 percent of the population of
the most powerful country in the region were living in poverty.
 &HT;    Chavez won elections in a full democracy. We have to support
him, give him time and hope that things turn out well.

WTO USES CYBERSPACE TO OPEN MEETINGS, TAKES HITS FROM PHONY SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The World Trade Organization is opening some of its
Seattle proceedings to Internet visitors and hosting a cyberspace
chat room, while criticizing as deceptive and illegal an anti-WTO
Web site that closely mimics its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that while the WTO is accused of lacking
transparency, some critics who put out misleading or false
information are camouflaging their identities,'' Mike Moore, the
WTO's director general, wrote in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   The phony site, www.gatt.org, replicates the WTO's own site,
www.wto.org, down to the logo, typeface, colors and layout. It even
carries a 1999 WTO copyright notice at the bottom of the page.
</P>
<P>
   But on the fake site's ``Director-General's Home Page'' _
complete with a picture of Moore _ the message reads, ``The WTO's
purpose is to broaden and enforce global free trade. Global free
trade already gives multinational corporations vast powers to
enforce their will against democratic governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar language appears throughout the phony site, which also
contains about two dozen links to sites maintained by organizations
opposing the WTO. A site called rtmark.com claims credit for the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Though the phony site is confusingly similar in appearance to
the real thing, people seeking WTO information through search
engines won't be misled.
</P>
<P>
   The fake doesn't come up when ``WTO'' is entered in most major
engines, while the WTO's site does. It doesn't even come up when
``GATT'' (short for General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a
predecessor to the WTO) is entered. The only arguably misleading
reference appears to be the link back to the phony site from
rtmark's site, which says, ``Looking for the WTO site? Visit
www.gatt.org.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO itself is using the Internet to make some of its
proceedings more public than they've been.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a daylong symposium of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) was Webcast from the WTO's site. Tuesday through Friday, the
WTO's plenary sessions will be Webcast live in English, French and
Spanish. Webcasts are scheduled all day Tuesday and Friday, and all
day and evening Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another link on the WTO's page leads to a chat room, where
visitors from around the world can discuss eight issues, including
agriculture, development, dispute resolution and the environment.
But few people appear to be taking advantage of the forum. By
Monday afternoon, no discussion had more than four postings.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is also using its site to counter what it describes as
``a number of websites contain(ing) accusations against the WTO
which are based on incorrect information or downright falsehoods.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carlos Menem siempre ha estado en el centro del escenario. Lo
mismo conduciendo autos deportivos que imponiendo regulaciones al
parecer extravagantes, el carismatico presidente se ha ganado
amigos y enemigos, pero nunca ha dejado de llamar la atencion.
 &HT;    Al salir de la presidencia (aunque sin duda no de la palestra
politica) despues de las elecciones de octubre, Menem defiende su
estrategia y su legado en una conversacion con Peter Hudson,
corresponsal de LATIN TRADE.
 &HT;    Extractos de la entrevista:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: Se devaluara el peso?
 &HT;    MENEM: No. Un candidato menciono eso. He dicho que seria un
suicidio.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hasta que punto mantiene su propuesta de convertir al dolar en
la moneda oficial de Argentina?
 &HT;    Si el dolar fuera la moneda comun de la region no habriamos
visto la devaluacion en Brasil o en Mexico, con todas sus
consecuencias. El 70 por ciento de la economia mundial se negocia
en dolares, y mas o menos lo mismo ocurre en Argentina. Seguimos
negociando con las autoridades norteamericanas para alcanzar este
sueno. Pero si no es el dolar entonces necesitamos una moneda
regional comun.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Muchas personas consideran que eso seria una agresion a la
soberania?
 &HT;    La soberania no es lo que la gente aqui creia: administrar los
ferrocarriles, el gas, la electricidad y los telefonos. Esa era una
soberania ilusoria. La unica empresa petrolera de todo el mundo que
tuvo perdidas fue YPF cuando era estatal. Nuestros telefonos no
funcionaban. En el verano, no habia electricidad para la luz, para
el aire acondicionado, para los refrigeradores. En el invierno, no
habia gas. Esa era la soberania argentina.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cual es el futuro del Mercosur?
 &HT;    Brillante. Muchos problemas que han surgido a consecuencia de la
crisis actual los resuelve el sector privado: los productores de la
industria lactea, la industria automotriz, los textiles y los
fabricantes de calzado. Y ahora los presidentes estan en contacto
permanente. Antes, cuando dos presidentes se reunian, habia
ceremonias impresionantes. Hoy nos hablamos por telefono y
resolvemos los problemas.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Actua Brasil unilateralmente en asuntos comerciales?
 &HT;    No, siempre nos consultamos cuando vamos a entrar en accion.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Pero cuando Brasil devaluo la moneda, Argentina se conmociono
tanto como el resto del mundo.
 &HT;    No hubo mucho aviso. Anunciaron la devaluacion a ultima hora y
ayudamos a Brasil para que los resultados no fueran tan terribles.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Los planes sin terminar, especialmente la reforma laboral, son
la verdadera causa de los males economicos que Argentina sufre hoy?
 &HT;    Iba a mencionarle ese tema. La reforma laboral no depende
solamente del presidente. Le enviamos un proyecto de ley al
Congreso, que es el que tiene que aprobar la reforma. Pero en el
Congreso hay una serie de intereses creados.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Otros presidentes (Alberto Fujimori en Peru y ahora Hugo Chavez
en Venezuela) siguieron su senda de reformas, pero los han
criticado por romper las reglas. Cual es su opinion?
 &HT;    Las figuras como Chavez surgen por la necesidad de implementar
reformas para resolver los problemas del pais.
 &HT;    Hace anos, Venezuela era el pais mas poderoso de America Latina,
con una riqueza impresionante proveniente del petroleo. Tambien era
un gran importador porque tenia los recursos. Luego cayo en la
decadencia. Cuando Chavez subio al poder, el 80 por ciento de la
poblacion del pais mas poderoso de la region vivia en la pobreza.
 &HT;    Chavez gano las elecciones en un proceso plenamente democratico.
Tenemos que apoyarlo, darle tiempo y esperar que las cosas salgan
bien.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ONLY PLAYOFF TEAM ON HOFSTRA'S CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The only playoff coach at Hofstra University
on Monday couldn't say enough about his football team. How it had
not given up when it was 10 points behind last weekend, how it
refused to surrender to tragedy a month ago or earlier this season
when its star running back went down for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Joe Gardi said with all due sympathy for the
other coach on campus, ``we didn't lose our starting quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde didn't survive one game this season, but
Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi threw for 258 yards against Lehigh last
Saturday in the Division I-AA playoffs. That is why Gardi was
formulating his game plan Monday for his next round, while Bill
Parcells was nearby, making his Jets' postseason concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, they've hung in there,'' Parcells said on the
morning people awoke from a fantasy that starred Ray Lucas as
Dorothy and Parcells as the Wizard. ``But now we're in a little
different situation. I'll try my best to keep 'em going.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant along the road to nowhere, which the Jets and Giants
will start walking together Sunday at Giants Stadium. You want
football playoffs? Hofstra plays host to Illinois State in the I-AA
quarterfinals on Saturday, while over in New Jersey, Montclair
State faces Rowan in the quarters of Division III.
</P>
<P>
   The serious portion of our local pro football season is over,
miracles and mathematics be damned. After the Jets' run last year,
after the Knicks, after the Yankees and the Mets, I think we may
all ultimately benefit from one sports season devoid of provincial
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knew the score on his offense weeks ago, but played
along with the pipe dream to keep his players frothing through
their face guards. The Jets played competitively, commendably,
Sunday in Indianapolis, but reality was a fourth-and-19 Lucas
aerial to Oz, through the hands of Wayne Chrebet, sure-handed 1995
graduate of Gardi's program.
</P>
<P>
   Delving deeper inside this little family circle, Gardi is also a
Jets alumnus. From 1976 through 1984, the Harrison, N.J., native
served three Jets coaches in various assistant's roles. Next came
five years in the National Football League office as an assistant
supervisor of officials, and then he just tired of being an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   As the head man at Hofstra, he has won 81, lost 28, tied 2, but
has not ridden down Hempstead Turnpike in a championship parade.
His first year at Hofstra, then a Division III program, Gardi
reached the third round of the playoffs. His quarterback got hurt.
He hasn't been that close again, which carries us back across
campus to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The general excellence of the Jets' defense suddenly makes it
easier to wonder where they would now stand if not for Parcells'
blunder of starting the season without a capable backup
quarterback. Could they have reversed two of those early defeats?
Three? In a league of shifting power, of no sure things, who can
say they could not have won a Super Bowl without Testaverde?
Another Parcells team did exactly that, winning with a backup
quarterback, at the start of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, things change so much in the off-season, the makeup
of your team,'' Parcells said, when asked if he was now hoping to
establish momentum for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he was saying that the increasingly transient pro
game is not all that different from the college game. Which is why
Gardi said he would take the opportunity to hang in the locker room
the colorful poster he pulled from a pile in his office. It
featured a championship trophy with this inscription: The Flying
Dutchmen: We Want the Ring.
</P>
<P>
   Making the playoffs seemed questionable when Vaughn Sanders went
down early last fall, 7 yards shy of the school rushing record.
Another backfield starter was lost. A senior offensive lineman. A
month ago, the starting offensive tackle John Ciampi died suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult, but we've held together,'' Gardi said.
``It helps to have these playoff games. Everywhere on campus,
people are excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere. To drop in on the Jets, Gardi must cross
Hemsptead Turnpike, after leaving Margiotta Hall, next door to the
15,000-seat football stadium. In the pre-Parcells days, he visited
often, but hasn't bothered since last season, when a security guard
treated him like a spy from New England or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway,'' he said, ``I don't want to go over there and have
people say, `He still thinks he's coaching the Jets.'''
</P>
<P>
   He'll stay on his side of the road, where the only playoffs are.

JOSE BOVA GETS THE STAR TREATMENT IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Walking through the streets of downtown Seattle
Monday, Jose Bove got the type of treatment usually reserved for
rock stars on tour: cameras flashed, hands jockeyed to tug his
leather jacket and young women shrieked ``Jose! Jose! Jose!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a farmer,'' Bove whispered softly, shrugging as he
cut through a throng of supporters that included people wearing
black hoods, businessmen in elegant suits and folks costumed like
sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   But the 46-year-old sheep farmer from the south of France, who
sports a handlebar mustache and carries a tobacco pipe, is a
national hero in his homeland for having taken a big stand against
a food Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by Monday's public reaction, Bove's potential for
folk hero-dom on this side of the Atlantic _ at least during this
week's World Trade Organization gathering _ is red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Bove was arrested this summer for vandalizing a McDonald's
restaurant under construction in Millau to protest U.S.-imposed
tariffs on Roquefort cheese and other products. The WTO had
authorized the tariffs in retaliation for the European Union's
refusal to import hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocquefort was taken hostage by hormone-treated beef,'' Bove
explained Monday as he made his way to a downtown McDonald's for a
rally to criticize the chain he says symbolizes the reach of
multi-national, industrial food concerns.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's hurts small farmers worldwide, he believes, and
spreads ``mal bouffe'' _ French for ``bad eats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bove also sounded off against Monsanto and large companies
that create genetically modified foods _ known as GM foods or
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove hoped the 2 p.m. rally would unfold without a violent
hitch, as press from all corners of the world cataloged his every
breath.
</P>
<P>
   He had to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Push back, push back,'' he told the crowd of more than 500,
urging the masses to step a few feet away from the fastfood
restaurant where a large, homemade sign urged people to ``Resist
McDonaldization.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally had one lone flashpoint: a few anxious seconds in
which a window was shattered and someone tagged the building with
obscenity-laced graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Managers temporarily closed the eatery, locking uniformed
restaurant workers inside as people outside banged drums, cheered
and _ in one case _ deposited an uneaten hamburger at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant manager said no customers or workers were injured.
No one was sure exactly how the glass was shattered, a McDonald's
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief speech, Bove stood before a blue picnic
blanket, spread in front of the McDonald's, adorned with three lit
candles, French bread, American cheddar cheese, Gabriel Court
Roquefort, grapes and bottles of French wine _ Cabernet Sauvignon,
vintage 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lambasting fast food, Bove said: ``People don't want this kind
of food ... the food of WTO. They want safe food.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later Bove, trailed by dozens of pushing,
shoving, anxious newspeople with cameras _ clambered to the roof of
a white van parked in the middle of an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by farm representives from the United States and
India who voiced support of Bove's criticisms of the globalization
of agriculture, which they said WTO policies encourage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the van-top speakers, Prof. Nanjunda Swamy of India, drew
thunderous applause when he mentioned India's successful efforts to
keep fast food chains out of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Bill Christison, president of the National
Family Farm Coalition, said global agriculture was ``killing'' the
small farmer worldwide. ``Corporate food is bad food,'' he said
later in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to early media characterizations, Bove said he is not
anti-American. He said French farmers and American farmers share
similar concerns. ``We are in this together,'' he said, noting that
global trade waters down cultural diversity and lowers quality.
</P>
<P>
   For Bove, who looks like a college chemistry professor, Monday
was deja vu. In August, he organized the vandalization of the
McDonald's in France because the tariffs were hurting farmers like
himself who sell sheep's milk to make Roquefort cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bove faces state criminal charges next year in a French court;
McDonald's decided against filing for civil action in part because
they did not want to make him a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Before drifting off to an interview with a stand-up comedian and
satirist for British television yesterday, Bove laughed at a
suggestion he would have a Big Mac for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way!'' he said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, however, did prove handy. Protestors asked for
plastic knives to cut the French bread and spread the cheese.

 AFTER SECURITY SCARE, WTO GETS AN EARFUL FROM NGO'S
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While anti-WTO activists took to Seattle's streets
Monday, members of the trade orgainzation held a unique complaint
session inside the besieged convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some quarters, the WTO has become the institution that
people love to hate,'' British Development Minister Clare Short
told a symposium at which environmental, labor and other
organizations were allowed to voice concerns about world trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this criticism is misplaced,'' she said in her
keynote speech to representatives of so-called non-governmental
oganizations, or NGOs.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the symposium was to encourage an informal
dialogue between members of the five-year-old World Trade
organization, which sets the rules for world trade, and the more
than 700 non-governmental organizations that have been accredited
to the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the Geneva-based WTO places global trade
liberalization above other legitimate interests such as human and
worker rights and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Short, those who spoke included Mike Moore, the
WTO's new director general, Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's
commissioner for trade, and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   They got an earful of criticism once the session was opened to
three-minute comments from representatives of the many
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Khor of the Third World Network, based in Penang,
Malaysia, called the program ``less of a dialog and more of a
lecture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said numerous groups have decided they want no new round of
issues _ not investor rights, procurement, competition, biotech,
environment or labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These would put the developing countries to further
disadvantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rich countries have broken their promises to gradually open
their market to textiles and to reform their anti-dumping laws,
Khor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is not willing to do these things, one does not have
the right to portray one's proposals as a `development round.'''
Khor said. ``It is a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist group,
also said the NGO Day had been ``you speaking and us listening.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Canadian government had given out a list of private
sector news sources on WTO issues, and that they were all employer
confederations or wealthy men. ``They didn't give any of our
names,'' she said. ``We were not welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would express her opinions Tuesday, in the street.
</P>
<P>
   There was no clear theme to the voice of protest inside the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for sweeping changes of the WTO and its trade
policies; others were more measured in their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium got off to a slow start when Seattle police shut
down the convention center because of security concerns. It was not
opened until about 10:30 a.m., which delayed by a couple hours the
start of the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending had to pass through metal detectors and at one
point a parade of protestors that included the Sierra Club, members
of labor unions and animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the WTO director general, said he hoped the protests
would not overshadow the WTO's good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there could be up to 50,000 demonstrators against
us,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember: In over 30 countries, 1.5 billion want to join
the WTO,'' he said, referring to the 30 nations including China
that have WTO membership applications pending.
</P>
<P>
   He said the WTO will listen to its critics. Economic growth that
has resulted from free trade policies, he acknowledged, has caused
``pain and problems'' for many people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``freedom fighters'' of the past of now protersting the
WTO in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we goign to tell hem the old ways are best?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the WTO was in Seattle to ``open the door to working
families everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In her keynote speech, Short said liberalized trade will benefit
developing countrues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the WTO and its rules, the rich and powerful could
bully the rest as they used to,'' she said. ``Let's face it, no
rules is when the rich and powerful do bully the poor.''

   MEDICAL DEVICE RESEARCH MIXES WITH PROFIT MOTIVE
</P>
<P>
   In the world of medical devices, the lines between inventors,
researchers, promoters and investors are often nonexistent. Rare is
the truly disinterested researcher, with no stake in the outcome of
a study. It is a phenomenon found in every medical treatment using
devices, from laser surgery to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on the front line of such medical research, whose
work can help determine treatment options for countless Americans,
often can earn vast wealth as long as their results are positive.
It is an immense financial pressure that would be unacceptable in
any other field of medical research.

   EDITOR NAMED AT GEORGE MAGAZINE
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the prospect and challenges of stepping into a role
established by John F. Kennedy Jr., Frank Lalli, a former managing
editor of Money magazine, has agreed to take over as editor in
chief of George magazine. Jack Kliger, the chief executive of
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines, said he waited several months to
hire an editor because he wanted to do so only after Hachette had
bought out the Kennedy family's 50 percent stake in the magazine,
which the company did in October.

EDITORIAL: IRAN JAILS A CRITIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah Nouri, one of Iran's most popular and courageous
political reformers, has been unjustly sentenced to five years in
prison and banned from running for office until 2004. His alleged
crime consisted of publishing newspaper articles critical of
official Iranian policies. That such a harsh sentence could be
imposed for exercising basic journalistic freedoms is a measure of
how fearful and out of touch Iran's ruling conservative clerics
have become in the face of popular demands for greater democracy
and individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for change is likely to be the main theme of
crucial parliamentary elections to be held in February. Until his
sentencing last Saturday, Nouri was to lead the ticket of
candidates pledged to support the reformist policies of President
Mohammad Khatami. Iran's Islamic Constitution gives clerical
conservatives ultimate control over policy and the courts. But
Khatami, who won election two and a half years ago with an
overwhelming 70 percent of the votes, has challenged their power. A
reform victory in February could let him go further. Khatami's
support is particularly strong among young people, who make up a
large and growing share of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is an Islamic cleric once known for his support of
revolutionary fundamentalism. But in recent years he has come to
understand that Iran's revolution will only survive if it adapts
itself to popular yearnings. First as the most liberal member of
Khatami's cabinet, and later through the pages of his newspaper,
Khordad, Nouri became a fearless champion of open political debate,
improved relations with America and acceptance of Palestinian peace
talks with Israel. He also denounced as illegitimate the immense
power wielded by unelected clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by the prospect of severe punishment, Nouri
skillfully used his trial to broadcast these views to the larger
Iranian public. His words proved so eloquent that prosecutors
abruptly cut short the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Now reformers must continue their parliamentary election
campaign without Nouri, who was a top vote-getter in municipal
elections earlier this year. His forced exclusion from politics
follows last year's imprisonment of another leading reformer,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, the mayor of Tehran. If Khatami and his
reform allies can overcome the handicap of these exclusions and win
a parliamentary majority, they may be able to diminish some
clerical powers.
</P>
<P>
   With control of military and internal security forces,
conservative clerics can for now stifle the aspirations of
Iranians. But with nearly two-thirds of the population of 70
million under the age of 25, the clerics will face mounting
opposition if they fail to understand the demand for
liberalization.

ROCKETTES MOVING OVER FOR JONES TO TAKE THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chocolate-dipped strawberries were large and
luscious. The champagne was perfectly chilled. The string quartet
was melodiously soothing. Boxing was the only thing that seemed out
of place at Radio City Music Hall Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Jones Jr., the undisputed light-heavyweight champion, and
David Telesco descended the spiraling staircase into the Art Deco
lobby, both with a Rockette on each arm, to announce that they will
meet at Radio City Music Hall in a 12-round title bout on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The match, which will be telecast on HBO, will be the first
sporting event to take place at the theater, which recently
underwent a $70 million face lift.
</P>
<P>
   The ring for the fight will be set up on the stage, which will
be lowered by about two feet. Tickets will be sold for 5,500 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he relished the opportunity to be the first boxing
champion to fight at Radio City Music Hall, because he is always
looking for challenges. In 1996, Jones, arguably the best boxer in
the sport, played in a basketball game in the afternoon and scored
a 12th-round technical knockout against Eric Lucas that night.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first major boxing match in New York City since
the controversial Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight
unification bout at Madison Square Garden on March 13. That fight,
which arrived with a huge buildup, disappointed almost everyone
involved, ending in a controversial draw that spawned an
investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office that is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at HBO and Madison Square Garden are hoping that a
good showing by Jones and Telesco in a fabulous showplace like
Radio City will go a long way toward erasing some of the bad
feelings left by the Lewis-Holyfield match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't change the perception of boxing itself,'' Jones said.
``But it will allow people to see that there are some boxers who
can go to another level. It will show that not all boxers have a
poor background. People will get a chance to see that I'm a great
athlete, who happens to be a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   This bout represents both a change of site and a change of
opponent for Jones (40-1), who will turn 31 the day after the bout.
Jones was originally supposed to fight Graciano Rocchigiani of
Germany at the Garden. But the Knicks were playing at the Garden on
Jan. 15, and Rocchigiani could not commit to the schedule of the
news conference in New York and to the date of the fight. So, the
fight was shifted to Radio City, which is owned by Cablevision, the
parent company of Madison Square Garden, and Rocchigiani was
replaced by Telesco (23-2).
</P>
<P>
   Jones last fought in New York City when he appeared at the
Garden on July 18, 1998, beating Lou Del Valle of the Bronx in a
12-round decision to add Del Valle's World Boxing Association title
to his World Boxing Council title.
</P>
<P>
   In Telesco, of Port Chester, N.Y., Jones will face another New
York-bred fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Telesco, 31, has pestered Jones for a fight for the last year
and a half. He has had people carry signs at Jones' bouts, trying
to bait Jones into a match, and he has shown up at Jones'
post-fight news conferences shouting at Jones to make the fight.
But Jones said it will not raise the level of animosity for the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to respect a guy like that,'' Jones said. ``For him
to know he's going to get beat as bad as he's going to get beat and
still go around begging for that beating, you have to respect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Telesco, who has never been to Radio City _ not even for the
Christmas show _ does not feel overmatched against Jones. He said
that he promised his mother, Mary Teresa Telesco, who died while he
was serving a jail sentence for drug possession from 1993 to 1996,
that he would someday win the world light-heavyweight championship.
That drove him to challenge Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay on top of him so I would be forgotten,''
Telesco said. ``I wanted Jones to remember me. I wanted him to look
in the mirror and say, `I'm ashamed of myself for ducking this
guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two of them will have a chance to work out their differences
on one of the most famous stages in New York City. HBO plans to use
eight cameras to televise the fight, and two big screens will be
set up on the side of the stage. The cable network is accustomed to
broadcasting boxing in nontraditional sites. Two years ago it
broadcast a ``Boxing After Dark'' show at the Apollo Theater in
Harlem.

MAKING TOP DOLLAR FROM COLLECT CALLS BY PRISON INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Fla., Ill., N.J.) (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Smith said a telephone call from prison had been a way for
her cousin to speak to his dying mother. For Tulen Rivera, the
calls from prison are an opportunity for her three boys to speak
with their father. For Ruby Jackson, speaking by phone with her
imprisoned husband is a chance to talk without having to spend
eight hours on an overnight bus.
</P>
<P>
   But for New York state, like most other states, telephone calls
from prison are something else. They are a way to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Under state policy, the families of inmates are charged a high
rate for calls from prisons _ at least a third more than rates
available to the general public _ and most of the money is kept by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, New York made $21 million from collect
phone calls placed by inmates, one of the highest totals in the
country. The money is paid under a contract with MCI, which
provides the phone service to New York state prisons. In part, MCI
won the contract by agreeing to pay the state a larger share of its
earnings than its competitors. Under the current contract, MCI pays
60 percent of its revenue to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inmates do not have a right to make telephone calls,'' said
James B. Flateau, the spokesman for the New York State Department
of Correctional Services. ``If they are going to make phone calls,
we believe it is smart to charge a commission and use the funds to
offset the costs that taxpayers pay for inmate programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates and their families, while acknowledging an
understandable limit to public sympathy for their plight,
nonetheless say the arrangement is often painfully unfair. In many
cases, they have to pay the phone bills or lose contact with their
husbands, wives, fathers or mothers, for inmates can call only
collect from prison, and their families are often too far away to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Similar arrangements between state prison systems and phone
companies have existed for years across the country _ Ohio and
Florida each made roughly $14 million annually in recent years _
and a small handful of lawsuits, including one in New York, have
been filed charging that the practice is exploitive.
</P>
<P>
   While some states tack on surcharges to inmate calls, New York
instead requires that inmates in state prisons pay the
operator-assisted dialing rate, which is about $5.03 for a
10-minute phone call, according to MCI. A person using an 800
number to dial collect would pay $3.83 for the same call. Rates
would be much lower for a direct call. Inmates in federal prisons
dial direct, using debit cards, but New York officials say this
would be impractical for their system.
</P>
<P>
   Tulen Rivera, then, lives _ and pays _ the consequences of the
state's determination to make money on inmate phone calls. Ms.
Rivera says she usually drives to visit her husband, who is serving
his sentence near Buffalo. But she says it is hard to make the
trip, and she cannot go as often as she would like. As a result,
she spends what she estimates is more than $200 a month to have her
children speak with their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give up a lot to pay the phone bill,'' Ms. Rivera
said. ``But I think it is important that the children have contact
with their father.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmate groups argue that New York and other states should award
the telephone contract to the companies that can provide the
service at the lowest cost, rather than profiting on fees paid by
inmates' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people are poor,'' said Robert Gangi, executive
director of the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit
group that monitors prison conditions. ``They don't have the
political leverage to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   But corrections departments say it is not unreasonable to expect
inmates' families to bear some of the cost of running a prison
system. Part of the reason for the higher cost is the extra
security features that corrections departments require to prevent
prisoners from using the phones to commit fraud or other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Flateau points out, inmates are in prison as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayer provides a bed and three square meals a day, with
educational and vocational programs that will help the inmates be
successful on their release,'' he said. ``It is certainly not
unreasonable for the telephones to help pay for the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Blankenship, a spokesman for MCI Worldcom, said the company
did not set the phone policy, which is mandated by the state. MCI,
he said, had simply made the most attractive bid for the state's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In some states across the country, inmates' families have begun
to protest the amount they are charged for accepting the collect
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a state that we have encountered that does not
have this problem,'' said Kay D. Perry, chairwoman of Citizens
United for the Rehabilitation of Errants, a national prisoners
advocacy group. She said that the states should not ``be in the
business of making money'' from the inmates' calls.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and Illinois, inmates' families have filed lawsuits
claiming, among other things, that the charges are an unfair tax on
a small group. ``The families have done nothing wrong, so why are
they being taxed?'' said William T. Martin, the lawyer representing
the families in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, whose cousin is serving a 25-year sentence on a drug
conviction, estimated that she spent $100 a month to speak with
him. When his mother was dying, it was particularly important for
him to have contact with his family, she said. Ms. Smith said she
is now one of the few family members her cousin has left in New
York, and as one of the directors of a substance abuse center,
knows ``the importance of having someone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree that people can just say no to a phone call from a
family member,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Faye Plopert, who works with the New Jersey chapter of an inmate
advocacy group, said she recently received a letter from a woman
whose son is undergoing chemotherapy in prison. The woman wrote she
could not afford the $200 monthly phone bills to speak with her
son, Ms. Plopert said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Plopert, who said her son is serving a prison sentence in
New Jersey for murder, said that the state seems to be trying to
make it more difficult for families to contact inmates in person
and by phone. ``I know he has done wrong, and he needs to pay his
debt to society,'' Ms. Plopert said. But she said, ``The state is
punishing the families, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Flateau said that New York State uses most of the money to pay
for AIDS medication and treatment, and some pays for visitors'
services, including buses and waiting rooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But inmate advocates say that a vast majority of the money is
spent on health care for prisoners, which the state is required to
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the government's responsibility, and it should not
impose an unfair burden on inmates' friends and families to pay
part of that bill,'' Gangi said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies say that much of the cost faced by inmates
is due to security. While callers can typically use cheaper
methods, including dialing direct or automated collect numbers,
inmates have to use operator-assisted calling because of required
security features.
nn
</P>
<P>
   New York, like other states, requires special security features
for inmates' calls. Prisoners may call only approved numbers, and
can be monitored and taped while calling. The telephones also
automatically inform the person answering the phone that the call
is from an inmate in a state prison. The steps are intended to
prevent inmates from harassing or defrauding others.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual cost of security systems are typically much lower
than the state's earnings. Flateau said New York spent $283,000
last year to maintain the system, including the security features.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Norlander, deputy director of the Public Utility Law
Project, a consumer group, said the reason costs have risen is not
the security considerations or phone company profits, but the
commissions demanded by state governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system seeks to generate the most revenue possible
from the phone system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the Florida State Legislature
tracked the state's revenues from prison phone calls from 1990 to
1998 and found that the earnings jumped from less than $2 million
in 1990 to more than $14 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   John Mavros, executive director of the Joint Connection _ an
organization that works with the families of inmates in New Jersey
_ said the increase reflected a simultaneous growth in telephone
competition and prison population. Mavros said the newly
competitive telephone companies saw the country's skyrocketing
numbers of inmates as an untapped market, and prison administrators
saw it as a chance to support their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of communications has gotten less expensive,'' he
said. ``But the cost of making a phone call from prison has
risen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida study, which is frequently cited by inmate
advocates, also concluded that inmates with strong ties to their
families were less likely to return to prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State Rep. Allen Trovillion, whose committee issued the report,
has argued that rather than seeking the most money from the calls,
states should encourage family contact ``to see what we can do to
get these people from coming back into the system.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing studies that show that medical malpractice
causes tens of thousands of deaths each year, the National Academy
of Sciences called Monday for a new federal agency to protect
patients and said that Congress should require all health care
providers to report medical mistakes that cause serious injury or
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the academy's Institute of Medicine said that
``health care is a decade or more behind other high-risk industries
in its attention to ensuring basic safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In hospitals alone, the report said, research suggests that
medical errors kill 44,000 to 98,000 people a year. This exceeds
the number of people who die annually from highway accidents (about
43,450), breast cancer (42,300) or AIDS (16,500), the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the panel that conducted the study, William
Richardson, said, ``These stunningly high rates of medical errors _
resulting in deaths, permanent disability and unnecessary suffering
_ are simply unacceptable in a medical system that promises first
to `do no harm.''' Richardson is president of the W.K. Kellogg
Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that safety experts could prevent many of the
injuries and deaths if they systematically collected and analyzed
data on medical errors, to identify the causes. Accordingly, the
panel said that the United States should strive, as a ``minimum
goal,'' to reduce medical errors by 50 percent in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To err is human, but errors can be prevented,'' the report
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is a federally chartered but
independent organization of scientists that studies scientific and
technical issues for the government. Its recommendations carry
substantial weight in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member panel said that Congress should create a new
federal agency, a Center for Patient Safety, to set detailed
national goals for reducing medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency would be part of the Public Health Service and
would initially need $30 million to $35 million a year in federal
money, but its budget should eventually reach at least $100 million
a year, the panel said. That is slightly more than 1 percent of the
$8.8 billion a year in health care costs that can be attributed to
preventable medical injuries, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the proposed new Center for Patient Safety
could learn some lessons from other government agencies like the
Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration. The chance of dying in a domestic airline
flight or at the workplace has declined sharply in recent decades,
in part because of the efforts of these agencies, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant recommendation, the study said that
Congress should require health care providers to inform state
governments of any medical errors that cause serious harm to
patients. The requirement would apply first to hospitals, then to
doctors, clinics, outpatient surgery centers, nursing homes and
others who care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many states don't have any mandatory reporting,'' said Janet
Corrigan, the director of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report condemns the current system of handling medical
mistakes, which relies on a combination of peer review, federal and
state regulation, malpractice lawsuits and evaluations by private
accrediting bodies. ``There is no cohesive effort to improve safety
in health care,'' the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that reports on medical errors that cause serious
harm to patients should be available to the public. Ms. Corrigan
acknowledged that such information might be used against doctors
and hospitals in lawsuits filed by injured patients or their
survivors. ``That's certainly possible with a mandatory reporting
system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From the reports filed with state agencies, Ms. Corrigan said,
consumers could identify hospitals where patients have been injured
as a result of medical errors. But she said that the panel had not
specified whether the names of individual doctors should be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Monday's recommendations appear to have a good chance of being
put into effect because they coincide with efforts by the Clinton
administration and members of Congress from both parties to define
patients' rights and enhance the quality of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was initiated by the academy because of growing
evidence _ and a growing perception among experts _ that the
quality of medical care falls far short of what it could be. The
study, unlike many projects of the academy, was not commissioned by
Congress or by any government agency.
</P>
<P>
   While the public has a right to know about errors causing
serious harm, the panel said, Congress should protect the
confidentiality of information about less serious mistakes. This,
it said, would encourage doctors and hospitals to report such
incidents voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, former president of the American Medical
Association, said, ``Any error that causes harm to a patient is one
error too many.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Dickey expressed concern about mandatory reporting and
public disclosure of serious medical errors. ``On the surface,''
she said, ``it appears to be a relatively straightforward step, but
actually it engenders all sorts of problems with confidentiality
and liability. Doctors find themselves in a real bind. We
understand the importance of investigating errors early on, while
everybody has a fresh memory. But there are still insurance
companies that would advise a physician not to tell anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the academy said that federal and state
government agencies should pay more attention to the safety of
patients when they license, evaluate and regulate health care
providers. Likewise, it said, employers should focus on these
issues when they buy health care for employees, and private
accrediting organizations should devote more attention to medical
errors when they assess the performance of hospitals and other
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report said, state licensing boards should
periodically re-examine doctors and nurses to check their
competence and knowledge of safety practices.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 Americans die each year as a result of
``medication errors,'' which include the prescribing or dispensing
of the wrong drugs, the panel said. By contrast, it said, about
6,000 Americans die each year from workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of lives lost,'' the panel said, ``patient safety is
as important as worker safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Most medical errors, it said, result not from individual
recklessness, but from basic flaws in the way hospitals, clinics
and pharmacies operate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it said, pharmacists often have difficulty
deciphering the illegible handwriting of doctors who prescribe
drugs. Many drug names sound alike, causing confusion for doctors,
nurses and patients. And in a fragmented health care system,
doctors often do not have complete information about treatments
prescribed for their patients by other physicians.

INVESTIGATORS DIG FOR MASS GRAVES AT U.S.-MEXICO BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs fo new material, rewriting throughout)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexican authorities, working with a team of FBI agents, began to
excavate sites near the Texas border Monday that they believe may
hold the bodies of scores of Mexicans and Americans who disappeared
in the last several years and who are thought to have been killed
by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies, an American law enforcement official
said, was spurred by a tip from an informant recruited by the FBI,
who acknowledged complicity in several killings and identified the
locations of what he said were at least two mass graves on the
outskirts of Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city just over the border
from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The informant, a former Mexican police officer, said as many as
200 people might be buried in several graves. An American official
said the informer had passed a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   The informant told American investigators that many of those
killed had been providing information to the FBI and other American
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and American officials said the digging began Monday and
that, as yet, no human remains had been recovered. Officials said
that while they find the informer's claims credible, and they have
confirmed that many of informants for the FBI, drug agencies and
Customs Service have disappeared in recent years in mysterious
circumstance, they have no independent corroboration that drug
traffickers killed so many people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, while murders have occurred in Ciudad Juarez by
the hundreds, scores of other people have simply vanished from the
area, sometimes after being seized in broad daylight by men dressed
in the uniforms of Mexican federal or state police forces or the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutions of Mexican drug traffickers along the Texas border
have also been undermined by the disappearances of witnesses and
informants, some of whom have been kidnapped from American soil.
</P>
<P>
   According to American officials, some of those missing had no
apparent connection to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican attorney general's office, the country's chief law
enforcement arm, issued a statement Monday night confirming the
search for bodies, which was first reported by CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation is focused on resolving a series of
assassinations and disappearances related to drug trafficking,
perpetrated against Mexican and United States citizens, apparently
by members of the so-called cartel,'' the attorney general's
statement said. ``Over the last four years and possibly longer, in
Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, citizens of both nationalities have
disappeared without a trace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican authorities said they had set up toll-free telephone
lines in both countries for relatives and others with information
on missing people. The numbers are 800-338-5856 and 800-716-7852.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by citizens in both countries, including the Association
of Relatives of Disappeared Persons, the Mexican authorities
carried out a long inquiry into the disappearances, but had little
success.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,
acknowledged that drug traffickers had infiltrated a police agent
into the special unit that was investigating the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The informer who described the killings to the FBI said some had
been carried out by Mexican federal policemen who worked as hired
assassins for the drug gangs that operate from Juarez, which is one
of the main gateways for cocaine and other drugs being shipped
through Mexico into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said about 20 FBI specialists were waiting in
El Paso to receive and examine any bodies recovered in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they had been working closely with Madrazo,
who is a former human rights lawyer. Officials said the FBI began
quietly examining the case several months ago. The Mexicans were
informed about three weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A United States official said the FBI had begun its
investigation, focusing on American citizens who had been among
those who disappeared. On Monday, the Mexican authorities gave
permission to 25 FBI agents to cross into Mexico to join the
government's excavation efforts, a law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they had established a joint base for the
inquiry in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   According to CBS, one ranch was about 10 miles south of the
border, and the other 30 miles south of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have disappeared in Juarez since early 1994
vanished after being detained by men in police uniforms, or
carrying police credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty city, which forms one metropolitan area with El Paso,
straddling the Rio Grande border, was dominated by a drug gang
controlled by Amado Carrillo Fuentes. A Mexican informer told the
FBI that some of the killings had been ordered by Carrillo Fuentes,
who died in July 1997 after undergoing plastic surgery. After his
death, a wave of killings swept through Juarez and authorities
attributed them initially to a succession struggle among his
lieutenants. At least some of those killings, it now appears, may
have involved attempts by the traffickers to eliminate informers
from their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   With huge sums at their disposal, the drug traffickers long have
long had the upper hand in Juarez over government law enforcement
agencies, whose officers were often on the cartel's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But the large number of people who have disappeared in recent
years led to the creation of the Association of Relatives of
Disappeared Persons, which began putting pressure on Mexican
officials to take action. One result was the appointment of a
20-man unit under Jorge Castaneda Espinoza de los Monteros to
review all reported disappearances. Juarez has also been torn by
the killings of more than 200 women since 1993, thought to be
victims of serial killers, gangs and violent spouses. Many have
been found but about 30 have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the sites were large and that the digging
would proceed with shovels and heavy machinery.

 Dot-Com Madness Heats Up Ad World  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Dot-com madness has brought a blizzard of new revenue _ and a
multitude of new challenges _ to Bay Area advertising.
<P>
   Here in the technology epicenter, e-tailers accounted for 17
percent of spending on radio ads in the first half of the year and
11 percent of outdoor ads, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, advertising by dot-coms in conventional media nearly
tripled in the first half of the year compared to the comparable
1998 period, reaching $755 million, CMR reported.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the make-or-break fourth quarter, ``My guess is those
numbers will be off the charts _ four, five or 10 times bigger''
than in the first half, predicted Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Citron
Haligman Bedecarre Euro RSCG, a San Francisco ad shop whose
billings have doubled in the past two years to $200million.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter is crucial because venture capital for e-tailers
that fail to make a name for themselves this holiday is expected to
dry up by early next year. That will cause painful fall-out among
dot-coms and also hurt their business partners.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic jump in agency revenues is the most obvious outgrowth
of the dot-com advertising orgy. But the hot new sector has also
caused fundamental changes in the way agencies do business.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, it has put ad agencies in the driver's seat
on choosing clients, altered billing practices and caused a new
aggressiveness in the way ad space is bought and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com mania has even changed the nature of ads themselves as
agencies attempt to cut through the clutter at any cost, sometimes
sacrificing good taste _ or any taste at all.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of e-commerce ``has completely transformed our
agency,'' said Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Citron Haligman Bedecarre
Euro RSCG, a San Francisco ad shop whose billings have doubled in
the past two years to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constraint to taking on new business is not winning it,
but being able to find enough people to handle the accounts,''
Bedecarre said.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies have suddenly found themselves in the unheard-of
position of being able to select from an array of potential
clients, rather than vying with rival ad shops for every scrap of
available business.
</P>
<P>
   In introductory meetings, e-tailers now do as much pitching as
the agencies do, said Courtney Buechert, managing director of
Leagas Delaney in San Francisco. To figure out which dot-coms have
good long-term prospects, agency executives sign nondisclosure
agreements and study the e-tailers' business plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're meeting with Clorox, you pretty much know what they
do,'' said Buechert. ``Beltbuckle.com has to explain itself.'
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com income has changed business for publishers and ad
brokers as well. But even as they get fat from the ad glut, they
face challenges they never would have dreamed of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard, a San Francisco-based technology
magazine, is hard pressed to produce enough articles to keep its
ad-to-content ratio at a reasonable level, said publisher Steve
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole brand is about countering the noise,'' said
Thompson, whose weekly recently ballooned to more than 300 pages
and 70 percent ads. ``We're trying to offer a distinctive voice. .
. . The last thing we want to do is contribute to the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   For other ad sellers, the dot-com madness is like a gift from
the blue.
</P>
<P>
   At Alice 97.3, a popular rock radio station, several 60-second
spots sold recently for the astronomical sum of $6,000, said Steve
DiNardo, general manager. In last year's fourth quarter, top spots
might have gone for $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is funny money _ it's the difference between (startups
backed by) venture capital and the people who are really running a
business and have to turn a profit,'' DiNardo said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, dot-coms accounted for about 30 percent of Alice's
ad revenues, compared to less than 10 percent last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, dot-com mania is taking its toll on old-line
advertisers, ``effectively pricing them out of the marketplace,''
said Roger Becker, president of Becker Media of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations routinely bump traditional advertisers, such as
auto dealers and malls, from scheduled spots when a higher offer
from a dot-com comes in, Becker said. ``It's always been a dirty
business, but we've gotten into the arena of the surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad rates aren't the only surreal aspect of dot-com advertising;
content has also become questionable.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine ad for Luckysurf.com shows a pizza delivery boy being
greeted at the door by a nude, curvaceous blonde with a shocking
amount of exposed breast. ``Feeling lucky?'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold ads on bus sides feature a reclining young woman and
the tagline, ``I Get Paid for Doing It.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial for Cnet that ran earlier this year,
a proctologist snaps on a rubber glove and prepares to conduct an
anal exam on a young man looking for information about technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is no point of differentiation (among e-commerce
companies), advertising has gone down the tubes,'' said Denis
Scheyer, president of Scheyer/SF. ``People are resorting to potty
humor. They're resorting to bad jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ad executives don't always understand the spots. ``I see
these ads and I don't know what they're talking about half the
time,'' said Bob Coen, director of forecasting for McCann-Erickson,
a large New York agency.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some evidence that over-the-top advertising is
losing favor. Cnet moved its TV account from Citron Haligman
Bedecarre to Leagas Delaney this fall after research showed that
viewers didn't understand the point of the ads _ that Cnet is the
best source for technology information.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cnet commercials are almost a parody of clarity. In a
typical spot, a man wearing a Cnet T-shirt directs a man wearing a
shirt that says ``You'' away from a fellow whose shirt reads ``The
Wrong Digital Camera'' and toward one whose shirt says ``The Right
Digital Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that simplicity in the midst of the madness would be a
very provocative message,'' Buechert said.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable advertising is particularly tough to create for
dot-coms because ``every ad ends in www.fillintheblank.com, so that
part of the ad gets lost'' said Scheyer. ``It's as if every
supermarket commercial ended with the phrase `can of peas.'''
</P>
<P>
   The glut of ads in conventional media has inspired advertisers
to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com has been flying a bright orange blimp over the Bay
Area. Floating billboards for AdAuction.com have appeared on boats
in San Francisco Bay. Citron Haligman Bedecarre received an award
from a trade association for plastering Cnet ads on the passenger
ramps that connect airplanes to airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
   While agencies enjoy the current spate of dot-com wealth, some
are also girding against a widely-expected consolidation among
e-tailers in highly duplicative categories such as pet supplies,
personal care products and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Scheyer, for example, still has just five people on the payroll,
despite a four-fold increase in revenues since 1997. The agency's
work for eMusic, eTranslate and other dot-coms, which will generate
$3million to $4million in revenues this year, is handled largely by
a pool of 50 free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose one of our dot-coms, it doesn't bother us,''
Scheyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing practices have also changed to reflect the risk of doing
business with dot-coms. Media brokers demand payment for ad space
up front, and some agencies have followed suit for their own fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not set pen to paper before we have 50 percent,'' said
Scheyer. ``We get the other 50 percent before it goes into
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies have begun accepting stock options as part of
their compensation _ but the smart ones insist that expenses be
covered with cash, said Buechert.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options have proven to be a mixed bag for local agencies,
he said. ``Some have tried it and gotten burned; some have tried it
and it has turned out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Leagas Delaney, whose clients include Beyond.com and Red
Envelope.com, has accepted stock options as partial payment from
about one-third of its clients, said Buechert. But none of them has
gone public yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are trying to get through the fourth quarter, and
if they survive, they'll IPO by summer,'' Buechert said. ``So the
big return remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the highly-wired Bay Area, ad space in what media in the
fourth quarter sold out in record time _ and for record prices,
according to local media brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, e-tailers spent $755 million in the first half of
1999, nearly triple the total in the comparable 1998 period,
according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Spending locally, at the tech epicenter, has become
</P>
<P>
   The multiples are expected to be many times that amount in the
most-wired markets, particularly the Bay Area, during the fourth
quarter, a make-or-break period for many dot-com startups.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1999, tech companies, mostly dot-coms,
accounted for 17 percent of spending on Bay Area radio stations and
11 percent of outdoor advertising, although just 4 percent of total
ad spending, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, e-commerce companies spent $755 million in the first
half, nearly triple the total in the comparable 1998 period, CMR
found. Only about 1 percent of spending goes to ads that actually
appear on the Web; most run in conventional media: radio,
television, newspapers, billboards and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly-wired Bay Area, ad space in what media in the
fourth quarter sold out in record time _ and for record prices,
according to local media brokers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to measure fourth-quarter dot-com
spending, ``My guess is that number will be off the charts _ four,
five or 10 times bigger'' than in the first half, predicted
Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Ehringer, a top creative director at San Francisco ad shop
Leagas Delaney, used to spend his workdays brainstorming about
billboards, dreaming up taglines and directing television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But these days Ehringer has an additional duty: Evaluating the
business plans of hordes of Internet companies that come knocking
on his agency's door.
</P>
<P>
   Many startups, desperate for an advertising agency that can
catapult their brands into mass awareness, have millions of dollars
in venture capital at the ready, but little or no track record. Ad
agencies face the challenge of choosing clients with good long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're meeting with Clorox, you pretty much know what they
do,'' said Courtney Buechert, Leagas Delaney's managing director.
``Beltbuckle.com has to explain itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehringer's new role as business analyst _ which requires him to
sign nondisclosure agreements and examine potential clients'
resumes and revenue projections, among other things _ is just one
example of how dot-com mania has radically altered the Bay Area
advertising sector.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, it has put agencies in the driver's seat on
choosing clients (historically, the client has chosen the agency),
altered billing practices and caused a new aggressiveness in the
way ad space is bought and sold.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Web ad glut is an economic boon to sellers of ad
space, it also poses new challenges. The Industry Standard, a San
Francisco-based technology magazine, is hard pressed to produce
enough articles to keep its ad-to-content ratio at a reasonable
level, said publisher Steve Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole brand is about countering the noise,'' said
Thompson, whose weekly magazine sometimes balloons to more than 300
pages. ``We're trying to offer a distinctive voice. . . . The last
thing we want to do is contribute to the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Internet windfall to last forever. In fact,
many executives are forecasting a fallout among e-tailers after
this holiday season. But agencies and ad brokers in the Bay Area _
and to a lesser extent the rest of the country _ are enjoying the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1999, tech companies, mostly dot-coms,
accounted for 17 percent of spending on Bay Area radio stations and
11 percent of outdoor advertising, although just 4 percent of total
ad spending, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, e-commerce companies spent $755 million in the first
half, nearly triple the total in the comparable 1998 period, CMR
found. Only about 1 percent of spending goes to ads that actually
appear on the Web; most run in conventional media: radio,
television, newspapers, billboards and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly-wired Bay Area, ad space in the fourth quarter
sold out in record time _ and for record prices, according to local
media brokers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to measure fourth-quarter dot-com
spending, ``My guess is that number will be off the charts _ four,
five or 10 times bigger'' than in the first half, predicted
Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and outdoor ads are favored since they are cheaper than
television and enjoy broad reach among professionals who commute to
work.
</P>
<P>
   At Alice 97.3, a popular rock radio station, several 60-second
spots sold recently for the astronomical sum of $6,000, said Steve
DiNardo, general manager. In last year's fourth quarter, top spots
might have gone for $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is funny money _ it's the difference between (startups
backed by) venture capital and the people who are really running a
business and have to turn a profit,'' DiNardo said. In October,
dot-coms accounted for about 30 percent of Alice's ad revenues, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, dot-com mania is taking its toll on old-line
advertisers, ``effectively pricing them out of the marketplace,''
said Roger Becker, president of Becker Media of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations routinely bump traditional advertisers, such as
auto dealers and malls, from scheduled spots when a higher offer
from a dot-com comes in, Becker said. ``It's always been a dirty
business, but we've gotten into the arena of the surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad rates aren't the only surreal aspect of dot-com advertising;
the content has also become questionable.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine ad for Luckysurf.com shows a pizza delivery boy being
greeted at the door by a nude, curvaceous blonde with a shocking
amount of exposed breast. ``Feeling lucky?'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold ads on bus sides feature a reclining young woman and
the tagline, ``I Get Paid for Doing It.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial for Cnet that ran earlier this year,
a proctologist snaps on a rubber glove and prepares to conduct an
anal exam on a young man looking for information about technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is no point of differentiation (among e-commerce
companies), advertising has gone down the tubes,'' said Denis
Scheyer, president of Scheyer/SF. ``People are resorting to potty
humor. They're resorting to bad jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ad executives don't always understand today's dot-com
spots. ``I see these ads and I don't know what they're talking
about half the time,'' said Bob Coen, director of forecasting for
McCann-Erickson, a large New York agency.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some evidence that over-the-top advertising is
losing favor. Cnet moved its TV account from Citron Haligman
Bedecarre to Leagas Delaney this fall after research showed that
viewers didn't understand the point of the ads _ that Cnet is the
best source for technology information.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cnet commercials are almost a parody of clarity. In a
typical spot, a man wearing a Cnet T-shirt directs a man wearing a
shirt that says ``You'' away from a fellow whose shirt reads ``The
Wrong Digital Camera'' and toward one whose shirt says ``The Right
Digital Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that simplicity in the midst of the madness would be a
very provocative message,'' Buechert said.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable advertising is particularly tough to create for
dot-coms because ``every ad ends in www.fillintheblank.com, so that
part of the ad gets lost'' said Scheyer. ``It's as if every
supermarket commercial ended with the phrase `can of peas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The glut of ads in conventional media has inspired advertisers
to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com has been flying a bright orange blimp over the Bay
Area. Floating billboards for AdAuction.com have appeared on boats
in San Francisco Bay. Citron Haligman Bedecarre received an award
from a trade association for plastering Cnet ads on the passenger
ramps that connect airplanes to airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
   While agencies enjoy the current spate of dot-com income, some
are also girding against a widely-expected consolidation among
e-tailers in highly duplicative categories such as pet supplies,
personal care products and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Scheyer, for example, still has just five people on the payroll,
despite a four-fold increase in revenues since 1997. The agency's
work for eMusic, eTranslate and other dot-coms, which will generate
$3 million to $4 million in revenues this year, is handled largely
by a pool of 50 free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose one of our dot-coms, it doesn't bother us,''
Scheyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing practices have also changed to reflect the risk of doing
business with dot-coms. Media brokers demand payment for ad space
up front, and some agencies have followed suit for their own fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not set pen to paper before we have 50 percent,'' said
Scheyer. ``We get the other 50 percent before it goes into
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies have begun accepting stock options as part of
their compensation _ but the smart ones insist that expenses be
covered with cash, said Buechert.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options have proven to be a mixed bag for local agencies,
he said. ``Some have tried it and gotten burned; some have tried it
and it has turned out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Leagas Delaney, whose clients include Beyond.com and Red
Envelope.com, has accepted stock options as partial payment from
about one-third of its clients, said Buechert. But none of them has
gone public yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are trying to get through the fourth quarter, and
if they survive, they'll IPO by summer,'' Buechert said. ``So the
big return remains to be seen.''

 &HT;    Converting an IRA to a Roth &HT;    By Arthur Louis
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Q: &LR;  I would like to take some money out of one of my &LR; 
 &LR; individual retirement accounts and convert it to a Roth &LR;   &LR; IRA (I
don't have one yet). However, I don't know whether I am &LR;   &LR; permitted
to do this, because I don't have any wage income. All &LR;   &LR; I have is
nontaxable disability income, dividends and interest. &LR;
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &LR;  A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says
that even though you don't have taxable wages or professional
income, you may be entitled to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth.
But you can do so only if you and your spouse (if you have one)
don't have total adjusted gross income greater than $100,000 in the
year you make the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to convert, remember that you must pay taxes on the
earnings from the old IRA, as well as on any deductible
contributions you may have made.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a new Roth from scratch, rather than rolling funds
over, is a different story. To create a new Roth, you or your
spouse must &UR;  &LR; have some taxable wages, salary or professional
income.
</P>
<P>
   You can piggyback on your spouse's income if you don't have any
yourself. If your spouse has at least $4,000 in wages, each of you
can contribute the maximum of $2,000 to your new Roth. If your
spouse earns less than that, your total IRA contributions are
limited to that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, there are income limits at the upper end. A single
person whose adjusted gross &UR;  &LR; income exceeds $110,000 cannot create
a Roth, while the limit is $160,000 for a married couple filing
jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The rules applying to IRAs are about as complex as anything in
the tax code. Any taxpayer who has an IRA, or is thinking about it,
ought to get a copy of Internal Revenue Service Publication 590.
You can download it from the Internet at  &LR; www.irs.gov &LR; . Or, you can
order a copy by telephone, toll-free, at (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   Checking FDIC Insurance
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a bank, especially one located out of state, advertises
attractive rates on certificates of deposit, how can you check that
they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: If you have access to the Internet, go to the FDIC's Web
site. Go to the agency's search engine at
 &LR; www2.fdic.gov/structur/search &LR;   &LR; /findoneinst.cfm &LR; . You will see a
prompt directing you to enter the name of the bank in question.
</P>
<P>
   After you have done that, click on the search button and you
will see a display indicating whether the bank is FDIC-insured _
and, if so, for how long. You also get information such as the date
the bank was founded, the location of the main office and the
number of branches.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have access to the Internet, call the FDIC's
toll-free number: (800) 276-6003.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Deductions
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, I took a tax deduction on a $2,000
contribution to a deductible IRA. The deduction was later
disallowed by the IRS, because I was enrolled in a pension plan at
work part of that year. The IRS instructed me to pay taxes on the
$2,000, which I did.
</P>
<P>
   Now I want to withdraw money from my IRA. I am not yet 591/2
years old, and therefore would be subject to the 10 percent penalty
for premature IRA distributions. But I wonder whether the penalty
would apply to the $2,000 contribution on which I have already paid
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A: No. But, there are complications.
</P>
<P>
   You can't just identify the nondeductible $2,000 and take it
out, while leaving the other money in. Because the $2,000 is
mingled with other funds that were deductible, you have to prorate
your withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how that works:
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that you have $10,000 in your IRA, consisting of your
nondeductible $2,000 plus deductible contributions and earnings. If
you withdraw money from the account, all but one-fifth of the
amount ($2,000 divided by $10,000) will be subject to taxes or
penalties. The only way you would be able to get the full $2,000
out tax-free would be to liquidate the entire account.
</P>
<P>
   When you withdraw money from an IRA, you must complete Form
8606, which indicates how much of your withdrawal is taxable and
how much is nontaxable. Also, you should get a copy of IRS
Publication 590, mentioned in the first item in this column.

 &HT;     Pro Athletes Pool Funds To Cash In on High Tech  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The 49ers may not be making many points on the field, but a number
of current and former players hope to score big in another venue:
venture capital.
<P>
   Ex-49er greats Harris Barton and Ronnie Lott yesterday said they
have raised $40 million from 99 professional athletes and that
their Champion Ventures I fund will invest it with 10 top
technology-focused venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Barton and Lott, investors include past and
present football stars Steve Young, Jerry Rice, Brent Jones, Junior
Bryant, Merton Hanks and Dan Marino; baseball players Barry Bonds,
Eric Karros and Ryne Sandberg; and basketball player Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was open only to professional sports figures worth a
minimum of $1 million with at least $250,000 to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Former offensive tackle Barton and former defensive back Lott
have both invested in high-tech stocks and have been limited
partners in previous venture capital funds. As general partners in
Champion Ventures, they don't plan to review business plans or
invest directly in hot startups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they leveraged their connections in Silicon Valley to
gain entry to an elite group of funds that close their doors to
most mortals.
</P>
<P>
   The first Champion Ventures fund-of-funds will invest from $2
million to $5 million each with Accel Partners, Benchmark Capital,
ComVentures, Crosspoint Venture Partners, Mayfield Fund, Mohr
Davidow Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Redpoint Ventures,
Sequoia Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Barton and Lott say they launched Champion Ventures to let other
pro athletes share the opportunity to invest in hot technology
startups. Given the bull market and mania for new Internet stock
offerings, some venture capital firms recently have posted
triple-digit returns.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of professional athletes ``have gotten involved with a lot
of dumb restaurant, car wash and other deals, and had a problem
with capital preservation,'' according to Barton. With venture
capital firms regularly ``ripping the skin off the ball,'' he said
he expected Champion Ventures to beat the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Barton and Lott also see their venture as a way to connect pro
athletes with venture capitalists and startup companies, opening
the way to product endorsements, speaking engagements and
post-career job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital firms get something out of the deal, too.
``This is a way to use athletes to help brand their companies,''
said Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have an ongoing relationship with Champion
Ventures that will put us and our portfolio companies in closer
contact with some of their high-visibility investors,'' noted
Mayfield Fund General Partner Kevin Fong.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like Champion Ventures should have much trouble
attracting new investors. Barton said he and Lott anticipate
closing another $40 million to $80 million fund by next summer.

   A court in Duesseldorf sentenced Maksim Sokolovic, a 59-year-old
Bosnian Serb and longtime German resident, to nine years in prison
for war crimes in Bosnia in 1992. Sokolovic, who led a paramilitary

Although the party won the most seats in the 18 district councils

IN THE SEESAW OF CURRENCIES, THE DOLLAR STANDS TALL IN THE MIDDLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One constant of financial markets is that they
regularly defy expectations. It means that losers can be winners,
analysts are caught off guard and explanations of what is occurring
sometimes must be given with a shrug of the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   These are all features of the newest leg of the Japanese yen's
rally against the dollar and the euro's plunge against both the
dollar and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Easiest to explain is how the dollar can be strong against the
euro at the same time it is weak against the yen. The dollar's
weakness is a product of what is going on in Japan, not in the
United States, while the dollar's strength has more to do with
worries about Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, this means that the dollar's stumble against the yen
is not as serious as this year's 10 percent slide might imply. In
trading Monday, the Japanese yen shrugged off intervention by the
Bank of Japan to weaken it and finished the day at 102.35 yen to
the dollar, slightly shy of the four-year high of 101.10 it set
Friday, when American markets closed early in the session the day
after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro plunged further Monday, setting new lows against
both the dollar and the yen. At $1.0095, the euro is down from
$1.0156 on Friday and almost at parity with the dollar; the euro
finished at 103.50 yen Monday. For the year, the euro is down 13.5
percent against the dollar and 21.8 percent against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The world's three major currencies are now close to a numerical
parity never seen in the currency markets: 100 yen to the dollar
and one dollar to the euro. At least that makes currency
conversions simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yen should not be as strong as it is now, but it is,''
mused David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in
Essex, Conn. ``And the euro should not be as weak as it is now, but
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Signals that currency traders would usually watch closely are
having little impact. The yen is strengthening despite the presence
of some negative economic signals, including weak Japanese
household spending in the third quarter. The euro is falling even
though new data show the French and German economies on upward
paths.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be more critical to these currency moves is a
volatile year-end environment. That climate is partly influenced by
worries about Year 2000 computer problems and partly by money
managers who are fleeing bad bets they made on the euro or are
rushing to the Japanese stock market in the hope that it remains a
good bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flows caused by the Y2K phenomenon will dominate the market,''
said Michael Rosenberg, head of global foreign exchange research at
Deutsche Bank. ``The volume of trading is not what it normally
is.'' This contributes to his sense that the dollar's decline
against the yen and the euro's slide against both the yen and
dollar have ``a feel of free fall.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Karen E. Parker, director of currency
research at Chase Securities, said, ``if you are overweight the
euro, a little bit of bad news is given a lot of weight while good
news is ignored. Japan is the mirror image; a bit of good news is
given a lot of weight and bad news is ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg thinks that in the months ahead the dollar will
rebound against the yen and the euro will rise against the dollar.
But he said money managers who agree with that outlook would not
make such bets in this environment. They are not willing, he said,
to take the risk of a 2 percent or 3 percent loss now for the
chance of a 10 percent gain later next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors bet on the euro, the currency of 11 European
countries, when it was introduced in January, Ms. Parker noted.
They lost badly as the euro fell close to parity with the dollar in
July. But they bet on it again as it rallied up to $1.0894 by
mid-October. In the swoon since, she said, they have fled faster
than they did during the euro's first slide.
</P>
<P>
   She said that European monetary officials were also hurting the
euro by creating confusion regarding the euro's importance to their
policies. Last week, the president of the European Central Bank,
Wim Duisenberg, said he was not worried about the euro's decline.
Monday, he said intervention to support the euro was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may also have worried
investors about his nation's commitment to restructuring its
economy both by inveighing against Vodafone AirTouch's proposed
hostile takeover of Mannesmann AG, and by arranging a $2.2 billion
bailout of Germany's leading builder, Philipp Holzmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan, 10 interventions since June by the Bank of Japan,
including the action Monday, have failed to weaken the yen, both
because the central bank refuses to use more radical means to
weaken the currency and because investors _ most of whom had been
out of Japan for years _ want back in. ``Investors are looking for
value and are finding it in the Japanese stock market,'' Gilmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nikkei index of 225 issues is up 50
percent in dollar terms; the Topix index of more than 1,300 stocks
is up 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts thought that a stronger yen would make Japanese
exports more expensive abroad and thus hurt sales, undermining the
economic boomlet Japan has seen this year and stopping the stock
rally. But the yen has risen 8.5 percent since Sept. 8 against the
dollar, and the Nikkei has climbed 6.9 percent in that time.
</P>
<P>
   As analysts pondered the currency moves, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said Monday that the Clinton administration
still favored a strong dollar. ``Our policy with respect to the
dollar is unchanged: A strong dollar is in the national interest,''
he told reporters, according to Reuters. ``As always, we are
watching developments in currency markets.''
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves forecasters thinking that the trend will
continue in the near term, with the yen moving to an exchange rate
of less than 100 to the dollar while the euro drops to less than $1
as well. So currency conversions could get more difficult.

 PUC Listens To 2 Sides Over PG&AMP;E's Hike  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. made its case before the California
Public Utilities Commission Monday for a huge rate increase.
<P>
   Consumer groups, in turn, made their case for why the state's
largest utility should get by with considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC hearing in San Francisco followed an administrative law
judge's ruling last month that PG&AMP;E should be allowed an annual
rate increase of $243 million. PG&AMP;E had requested $822 million.
</P>
<P>
   The utility subsequently warned that as many as 3,500 workers
could get the sack if its desired rate increase falls through. It
also said it would have to cut back on tree trimming around
electrical lines, potentially increasing fire hazard in residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides yesterday used lots of colorful charts and tossed
around a lot of big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a long, well-choreographed exercise in public
discourse that left some in the hearing room scratching their heads
and fidgeting in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gordon Smith, PG&AMP;E's president and chief executive, kicked
things off by insisting that the utility's current rates do not
fully cover its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   He placed the shortfall at ``several hundred million dollars a
year'' _ an amount that Smith said is being borne by PG&AMP;E's
shareholders in the form of reduced dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E's shareholders cannot and will not continue to fund the
difference between what service really costs and what's allowed in
rates,'' he told the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, PG&AMP;E's shareholders have been fleeing the stock in
droves. The utility's shares closed yesterday at $22.06, down 6
cents from Friday and well off its 52-week high of $34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most people in this room,'' Smith said, ``I believe lower
rates are better. But lower rates are not better at the expense of
reliability and service customers demand and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   However, representatives of consumer groups and PG&AMP;E's customers
challenged Smith's argument that reliability and service will be
endangered if the PUC approves the proposed $243 million rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Gileau, staff counsel of the Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, said the more than $800 million increase sought by PG&AMP;E
``is simply not warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the utility has overstated both its financial jeopardy
and the impact of a lower rate increase on employees.
</P>
<P>
   This position was echoed by Robert Finkelstein, an attorney for
The Utility Reform Network (TURN), who accused PG&AMP;E of trying to
soak smaller customers for upgrades required by energy-sucking
enterprises in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E says it is just responding to consumers' calls for
greater reliability,'' he said. ``This is a crock.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is expected to decide on the rate increase within the
next few weeks. A compromise remains a distinct possibility,
allowing both sides to claim partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E received some noisy support from about 300 members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, who
gathered on the sidewalk prior to the hearing to back the utility's
call for a higher increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go down to Silicon Valley and ask them what happens when
there's a glitch in the line,'' said Ken Ball, a union
representative. ``You'll find it's damned important to have
reliable energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the funds, you don't have the jobs,'' said Gary Ray,
an electric crew foreman who traveled all the way from Bakersfield
for the midday rally. ``If they lay off 3,500 employees and the
power goes out, how long do you think it's going to take to get it
back on?''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for TURN, said the union members were
merely responding to what she called PG&AMP;E's scare tactics.
``They're really being manipulated by the threat of layoffs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rich Cowart, an electric crew foreman from Concord, said
that PG&AMP;E employees have crunched the numbers for themselves and
that the threat of cutbacks is very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not easily manipulated,'' he said.

 &HT;    Redback To Buy Siara Inc. &HT;       By Benny Evangelista
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Redback Networks Inc., a Sunnyvale networking-equipment-maker that
went public just six months ago, agreed Monday to buy Siara Systems
Inc. _ a Mountain View company with no revenues, customers or
products to sell _ for $4.7 billion in stock.
<P>
   Redback sells equipment and software to cable TV and phone
companies that offer high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Redback was mainly after Siara's 170 engineers, who are
developing hardware and software to run high-speed Internet service
over fiber-optic lines. This could let Redback's customers provide
even faster Internet service than is now possible.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is only the latest transaction by companies racing to
build the backbone for new high-speed Internet networks, a race
fueled by the explosive growth of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In August, San Jose's Cisco Systems agreed to pay a whopping
$6.9 billion in stock for Cerent Corp., a privately held Petaluma
startup that is also developing equipment to help
telecommunications companies provide faster Internet speeds on
fiber-optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent Corp. and Siara Systems share a common history. Vinod
Khosla, a partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, helped found both companies.
</P>
<P>
   And several of Cerent's founders left to form Siara. Among them
were David Stiles and Greg Favour, two chip designers who also
helped design the successful K-6 and K-7 computer chips at Advanced
Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Redback Chief Financial Officer Craig Gentner is confident
Siara's engineers have the technology to expand Redback's overall
share of a projected $20-plus billion market for high-speed cable,
fiber-optic and wireless Internet communications by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of money, but to get the opportunity to address
a $20 billion market and have the lead on the competition with this
kind of veteran engineering team on both sides, I think, this is
just a phenomenal deal,'' Gentner said.
</P>
<P>
   Siara will let Reback ``leapfrog'' over competitors like Cisco
and Nortel Networks Corp., said analyst Barry Sine of Kaufman Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Redback's perspective, it's a great strategic fit,'' Sine
said. ``It shores up Redback where it needed to be shored up,'' in
the fiber-optic area.
</P>
<P>
   What Siara gains form the deal is Redback's sales and marketing
staff _ something Siara hadn't even started to assemble, said Sine.
</P>
<P>
   Redback's sales and marketing staff could shorten hasten its
product launch, said Sine, who retained his ``strong buy''
recommendation on Redback.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Steven D. Levy of Lehman Brothers agreed the deal made
strategic sense for both companies. However, Levy said he
questioned whether the companies were overstating the overall
dollar value of the deal for Siara's shareholders because it is
based on what he called Redback's currently overvalued stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Redback stock, which debuted at $11.50 per share in May, closed
yesterday at $150, up $13.50.
</P>
<P>
   Redback sells equipment and services to about 120 regional phone
companies and cable providers, including Qwest, UUNET, Bell Canada
International Corp. and GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It posted a net loss of $9.16 million on revenues of $38.1
million for the first nine months of 1999. Last year, it lost $9.9
million on revenues of $9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gentner said the company only expects to break even for fiscal
year 1999. Still, he hopes the Siara deal will let the company turn
a profit by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Redback will issue 31.3 million shares of stock to acquire
Siara. That will give Siara's owners a 38 percent stake in Redback.
</P>
<P>
   Redback President and CEO Dennis Barsema will remain CEO of the
combined company, with Siara CEO Vivek Ragavan becoming president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will keep Siara's headquarters and development
center in Mountain View and a development center in Vancouver,
British Columbia.

ROBERT BINGHAM, A PUBLISHING SCION AND AN AUTHOR, 33 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Bingham, the author of a collection of short
stories and a member of the prominent Kentucky newspaper publishing
family, died Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 33.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death is under investigation, said Ellen Borakove,
a spokeswoman for the Office of the City's Chief Medical Examiner.
The police said they found no signs of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham's first novel, ``Lightning on the Sun,'' is scheduled
for release by Doubleday Broadway in May. In a review of Bingham's
1997 short story collection, ``Pure Slaughter Value,'' Gardner
McFall wrote in The New York Times Book Review that his stories
dealt with ``men in their 20s and 30s gripped by an indefinable,
irremediable malaise.'' He praised Bingham for evoking ``the
contemporary scene with acute observational powers and clean,
reportorial prose,'' though he called the characters ``curiously
unsympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham's editor at Doubleday Broadway, Gerald Howard, said the
writer's forthcoming novel was a literary thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, whose first short story appeared in The New Yorker when
he was 26, helped found and edit Open City, a new literary
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Brown University in 1988 and received a master
of fine arts degree from Columbia University in 1994. He worked for
two years as a reporter for The Cambodia Daily in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham was born in Louisville, Ky., where his family owned The
Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times. His father was the
assistant publisher of both papers; his grandfather, the late Barry
Bingham Sr., was the editor and publisher. His great-grandfather,
Judge Robert Worth Bingham, was ambassador to Britain from 1933 to
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham is survived by his wife, Vanessa Chase, whom he married
in May; his mother, Joan Bingham of New York City and Washington,
and his sister, Clara Bingham, of Washington.

   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ A decade after leading Namibia to
independence, President Sam Nujoma's party faces the first bona
fide challenge to its political leadership this week when voters
elect a president and new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   While the party, the South West Africa People's Organization, is
almost certain to retain control of the presidency and Parliament,
a breakaway party formed this year appears likely to chip away at
the its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for independence from South Africa, which occupied the
country in defiance of the United Nations, remains fresh in the
memories of many people here, and loyalty to the guerrilla movement
that waged that fight is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   A country of about 1.7 million people, Namibia has been notable
among its neighbors for its relative political and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not without problems. Economic growth has slowed
considerably in the last several years. The public health system
has been overwhelmed by AIDS. Schools have been criticized for
failing to improve education. Thousands of Namibian soldiers have
been sent to Congo, at great expense, to help battle rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Namibia is no different from many other African countries in
that the first few years of independence are dominated by
personality and party loyalty and symbolism,'' Andre DuPisani, of
the University of Namibia, said in an interview. ``Now, I think we
are seeing the emergence of the issues as important.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people behind Swapo, as the governing party is known,
still care less about roads and schools than about liberation and
loyalty. ``I will die a member of Swapo,'' Ndahafa Johannes, 36,
who joined at age 13, said after a rally outside party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the party into the voting, which takes place Tuesday and
Wednesday, will be the movement's father, President Nujoma. First
elected president in 1990, he was re-elected in 1994 to what should
have been a second and final term. But a constitutional change
pushed through Parliament by Swapo has let Nujoma, 70, run again.
</P>
<P>
   With control of almost three-quarters of seats in Parliament,
far more than the two-thirds needed for constitutional amendments,
Swapo can ignore the existing opposition without consequence.
</P>
<P>
   But long as the party goes unchallenged, the country's problems
will not be solved, said Ben Ulenga, presidential candidate of the
new party, the Congress of Democrats. ``There is a feeling that
they are there forever and therefore they can do exactly what they
want,'' said Ulenga, 47, who quit Swapo and his post as ambassador
to Britain last year, frustrated by the party's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the official opposition party, which was fashioned by the
old apartheid regime, the Congress of Democrats aims for the masses
that have supported Swapo. Ulenga's background is likely to give
him credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, he comes from Namibia's largest ethnic
group, the Ovambo. Active in the struggle for liberation, he spent
several years imprisoned on South Africa's notorious Robben Island
after being captured. For many years after independence, he was a
loyal Swapo leader, serving in the party and in government.
</P>
<P>
   Proud as he is of his past, Ulenga now has to persuade voters
that Swapo's role in the struggle did not earn it eternal loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is not a good enough reason to support a party,'' he
said. ``We have to look to the future.''

TRADE MINISTERS GATHER FOR RAUCOUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With deep divisions among themselves and with tens of thousands
of protesters threatening to shut them down, trade ministers from
135 nations Tuesday gather in Seattle for a difficult round of
talks aimed at reducing barriers to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The third meeting of the five-year-old World Trade Organization
promises to be a free-wheeling global town hall on the virtues and
vices of globalization, as the world's trade ministers try to speed
up trade liberalization and a panoply of protesters try to slow
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the ministers got their first hint of what promises to
be a raucous weeklong debate when a security scare at the
convention center delayed a forum for hours and forced thousands of
delegates and reporters to spend a chilly damp morning standing on
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Children costumed as endangered species wandered the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A French sheep farmer angry over tariffs on cheese led a march
on a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro begged off, saying he was worried he
might be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, who arrives in Seattle Wednesday morning,
is already altering his schedule to acknowledge the unhappiness in
the air. He promised Monday to hold closed-door meetings with
critics Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the delegates hit town, many were predicting
failure _ often a brinksmanship tactic employed by trade
negotiators but also an indication of the difficulty of reaching
compromise by the close of the meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is demanding to talk about U.S. tactics to protect
politically sensitive industries like steel. The United States
refuses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists on talking about European subsidies to
protect agriculture. The Europeans refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, trying to placate its critics, is
pushing the causes of labor and the environment, but they seem to
have persuaded few other nations to join the cause. And labor and
environmental leaders, apparently smelling fear in the air, began
proclaiming victory even before the talks began, saying that the
disarray is a testament to the power of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The security scare at the convention center Monday, triggered
when a guard spotted a broken lock, had an ironic effect: the WTO
had to delay the one major event it had scheduled at which critics
could speak directly to trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Police swept the building and turned up nothing. The symposium
for non-governmental organizations proceeded, a little late and a
little abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   But the day offered a preview of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   The city was thick with politicians and dignitaries, many of
them with an ax to grind. Interest groups tried to defend their
cause _ domestic and foreign sugar producers, for example, held
competing events to debate the merits of how the United States
protects its politically powerful sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing for a new trade round that
would be limited to a few topics with strong domestic appeal, such
as agriculture and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much disagreement that trade officials at the WTO's
headquarters in Geneva were unable even to come up with an agenda
for this week's gathering in Seattle, so the ministers are meeting
without a script. Their goal is by Friday to come up with an agenda
for a global round of trade liberalization talks that would be
launched here and continued over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Unsexy as these topics may be, the so-called Millennium Round
has already engaged the public more than any previous round of
global negotiations. The WTO has become the focal point of a broad
set of global anxieties about the sovereignty of nations and the
power of multinational corporations. The very tenor of this week's
meeting is being dramatically affected by those fears.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart promised a
boring week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is a student of trade negotiations will find it's
akin to watching paint dry'' Lockhart said. ``It is not the most
exciting thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's own schedule is being shaped by the domestic
political tumult that has greeted the WTO. Two of the Democratic
Party's top constituencies, the environmental and labor movements,
are leading the protests against the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is spending Tuesday in California, is to arrive in
Seattle early Wednesday and then spend about 30 hours in town,
talking up the benefits of trade, attempting to mollify critics,
and urging delegates to embrace the needs of workers and the
environment even as they work to lower trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   He is to spend much of his time at the Port of Seattle, touring
a control tower that directs marine traffic and a transit shed
where he will see apples, hay and newsprint readied for export, as
well as a Weyerhaeuser ship handling exports of forest products.
Clinton plans to give a major trade speech to a group of local
farmers, elected officials, and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning
Clinton is to address WTO ministers, hold private meetings with
environmental and labor leaders, and sign an International Labor
Organization convention against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is essentially a committee of its member governments,
operating by consensus as the members try to forge agreements to
eliminate protectionist tariffs. But the movement to free trade
around the world has become increasingly controversial as many
tariffs are removed and countries increasingly challenge the
non-tariff barriers to trade, such as labor laws and environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's symposium for non-governmental organizations was a
first for the WTO, which considers itself an organization of
governments and whose members often resist direct conversations
with non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came to protest WTO policies said they expected little
of substance to emerge from this week's discussions. Generally,
they termed WTO's Non-Governmental Organization Day _ the official
forum for enviornmental, labor and other groups _ a flop. Activists
in forums outside the official WTO pre-meetings sensed they were
winning at least some points in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get disoriented when I think we may be about to
win one,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of the Canadian Parliament,
who cited ``the obvious confusion of the (WTO) leadership about
whether they're going to come out of this with what they thought
they would. ... I think we're on the beginning of a bit of a roll.
I want to be hopeful _ we've lost these things so many times _ but
I want to be hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists are working to head off plans to apply the free trade
rules to investments. They also are working to short-circuit plans
for liberalized trade in timber and other forest products, and
other goods as part of the so-called acellerated tariff
liberalization idea. They also want the WTO to butt out of
discussions over genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly obvious at the moment that the negotiators are
in deadlock,'' said Ronnie Hall of Friends of the Earth's United
Kingdom office. ``They're not going anywhere. It seems there is a
lot of hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   American business is trying to turn public opinion around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first goal is educating the American public, workers and
some policy makers that overwhelming evidence supports expanded
trade in today's global economy,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president
of National Assocaition of Manufacturers. ``The integration of
America into the global econmy has mvoed forward so rapidly that
people dont understand it and the benefits associatiend with it.
... They are susceptible to the demagogic arguments that trade is a
race to the bottom ... when there's no evidence for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is making a concerted effort to
placate protesters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy, the main
negotiator for the United States, delivered a forceful speech
Monday promising that the America will stick to its proposal to
expand world trade rules to cover labor rights, although it is the
most controversial issue among WTO members.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions, Barshefsky said, ``It is astonishing to me that so many
other countries feel so threatened by the inclusion of these
issues. We intend absolutely to persist in this, and not just in
Seattle, because these issues are fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of union leaders, who included AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney, broke into applause. Sweeney had said before the
meeting that it wasn't clear how strongly the Clinton
Administration supports labor rights abroad. ``We'll see,'' he
said. ``After the agreement with China, I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lamy,trade commissioner for the European Union, said he
opposed a proposal by labor unions to allow WTO trade sanctions
against countries that violate labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are not on the agenda,'' he said, proposing instead
a joint committee of the WTO and International Labor Organization
that ``has nothing to do with imposing advanced social standards on
countries that cannot afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has particular importance for Washington state, the
most trade dependent in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke called on the Clinton administration to hold
firm to policies aimed at opening foreign markets and creating fair
competition in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that other countries are not putting
United states products and commodities at a competitive
disadvantage becaue of the huge subisidies,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that puts our companies and employees at a competitive
disadvantage, and this round of the WTO must address these issue.''

<P>
   When Wynn Smith begins designing a new collection, he approaches
the matter the way he would sit down to write a short story. First,
he manufactures a character, then conjures for her the kind of
detailed biography that could serve as a model to creative-writing
students in many an MFA program.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the fourth season he has turned out his
youthful line called Wink, Smith, 34, envisioned a girl named
Amanda Norwood. He had her grow up in Virginia, the daughter of a
strict military family. She worked bitterly hard in high school _
like Reese Witherspoon's striving teenage politico in the film
``Election,'' Smith explained. She attended West Point but then, in
a twist deserving a place on an after-hours cable program, landed
at the Playboy mansion as Hugh Hefner's intern.
</P>
<P>
   The previous season's protagonist, dreamed up by Smith and
Wink's creative director, John Vertin, was a girl named Angel who
fled her Midwestern hometown in the 1930s and, well, things get
complicated from there.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith's Angels and Amandas are far-fetched, the clothes he
puts them in are not. Looking at the pieces, including T-shirts
with the names of bands on them, it might not be easy to guess that
some in the fashion world consider Smith to be among the most
gifted young people designing today, a tailor in the classic
tradition, capable of directing a grand Parisian house. When
Women's Wear Daily recently asked Linda Dresner, owner of the
influential Park Avenue boutique that bears her name, who in her
opinion should take over the venerable ready-to-wear division at
Yves Saint Laurent, she answered Wynn Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dresner's comment makes sense when you consider Smith's
earlier work, which was more inventive, though less financially
viable, for a defunct label known as Wynn. It is tempting to read
into his career trajectory from innovator on the fringe to more
conventional commercial success an allegory for how young designers
fare in America, a country that, increasingly, would live in
Dockers if it could.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are slightly quirky, somewhat off, but ultimately
simple, sellable pieces, rarely costing more than a few hundred
dollars. There are tweeds with metallic threads, short cotton
shirtdresses, khaki blazers with pockets that sit purposely too
high, bikinis bizarre only when he shows them on the runway over
pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the basis of other work, however, that Smith developed
his initial following among fashion cognoscenti, a group very
different from the Jane magazine demographic he outfits now.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1980s, Smith designed and sewed
custom-made suits and evening wear for San Francisco society women.
``I was making difficult things,'' Smith said recently in his tiny
Geary Street studio in San Francisco. ``My hands would be bleeding.
It was self-torture.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Smith, who has lived in San Francisco for the last 16
years, started unveiling small collections of couturelike clothes
in New York under the label Wynn. They gained fans and customers
like the fashion editor Polly Mellen and Amy Fine Collins, a writer
in the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame .
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes were serious, not wacky deconstructed messes,''
Ms. Collins recalled. ``His stuff didn't look like anyone else's.
It was experimental but very refined at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's wear designer Gene Meyer said, ``It reminded me of
Balenciaga.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith showed his first collections in a suite at the
Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where visitors recall being greeted at the
door by the designer in his pajamas and bare feet. One of the
visitors who came to see Smith's Wynn work was Catherine Detliner,
a buyer for Linda Dresner, among other fancy shops. Ms. Detliner
was so impressed she called people from the hotel and told them to
come check out the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's the best American designer I ever found,'' she
said a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dresner soon began carrying the clothes (generally costing
$1,000 and up). Sales were decent but not great, she said.
Beginning in 1995, Wynn shows were held at Ms. Dresner's New York
shop, with the lower-priced, more trend-conscious Wink collection
introduced along the way, too. In 1998, when it became clear to
Smith that Wink was more financially viable, he stopped designing
his high-end line.
</P>
<P>
   At whatever price, Smith's clothes bear the precision one might
expect from a young man taught to sew as a child by a
great-grandmother named Gertrude Pilkington. Smith and his sister
were brought up in Arkansas by their grandparents, Eveyln and
Winifred Smith, who were doting, if conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother thought curly hair was the downfall of
America,'' Smith joked over lunch at a favorite local restaurant
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith's grandmother encouraged his wish to attend the
Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in San Francisco.
When he graduated, at 22, he came to New York and landed a job with
Geoffrey Beene, one of his idols _ ``wheeling bust forms and
folding gloves'' in the showroom, Smith recalled. Creatively
unfulfilled but too intimidated to apply for a job as one of
Beene's design assistants, he soon returned to San Francisco, where
he took lessons in pattern making and sewing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith eventually became so enamored of the technical aspects of
making clothes that he spent an entire summer perfecting a pair of
pants cut on the bias. For one of his Wynn collections, he spent
$30,000 on fabric for a relatively small number of sample garments.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the first to admit that if Wynn didn't take off in ways
he might have hoped, his own self-indulgence was partly to blame.
Many adventurous designers produce unwearable fantasy pieces, but
their collections are often diverse enough to support them. Smith's
were not. ``I was showing see-through things with nothing to go
under them,'' he said. ``At that price point, it's irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He once labored to make a seamless dress out of three circular
panels. ``I thought, `Isn't this amazing?''' he recalled. `` `I'm a
genius!' Well, no one cared. No one cares if something has no
seams.''
</P>
<P>
   The dress did grace a window at Bergdorf Goodman next to a John
Galliano piece.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith started Wynn, he also seemed to lack focus. A
well-mannered teenager, he rebelled in his late 20s, he said. When
he would show in New York, he and his sister and muse, Mink Smith,
would take the red eye from San Francisco and head for the Sound
Factory, a club, at 6 a.m. Once, in his rush to get there, he left
half the collection at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's current efforts at rebellion appear to take place
largely in the subversive atmosphere he creates at his Wink shows.
At his spring 2000 show in September, the techno-music was loud and
models were made to seem younger and angrier than they probably
were. Some had hair styled into menacing peaks. They walked
furiously, many in sneakers, looking like 15-year-olds determined
to get away from go-nowhere lives full of pimple-faced boyfriends
who sit around listening to White Snake and drinking Colt 45. Maybe
these Amanda clothes were their passport.
nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something to be said for the fact that Wink
offers well-constructed clothes at reasonable prices. It can also
be forward thinking. Smith was churning out blouses with ties long
before they turned up all over European runways last month. The
line is selling well in the Co-Op at Barneys New York. Kirna
Zabete, the shop in SoHo, has increased its order for next season,
and Bergdorf's will begin offering the clothes in the spring. Ms.
Dresner finds flashes of Smith's brilliance in Wink, and continues
to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Wink has its admirers among editors _ and stylists, including
Lisa Marie Fernandez, who said: ``There are a lot of designers out
there who can make a nice peacoat, but they don't have something to
say. Wynn has something to say.'' But there are those who lament
Smith's transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking for that great American young person,'' said
Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director. ``He was on the wave of
becoming huge. I wish he'd get back to his collection,'' she added,
referring to the Wynn line, though she also admires Wink.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Baume, a former Vogue fashion editor and a Wynn fan, said
that when she first saw Wink, it seemed to be coming from a
different person from the one she had known. ``It was weird,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Smith claims not to miss the demands of producing a high-end
label all that much. ``Different people see different things in
Wink,'' he said. ``I can reach more people with it. It's not so
alienating.''

THESE COYOTES MAY BE MOST WILY OF THEM ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With three teams tied atop the Pacific Division,
Western Conference and the NHL itself, it would seem the greatest
success stories would be the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks,
because neither made the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   But as the season opens its third month Wednesday, the Phoenix
Coyotes might be on the biggest roll. They are 15-6-3 and have 33
points in 24 games, one fewer than the Kings and four fewer than
the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Their 4-3 victory over Detroit on Sunday was their sixth in a
row, tying them with Boston for the longest streak this season. It
capped a week in which they defeated New Jersey, Colorado and the
Red Wings. Those teams won four consecutive Stanley Cups before
Dallas did it last June.
</P>
<P>
   It is still four months to the playoffs, but beating teams like
that is critical for the Coyotes, who have lost four straight times
in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   That can be just as disappointing as not making them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, but we're really not getting too worried about
what's going on right now,'' said Shane Doan, who had two goals
against Detroit and now has seven after scoring six all last
season. ``This isn't when it counts. It's April that's big for us.
Right now, we're just trying to keep a businesslike approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best sign of a real winner is when everyone contributes.
Last week, Jeremy Roenick scored two hat tricks and slumping Keith
Tkachuk had the game-winning goal against the Kings at Staples
Center. Doan scored twice against Detroit, and the Coyotes came
back from a 2-0 deficit that started when enforcer Louie DeBrusk
scored his first goal in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   And now they have another hero in goalie Bob Essensa, an
undefeated backup (6-0-1) who will be starting the next six weeks
now that newcomer Sean Burke is out six weeks with a partially torn
tendon in his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had 90 points during the regular season last year and
was expecting to play Detroit in the second round. But somehow the
St. Louis Blues got in the way and the Coyotes went home.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, top goalie Nikolai Khabibulin decided to
hold out. An unrestricted free agent, Khabibulin thought his 2.13
goals-against average in 63 games would be enough to get a new
contract. The Coyotes aren't budging.
</P>
<P>
   Are they the best team in the West?
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are 2-0-1 against the Kings, but 0-2 against the
Sharks. And though Phoenix won in Detroit, the Red Wings were
playing without 10 front-liners, including Sergei Federov and
goalie Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   But consider:
</P>
<P>
   __When Roenick scores a point, which he did Sunday with an
assist on the first of four third-period Phoenix goals, the Coyotes
are 12-1-1. When he doesn't score, they're 0-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   __They beat New Jersey, Colorado and Detroit by a combined score
of 15-5.
</P>
<P>
   __The Coyotes' red-hot line of Roenick, Tkachuk and Dallas Drake
had 12 goals and 24 points in the five games before Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   __For the sixth time this season, Phoenix avoided a loss Sunday
after falling behind by two goals. And it was the fourth time the
club stormed back to win. That's something the Coyotes managed to
do only twice during the previous two seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than the alternative,'' Coyotes first-year coach
Bob Francis said. ``We're just taking it a game at a time. We were
looking at these three games in a 60-hour stretch to see where we
stood in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequent flyer: Since leaving the Mighty Ducks in June 1998,
goaltender Mikhail Shtalenkov has played for Nashville, Edmonton,
Phoenix and now Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He recently was traded for Burke even though he was the No. 1
goalie in the absence of holdout Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov was surprised when he heard he was headed for Florida
because he had such a great October, going 7-2-2 with a 1.80
goals-against average and .931 save percentage to be named the
NHL's Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably scared them to death when I lost the last four
games, so that was probably my mistake,'' Shtalenkov said of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is in first place in the Southeast Division. Panthers
coach Terry Murray said he expects Shtalenkov probably will play 20
games the remainder of the season to make sure starter Trevor Kidd
knows he is the No. 1 guy.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up: By losing to the Rangers 6-3 Wednesday, the
Lightning's home winning streak was broken at five games _ one shy
of a franchise record set in the team's only playoff season,
1995-96. The fifth win came over the Flyers, who lead the Northeast
Division.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, a 4-1 victory, backup goalie Zac Bierk, 22, made
30 saves for his second NHL win and first since March 30, 1998.
Bierk's brother is Sebastian Bach, lead singer of the heavy metal
band Skid Row. The only reason Bierk was up with the Lightning was
because Dan Cloutier injured his groin. Then, Kevin Hodson pulled a
groin in the morning workout. Bierk found out he was playing about
90 minutes before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Great debut: No NHL team ever had chosen a goalie as high as the
New York Islanders did in 1997 when they made Roberto Luongo the
fourth overall pick. Now you know why.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game, Luongo made 43 saves against the potent
Boston Bruins. Nine of those shots were by Dave Andreychuk, eight
more by Anson Carter. That was only three fewer than the entire
Islanders team had. But Luongo didn't budge. He was called up Nov.
22 after going 6-6-3 in 15 games in the minors.

THE BIG GAME IS ESPN VS. BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal trial between ESPN and Major League
Baseball, which starts Dec. 6 in Manhattan, promises to be a dandy
for its revelation of financial details and its demonstration of
long-simmering hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is suing its partner to prevent baseball from terminating
their regular-season contract after the just completed season,
three years before its scheduled 2002 expiration.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN wants to keep intact its contract: 80 games on Sundays,
Wednesdays and holidays, and ``Baseball Tonight,'' make up crucial
programming for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball wants to divorce ESPN because of rage and cash. Or
is it cash and rage? Baseball's hierarchy was infuriated last year
when ESPN purchased National Football League rights for $600
million annually, which led the cable network to propose
transferring three Sunday night baseball games in September to
ESPN2 to make room for pigskin.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball refused to approve the shift of the games _ and wrested
them from ESPN to let the teams show them on their local TV outlets
_ to avoid seeing them relegated to ESPN2, which has 11 million
fewer subscribers than ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, baseball canceled ESPN's contract last April. ESPN
retaliated with its lawsuit, which alleges that baseball's action
is a transparent attempt to extract more cash in a hot market that
has yielded huge increases for the NFL, NASCAR, the National
Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament and the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   If ESPN loses, baseball could peddle the regular-season deal to
TNT or just the Sunday night games to Fox Sports Net or FX. Or ESPN
could re-enter the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ESPN's case is its charge that baseball
unreasonably withheld its approval to pre-empt the Sunday night
games in September 1998 and 1999 for events of ``significant viewer
interest,'' or NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has okayed transfers of games in the past to
accommodate hockey playoff games and other events _ but never on
Sundays. Baseball views the Sunday games as sacrosanct property
with enormous value which does not merit being shuttled to ESPN2
for the more expensive, higher-rated NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial hearing last week, United States District Judge
Shira A. Scheindlin repeatedly tried to persuade Robert Kheel, a
lawyer for baseball, to quantify how much baseball was damaged by
ESPN's action.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a dollar figure, she said, as if chasing a phantom.
Kheel repeated that he could not provide a sum because it was
impossible to place a number on being bumped off the network you
contracted to show your games on. If ESPN had negotiated a
pre-emption right, he said, then he might have a figure.
</P>
<P>
   But ESPN paid its $36 million rights fee, didn't it, the judge
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kheel said, but that was payment to show games, not shuttle
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you quantify hurt?'' Scheindlin said. ``Because hurt
sounds to me a little bit like hurt ego, hurt feelings. `We're the
national pastime and now people will think football is the national
pastime. We're going to become not as important in the public mind
as we once were.' I understand all that. I don't know how you
quantify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kheel said: ``We have not shown specific losses, your honor, we
agree with you there. What we have said is we believe it did affect
us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recess, Kheel returned with a hastily hatched damages
theory that went like this: ESPN pays $30 million to broadcast each
NFL game, so baseball's hurt was three NFL games multiplied by 5
percent, or $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lobenfeld, an ESPN lawyer, was not amused. ``I don't know
how, if they got every dollar they contracted for and can't itemize
a penny of anything else, that it hurt them,'' he said. ``They are
basically down to saying, `It hurt my feelings, it's a black eye,
makes me look bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Scheindlin ruled that baseball would not be
eligible for major damages. If victorious, it could receive only a
nominal sum.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin also ruled that the jury can hear evidence that
baseball's refusal to approve the transfer of games to ESPN2 was
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is two letters written by baseball to ESPN during
settlement discussions that proposed large increases in ESPN's
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Irrelevant, baseball argued.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball made two offers, which ESPN alleged to be a blatant
attempt to extract ``extracontractual concessions'' to an existing
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The first offer, made in April 1998, suggested adding $30
million to the $183.6 million ESPN was scheduled to pay baseball
from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Last January came the second offer: raise the 1999-to-2002
rights fees, which average $37.2 million a year, by more than $50
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more: baseball proposed to extend the contract
for two years, to $125 million for 2003 and $140 million for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to preclude this evidence, baseball said it would be
``highly prejudicial and lead the court and the jury into
consideration of entirely collateral issues.'' Scheindlin called it
``directly relevant to the critical question of reasonableness.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a settlement, ESPN and baseball will stage the best game
of the off-season. Best of all, it's free.

RUSSIA DISCLOSES DETAILS OF FORMER CHEMICAL ARMS PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Congress cut American assistance to Russian
programs aimed at destroying chemical weapons stockpiles, Russia
has disclosed new details about its former chemical weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published on Monday in a magazine of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Hague,
Netherlands-based international agency that oversees the 1993
treaty banning chemical weapons, three Russian officials say that
Russia had 24 poison gas factories, six of which it plans to
destroy, and 18 of which it has either converted to peaceful use or
intends to convert, rather than destroy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also appeal in their article, in the magazine
Synthesis, for financial aid for their chemical weapons destruction
and conversion program.
</P>
<P>
   Government and private chemical weapons experts called the
article the first detailed public description of Russia's former
chemical weapons factories, its plans for them and the cost of such
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures come on the eve of a meeting of the 41-member
executive council of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons, which was founded to monitor the carrying out of
the treaty ratified by more than 125 nations, including the United
States and Russia. Council approval is needed for Russia's request
to convert, rather than destroy, the former chemical weapons
factories, and it will then need approval by the organization's
full assembly, set to meet next May.
</P>
<P>
   The article asserts that because Russia can afford only 10
percent of the $110 million required to demilitarize its former
poison gas factories, ``financial assistance from other countries
is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of submission of the relevant documentation to the
OPCW, and consequently, of the destruction and conversion of the
facilities, will depend on the financial resources available,'' say
the authors. They are Svetlana Utkina, the division head of the
National Scientific Center of the State Institute on Organic
Chemistry and Technology; Aleksandr Gorbovsky, a department head of
the Russian Agency on Munitions; and Aleksandr Zhuchkov, a
department chief at the Russian Ministry of Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also say that destroying rather than converting
the factories, some of which are already engaged in peaceful
production, would cost Russia up to $1 billion in lost revenue,
which it can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has privately shared this kind of information about its
former chemical arms program with the prohibition organization, as
the treaty and agreements with the United States require.
Washington has spent roughly $150 million helping Russia destroy
and convert such factories. But Moscow has been reluctant to
discuss details of its former poison gas factories or plans for
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian government has repeatedly denied
assertions by Soviet defectors and American officials that it
developed and tested a new class of highly lethal chemical weapons.
These so-called binary weapons, in which two chemical agents become
lethal when joined in a munition, are called novichuk, which in
Russian means ``new guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has grown more willing to discuss certain aspects of its
conversion and destruction programs as its concerns about financing
them have mounted. Last week, Congress eliminated all funds to help
Russia build a pilot plan to destroy its nerve-agent-filled
munitions at Shchuchye, where 13.6 percent of the Russian stockpile
is stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weapons aren't going to destroy themselves,'' said Amy
Smithson, senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington. ``If the Pentagon wants to ensure that U.S. troops
never encounter this stuff on a battlefield, it will have to
persuade Congress to resume funding chemical- weapons destruction
assistance for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   In their article, the Russian officials say that equipment that
could make chemical weapons had already been removed from eight of
the 18 factories scheduled for conversion. But considerable foreign
aid would be required to demilitarize the remaining 10, which had
been used to produce sarin, soman and their precursors, the authors
say.

JUDGE LIMITS EXPENDITURES BY THE IBF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal judge, acting on part of a request by
prosecutors that the court take sweeping control of the
International Boxing Federation, issued an order Monday barring its
indicted leadership from making any individual expenditures in
excess of $5,000 without court permission.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the temporary restraining order against the boxing
sanctioning and ranking organization and its founder, Robert W. Lee
Sr., Judge John W. Bissell of U.S. District Court said he was
concerned about ``preservation of the entity's resources for the
future'' and saw some validity to federal prosecutors' concerns
that funds going into the organization in the coming weeks could be
misdirected by those under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected arguments by federation lawyers federation and Lee
that the restrictions were an unnecessary move by the federal
prosecutors who were illegally and improperly trying to become
boxing reformers.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions on spending were an initial step sought by
Robert J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, in his battle
to wrest control of the organization from private hands in what is
the first attempt to bring a sporting organization under court
supervision. Cleary's office, using the civil provisions of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, moved last
week to have the court appoint a monitor to take over and reform
the IBF less than three weeks after his office obtained a 32-count
indictment against Lee and three other top officials of the
federation, charging them with bribery, racketeering and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week the prosecutors proposed to the court that they
appoint Zachary W. Carter, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District of New York, who is now in private practice, as the
monitor of the sanctioning group with authority to remove the
indicted officials and hire new executives, restructure it and
reform it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bissell scheduled Dec. 22 for final legal arguments
on the appointment of the monitor. While he did not hint at his
leanings, he did telegraph during the hearing that he saw a proper
and legal role for federal and court intervention in the sport.
``The court perceives a public policy interest in the enhancing of
the integrity of an activity as pervasive as boxing and
particularly one which plays a big role in interstate commerce,''
Bissell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 65 of Fanwood, N.J.; his son Robert Lee Jr., 38, of Scotch
Plains, N.J., who was liaison to his father; Donald William
Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., chairman of the group's ranking
committee; and Francisco Fernandez, an international commissioner
and South American representative of the group who lives in
Colombia, are charged with extracting $338,000 in bribes from
fighters and their managers in exchange for moving them up in the
rankings and in line for lucrative purses and broadcast proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell said Monday's order directs the elder Lee and others to
carry on the IBF's ``normal course of business,'' but to avoid
``extraordinary expenditures,'' including any payment of legal fees
for the officials out of organization funds. Bissell said that the
order was not an absolute prohibition and that he would entertain
requests for modifications ``to minimize the impact on the normal
operations'' of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Krovatin, the elder Lee's lawyer, called the sweeping
civil action by the prosecutors to seek a court takeover of the
sports organization overreaching and typical of the way prosecutors
try to use the powerful anti-racketeering laws. But Krovatin said
that the civil provisions of the law were as ``vague and
amorphous'' as they were sweeping, and he accused prosecutors of
trying to use them to ``bootstrap'' remedies to which they would
not be entitled even if Lee were eventually found guilty of the
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Braunreuther, the assistant United States Attorney and
chief of the civil division in New Jersey, raised the specter of
diversion of funds by noting that the IBF was both a nonprofit
organization and a for-profit group in which the elder Lee
controlled 62 percent of the shares. While there has been no
``looting'' of either entity, Braunreuther said, the possibility
exists that Lee could ``hijack'' funds from one organization and
place them with another.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the current federal, civil and criminal
proceedings involving the IBF, there is also a state court action
in which Lee is seeking to oust three minority shareholders from
Oregon of the for-profit IBF, accusing them of bilking the group of
$1.5 million over the last seven years. Hearings in that case are
scheduled in Essex County Superior Court on Dec. 16.

EDITORIAL: THE FUTURE OF ELIAN GONZALEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 30:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Straits, where so many Cubans have lost their
lives trying to make their way across the last Cold War barrier to
the United States, another small, overloaded boat has sunk,
apparently drowning a young woman and casting her 5-year-old son
adrift. For two days after the 16-foot boat went down, Elian
Gonzalez clung to an inner tube before fishermen on Thanksgiving
morning found him and two adults who had survived. His pluck kept
him alive, and brought him to the country his mother and stepfather
may have died trying to reach. Their bodies have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, where should Elian Gonzalez be? Authorities
in Cuba, where his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives, allege that
the boy was kidnapped by his mother. On Sunday the father formally
asked for his son's return. But the Immigration and Naturalization
Service said Monday that it had already legally paroled Elian to
relatives living in Miami. ``His mother was bringing him to
freedom,'' the boy's uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, said, ``and we don't
want him to go back to a Communist system.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Coast Guard had found the boy at sea, United States
policy would have directed that he be sent back to Cuba. But
because the fishermen brought him to land, he has the legal right
to stay, and that right should not be hastily abridged because of
Elian's age.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of Cuban boat people are growing after a downturn in
the mid-1990's. A total of 2,254 arrived here this year, while
1,265 were stopped in open water. Another boatload of Cubans
drowned last December.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to win new life here costs lives, and creates
dilemmas to test the wisdom of a Solomon. If the boy's father
wishes, he can petition for custody of Elian, and legal proceedings
in Florida will decide who should raise him. The INS could give the
father permission to come to this country and testify.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the American system must now accord Elian
Gonzalez the same care and protection that any child would receive
in a custody case. That could mean having a family court consider
the child's wishes, once he has had time to recover from the shock
of losing his mother and also to determine the best home
environment for him. His father has a right to press his claim, and
American authorities have an obligation to make an apolitical
judgment that serves the boy's needs rather than any political
interest.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French composer Darius Milhaud was asked by a
cousin if all the instruments he wrote into a symphonic score
should be played together. ``Preferably,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Ballet, too, prefers its orchestra to sound
like the cohesive ensemble it can be at its best. How to guarantee
excellence is the issue that has divided the ballet management and
its orchestra members. The musicians, represented by Local 802 of
the American Federation of Musicians, went on strike a week ago in
a labor dispute. Taped music has accompanied performances of ``The
Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that both sides agreed upon in contract talks was
that this strike was different from the other four in the company
since 1966. It was not a dispute about money or benefits. It was
about changing work schedules to encourage or require musicians to
attend rehearsals for the performances they play. ``Linkage''
between rehearsal and performance was the word used by lawyers on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Under the last contract, which expired in September, substitutes
could replace the orchestra's regular musicians at rehearsals or
performances. Although many musicians attend most performances and
rehearsals, they may go on unpaid leave to work or perform outside
the company to supplement their income. Their regular season is 23
weeks a year with the option of playing for the ballet for three
more weeks in Saratoga, N.Y., in July. All orchestra members
receive benefits for 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for substitutes to play at a performance for
which they have not rehearsed or to play at a rehearsal for a
ballet but not at its performance. The same applies to the regular
musicians. Had the orchestra members not gone on strike and played
at the Nov. 23 opening-night gala, 22 of the 62 musicians in the
pit would have been substitutes, the management said.
</P>
<P>
   The company proposed that newly hired orchestra members be
required to play six performances each week (there are seven each
week and more during ``Nutcracker'' season) and attend two out of
four rehearsals designated by the company each week. This would
enable the conductor to know in advance which musicians would be
present, and there would be continuity between rehearsals and
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Current orchestra members would remain free not to attend
specific performances or rehearsals, as under the old contract. But
if they volunteered to join the new system, they would be paid at a
higher rate like the new musicians. Although the orchestra members
had proposed the grandfathering clause by which the current members
could stay on the old system, they rejected the proposal last week.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Leibowitz, the lawyer representing the orchestra
bargaining committee, said that that proposal would create a
two-tier system and divisions among the musicians. Negotiations
between City Ballet and Local 802 ended Monday afternoon after the
ballet management agreed to study new proposals presented by the
musicians. Judy West, the spokeswoman for Local 802, said the union
offered a comprehensive counterproposal. Talks were to resume
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In this strike, unlike any other at City Ballet, the orchestra
leadership stepped onto risky ground. One reason is that the
musicians in recent years have come under increasing criticism for
the quality of some performances. Another is that ``The
Nutcracker'' run, which began last Friday after two scheduled dark
days, has been accompanied by taped music. This precedent might
affect the musicians' union in labor disputes with Broadway
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In previous strikes, City Ballet had found it cheaper to cancel
performances. During the six-week orchestra strike in the winter of
1976-77 George Balanchine, the ballet's co-founder, considered
using taped music. He called this ``something to tide us over,''
but not a solution, and added, ``It's a pity that some of the
musicians do not look up a little higher and try to see another
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The company canceled most of its ``Nutcracker'' performances and
part of its winter repertory during that strike. The orchestra's
musicians had gone on strike for three days in 1966 and four weeks
in 1970. In 1973 the dancers went out for four weeks on what was
widely interpreted as a move by the management to pre-empt an
orchestra strike. The dancers had asked the ballet to guarantee
them 14 weeks of work, which the company said it could not do
because it had not reached agreement with the orchestra, which
threatened a strike. In effect, the dancers' walkout locked out the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This season the musicians may have committed a tactical error.
Last Saturday afternoon, for instance, the New York State Theater
appeared full with only a scattering of empty spots in the
2,800-seat house. Ticket buyers, staff members and stagehands had
crossed the musicians' picket line and the few refunded tickets
were often resold, providing a bonanza for those who could not get
into previously sold-out performances.
</P>
<P>
   Because many dance companies perform to tape in New York or on
tour (the Miami City Ballet did so recently in Newark with a
Balanchine repertory), dance to recorded music is not a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   At the Saturday matinee the recording was obviously not live
sound but acceptable. The applause rolled in with roars at
traditional moments. Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic
director, and Anne Parsons, its general manager, said in an
interview that they had decided not to close the State Theater
because 350 people, including dancers, stagehands, ushers and other
staff members, would be out of work and because 125,000 tickets had
been sold for ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Martins said he considered the orchestra players part of City
Ballet's family. ``It's an excellent orchestra, and I respect them.
They are asked to perform a very advanced and sophisticated musical
repertoire, which is difficult. It's not that they can't play but
that they are not there. Artistically, I feel it's a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Martins has often taken the rap for the orchestra's occasional
waywardness. Last year an oboist did not play on time and a dancer,
Miranda Weese, found herself performing a solo to silence for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance rules have inhibited the company's search for a
new music director. Many of the 12 guest conductors invited during
City Ballet's 50th anniversary season in 1998-99 were surprised
that the players they had rehearsed were not always those they saw
at the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsons said that the company was close to choosing a new
musical director, but that any candidate would need assurance that
the orchestra members are prepared to play as a genuine ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the company's
co-founders, had put ``music on a par with dance,'' Martins
emphasized: ``We have to do something so that musicians apply the
same standards of integrity and professionalism in their work as
everyone else. This is the mandate that Balanchine set forth in
this house.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all well and good, but it was under Balanchine that the
current orchestra rules evolved. And changes in lifestyle and
habits are psychological issues, even in the interest of artistic
quality.
</P>
<P>
   As Bernard M. Plum, the lawyer for the ballet management, said,
``It's not about money, and that is what makes it difficult.''

NAVAL PETTY OFFICER IS ACCUSED OF GIVING RUSSIA INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Navy code expert has been charged with passing
secrets to Russia five years ago, military officials said on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Petty Officer First Class Daniel M. King, 40, was
arrested on Nov. 5 after failing a routine polygraph test and is in
custody at Quantico, Va., awaiting the military equivalent of a
grand jury proceeding, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Navy and CIA said King was accused of passing
intelligence about submarines to the Russians while he worked in a
Navy unit of the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature of that intelligence has not been determined,
but the Navy and CIA officials said the security breach was far
less serious than those caused by other recent espionage cases. The
officials said King's offense seems to have been committed in a
single incident.
</P>
<P>
   The officials familiar with the case said the defendant, who has
been in the Navy for 18 years, told questioners that he had mailed
a package of classified material to the Russian Embassy in
Washington in 1994 and that he had no further contact with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they had no corroboration of the defendant's
account of mailing material to the Russians. King said he had been
motivated by anger at personal problems rather than greed and
received no money, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that King had been
charged with espionage and the less serious count of disclosing
classified information to an unauthorized person. Smith said the
investigation was continuing.

TRADE MINISTERS GATHER FOR RAUCOUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With deep divisions among themselves and with tens of thousands
of protesters threatening to shut them down, trade ministers from
135 nations Tuesday gather in Seattle for a difficult round of
talks aimed at reducing barriers to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The third meeting of the five-year-old World Trade Organization
promises to be a free-wheeling global town hall on the virtues and
vices of globalization, as the world's trade ministers try to speed
up trade liberalization and a panoply of protesters try to slow
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the ministers got their first hint of what promises to
be a raucous weeklong debate when a security scare at the
convention center delayed a forum for hours and forced thousands of
delegates and reporters to spend a chilly damp morning standing on
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Children costumed as endangered species wandered the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A French sheep farmer angry over tariffs on cheese led a march
on a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro begged off, saying he was worried he
might be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, who arrives in Seattle Wednesday morning,
is already altering his schedule to acknowledge the unhappiness in
the air. He promised Monday to hold closed-door meetings with
critics Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the delegates hit town, many were predicting
failure _ often a brinksmanship tactic employed by trade
negotiators but also an indication of the difficulty of reaching
compromise by the close of the meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is demanding to talk about U.S. tactics to protect
politically sensitive industries like steel. The United States
refuses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists on talking about European subsidies to
protect agriculture. The Europeans refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, trying to placate its critics, is
pushing the causes of labor and the environment, but they seem to
have persuaded few other nations to join the cause. And labor and
environmental leaders, apparently smelling fear in the air, began
proclaiming victory even before the talks began, saying that the
disarray is a testament to the power of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The security scare at the convention center Monday, triggered
when a guard spotted a broken lock, had an ironic effect: the WTO
had to delay the one major event it had scheduled at which critics
could speak directly to trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Police swept the building and turned up nothing. The symposium
for non-governmental organizations proceeded, a little late and a
little abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   But the day offered a preview of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   The city was thick with politicians and dignitaries, many of
them with an ax to grind. Interest groups tried to defend their
cause _ domestic and foreign sugar producers, for example, held
competing events to debate the merits of how the United States
protects its politically powerful sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing for a new trade round that
would be limited to a few topics with strong domestic appeal, such
as agriculture and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much disagreement that trade officials at the WTO's
headquarters in Geneva were unable even to come up with an agenda
for this week's gathering in Seattle, so the ministers are meeting
without a script. Their goal is by Friday to come up with an agenda
for a global round of trade liberalization talks that would be
launched here and continued over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Unsexy as these topics may be, the so-called Millennium Round
has already engaged the public more than any previous round of
global negotiations. The WTO has become the focal point of a broad
set of global anxieties about the sovereignty of nations and the
power of multinational corporations. The very tenor of this week's
meeting is being dramatically affected by those fears.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart promised a
boring week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is a student of trade negotiations will find it's
akin to watching paint dry'' Lockhart said. ``It is not the most
exciting thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's own schedule is being shaped by the domestic
political tumult that has greeted the WTO. Two of the Democratic
Party's top constituencies, the environmental and labor movements,
are leading the protests against the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is spending Tuesday in California, is to arrive in
Seattle early Wednesday and then spend about 30 hours in town,
talking up the benefits of trade, attempting to mollify critics,
and urging delegates to embrace the needs of workers and the
environment even as they work to lower trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   He is to spend much of his time at the Port of Seattle, touring
a control tower that directs marine traffic and a transit shed
where he will see apples, hay and newsprint readied for export, as
well as a Weyerhaeuser ship handling exports of forest products.
Clinton plans to give a major trade speech to a group of local
farmers, elected officials, and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning
Clinton is to address WTO ministers, hold private meetings with
environmental and labor leaders, and sign an International Labor
Organization convention against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is essentially a committee of its member governments,
operating by consensus as the members try to forge agreements to
eliminate protectionist tariffs. But the movement to free trade
around the world has become increasingly controversial as many
tariffs are removed and countries increasingly challenge the
non-tariff barriers to trade, such as labor laws and environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's symposium for non-governmental organizations was a
first for the WTO, which considers itself an organization of
governments and whose members often resist direct conversations
with non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came to protest WTO policies said they expected little
of substance to emerge from this week's discussions. Generally,
they termed WTO's Non-Governmental Organization Day _ the official
forum for enviornmental, labor and other groups _ a flop. Activists
in forums outside the official WTO pre-meetings sensed they were
winning at least some points in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get disoriented when I think we may be about to
win one,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of the Canadian Parliament,
who cited ``the obvious confusion of the (WTO) leadership about
whether they're going to come out of this with what they thought
they would. ... I think we're on the beginning of a bit of a roll.
I want to be hopeful _ we've lost these things so many times _ but
I want to be hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists are working to head off plans to apply the free trade
rules to investments. They also are working to short-circuit plans
for liberalized trade in timber and other forest products, and
other goods as part of the so-called acellerated tariff
liberalization idea. They also want the WTO to butt out of
discussions over genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly obvious at the moment that the negotiators are
in deadlock,'' said Ronnie Hall of Friends of the Earth's United
Kingdom office. ``They're not going anywhere. It seems there is a
lot of hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   American business is trying to turn public opinion around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first goal is educating the American public, workers and
some policy makers that overwhelming evidence supports expanded
trade in today's global economy,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president
of National Assocaition of Manufacturers. ``The integration of
America into the global econmy has mvoed forward so rapidly that
people dont understand it and the benefits associatiend with it.
... They are susceptible to the demagogic arguments that trade is a
race to the bottom ... when there's no evidence for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is making a concerted effort to
placate protesters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy, the main
negotiator for the United States, delivered a forceful speech
Monday promising that the America will stick to its proposal to
expand world trade rules to cover labor rights, although it is the
most controversial issue among WTO members.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions, Barshefsky said, ``It is astonishing to me that so many
other countries feel so threatened by the inclusion of these
issues. We intend absolutely to persist in this, and not just in
Seattle, because these issues are fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of union leaders, who included AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney, broke into applause. Sweeney had said before the
meeting that it wasn't clear how strongly the Clinton
Administration supports labor rights abroad. ``We'll see,'' he
said. ``After the agreement with China, I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lamy,trade commissioner for the European Union, said he
opposed a proposal by labor unions to allow WTO trade sanctions
against countries that violate labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are not on the agenda,'' he said, proposing instead
a joint committee of the WTO and International Labor Organization
that ``has nothing to do with imposing advanced social standards on
countries that cannot afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has particular importance for Washington state, the
most trade dependent in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke called on the Clinton administration to hold
firm to policies aimed at opening foreign markets and creating fair
competition in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that other countries are not putting
United states products and commodities at a competitive
disadvantage becaue of the huge subisidies,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that puts our companies and employees at a competitive
disadvantage, and this round of the WTO must address these issue.''

DESPITE BANK INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, CUSTOMERS HAVE MANY CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Rick Force and his partner started
selling evidence collection supplies to police departments three
years ago, they set up their business accounts with one of the
city's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Force and his partner, Mike Canfield, quickly found out,
however, that a small company such as theirs could not command the
attention offered larger customers. When the bank merged into a
bigger bank company, they felt lost in the shuffle. They had to
keep explaining their unusual business to a series of young
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through account reps like toilet paper,'' Force said.
</P>
<P>
   They have since moved their business to a small community bank,
Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust, where they have received great service _ and
better rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bank consolidation came late to this area, and it continues to
roil the market with changes. Although sometimes confusing, bankers
said, the action has created a boon for business and individual
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has provided just about every choice in banking a customer
might want. And it has made the market more competitive, pushing up
the interest rates that banks pay for money market accounts and
certificates of deposit and pushing down interest rates on loans
for everything from cars to credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition in September of Mercantile Bancorporation
Inc., based in St. Louis with a big presence in Kansas City, the
area again is feeling the undulations. Mercantile was acquired by
Firstar Corp. of Milwaukee as part of a $10.4 billion merger.
Branches will be converted next year to the Firstar name.
</P>
<P>
   With Firstar's reputation for aggressiveness and strong service,
businesses and bankers alike are eager to see how the next
derivation of the market plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is more opportunity than ever before,'' said
local bank consultant Jerry Swords. ``The new banks that have come
along are doing super. Still, things have changed dramatically.
People are doing more of their banking electronically, and banks
are going to have to adapt. If you say you don't care what people
want, that bank won't be around in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks fall into four basic categories, and with Firstar coming
into the market, Kansas City businesses and consumers have all four
banking models to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The national model is represented by Bank of America, formerly
NationsBank, formerly Boatmen's. It is the country's largest bank
company, with $620 billion in assets and operations in 22 states
and 33 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar, with about $74 billion in assets, is considered a
superregional bank, serving more than one area of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the regional banks, both hometown companies,
Commerce Bancshares Inc. and UMB Financial Corp., with assets under
$12 billion and less geographical reach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are many community banks. Most of the new
community banks are drawn to Johnson County and its concentration
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel if they can get in and get a niche, that the Johnson
County market will continue to expand into the next decade,'' said
Jim Maag of the Kansas Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   It is one reason Kansas ranks near the top nationally in the
lowest number of people per bank office, Maag said. It has about
one bank or branch for every 2,200 persons. New York state has
about twice as many people per bank office.
</P>
<P>
   It is also one of the reasons, bankers said, that customers will
find some of the best deals on loans and bank accounts in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many banks are chasing deposits that it has caused deposit
rate pressure,'' said Alexander Kemper, president and CEO of UMB
Financial Corp. ``It is like taking a football to a soccer match.
It is the wrong tool. What many people in Johnson County are
looking for is wealth management.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes, it is good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   What Firstar brings specifically to this mix is a commitment to
service that the market has not seen, certainly among large banks,
said Ron Barnes, president and CEO of the newly acquired Mercantile
Bank in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar guarantees to meet certain standards or pay customers a
penalty for coming up short, Barnes said. A customer who waits more
than five minutes for a teller will get $5. A business customer who
has provided all the information needed on a loan request is
guaranteed a response within 48 hours. The penalty for failure is
$25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much that people will fall all over themselves to
receive 25 bucks, but it is the symbolism that service is king and
everyone at Firstar is lined up behind that,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Megabanks such as Firstar also offer a breadth and depth of
products and specialists that companies need as markets become
increasingly global and the economics of business become
increasingly complex, Barnes said. Even small companies are finding
a need for international services.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson extols the benefits of an international bank such as
Bank of America, where he is president of the Kansas City region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a client that just made an acquisition in Italy and
needed financing for its operations there of 25 million lire,''
Nelson said. ``We called our colleagues in Milan, where we have a
bank, and within 24 hours had the financing in place. That is the
advantage of dealing with a global bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Burcham, whose office at Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust sits in the
shadows of three big downtown banks, tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a customer whose teen-age kids were going to
Australia, and she wanted ATM cards for them,'' said Burcham,
president of Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust. ``They went to the bank where
they had banked for 25 years, and they wouldn't give the cards
because of their age. They said it was against their rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called us from her cell phone in that bank's parking lot.
She had an application that afternoon and debit cards and
traveler's checks the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Responsiveness like that has helped Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust grow
from $37 million in assets in 1992 to $105 million and garnered it
the 1999 Small Business of the Year award from the Greater Kansas
City Chamber of Commerce. The growth came even though the bank has
had one location, no weekend hours and no drive-through window.
Bank owners picked a niche and distinguished the bank with service,
Burcham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business owners only need a good bank when they have a
problem,'' Burcham said. ``When that happens, we don't have layers
and layers to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a banking theory that the industry will soon look like
a barbell. At one end is a few international banking companies with
huge assets, broad services and phenomenal lending limits. At the
other end are a large number of community banks with small loan
limits but extraordinary personal service. Only a few regional
banks in the middle would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Regional banks here see Kansas City, where small and medium-size
companies dominate the economy, as a perfect place to thrive in
that middle market. They see themselves offering the best features
of big and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical Kansas City middle-market company would prefer to
do business with a decision maker that is local, is successful and
has continuity,'' said Jonathan Kemper, chairman of Commerce Bank.
``That plays into the advantages of our bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kemper at UMB Financial agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doubtful that bigger is better. I think better is
better,'' he said. ``You need what I call the three C words:
creativity, continuity and capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Creativity is needed to find solutions to clients' banking
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity means the business relationship is not constantly
interrupted by mergers that roll new managers through a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity is needed to offer a full range of services required by
clients, Alexander Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees UMB's future brightened by the growth in small
banks. He wants to provide small banks and companies computer and
Internet services to help them compete against their giant
competitors. UMB already is among the largest in the country in
handling financial transactions, such as credit card processing,
for other banks. It now wants to be the intermediary for its
clients in services such as Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a very romantic vision,'' Alexander Kemper said,
``but the idea of empowering the little guy is very powerful to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mic Aslin, who spent 22 years at UMB Bank and its parent company
before leaving in 1994, thinks the banks that can harness
technology for themselves and their clients will be the banks of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Aslin became president and chief executive officer of Leawood,
Kan.-based Gold Banc Corp. in February when it bought his computer
networking company, CompuNet Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Banc is a relatively new company that has been growing into
a regional operator through acquisitions. With deals announced in
October, it will serve 47 communities and have $2.75 billion in
assets. It is taking the national banking model to community banks
by getting into investment banking, insurance, international
banking and Internet banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that can tie technology together without killing
themselves with the investment and without making big mistakes,
they will be the banks that will get the real attention,'' Aslin
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   One result of becoming a successful regional bank is living with
constant takeover speculation as other bank companies look to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   As public companies, the Kansas City area's regional banks would
be compelled to consider any serious offer. But top regional bank
executives say they aren't in discussions with any prospective
suitors, and they aren't looking for deals.
</P>
<P>
   There is no disagreement among industry leaders, however, that
consolidation will continue in the area and that it will be good
for bank customers who find the bank that meets their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is cause of optimism,'' said Aslin, who also is
an owner of a start-up bank in Johnson County. ``There will be new
products that banks will be able to offer. It means ultimately
everyone who is capable of borrowing money will be able to borrow
money, and that is whether you live in rural areas or in urban
areas.''
