<HEADLINE> Shanghai Seeks More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Shanghai, China's industrial and financial center, today announced
plans to seek investments for 168 key industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects, which will require total investments of over 4.1
billion U.S. dollars, are part of the city's efforts to implement
the central government's decision to increase domestic demand,
increase employment and achieve that growth target for gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The projects cover wide-ranging sectors, including automobile
parts, electronics, telecommunications facilities, modern
medicines and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The projects are primarily designed for the Pudong New Area
which over the past eight years of development has emerged as
Shanghai's new base for economic growth, and for adjusting the
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's gross industrial output value is expected to rise at
an annual rate of between 12-13 percent over the next three years,
with the figure expected to hit 700 billion yuan by the year
2,000, according to Huang Qifan, director of the Municipal Economic
Commission.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Impose Landing Ban on Yugoslav Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union (EU)
could start to impose a ban on all Yugoslav airlines in EU
airports within this month as a further reaction to the continuing
violence in Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, the German government
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The landing ban would be a "clear signal" for Belgrade, German
government spokesman Otto Hauser said, adding the EU nations
reserved the right to impose other sanctions if Belgrade continued
to refuse to end the bloodshed in Kosovo and to allow the return
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Hauser Wednesday also voiced doubt about the sincerity of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic who reportedly said Tuesday
that he was willing to grant Kosovo "a certain degree of
autonomy."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic should follow his words with deeds, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
told the German parliament Wednesday that the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) was due to decide next week under which
circumstances group troops would be sent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NATO was considering for the moment only to
conduct air force operations against targets of Serbian security
forces in case of a military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"At issue is a concept for calculated actions with which the
NATO could, for example, react swiftly to severe human rights
violations and force the conflicting parties back to the
negotiating table, " Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO ground troops would probably only be deployed to
monitor a peace or cease-fire agreement in Kosovo, Ruehe added.

<HEADLINE> St. Lucia to Strengthen Ties With China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China and St. Lucia have
enjoyed sound exchanges and cooperation in all areas since the two
nations forged diplomatic ties in 1997 and friendly cooperative
relations will be strengthened even further in the future.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Mario Michel, who also serves as first
deputy leader of the St. Lucian Labor Party (SLP), made the
remarks today during an exclusive interview with the Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Michel said his visit to China coincides with the first
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the
two nations. He pointed to the visit as "successful, fruitful,
rewarding and very interesting."
</P>
<P>
The St. Lucian leader said he has visited numerous places in
Beijing and Tianjin, including historical sites and modern
facilities. He has also met with Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
and various high-ranking officials from the Foreign Ministry and
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Michel cited his "favorable" impressions and noted that he has
acquired a deeper undersanding of the Chinese economy, political
situation, history and culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said, "Forging diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China represents a major decision made by the new
government of St. Lucia once the SLP emerged as the ruling party."
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia-China relations have developed smoothly, said Michel
adding that the economic and technological cooperation agreement
signed by the two countries calls for China to participate in the
design and construction of a free trade economic zone and his
nation's first sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
China's economic and technological assistance to St. Lucia over
the past year fully demonstrates St. Lucia's correct decision
in forging diplomatic ties with China, said Michel.
</P>
<P>
He said one goal of his visit is to establish and develop
friendly links between the SLP and the Communist Party of China
(CPC), and he noted the visit has provided an opportunity for
formal contacts and laid a solid foundation for the development of
party-to-party relations.
</P>
<P>
Michel cited the CPC as a "strong and resilient" party with a
history of over 70 years. China has witnessed sustained and stable
economic development under the leadership of the CPC, according to
Michel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the SLP will draw lessons and learn from the CPC,
and expressed hope that the two parties will expand exchanges and
cooperations in various areas.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Needs More International Aid: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hit severely by an
unexpected abnormal weather, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) this year is facing a gloomy prospect in its
agricultural sector and needs more international aid, DPRK
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee and
director of the Agricultural Production Department of the
Agricultural Commission described the delivery of international
aid as "smooth."
</P>
<P>
They said in August alone, more than 100,000 tons of food and
other relief materials donated by the World Food Program, the
European Union and other international organizations and countries
arrived in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by aid from the international community, they said,
the DPRK people are determined to solve the food problem by
themselves under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this year, the people have made
substantial preparations for farming with the general mobilization
of all, thus laid a foundation for increasing the grain output,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the officials said the freak weather hit the DPRK
in the latter half of the year caused serious damage to its
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, east and west coastal areas including
Kangwon, south Phyongan and south Hwanghae provinces and Kaesong
suffered from cold weather, downpours and hails while Jagang and
Ryanggang provinces and other northern inland areas were hit by
off-season cold weather.
</P>
<P>
According to conservative data available as of late August,
Kangwon, north and south Hwanghae, north and south Hamgyong, north
and south Phyongan provinces, Kaesong and other affected areas
were losing lives, and 128,927 hectares of arable land were
covered by water or washed away and more than 10,000 houses were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The officials said representatives of the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Program, the
United Nations Development Program and other international
organizations arrived in the DPRK several days ago to learn about
the damage on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The Korean people, who are suffering from the heavy damage
caused by natural disasters and shortage of food, are working hard
to solve the food problem and resume agricultural production at an
early date, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Duma Urges Yeltsin to Fire Central Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to call on President Boris Yeltsin to
dismiss Central Bank governor Sergei Dubinin.
</P>
<P>
The demand was contained in a resolution passed 267-2 in the
lower house of parliament on the socio-economic and financial
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Duma described the actions taken by the government and the
Central Bank to overcome the financial crisis as "unsatisfactory
and belated."
</P>
<P>
Dubinin, however, has reportedly told Duma deputies that he
does not intend to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Duma told the bank to propose candidates for the bank's
directors, and instructed the government, in drafting a program
for pulling the country out of the crisis, to be guided by the
relevant provisions in a statement made by the trilateral
commission representing the State Duma, the Federation Council and
the cabinet, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Central Bank to tighten control over the
activities of crediting institutions, take steps to protect
savings, restore the liquidity of commercial banks and enable the
banking system to function properly.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also instructed the government to hold urgent
consultations with Belarus and other member nations of the
Commonwealth of Independent States on coordinating efforts to
stabilize the national financial, crediting and monetary systems.
</P>
<P>
It called for the imposition of state monopoly on production
and sales of alcoholic products and a suspension of tenders and
auctions in sales of the stock of natural monopolies and
strategically important installations.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Passes Law on Grain Storing and Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has adopted a law on
grain storing and trading, an effort to keep the country fed on
all occasions, the Agrarian Finance Daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, any individual or organization must
have the permit from the Agriculture Ministry to trade in
grains. Violators will be fined 3 million to 50 million lev (about
1,700 to 28,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the permit from the Agriculture Ministry, individuals or
organizations can also operate grain silos, after making an
initial investment of at least 100 million lev, or 57,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
All the silos are required to have a storing capacity of at
least 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The law also regulates that a system of strategic grain reserve
must be set up in case of major natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria suffered an acute grain shortage at the beginning of
1997 due to improper management and over-export and, as a result, had
to import large quantities from Poland.
</P>
<P>
This year, its wheat output is expected to reach 3.38 million
tons, about 200,000 to 500,000 tons of which can be exported.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was dismissed from his
posts Wednesday without any reasons given.
</P>
<P>
His dismissal was announced in a short statement by the Prime
Minister's Department issued late Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Anwar was also removed from all other
positions held by him in his capacity as deputy prime minister
and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the Supreme Head of State or the
King) has been informed of Anwar's removal from the cabinet, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The letter of his sacking was believed to have been delivered
to Anwar at his house by a top government official at about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give any reason for the dismissal of
Anwar. Anwar and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had reportedly
been at odds over monetary policies as the ringgit depreciated by
40 percent against the U.S. dollar since July last year following
the onset of the economic crisis that was sparked off by
speculative currency attacks.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir favored stimulating business with lower interest rates
while Anwar along with Bank Negara (State Bank), whose governor
and deputy governor resigned four days ago, had adhered to
International Monetary Fund style policies particularly in
maintaining tight monetary policies including high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy slipped into recession with gross domestic
product declining 2.8 percent and 6.8 percent in the first two
quarters of the year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's dismissal came a day after the government announced new
controls to protect the falling ringgit and to boost efforts to
revitalize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Teams of police personnel were seen entering the Deputy Prime
Minister's Office in Jalan Dato Onn and the Treasury in the Jalan
Duta government complex in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Police were seen sealing off the road leading to Anwar's house
in Bukit Damansara and Federal Reserve Unit personnel were placed
on standby.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is also deputy president of the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO). His fate as UMNO deputy president is
expected to be known when the party's supreme council is scheduled
to meet Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
No immediate comment could be obtained from Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad or Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 51, was appointed deputy prime minister on December 1,
1993, succeeding Tun Ghafar Baba, and was declared on several
occasions as Mahathir's successor.
</P>
<P>
He was brought into the government by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad in 1982 when he was initially made a deputy minister in
the Prime Minister's Department. He was later promoted to full
minister, moving from the portfolio of the then Culture, Youth and
Sports Ministry in June 1983, the Agriculture Ministry (July 1984)
and the Education Ministry (May 1986). He has been finance
minister since March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Besides his government and political posts, Anwar also held
several other posts. He was chairman of the Cabinet Committee on
Malpractices in the Government, deputy chairman of the National
Information Technology Council and deputy president of the
National Telecommunication Council. He was appointed earlier this
year deputy chairman of the National Economic Action Council.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was appointed chairman of the Development Council of the
World Bank/International Monetary Fund in April this year for a
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is Member of Parliament for Permatang Pauh, a seat in
Pulau Pinang, a northern state in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, a graduate from the University of Malaya, received his
secondary education at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, an elite
school reputed for producing many of the country's leaders in
government and business.

<HEADLINE> World Population to Grow in Next Decade, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Global population
growth is slowing, thanks to successful family planning programs,
but because of past high fertility, world population will continue
to grow by more than 80 million a year for at least the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
In mid-1999, the total world population will pass 6 million --
twice what it was in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made as Stan Bernstein, a senior research
advisor of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), briefed
reporters here Wednesday on "The State of World Population 1988"
report by the UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "The New Generations," was released
Wednesday by Nafis Sadik, the UNFPA's executive director, in
London. "This report focuses on two large generational groups --
younger and older, the relationship between them, and prospects
and challenges that they pose for future development," Bernstein
said.
</P>
<P>
More young people than ever are entering their childbearing
years. "Now there are over 1 billion people between the ages of 15
and 24," Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number and proportion of people over 65
are increasing at an unprecedented rate. The rapid growth of these
young and old "new generations" is challenging societies' ability
to provide education and health care for the young, and social,
medical and financial support for the elderly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In some developing regions over the next two decades, young
people will swell the workforce compared to older and younger
dependents, the report said, adding that "this will create a
temporary opportunity to build human capital and spur long-term
development, before dependency levels go up against as populations
age."
</P>
<P>
Falling fertility and smaller families have prompted recent
well-publicized claims that the "population explosion" is over. On
the contrary, the UNFPA report said, adding that the world
population will continue to grow substantially for at least
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Declining fertility and mortality will produce a gradual
demographic shift towards an older population in all countries
over the next few decades, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ageing populations will strain medical systems in many
developing countries which are still struggling to protect the
health of younger age groups, the report said. The burden of
disease will shift to older ages over the next several decades, it
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The dismissal of
Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim as announced by the Prime Minister's Department Wednesday
evening set off mixed reactions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Political party leaders such as United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) Secretary General Sabbaruddin Chik and Gerakan
(the People's Movement Party) President Lim Keng Yaik expressed
their shock over the announcement of Anwar's removal from the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) President Ling Liong Sik
said his party respected Mahathir's decision.
</P>
<P>
They, all cabinet ministers, shared the view that it was Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's "prerogative" to appoint or remove
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat
Ayob expressed his sadness over Anwar's sacking as he said he felt
sad because this is happening at a time when the country is facing
an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said he believed the prime
minister had enough information to act against Anwar in the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Action Party Secretary General Lim Kit Siang,
the opposition leader in Parliament, said in a statement that the
sacking had nullified whatever positive effects of the currency
control measure announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said it had also plunged Malaysia into an unprecedented
political crisis which would make economic turnaround and recovery
more distant and difficult.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Troops to Continue Help Quell DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN (South Africa), September 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibian
President Sam Nujoma said here Wednesday that his country,
together with Zimbabwe and Angola, would not withdraw their
troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) until they had
helped the Kinshasa government quell the rebel forces in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the 12th summit of the
Non-Aligned Movement, Nujoma said the presence of Namibian,
Angola and Zimbabwean troops in the DRC was in line with
agreements of the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The agreements compelled regional members to go to the rescue
of another member if requested. "We will leave only when the
(quell) job is done to the satisfaction of the government of the
Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president appealed NAM countries to reiterate the
principle of sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of
states, and to oppose attempts to overthrow legitimate
governments by military force.
</P>
<P>
"We should not hesitate in condemning those that are found
guilty of such brutal acts," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
more than half a U.S. cent Wednesday, buoyed by the release of
better than expected news on growth in the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar closed in Sydney at 58.27 U.S. cents from
57.65 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics Wednesday said the gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.9 percent during the past
financial year ending on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The local unit jumped in early Wednesday afternoon trading from
58.26 U.S. cents to 58.43 U.S. cents after data showing that
economic growth had been solid in the financial year of 1997-1998
and Treasurer Peter Costello's announcement that the budget
forecast for growth for the financial year of 1998-1999 would be
revised to 2.75 percent from 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said the boost in the Australian dollar Wednesday
made up for last week's fall, but noted it is still undervalued.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was trading at 80.10 Japanese yen from 80.20
yen and 1.0186 German marks from 1.0103 marks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India to Hold Official Dialog on "Push-in" Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India will hold
an official dialogue next month to thrash out the "push-in" issue
that created border tensions between the two neighboring
countries, the Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India's Home Affairs Secretary B.P. Singh will come to Dhaka
sometime in October on a visit and meet his Bangladeshi
counterpart Safiur Rahman, APB quoted a spokesman for the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides the "push-in" issue, the two officials are likely to
hold discussions on skirmishes between security forces and other
border-related issues, like smuggling, trespass and trafficking in
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the official said, the Indian home secretary was
supposed to arrive here this month, but his trip was deferred in
view of the devastating floods Bangladesh is now facing.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh formally requested India on August 25 to stop
pushing Bengali-speaking "Indian citizens" into Bangladesh in the
interest of the two countries, against the backdrop that India had
made a series of attempts to push what India called "illegal
Bangladeshi nationals" into the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad has reiterated
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's assertion that "no Bangladeshi
nationals are staying illegally in India."
</P>
<P>
From mid-August on, the situation on the Bangladesh-India
border has become a bit tense.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Gov't Indicts Benazir on Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
indicted former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto on money
laundering and handed over incriminating evidence to Pakistani
authorities here Wednesday, a senior anti-corruption official
said.
</P>
<P>
Benazir and her husband Asif Ali Zardari stashed away an
estimated 500 million U.S. dollars in 30 Swiss banks, Chairman of
Pakistan's Ethesab Bureau (accountability cell) Saif -ur-Rehman
told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The original indictment order of Swiss Judge Daniel Devaud was
handed over by Swiss Charge D' Affairs to an additional secretary
of the Foreign Office here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This indictment order against Benazir Bhutto will be served on
her through the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court within a few
days because this court was hearing Bhutto's corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Saif said he was "hopeful Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari are
awarded punishment within three to four months."
</P>
<P>
Despite request by Pakistan, the Swiss Government had refused
to make it a party to its investigation into the money laundering
case, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Government, he said, initiated the probe on its own
after the Ehtesab Bureau provided photo copies of Swiss Banks
proving Bhutto's involvement in money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Under Swiss law, Bhutto will be given two options, either to
defend herself before a jury comprising a professional magistrate
and ten jurors drawn from amongst the population, or before a
Criminal court consisting of two judges.
</P>
<P>
The jury can give her as long as 10 years' imprisonment while
the two judges have the powers to hand her a maximum prison term
of 18 months if she is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
If Benazir refuses to receive the indictment order, the
Pakistani government will send it back to the Swiss government for
further legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
If the Swiss court gives its decision against Benazir Bhutto
after hearing her, the Pakistani government will be obliged to
hand over her and her husband to Swiss authorities under an
existing extradition treaty between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Market: Price Drop, But Not Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- House prices fell slightly in
August in Britain, but the drop does not signal the start of a
property recession, according to Halifax, UK's biggest mortgage
lender.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the bank showed that the average price of a home
has risen by 5.3 percent over the last year, but in August the
market went into reverse and prices dropped 0.1 percent compared
with July.
</P>
<P>
"This does not signal the start of a housing recession but does
continue to strengthen our belief that the market is only growing
at a moderate rate," the Halifax said.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax is standing by its earlier forecast that annual
house price inflation for the last three months of the year would
be around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bank dismissed a suggestion from London
financial City analysts that house prices were "coming off the
boil."
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that house prices have only been on the boil in
London where City analysts live, throughout the rest of the
country it has been much more moderate.
</P>
<P>
"The market is performing just as we expected and there are
upturn and downturns but not the boom and bust that we've seen in
the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier survey, however, Britain's housing
market appeared to be cooling, as house prices were falling for
the first time in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
Figures published by the Nationwide Building Society showed
that the annual rate of price rises was at its lowest since April
1997.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Divisional Manager David Parry said, "Although one
month's figures should not be seen in isolation, persistently high
interest rates and weakening consumer confidence mean that house
prices are likely to be somewhat less robust in the coming
months."
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that the house price inflation peaked towards
the end of 1997 and has been on a modest downward trend ever
since," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Indirectly Urges U.S. to Make Known Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday indirectly
urged the United States to make known its position towards the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that it was unclear whether the U.S. had any
foreknowledge of a proposal by Turkey and northern Cyprus
regarding the establishment of a confederation on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Those who, without making known what they wanted, simply
undertook initiatives for the resolution of the Cyprus problem,
did not respect the countries taking part in this process and
turned their backs on reality and the decisions of the U.N.
Security Council, he said, adding that these things did not
correspond.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the framework and basis on which
the Cyprus issue must be resolved were the resolutions passed by
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Greece has flatly rejected the idea of establishing a
confederation on the divided republic, saying that such a move was
unacceptable because it was a clear attempt by the Turkish side to
succeed in having northern Cyprus recognized and to undermine
Cyprus' attempt accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The official exchanged rate of
the ruble set by the Central Bank for Thursday dived to 12.8198
rubles to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The new rate, announced Wednesday by the bank's public
relations department, represents a 17.8 percent fall on the
proceeding day's figure and way below the bottom rate of 9.5
rubles to the dollar set by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and head of the State Tax
Service, said the currency corridor policy pursued by the central
bank has failed.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference Wednesday that the currency corridor
"gave the go-ahead to speculations" on the financial market.
</P>
<P>
"Now the Central Bank must announce a floating exchange rate
and allow it to slowly move to the actual level," the Interfax
news agency quoted Fyodorov as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, has asked President Boris Yeltsin to fire Central Bank
Governor Sergei Dubinin.
</P>
<P>
The demand was contained in a resolution passed 267-2 in the
lower house of parliament on the socio-economic and financial
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Duma described the actions taken by the government and the
Central Bank to overcome the financial crisis as "unsatisfactory
and belated."
</P>
<P>
Dubinin, however, has reportedly told Duma deputies that he
does not intend to resign.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Prime Minister to Visit Egypt Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is due in Cairo next week to discuss with Egyptian leaders
the bilateral ties and the stalled Middle East peace process,
Lebanon's National News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lebanese Ambassador in Cairo Hasham Damqia
as saying that Hariri will co-chair with his Egyptian counterpart
Kamal El-Ganzouri the third session of the Lebanese-Egyptian Joint
Council next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The session, which will last for two days, will focus on
cooperation agreements on the establishment of free trade zone,
holding of goods exhibitions in both countries and promotion of
trade, Damqia said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries stood at 74 million U.S.
dollars in 1997, as Egypt has been registering trade surplus in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
Damqia said that during his stay in Cairo, Hariri will also
hold talks with Egyptian leaders on the stalled Middle East peace
process and the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up an 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern
areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and its two neighbors Syria and
Lebanon have been in a standstill since early 1996 due to the
dispute over the future of the Golan Heights which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, backed by its closest ally Syria, has rejected an
Israeli offer to withdraw from south Lebanon under a condition
that the Lebanese government prevents the Muslim guerrillas from
attacking its northern towns after its troop pullout.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Omagh Bombers Fail in Derailing Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday the Omagh bombers had failed in their attempt
to derail the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a debate in parliament on the new measures
designed to eradicate those still committed to terrorism, Blair
said the bombers had failed "because violence and terror represent
the past in Northern Ireland and democracy and peace represent the
future."
</P>
<P>
Blair also announced the intent to legislate on "long-held
plans to make it a criminal offense of conspiracy to commit
offenses outside the UK."
</P>
<P>
Blair said such legislation was necessary to prevent worldwide
terrorism such as recent attacks in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He pointedly referred to the bombing of the American embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Conservative party leader William Hague promised
that his party would support the government's anti-terrorist
legislation but voiced concern that powers of internment had been
removed from the statute book.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown also pledged support but
complained that measures which had "nothing to do with Northern
Ireland" were included in the bill.
</P>
<P>
The emergency session coincided with a debate to introduce
similar laws in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern promised to "crush and
dismantle" anyone determined to continue with terrorist
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are losing
millions of U.S. Dollars in terms of export revenue as the crisis
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Lusaka-based COMESA
secretariat, the DRC's total imports from other COMESA members
were estimated to rise to about 150 million U.S. Dollars by the
end of this year but with the on-going war, this would not be
realized.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the DRC has been growing as a steady
trading partner for the 21-member regional grouping since 1996
when its total exports to that country grew from 85 million U.S.
Dollars in 1995 to about 100 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The former Zaire which joined COMESA last year has also been
Zambia's largest market for non-traditional exports. The report
shows that Zambian companies which were exporting to the DRC are
now stuck with their products due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, with the aim to achieve a free market by the year 2000,
is also losing out in terms of investment that is on hold as the
DRC has a number of investment opportunities in its mines as well
as hydro electric power, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Duma Says Economic Crisis Threatens National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian lower house of
parliament said Wednesday that the economic crisis is threatening
the country's security.
</P>
<P>
In a statement passed unanimously, the State Duma said the
situation "poses a serious threat to the security of the Russian
Federation as a sovereign state and requires a change in the
economic policy."
</P>
<P>
"The August collapse of the financial system resulted from the
accumulation of the state debt, the outflow of capitals from the
country, instability, and lack of confidence in power," the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement was prepared by a trilateral commission grouping
members of the Duma, and the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, and the government.
</P>
<P>
It called for decisive and well-considered measures to prevent
the crisis from deteriorating and consolidation of all branches of
power and political movements to face the "nation-wide task."
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the government and the Central Bank to take
all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the deposits of
individuals with commercial banks, to restore their liquidity, and
to avoid the crashing of the system of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the pleas and statements, Russia's economic woes
worsened Wednesday, as the Central Bank set Thursday's official
exchange rate at 12.8198 rubles to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The new rate represents a 17.8 percent fall on the proceeding
day's figure and way below the bottom rate of 9.5 rubles to the
dollar set by the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes Rwanda's Genocide Judgement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday welcomed the first-ever judgement on the
crime of genocide by an international court.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda Wednesday found
its first defendant Jean Paul Akayeau, a former Hutu mayor of Taba
commune, guilty of nine counts including genocide, crimes against
humanity and violations of the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
said this is a landmark decision in the history of international
criminal law, and it brings to life, for the first time, the
ideals of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide adopted 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the judgement is a testament to the
collective determination to confront the heinous crime of genocide
and a defining example of the ability of the United Nations to
establish an effective international legal order and the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that this judgement will contribute to
the long-term process of national reconciliation in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was created by
the United Nations Security Council in November 1994. During the
year, at least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were brutally massacred.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NATO Chief Tried for Alleged Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Ex-NATO Secretary-General
Willy Claes went on trial Wednesday in a multi-million franc
bribery case that was dubbed by Belgians as "the trial of the
century."
</P>
<P>
The trial was held at Belgium's highest court.
</P>
<P>
Claes, Belgian economy minister at the time of the alleged
"gift money" given to his Socialist Party in the late 1980s, is
one of the 12 former Belgian politicians and businessmen accused
of corruption in the Agusta/Dassault case.
</P>
<P>
Claes was forced to resign from the top NATO post in October
1995 when allegations rose that the economy minister, who also
served as foreign minister and was responsible for comparing rival
bids from helicopter manufacturers, received bribery.
</P>
<P>
The trial will investigate cash gifts allegedly given by the
Italian company Agusta and the French company Dassault in the late
1980s after they won multi-million franc contracts to supply
Belgium with 46 A-106 helicopters and to refit the electronic
systems in the country's F-16 fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
The death of Socialist Party politician Andre Cools in 1991 led
to the discovery of irregularities in party funds that in turn led
to a report alleging that the granting of the 1988 contract to
Agusta was tainted with illegal acts and suggesting technical
evaluations of the rival bids were handled by Belgian cabinet
members to make Agusta's bid more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The Agusta probe then led up to allegations over Dassault.
</P>
<P>
All the 12 accused, including ex-Belgian Defense Minister Guy
Coeme and former Socialist Party Chairman Guy Spitaels, have
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
One key defendant, former Agusta President Raffaelo Teti, died
from a heart attack 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last well into December and if found
guilty, the accused could face five years in jail.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediates for Cease-Fire in DRC: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
been trying to mediate between Zimbabwe and the forces fighting
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Zimbabwean paper
The Herald as saying Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had instructed U.S. diplomats in Harare to
press for safe passage for anti-Kabila troops trapped in western
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The region was captured by Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian
forces backing Kabila in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unidentified government sources, the paper said the
U.S. has been asked by Uganda and Rwanda to intervene
diplomatically because their troops were trapped in western DRC.
</P>
<P>
It was almost certain that the information was from Zimbabwe's
senior government officials, and has been published by The Herald
on the instructions of the government, SAPA quoted Western
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said U.S. ambassador Tom MacDonald, acting on
Albright's instructions, had been busy advocating proposals for
"some kind of cease-fire and standstill arrangement for the
allied (Angolan, Namibian and Zimbabwean) forces".
</P>
<P>
It said Zimbabwean Defense Force commander, General Vitalis
Zvinavashe, is now in Luanda to discuss the U.S. proposals with
Angolan military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said Wednesday that Namibian,
Angolan and Zimbabwean troops would not leave the DRC until the
rebellion had been quelled.
</P>
<P>
He told the Non-Aligned Movement summit that the presence
of the troops was in line with agreements of the Southern
African Development Community.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Lays Off 27,677 Because of Pilots Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Northwest Airlines has
laid off 27,677 employees and canceled all its flights through
weekend since the start of the pilots strike last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The airline announced laying off of 27,500 employees Wednesday
following 177 layoffs Tuesday. The affected employees include
mechanics, flight attendants, customer service employees and other
ground workers.
</P>
<P>
Northwest said more layoffs among its approximately 50,000
employees may follow and it also canceled all inbound flights from
Europe and Asia through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Because of the layoffs, the airline would need eight to 10 days
to resume a full flight schedule when the strike ended, airlines
spokesman Jon Austin said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of new layoffs and flight cancellations came
on the fifth day of the strike by 6,100 pilots, despite an attempt
to resume negotiations to resolve the differences between the
company and the striking union over compensation and job security.
</P>
<P>
The National Mediation Board called an "exploration meeting"
Wednesday to bring airline and union negotiators back to the table
to identify areas of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, ordered by President
Bill Clinton, held meetings with the airline and the union
Tuesday. Both sides said at the meeting that there was room for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Northwest is the nation's sixth-largest airline in terms of
passengers carried annually and the fourth-largest in revenue. It
carries nearly 150,000 passengers a day on 1,700 flights in North
America, Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Praises World Population Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia described on
Wednesday the significance of the state of world population
report-1998 to the country as "very great indeed".
</P>
<P>
In a statement made at the launching of the state of the world
population report-1998 here, Negussie Teferra, head of Ethiopia's
national office of population said the report concentrates on the
part to be played by the new generations in the attainment of
sustainable development and on issues particularly related to
reproductive health and rights.
</P>
<P>
The state of world population report-1998, published by the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), was officially launched
worldwide on Wednesday under the theme "The New Generations".
</P>
<P>
According to the report, among the 5.9 billion population in
the world today, there are about 1.05 billion young people
between the age of 15 and 24. The proportion of adolescent
population is reported to be 34 percent for less developed
countries, 19 percent for more developed and 43 percent for least
developed.
</P>
<P>
Negussie pointed out that as Ethiopia is in the very last
category, the significance of the report to Ethiopia is very
great indeed.
</P>
<P>
He said young people have special needs for health care and
education including the very important area of sexual and
reproduc- tive health both to fulfill their individual potential
and to make the maximum possible contribution to development.
</P>
<P>
He outlined focus areas of support for adolescents in
Ethiopia's fourth country program which included, among others,
establishing youth friendly reproductive health and family
planning service delivery centers and providing counseling
services specifically suitable for adolescents.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the elderly people in Ethiopia, Negussie said
although there are a variety of welfare institutions in Ethiopia
catering to the needs of the elderly, the services they render
leaves much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
The government alone can not handle all kinds of welfare
requirements geared to elderly people, he said, and called on
non-governmental organizations and members of the community at
large to pull their efforts together to save the elderly from
facing diverse problems in their old age while at the same time
designing viable programs of a lasting nature.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged here Wednesday leaders of Russia's political parties and
movements to work together in the face of economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told the officials that Washington will render support if
the parties find a way to work together on overcoming the crisis
and the democratic basis is preserved in Russia, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks during a meeting at the U.S.
ambassador's residence with representatives of major Russian
political parties and movements as well as regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the absence of such a system of relations would
plunge Russia into a situation whereby investors would flee under
the rules of global economic operation.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov described his meeting with
Clinton as useful, noting Clinton's summit Wednesday might be the
final meeting with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "seemed to be very surprised when I told him that Mr.
Yeltsin did not work with parliament at all," Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party is the largest opposition faction in the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, occupying 133 of the 450
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Duma Monday overwhelmingly rejected Yeltsin's choice of
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko movement, said
Clinton's visit to Moscow "in the context of the very fierce
economic and political crisis in Russia is a good sign."
</P>
<P>
He told Clinton that support should be given to the democratic
course in general, not to individual personalities," Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Other participants at the meeting included Krasnoyarsk
territory Governor Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan President Mintimer
Shaimiyev, Our Home Is Russia faction leader Alexander Shokhin and
Duma International Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin and
Defense Committee Chairman Roman Popkovich.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to leave here Thursday for Ireland and the
British province of Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the opposition
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) who hold
posts in the Angolan government Wednesday called for dismissing
Jonas Savimbi from the UNITA presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued here, these officials including some
suspended ministers and deputy ministers urged all the patriotic
UNITA members to keep onto the track of the Angolan peace process
and choose the route of national reconciliation and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Valenti, who was suspended Monday as minister of hotel
and tourism, read the declaration at a press conference with
Deputy Defense Minister Demostenes Chilingutila and former UNITA
general secretary Eugenio Manuvakola in presence.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the patriotic members of the UNITA
have chosen the route of peace, national reconciliation and
democracy instead of civil war in their political struggle.
</P>
<P>
They hope that the hard-won cease-fire will be cherished and
the final tasks written in the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accords will be
completed with the help of the United Nations observer mission,
it said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, it called for removing Savimbi from the
presidency of the UNITA, dismissing the current leaders, setting
up a provisional leadership and holding a national congress.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process is facing the serious crisis in four
years. The UNITA did not disband all of its troops and refused
to turn the areas formerly controlled by the rebel group into the
hands of the government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the renewed fightings between the rebel soldiers and
the government troops have resulted in hundreds of deaths and
displaced many people.
</P>
<P>
On August 24, the UNITA announced a decision to stop its
cooperation with the U.N. observers from Russia, the United
States and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government Monday suspended the UNITA members in
the government of national unity and the congress of people.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, the UNITA held 70 seats in the parliament and
had four ministers and seven deputy ministers in the government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Urged to Reconsider Denktash's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Wednesday urged
Cyprus and Greece to reconsider the proposal put forward by
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for creating a confederation
in the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that if the proposal was
wasted, the tension in Cyprus might escalate to a level which
would lead to a permanent division of the island.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Denktash proposed that a bi-communal confederation
"equal states " of Turkish and Greek Cypriots be established to
settle the long-running Cyprus crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Cyprus and its closest ally Greece have categorically
rejected Denktash's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Those who do not bother to consider Denktash's proposal
carefully may regret in the future. I hope that Greece and
Greek Cypriots will sooner or later understand the merits of
Denktash's' proposal," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposal as not being tactical, he said it was
"a scheme which has the biggest chance of being realized since it
is based on political realities in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' President Glafkos Clerides, who was in Durban of South
Africa for the Non-Aligned Movement summit, said Monday that
Denktash's proposal contradicts the spirit of the United Nations
resolutions for the settlement of Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which supports the Greek Cypriot-controlled Cypriot
government, has also dismissed the Turkish Cypriot proposal as
"unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third after an abortive
coup by some Greek Cypriot military officers attempting to seek
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
To contend with the internationally acknowledged Republic of
Cyprus dominated by Greek Cypriots in the south, Turkish Cypriots
declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in the north, which was only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
communities broke down last summer when Denktash walked out to
protest against the European Union's decision to start accession
talks with the Cypriot government.

KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A member of parliament from
the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) has said no cease-fire
with the rebels should be passed by the country's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Major Noble Mayambo made the remarks Wednesday afternoon when
contributing to a cease-fire motion moved by a member of
parliament (MP) for Samia Bugwe North Aggrey Awori, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
Noble said that the UPDF has a historical and constitutional

safeguard the territorial integrity of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the parliament never to seek a resolution that
will allow gunmen to unseat a popularly-elected government and
rule the country.
</P>
<P>
The government army is fighting a principled war and should be
supported and applauded for their contribution to the national
security.
</P>
<P>
He urged the MPs to build strong foundations to guarantee
peace and ensure constitutional rule in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire motion was tabled Tuesday seeking to persuade
the Ugandan government and the rebels to declare a cease-fire so
as to initiate peace talks.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian anti-drug
authorities have foiled an attempt to smuggle large quantity of
drugs into the kingdom, the Saudi Press Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mujab Bin Mohammad Al-Qahtani, an official of the southern
Najran Administrative District, was quoted as saying that security
patrols seized 651,000 drug tablets near the border with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qahtani said the smugglers tried to get rid of the tablets
when they were being chased by the patrols.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the time when the drugs were
confiscated and their source.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Saudi anti-narcotics authorities, aided by
Pakistani security forces, also aborted a bid to smuggle 200
kilograms of hashish to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Like other oil-rich Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has become one
of the major targets of drug traffickers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf kingdom, which adopts a strict policy against
narcotics, imposes capital punishment against drug traffickers and
dealers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Central Bank Lets Ruble Free Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- As the ruble shed nearly 18
percent in a single day Wednesday, the Russian Central Bank
formally admitted that it has given up maintaining the exchange
corridor of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated Wednesday, the Central Bank said
it had to give up efforts to maintain an upper limit on the
ruble's official exchange rate, 9.5 rubles to the dollar, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the Central bank sold more than 9
billion U.S. dollars from its currency reserves in July and August
to support the ruble, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The period following the August 17 announcement of new limits
for the currency corridor was extremely complicated and the
situation developed according to the worst scenario imaginable,"
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
To restore the normal functioning of the currency market, an
electronic fixing system will start working on the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Central Bank Deputy Chairman Denis Kiselyov
praised the floating exchange rate, created through the electronic
fixing system, as the optimum foreign exchange policy in today's
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that back on August 17, the decision to set the
exchange band at 6.0 to 9.5 rubles to the dollar was taken with
the hope that "if events took a normal course, the rate could be
held within the established parameters without any intervention
(by the government)."
</P>
<P>
"What is happening now in economics and politics can in no way
be called a normal course of events, and we are facing a choice:
either to spend our foreign exchange reserves to keep the rate
within the limits of the corridor, or to leave the rate floating
the way it is and save the reserves for emergency measures,"
Kiselyov told the local Ekho Moskvy radio station.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was impossible under the present
circumstances to foresee how far the ruble will fall and how high
inflation will rise.
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate for Thursday set by the Central Bank
Wednesday was 12.8198 rubles to the dollar, a 17.8 percent fall on
the proceeding's figure.
</P>
<P>
Kiselyov said the inflation rate "depends on how many rubles
will have to be thrown in the economy and on how many rubles will
need to be issued to support lending organizations and Russia's
Sberbank to enable them to pay off deposits.
</P>
<P>
Sberbank is Russia's largest savings bank.
</P>
<P>
"And that depends on how soon it will be possible to stabilize
the situation in the country as a whole and on fiscal matters --
on how taxes will be connected," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned Over Angola's Decision to Expel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations was
deeply concerned over the decision by the Angolan government to
suspend representatives of the former rebel UNITA from the
cabinet, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government Monday announced the expulsion of
representatives of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) from parliament and from the government of
national unity because it failed to disarm in accordance with the
Lusaka Protocol signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fragile peace process in the country slipped deeper into
crisis after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The suspension further jeopardizes attempts to get the peace
process back on track," said Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is
now in South Africa attending a summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement, would bring up the suspension with Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton
said in Belfast Wednesday that America would support the Northern
Irish people in their quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
Hillary arrived at the Northern Irish capital Wednesday
afternoon to attend a conference on women's development. Her
husband President Bill Clinton will arrive in the British province
Thursday for a one-day visit,
</P>
<P>
At the conference, she praised women across the divided
community for striving to bury animosity and heal the wounds of a
conflict pitting pro-Irish and pro-British militias that claimed
3,600 lives in the course of three decades.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow my husband will come here... to address your new
Assembly and congratulate the citizens of Northern Ireland for
this hard-won peace that is yours," she said in a speech given to
400 women and some prominent politicians who were once arch foes.
</P>
<P>
She said that she and President Clinton would travel to Omagh
to "pay tribute to those who were murdered by the enemies of
peace."
</P>
<P>
"They were mostly women and children, they were Catholic and
Protestant, unionists and nationalist," said the U.S. first lady.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists targeted the people of Northern Ireland and in
response it was the people, all the people, who bravely stood side
by side to say `hatred and violence will no longer have a place
here, we have chosen ballots not bombs, democracy not
division... we will only move forward.' And as you do, please know
that America will stand with you," she said.
</P>
<P>
"All of you are now the architects of a new environment. You
are ultimately those who will determine whether the children of
Northern Ireland can play like children should -- without respect
to religion or politics, without stereotyping or name-calling,
without fear of violence," she added.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court Finds Former Rwandan Mayor Guilty of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), in the first-ever judgement
by an international court for the crime of genocide, Wednesday
found Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former Rwandan mayor, guilty of
genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Akayesu was found guilty of direct and public
incitement to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity
(extermination, murder, torture, rape, and other inhumane acts),
according to an ICTR statement reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In finding Akayesu guilty on nine counts in his indictment,
the court, based in northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, firmly
established the individual responsibility of the accused for the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
In its judgement, three judges of the Trial Chamber 1
unanimously found Akayesu, former mayor of Taba in central
Rwanda, guilty of nine out of the 15 counts on which he was
charged, and not guilty of six counts in his indictment.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old former Rwandan official, however, had pleaded
not guilty to all 15 counts.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was created by the United Nations Security Council in
November of 1994 after one of the intense periods of mass
exterminations in human history.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were brutally massacred in just three months in the middle of
that year.
</P>
<P>
The chamber stated that "there was an intention to wipe out
the Tutsi group in its entirety, since even newborn babies were
not spared."
</P>
<P>
At least 2,000 Tutsis were killed in Taba between April 7 and
the end of June in 1994 while Akayesu held office as mayor.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the accused stopped trying to maintain law
and order and was subsequently present during the killings and
sometimes gave orders himself for bodily or mental harm to be
caused to certain Tutsis, and endorsed and even ordered the
killing of several Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
It said Akayesu also incited genocide by leading and
addressing a public gathering on April 19, 1994, during which he
urged the population to unite to kill the Tutsis in general.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said numerous women seeking refuge at
the Taba communal office from the massacres were systematically
raped and regularly subjected to multiple acts of sexual violence
by the armed local militia.
</P>
<P>
Prior to becoming the mayor of Taba commune, Akayesu was a
school teacher and school inspector. He entered politics and the
Mouvement Democratique Republican (MDR) in 1991 and became
Chairman of the local wing of the MDR in Taba.
</P>
<P>
In April of 1993, he was elected mayor of Taba and held that
position until June of 1994 when he fled Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu was arrested in Zambia in October of 1995, indicted by
the ICTR in February of 1996, and transferred three months later
from Zambia to Arusha, where he was detained at the tribunal's
detention facility. His trial began in January last year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, which is more significant, the ICTR will
pronounce the first ever sentence for genocide.
</P>
<P>
Jean Kambanda, who was Rwandan Prime Minister during the
genocide, has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR is the first international body charged specifically
with prosecuting crimes of genocide. The maximum sentence the
tribunal can impose is life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has in its custody a total of 26 indicted
Rwandans and five suspects. All the 31 come from what Tribunal
Registrar Agwu Okali calls "the commanding heights" of Rwanda's
governing elite during the time the genocide took place.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested by countries across Africa and Europe and
delivered to the tribunal in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another accused, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a
Pastor, is being held in Texas in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. federal judge ordered his deportation to Arusha on
August 5 but he has one month in which to appeal.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal's next major challenge will be to find countries
which will accept for incarceration those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Denmark have definitively indicated their
willingness to take some of those convicted, and a number of
African states and others have opened negotiations with tribunal
officials as well.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal prefers that as many of the convicted as possible
be convicted within Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A regional police commander
in Uganda Wednesday urged local people to be more vigilant and
suspicious of any wrong elements.
</P>
<P>
Bakesiima Chrisostom, the central region police commander,
made the call Wednesday morning when addressing a bomb scare
awareness meeting in Mubende district, some 100 kilometers west
of capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of the business
community, heads of government departments and security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Chrisostom warned local people against the habit of picking
and storing nice-looking objects that may turn out to be bombs,
adding that thorough checks shall be done on people entering
taxis, hotels, churches, petrol stations, banks and other public
places.
</P>
<P>
People were encouraged to be effective and to report any
suspicious situations to the police.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were advised to install security lights to guide
security personnel on night duty.
</P>
<P>
Ever since August 25 when a total of 30 people were killed in
three bus explosions, police have used various means of media to
educate people on self-protection in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets have also been distributed to enhance people's safety
awareness.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel are dispatched to check passengers' parcels
at bus stations.

Though several arrests have been made, there is still no

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Advance Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pledged on Wednesday to make efforts to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled for 18
months, Israeli Prime Minister's Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the office said Clinton made the
promise in a phone conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu from Moscow, where he was holding a summit with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would work together with Netanyahu to advance
the peace process after he returns to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He added that he intended to speed up the peace talks between
Israel and Palestinians, which is stuck on the dispute over
Israel's second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has since earlier this year urging Israel to hand over
13.1 percent of West Bank in exchange for the fulfillment of the
Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has already
accepted the U.S. initiative, Israel has so far refused to
publicly endorsed it on security grounds.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu has repeatedly said in recent speeches that he is
ready to carry out the 13.1 percent withdrawal if the Palestinian
side accepts some conditions set by Israel.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions is believed to be the demand for turning
3 percent of the proposed territories be designated as a nature
reserve, over which Israel would have overall security control and
the Palestinians are not allowed to build.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Moscow also said that Clinton also made a phone
call to PNA President Yasser Arafat, who is attending the
Non-Aligned Movement summit in South Africa, to discuss the latest
developments in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's phone calls were regarded as a way to register his
disappointment with the prolonged deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

<HEADLINE> All Regions Register Record Flows of FDI in 1997: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- World foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows continued to expand in 1997 and are expected to grow
further in 1998, said the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in a report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, FDI outflows reached 424 billion U.S. dollars while
FDI inflows amounted to 400 billion dollars, up 27.1 percent and
18.6 percent compared with 333 billion in 1995 and 338 billion in
1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted that as recorded in 1997, world FDI did not
decline in the wake of the East Asian financial crisis," said the
UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the continued expansion of global FDI mainly to
the growth of large-scale cross-border mergers and acquisitions
(M&AMP;As) among developed countries. Cross-border M&AMP;As involving more
than 1 billion dollars announced in 1997 amounted to 161 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Despite divergent economic performance of individual
countries, FDI reached record levels in all major country
groupings in 1997," said the UNCTAD. "Developing countries as a
group account for more than one third of world FDI flows."
</P>
<P>
Inflows to developing countries rose at a slower rate than to
the developed ones, but were still up by a significant 15 percent
to reach 149 billion dollars while outflows were up 24 percent to
61 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries invested 359 billion dollars globally in
1997, up by 27 percent over 1996, and attracted 233 billion
dollars, 19 percent higher than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic increases were registered in central and eastern
Europe, although still at relatively small levels, said the
UNCTAD. FDI inflows to the region increased by 44 percent to 19
billion dollars and outflows more than tripled to 3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of FDI is clearly contributing to the
increasing internationalization and integration of economies, with
firms producing more and more outside their home country," said
the UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
"Seven percent of global GDP is now generated by production of
foreign affiliates of transnational corporations," it said. "If
parent firms were included the proportion would be much higher."

<HEADLINE> Romania's Economy Declined in The First Seven Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest data of National
Statistics Commission confirmed the decline of Romania's economic
activity, especially industrial activity.
</P>
<P>
The data show a new regression of industrial production which
decreased 6.2 percent in July compared to June, and the decrease
in the first seven months of the year reached 18.6 percent,
compared to the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This situation may be explained by a diminished activity in all
industrial branches, mainly, in the mining, the electric and
thermal power where the production declined by 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the foreign trade is also worrisome, with a
deficit of balance amounting to 1335.7 million U.S. dollars during
the first half of this year as against 1073.5 million scored
during the same period of the previous year. The exports amounted
to 4094.7 million dollars, a 1.3 percent decrease compared to the
same period of the previous year, while the imports totalling
5430.4 million dollars which represents a rise by 4.0 percent as
against the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Still, there are a few positive items from this data about a
small increase of economic investments by 0.8 percent in real
terms. The level of investments increased especially in the
manufacturing industry, the electric and thermal power industry,
agriculture and the tertiary sector.
</P>
<P>
The investments volume in the joint sector grew more than four
times, and by 6.4 percent those in the private one, detrimental to
those of the public sector which fell by 15.8 percent.

AMMAN -- The World Bank (WB) has proposed Jordan adjust
investment structure and speed up privatization to revive its
national economy, said a Jordan Businessmen Association (JBA)
statement obtained here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by John Page, WB's chief economist for
the Middle East and North Africa Region, during a JBA-sponsored
meeting on Tuesday in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has to adjust the current investment
structure by directing investors' priorities towards the
productive sector rather than building houses in order to create
"a balance between commercial and non-commercial investments,"
said Page.
</P>
<P>
A balanced investment structure, plus a healthy ratio of
investment to the gross domestic products (GDP), will contribute
much to reviving Jordan's economy, whose growth rates almost
grounded to zero in the past few years, said Page.

with no result achieved, means nothing to Iraq other than
confirming the fact that continued dealing with UNSCOM is of no
use," Aziz said.

insisted the factory produced only medicines and other goods, also
said that he would seek from the Congress reparations for victims
of the U.S. bombings.
</P>
<P>
He described as "unbelievable" and "disgraceful" the U.S.
bombing of the factory, which, he insisted produced only medicines
and other goods.
</P>
<P>
To believe the U.S. allegations that the factory produced
chemical weapons agents "is to strain credibility beyond its
limits," he said. He called the U.S. bombing a "Wild West shoot
first and ask questions later" type operation.
</P>
<P>
Some of lawmakers have expressed support for the
administration's action, but Republican Senator Robert Bennett
said he believed that the case for bombing the factory was weaker
than the one for the simultaneous attack on the suspected
"terrorist-related" base in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad, who has served here for two years, was away from
Washington when the attack on the factory took place. Shortly
thereafter the Sudanese government announced it was withdrawing
its diplomats from Washington, Mohamad said he is now implementing
that decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that this interruption will be temporary," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Urges Police to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi Wednesday urged all police in the country to
improve their skills, enhance efficiency and offer better
service.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican prime minister made the demand at a completion
ceremony of the police training course held in the Police
Training Center, 15 kilometers away from capital Maputo. Interior
Minister Almerinho Manheje, Minister of State Administration
Alfredo Gamito, Governor of Maputo Province Soares Nhaca and 580
trainees attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi pointed out that no cases of unlawfulness or
negligence of law should be allowed in the police force, saying
that police should be modest, just, fair, prudent and selfless in
performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
Manheje also noted that the police on duty should wear badges
so that the people can easily identify and supervise them.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister added that the measure is designed to
build up an atmosphere of trust among the masses and increase
justice and transparency in police service.
</P>
<P>
The three-month training course was sponsored by the United
Nations Development Program and the Spanish Police, and Germany
provided some equipments for it.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of the Mozambican government, a total
number of 4,000 policemen will attend the training course at the
center by April, 2000. The entire training plan is expected to
cost 12 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Rally but Close off Best Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- European shares staged a rally
but closed well off their best levels on Wednesday as worries
about Wall Street's ability to sustain yesterday's recovery and
fears about the Russian and Asian economies resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's 288-point overnight rally triggered early strength in
London, with the FTSE 100 index up 172.5 at one time. But Wall
Street's inability to hold best levels at this afternoon's
opening, however, prompted caution, and the FTSE 100 closed 66.7
points up at 5235.8.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices jumped 3.73 percent in the wake of a
good performance on Wall Street. The Dax index closed at 4,970.5
points, up from Tuesday's close of 4,791.81.
</P>
<P>
But traders said there was strong technical resistance at
around 5,000-5,010 on the Dax, and until the index managed to move
above that, the markets would remain volatile.
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a difficult stage. I can't say if this morning's
rise in share prices is just temporary or if the market is still
looking for a bottom," one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares retreated from their early highs as
volume slowed in cautious trading, which saw the Cac-40 index peak
at 3,749.19. The Cac eventually closed up 83.4 points at 3729.7.
</P>
<P>
Bond markets in Europe were restrained and generally a touch
weaker after sharp falls in the previous session. The benchmark 30
year U.S. long bond was slightly lower at 102-11 and yielding 5.34
percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices eased a touch in light profit-taking following the
overnight rally in U.S. stocks, but could easily rally once more,
if global stocks slide again, traders said.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Output Falls at Fastest Rate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's factory output is
falling at its fastest rate for at least six and half years,
according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
Almost 40 per cent of manufacturers reduced their output over
the past month, according to the latest monthly analysis by the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. Only a third as many
companies stepped up production.
</P>
<P>
The drop in production is considered in response to a further
weakening in domestic demand and export order books.
</P>
<P>
"Firms are responding by buying in fewer goods, running down
stocks and, worst of all, laying off staff," Peter Thomson, the
chartered institute's director-general, as quoted by the Financial
Times newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Export order books have been falling since May last year, in
the face of sterling's strength and escalation of the Asian
financial crisis. August's decline was the second largest recorded
since then. Domestic order books also weakened, but less than in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
As production has fallen and pressure to cut costs intensified,
companies have generally reduced purchases and stocks of inputs.
Stocks of unsold goods remained stable as intentional destocking
was offset by unintentional stockbuilding because sales came in
below expectations. Manufacturers continue to shed jobs, but at a
slower rate than recently, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the survey was unlikely to have much
impact on the interest rate deliberations of the Bank of England's
monetary policy committee, which has long expected a sharp
downturn in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Recent stock market falls have also raised doubts about the
likely strength of domestic spending in coming months, according
to analysts. These concerns have been reflected in interest rate
futures markets, which are now pencilling in a half-point cut in
base rates by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense Needs Huge Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States faces
staggering costs in developing its missile defense system under
tight budgets in the coming years, a U.S. Air Force general said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have a huge, huge bill in the future for
missile defense," and tens of billions of dollars would be needed
to enable the United States to shoot down ballistic missiles in
flight, Lieutenant General Lester Lyles told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lyles, head of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said
that because of the high costs and technical troubles, the
Pentagon might have to stop testing its Theater High Altitude Air
Defense (THAAD) system.
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed Martin Corp. designed THAAD, which was designed to
destroy medium-range missiles, suffered five successive failures
in tests. But the program has already cost 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking a number of missile defense
options but has virtually no effective defense against medium- or
longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Lyles said the U.S. military is operating within tight budgets
though Republicans in Congress are pressing the Pentagon and the
White House to move ahead with development of not only a "theater
missile defense" for troops and bases but also to build a more
costly U.S. national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Lyles, whose budget is 3.7 billion dollars this year, pointed
out that the costs of even short-range U.S. missile defenses were
growing rapidly. The cost of PAC-3 U.S. missiles designed to
destroy shorter-range attacking missiles had more than doubled
from original estimates of about 1 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pentagon expects the results of studies
this month on whether to conduct a new test of the "THAAD" later
in the year.
</P>
<P>
If the test fail again, the military has to build a new THAAD
missile, that could delay the program for up to two years, the
general said.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests Internet Technology for Science Museums in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An Australian expert suggested
today that China use internet technology to develop science and
technology museums.
</P>
<P>
Brenton Honeyman, an expert with the National Science and
Technology Center of Australia, offered the suggestion at the '98
Beijing International Conference on Science and Technology
Center/Museums held today at the China Science and Technology
Museum in Beijing. He pointed out that an increasing number of
science centers around the world have introduced computers to
enable people of all ages to enjoy the fascinating world of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Science centers are discovering that the Internet, the
Worldwide Web in particular, provides an excellent opportunity to
reach wide audiences and promote greater public contact,"
according to Honeyman.
</P>
<P>
He added that significant developments in browser software have
made it possible for web users to experience far greater levels of
"interactivity" than the passive scrolling which has dominated the
web in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Honeyman noted that China's population of 1.2 billion people
provides the nation's science centers and museums with the largest
potential audience in the world. However, he pointed to the fact
that most science museums have failed to give full play to
computers and noted the vast potential and prospects for their use.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Youwen, a senior engineer with the China Science and
Technology Museum, said that low rate of computer usage for
China's 285 science museums. He noted that most facilities simply
use computers to daily affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from general problems such as the lack of funds, a
major factor hindering the introduction of computer applications
in science museums centers on the lack of suitable software,"
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He called on related departments to increase funding to
promote the development and use of advanced internet technology
and computer application systems.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference has attracted Chinese experts and a
large group of scholars from a dozen of countries and regions,
including the Untied States, France and the Philippines. The
participants will discuss the development of science centers, as
well as related education, exhibits design and applications of
modern technology.
</P>
<P>
The conference, carrying the theme "Providing Education and
Inculcation for the Public," is a major academic exchange activity
initiated by the World Science Center (WSC). The first
international conference was held in Finland in 1996.

<P>
MOSCOW, September (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Russian State Duma
Gennady Seleznyov said on Thursday President Boris Yeltsin was
prepared to give more power to the government.
</P>
<P>
"As a gesture of good will and as the first step (toward a
compromise with the Duma) the president himself is ready to amend
the law on the government which would give the cabinet more
power," Seleznyov quoted Valentin Yumashev, chief of the Kremlin
administration, after their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
The change would enable the premier to have the right to choose
ministers and would give more space to the cabinet and soften
outside pressure upon it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Seleznyov and Yumashev is considered part
of the compromise between the State Duma and the Kremlin over
Yeltsin's effort to nominate Viktor Chernomyrdin for
premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Duma vetoed him on Monday and has scheduled to take the
second vote on Friday.
</P>

The Duma is seeking to limit Yeltsin's sweeping constitutional
power including the power of dissolving the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Iraq Working to Restore Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Iraq are working
toward the restoration of diplomatic ties, Syrian diplomatic
sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Syria reopened its trade center in Baghdad
Thursday and an Iraqi trade center is expected to open soon in
Damascus. The moves were widely seen as the lastest sign of
growing ties between the two neighbors after a lapse of 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Syria's Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh is now in Baghdad
to prepare for an exhibition of Syrian products, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq cut diplomatic relations with Syria in 1981 because of its
support for Iran in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
A thaw in the relations began after Syria sent a trade
delegation to Iraq in May 1997 and visits at ministerial level
have been exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has been picking up in the past
two years, during which Syria has exported 250 million
U.S. dollars worth of medicine, clothing and food to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's reopening of the Syrian trade center followed the
August 20 agreement between the two countries to re-start a
pipeline that carries Iraqi crude oil to Syrian Meiterranean ports.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that officials from Syrian Foreign Ministry
will arrive in Baghdad within days to inspect the premises of the
Syrian embassy which was closed down 17 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Snubs Duma Suggestion to Give Up Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday rejected a call from the State
Duma for him to voluntarily give up his nomination as premier.
</P>
<P>
"I shall not take such an irresponsible decision either in the
interest of work or calls of my conscience," Chernomyrdin said at
a government meeting.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, on Monday
overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin's nomination and passed a
resolution Wednesday urging him to reject the post.
</P>
<P>
"I have no other country or destiny. My children and
grandchildren will live here," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Chernomyrdin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the call for a speedy establishment of a
"government of concord" grouping professionals and those willing
to work, rather than those with political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also refuted accusations that he was using the
premiership as a springboard to presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chernomyrdin continued his efforts
Thursday to muster support, meeting leaders of 33 administrative
regions.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that addressing the situation with "usual
approaches" is "almost impossible."
</P>
<P>
There are reports that Chernomyrdin will make "sensational"
announcements Friday in the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Russia again has been plunged into a serious spiral of the
crisis which negatively affects the whole economy, and in these
conditions the government needs to decide what to do and how so as
not to allow serious shocks," he said, noting that "this is the
main thing one needs to avoid."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is scheduled to hold a second round of voting
on Chernomyrdin's nomination Friday. Most opposition parties have
indicated that they would vote against him.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, if the Duma blocks the nomination
of the premiership three times, the president will have to either
name a new candidate or dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
However, a Wednesday letter to Chernomyrdin says that "the
dissolution of the State Duma will not alleviate the
crisis. Rather, it will bring about irreconcilable political
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"Chernomyrdin has found himself in the center of a conflict and
now has to make a decision which will shape the fate of the entire
country as well as his own," the document said.

Eduardo Leano, vice-president of the club, said that they were
awaiting his response.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be cautious about how we proceed but we have heard
from reports in Argentina that a Mexican side is after him and we

Universidad sacked Mexican coach Victor Manuel Vucetich and

Leano said the club had not made any concrete arrangement with
Maradona but "simply registered our interest."

It was also reported earlier this month that Maradona, 37, was
mulling yet another playing comeback with Spanish second division

<HEADLINE> 36 Bodies Recovered from Plane Crash off Canadian Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six bodies have been
recovered from the crash of the Swissair jet off the coast of
Canada's Nova Scotia province, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the massive search-and-rescue effort has found no
survivors, Canadian police told a news briefing at Peggy's Cove,
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swissair confirmed that there were no survivors from
the crash. All 215 passengers and 14 crew aboard Flight 111 is
believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
The wide-bodied MD-11 jet crashed about 10:30 p.m. local time
(0130 GMT) Wednesday into the ocean 11 kilometers from Peggy's
Cove, a tiny fishing village on the south shore of Nova Scotia
province.
</P>
<P>
The three-engine plane, en route from New York to Geneva,
reported smoke in the cockpit after a normal takeoff from the JFK
international airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
The crew decided to turn back to Boston. After being told that
the Halifax airport was closer, the plane flew in the direction of
Halifax, but crashed into the Atlantic about 60 kilometers short
of its target.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers on board were thought to be Swiss, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Military aircraft, coast guard vessels and fishing boats
scoured the waters through the night.
</P>
<P>
Yet the inky and rough water made it difficult for rescuing
people to navigate through the debris field, which spread a couple
of kilometers across the sea.
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke on the southwest coast of Nova Scotia, a
shoreline search got under way.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, our main focus is on recovering the bodies,"
said Roy Bears of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, one of the
leading agencies in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Divers will be used to try to recover flight recorders from the
plane, the reports said. Waters in the area are about 50 meters
deep.
</P>
<P>
Canadian police appealed to the public Thursday to turn in any
debris from the crash, which might wash up the shore.
</P>
<P>
The weather there was reported to be overcast, with a light
sprinkle of rain.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the maker of the jet, was sending a team of people to
Nova Scotia to help in the investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The United States also sent a team of investigators to the
crash site, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Limited Russian Impact on Enlargement: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's financial crisis
would have a limited impact on the process of the European Union's
enlargement, a senior European Commission official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner responsible for
external relations with Russia and central and eastern Europe,
told the press, "We would like to make it perfectly clear that on
the basis of our analysis this impact should be a limited one."
</P>
<P>
The economic fundamentals in the central and eastern European
countries applying for European Union membership were sound and
there was no reason for a loss of confidence among investors, he
added at a joint press conference held together with Commission
President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said that the central and eastern European
countries in accession talks had reoriented their trade away from
Russia toward member states of the European Union after the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The EU started accession talks with Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus in late March this year.
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania also aspire to
join the union.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crisis in Russia underlined the need for
the central and eastern European countries to forge ahead with
adopting the legislation and building up the institutions
necessary to allow them to cross the EU threshold, said van den
Broek.
</P>
<P>
The fact that they had moved along the road while Russia had
not could help explain why the central and eastern European
countries were not facing the kind of financial crisis Russia was
now suffering, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are much less vulnerable because in the field of
legislation and institution-building they have made much more
progress than Russia," van den Broek said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, made its first assessment of the Russian crisis
Thursday after the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Commissioners agreed that the impact of the Russian financial
crisis would be limited on the economy of the union.
</P>
<P>
The EU's exports to Russia account for only 3.5 percent of the
union's total annual trade while its imports make up for 4 percent
of the total.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union expressed
Thursday "grave concern" over the missile testing conducted by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The concern was expressed through a written statement by
Austria that is serving the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
union.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the union expressed its grave concern
at the test which undermines the efforts to enhance peace and
security on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the DPRK to refrain from any further testing and
to exercise utmost restraint in its missile development and export
activities.
</P>
<P>
The union, a significant contributor to humanitarian assistance
in the Asian country, said that the missile testing created
further tensions in a region that is already facing a precarious
security environment.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned that a country which for several years
has required and received from the international community
extensive humanitarian assistance chooses to put its own scarce
resources into developing an offensive weapons system," the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar: NLD Parliament Decision Threat to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government said
Thursday that the declaration of the National League for Democracy
(NLD) to convene a national parliament on their own will be a
threat to Myanmar's national security.
</P>
<P>
An official information sheet, available here Thursday evening,
said, "The government of Myanmar noted with concern the decision
by the NLD to convene a national parliament. Such an action by any
individual political party would be in contravention of Myanmar
law, and seems designed to derail the ongoing discussions between
the government and the NLD," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It would amount to the NLD making herself a parallel
government which no government in the world could accept if they
come across the same situation," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The government warned that "In this scenario the government of
Myanmar will be left with no choice but to take necessary legal
action in safeguarding its national security."
</P>
<P>
The information sheet said the government believed that
"national unity, peace and stability are the most essential
elements the nation requires in order to develop economically and
politically."
</P>
<P>
On June 23, NLD leaders set a deadline for the ruling State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to meet their demand that the
parliament elected in the May 1990 multi-party general election be
convened for the first time within 60 days, but the government
made no response to the demand.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the NLD on August 21, the
NLD will convene a national parliament soon.
</P>
<P>
At the multi-party general election in May 1990, participated
by 93 political parties, the NLD won 396 out of 485 parliamentary
seats.
</P>
<P>
After the election and in January 1993, the Myanmar government
began to hold a national convention to lay down fundamental
principles for drawing up a new state constitution. However, all
the delegates of the representatives-elect of the NLD withdrew in
November 1995 from the convention, which has been in recess for
two and a half years since the last session ended in March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Non-government Groups Meet On Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's non-governmental
organizations and scientific institutes held a seminar Thursday to
facilitate the implementation of the country's aid-the-poor
program.
</P>
<P>
The seminar sought measures and ways to distribute relief loans
and worked out amendments to the program by drawing experience
from the past practice.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government began the national aid-the-poor
program in 1994. Since then, it has extended 2.2 billion tugrik
(2.59 million U.S. dollars) to help the poor families start
business or provide education to their children.
</P>
<P>
To aid the urban poor, the government initiated from the
beginning of this year a 7-year "green revolution" to encourage
city dwellers to plant potatoes and vegetables to increase market
supply and their income.
</P>
<P>
In the pastoral areas, it purchased animals for the poor
herdsmen on the condition that they would return the same number
of animals in five years and retain those produced in the period.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 500,000 Mongolians, one quarter
of the whole population, are now living under the poverty line.

LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government of
Nigeria is aimed at bringing all dilapidated power plants back to
their full utilization soon to improve power supply in the
country, a minister said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of power and Steel Alhaji Bello Suleiman
said that his government attached much priority to the power
plants' rehabilitation, adding that "we have a big plan to ensure
all the power plants are brought back to life", local press
reported Thursday,
</P>
<P>
Industry sources here estimated that the repair work to

Dollars as 49 out of 78 installed generating units in all the
power stations are believed to have broken down in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Public power supply is frequently interrupted in Lagos and
other cities because of the breakdown of power plants which is
due to lack of regular maintenance and mandatory overhaul.

Suleiman admitted that none of the power plants in the country
had undergone the mandatory turn-around maintenance since they

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs

for flood victims and ensure that at least a third of houses are
rebuilt before the arrival of winter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Most Ancient Copper Works in Cyprus Excavated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The most ancient primary
copper smelting works ever found in Cyprus were brought to light
after nearly 10 years of excavations, an Italian archaeologist
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The excavations were carried out by an Italian archaeological
team, said Rosaria Belgiorno, an archaeologist of the Italian
Institute for Research.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that the findings unearthed near Pyrgos
village, 20 kilometers east of the southern coastal town of
Limassol, are similar to those found in Sardenia (Italy) and
Spain, where copper was processed.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of metallurgical activity has been found in an
Early-Middle Bronze Age settlement and this has given us the
clearest picture yet of the method used at the time of how people
processed copper," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The objects we have discovered, made of copper, ceramic and
stone, are an indication of the high living standards the local
community reached in the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in the
valley of the river near Pyrgos," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that careful study of the findings will provide
information about the social structure in the beginning of the
Bronze Age and enable her team to get to know of the copper trade
at the time.
</P>
<P>
A two-day seminar on the Italian archaeology, archeometallurgy,
conservation and restoration will be held here Thursday, and the
findings of the Italian team will be on display at the
archaeological museum of Nicosia in September.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Conglomerates Unveil Merger Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's five largest
family-owned conglomerates Thursday unveiled a landmark agreement
to merge seven redundant and over-invested industries.
</P>
<P>
After three months of negotiations on merging their
subsidiaries, the five conglomerates -- Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo,
LG and SK -- Thursday told a joint news conference that they will
set up joint firms or consortiums in seven sectors as part of
reform to boost competitiveness of their products.
</P>
<P>
The seven industries included petrochemicals, rolling-stock,
aerospace, power generator, ship engines and oil refining. Merger
in the auto industry will be made in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The deal of subsidiaries' merger came with an agreement on the
marriage of Hyundai Electronics Ind with LG Semicon to create a
single entity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the petrochemical sector, Samsung General
Chemical Co. and Hyundai Petrochemical Co., both located in Daesan
Industrial Complex in South Chungchong Province, will be merged
into a joint consortium to attract foreign capitals to further
reinforce their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger between petrochemical sectors of LG and SK
groups, located in Ulsan and Yeochon of South Cholla Province,
will be discussed soon.
</P>
<P>
In the aircraft industry, Samsung Aerospace Industries,
aerospace division of Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hyundai Space &AMP;
Aircraft Co., will form a single independent consortium before
inviting foreign investors to make equity participation.
</P>
<P>
The three rolling-stock makers -- Hyundai Precision &AMP; Ind. Co.,
Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries -- will become
a joint management company.
</P>
<P>
In the power-generation equipment industry, the relevant
divisions of Hyundai Heavy Industries and state-run Korea Heavy
Industries and Construction Co will be combined.
</P>
<P>
In the oil refining field, Hyundai Oil Co. will take over the
oil-refining business of Hanwha Energy Co.
</P>
<P>
In the auto industry, Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung decided to
discuss their restructuring program after the fate of Kia Motors
Corp. is determined by an international bidding.
</P>
<P>
Calling for more support to help facilitate the seven-industry
restructuring schemes, the five conglomerates urged the government
and creditor banks to implement debt-to-equity swaps, drastic debt
write-offs, debt restructuring and tax reductions for the
concerned firms.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the demanded financial supports,
estimated at 20 trillion won (about 16 billion U.S. dollars), are
too excessive. They believed that the five groups may renege on
their declared restructuring pledges if the government aids fall
short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that excessive debt-equity swaps and debt
write-offs could be seen by the United States and other World
Trade Organization countries as a kind of subsidy, touching off
severe trade conflicts.
</P>
<P>
South Korean conglomerates are blamed for devouring bank loans
and shirking responsibility for triggering the current financial
crisis with their high debts build-up and over expansion.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries of the nation's top 30 groups were laden with
a total debt of 28 billion U.S. dollars, which was 4.5 times more
than their capital at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Seoul signed an agreement late last year with the International
Monetary Fund for a bail-out loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after
it was gripped by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the country, once the 11th largest
economy in the world, has to restructure its economy and open its
markets this year.

<HEADLINE> Views on Selection Committee Solicited in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- From September 3 to 6, social
bodies and people of various sectors in Macao will have a good
chance to express their opinions on the region's future.
</P>
<P>
The administrative working group of the Preparatory Committee
for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is conducting a
four-day consultation on the Selection Committee which will
produce the first government of the future Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 consultation meetings will be held in the four
days, sources at the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to rules enacted by the National People's Congress
(NPC), China's highest organ of state power, the Selection
Committee should consist of only permanent Macao residents and
have the broadest representation of people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The rules stipulate that the Selection Committee will be
composed of 200 members, including 60 from industrial, commercial
and financial sectors, 50 from cultural, educational and
professional sectors, 50 from sectors of labor, social service and
religion and 40 representatives chosen from Portuguese Macao
government employees, Macao deputies to the NPC and Macao members
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
By means of consultation and nomination after consultation, the
Selection Committee will produce the candidate for the chief
executive of the Macao SAR government and submit the candidacy to
the central government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee and
vice-director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the
State Council, said before the consultation meeting on Thursday
that the Preparatory Committee will formulate a detailed method
for forming the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The Preparatory Committee expects to hear opinions from the
most inclusive social bodies and personages of various sectors in
Macao," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to such consultation meetings, social bodies and
individuals in Macao can also submit written materials to the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee, talk with Preparatory
Committee members or express their views via the local media, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The administrative working group will surely have
conscientious discussions on such opinions and decide the method
on the formation of the Selection Committee through democratic
procedures," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several days, a number of social bodies have
stated their views on forming Selection Committee, or submitted
written opinions to the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Sets Out Proposals to Open Up TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has put forward 35
proposals covering eight broad areas to liberalize television
broadcasting and program services.
</P>
<P>
These proposals were listed in a document "The 1998 Review of
Television Policy" released here Thursday afternoon for
one-month-long public consultation.
</P>
<P>
The eight areas range from network sharing, in-building
distribution systems, pay TV market, regulatory issues to
royalties and license fees, digital terrestrial television,
legislation and regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major proposals include:
</P>
<P>
-- Allow Fixed Telecommunication Network Services (FTNS)
licensees to convey and provide television program services,
involving pay television and Video on Demand (VOD);
</P>
<P>
-- Lift the moratorium on pay TV and VOD program service
licenses and allow satellite broadcasters to offer pay television
services in Hong Kong;
</P>
<P>
-- Require Wharf Cable, the only cable television licensee in
Hong Kong, to open up its broadband network for use by other
television and telecommunications service providers;
</P>
<P>
-- Allow cable television networks to deliver
telecommunications services in addition to television services;
and
</P>
<P>
-- Prepare for the licensing of direct-to-home service using
the four Ku-band channels allocated to Hong Kong by the
International Telecommunication Union in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to K.C. Kwong, secretary for information technology
and broadcasting, these government proposals are designed to
"enable service providers to have fair and better access to all
the network facilities available in the market."
</P>
<P>
The government also proposed a series of measures to relieve
broadcasters of financial burdens and facilitate the introduction
of innovative services using new technologies.
</P>
<P>
These include relaxing the restrictions on ownership and
investment by licensees to enable diversification and
cross-fertilization of the telecommunications and broadcasting
markets, abolishing the charging of subscription royalties and
advertising royalties, and facilitating the development of digital
terrestrial television in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said, "Subject to policy decisions to be made by the end
of this year, we will immediately start work on the drafting of a
Broadcasting Bill with a view to introducing it into the
Legislative Council in 1999."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches Back Lanes Clean-Up Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's hygiene campaign
spread into its notorious back lanes Thursday as the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government launched a clean-up
operation targeted at some 133 black spots throughout the "New
Territories."
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Regional Services Department (RSD), the
operation was kicked off simultaneously Thursday in the nine
districts in the "New Territories" and outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the clean-up operations will improve the standard
of cleanliness of the back lanes and thus provide a better living
environment for people in these areas," Lo Yue-yee, acting
assistant director of regional services (environmental health
services), said when inspecting a clean-up site in Tsuen Wan
Market Street.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people had been mobilized, including RSD
officers, staff and cleaners, who joined hands with staff from the
local hygiene contractors in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Many local shop and restaurant owners and residents have turned
back lanes into storehouses and dump sites. One-third of the 353
back lanes in Hong Kong had been blacklisted due to their poor
hygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Depositing waste at back lanes is an offense in Hong Kong and
the maximum penalty is a fine of 25,000 HK dollars (3,200 U.S.
dollars) and an imprisonment of six months. Charges were laid down
against 41,000 hygienic regulation offenders last year, which
represented an increase of 6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The month-long back lanes clean-up operation is part of the SAR
government's three-year-long Healthy Living Into the 21st Century
Campaign, which started in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Lo said daily cleaning of public areas including back lanes
will be reinforced by weekly major clean-ups. Owners of private
back lanes will be asked to keep these areas clean, she added.

<HEADLINE> HK Open University to Start Web-Based Instruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Open University of Hong
Kong (OUHK) will implement full-scale web-based instruction in two
years' time, the university's newly-appointed director of
technology development, Leung Chun-ming, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said topping his agenda is to explore ways to enhance
distant education using advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
In web-based instruction, teaching activities will be conducted
on the worldwide web which integrates text, sound and images.
Students will be able to plan their studies at their own pace and
time.
</P>
<P>
To implement the plan, the OUHK will first convert materials of
more than 100 existing courses into on-line version. By applying
interactive multimedia technology, tutors and students will then
be able to interact on the web.
</P>
<P>
Web-based instruction is becoming popular in the United States
but has not yet been widely adopted in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Leung, the OUHK also plans to adopt speech
recognition technology to upgrade language teaching at primary,
secondary and university levels.
</P>
<P>
The OUHK projects will be carried out with the support of the
10-million-HK-dollar (1.3 million U.S.) multimedia laboratory
sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government's Proposals on Application of DTT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has proposed the
establishment of a joint government-industry steering committee to
coordinate technical trials on the digital terrestrial television
(DTT).
</P>
<P>
This is one of the proposals set out in a government document
entitled "The 1998 Review of Television Policy" which was released
here Thursday afternoon for one-month-long public consultation.
</P>
<P>
The document said the government has a role to facilitate the
development of DTT in Hong Kong and to promote the diversity of
services ensuing from the application of this technology.
</P>
<P>
The successful introduction of DTT will depend very much on
when the prices of DTT products will come down to a level
attractive to consumers, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe therefore that a step-by-step approach is prudent.
We propose to invite interested parties to participate in the
trial but careful assessment of market and technical conditions
along the way is necessary before taking any major policy
decisions on implementation," the document added.
</P>
<P>
The government's proposals on the application of DTT also
include the commencing of the trials of DTT and high definition
television (HDTV) as soon as practicable with a view to
determining a DTT standard to be adopted in 2000.
</P>
<P>
DTT is developing fast around the world. The United States and
Britain are introducing digital television service this year while
Japan will launch the service in 1999 and Australia on January 1,
2001.

<HEADLINE> Ringgit Transactions to Be Closed Out in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Foreign
Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC) has asked banks to settle
outstanding Malaysian ringgit transactions no later than September
9, 1998, according to its notes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The point was made clear in the guidelines adopted by the SFEMC
at a meeting Wednesday following Malaysia's announcement on
Tuesday that all overseas trading of its currency and stocks is
banned.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, generally agreed upon by market participants as
recommended practice for closing out ringgit transactions, also
require banks to close out ringgit-related transactions with
counterparties by netting all outstanding trades and settling the
difference in U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also proposed that the representative rate
prevailing at 10:30 a.m. on September 1, 1998, be adopted as the
guideline for bilateral settlement since the freely traded market
for the ringgit came to a halt approximately at that time.
</P>
<P>
A spot U.S. dollar rate against the ringgit, a benchmark yield
curve, an option volatility structure and other technical matters
were also listed in an appendix to the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The notes urged all affected parties to exert their best
efforts to reach an appropriate close-out arrangement and
preferably make the net payment on September 8.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Aims to Open Up Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) proposed here Thursday to
further liberalize the telecommunications market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was set out in the 1998 Review of Fixed
Telecommunications, which was made public Thursday for one-month
public consultation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing Thursday afternoon, M. H. Au,
acting director-general of telecommunications of the SAR, said
competition in the local fixed telecommunications network service
(FTNS) market should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Two measures are being considered, Au said. One is to issue
more FTNS licenses to allow more new operators to enter the market
and the other is to ask existing new FTNS operators to continue
expansion of their networks.
</P>
<P>
Competition will be allowed in the external telecom services
market from January 1, 1999, and in the external telecom
facilities market from January 1, 2000, Au said.
</P>
<P>
The government proposed to start issuing licenses for external
telecom services before the end of 1998 and to let the market
determine the number of licenses.
</P>
<P>
For competition in external telecom facilities, which include
satellite telecommunications facilities, submarine or overland
cables and new technologies, the government plans to let the
market determine the number of licenses and technologies to be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
The government also considers taking effective measures to
ensure fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Au said that liberalizing the telecom market will consolidate
Hong Kong's position as the telecom hub in the Asia-Pacific region
and that high-quality, low-price services will enhance the
competitiveness of other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The further opening up of the market will reduce the cost of
telecom for business organizations and individual consumers and
facilitate the rollout of information infrastructure in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It will also attract investment and create job opportunities,
allow use of state-of-the-art technology and promote the image of
Hong Kong internationally, Au said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rules Out Possibility of Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday ruled out the possibility of
advancing the general elections which are scheduled in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a meeting of the ruling Likud Party, Netanyahu
said he suported the view that the moves made by President Ezer
Weizman to hold early elections are against the law.
</P>
<P>
The hawkish National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
strongly criticized Weizman for attempting to bring down a
democratically elected government, saying he was breaching
Israel's constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
The Likud meeting came after Weizman's meeting with the
opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak last week, during which
he publicly called for early elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in response to Weizman's remarks, the
Likud said the president was bringing disgrace to the presidency,
which is only a ceremonial post without executive power.
</P>
<P>
It said Weizman was proving to the public that he is more
worthy of the title of head of the left-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
Although Weizman announced Wednesday that he planned to stop
discussing early elections, he defended his actions. "I'm doing
what I think I should do as a president when the state is in
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken president said the Netanyahu-led government has
ruined the peace process with the Palestinians, which have been
stalled for 18 months over the next Israeli troop redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that unless the government is changed soon,
the situation could deteriorate into bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Weizman and Netanyahu have long been at odds with each other
due to their differences over the handling of the peace process,
which has been stalled in all the tracks since the Likud

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Parliament Debates DPRK Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of the South Korean
National Assembly, or parliament, Thursday conducted hot debates
over the government's policy toward the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers from rival political parties showed their
difference on the government's decision to retain its "sunshine
policy" toward the DPRK despite its test-firing of a long-range
ballistic missile on Monday, which overflew Japan and fell into
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the opposition Grand National Party appealed to
the government to develop long-range missiles to counter any
military threat from the DPRK, and criticized the government for
overlooking the DPRK's missile threat in the past in the belief
that it was directed at Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The government, they said, should scrap its agreement with the
United States not to develop missiles with a range of more than
180 kilometers and join the Missile Technology Control Regime,
which permits the development of missiles with ranges of up to 300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, they showed unanimity in strengthening cooperation
with the United States and Japan in defense against the DPRK's
missile threat.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the ruling coalition of the National Congress
for New Politics and the United Liberal Democrats attributed
Pyongyang's missile test to the government's passive response to
its development of weapons of mass destruction in the past. They
urged the government to map out a plan to thwart that development.
</P>
<P>
The debates started after top government officials briefed the
lawmakers on the implications of the DPRK missile test at two
parliamentary panels -- the National Defense Committee and the
Foreign Affairs, Trade and Unification Committee.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects U.S. Envoy Back to Middle East, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel is waiting for a
final decision by Washington on whether to send U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross back to the region to help the Israelis and the
Palestinians clinch a deal, Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that Ross may visit the region within a
few days -- possibly this weekend -- though his arrival could be
delayed if there are no specific commitments by the Palestinians
to advance the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
If the Ross mission takes place and succeeds, it could be
followed up by three-way talks in the U.S. between President Bill
Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat to finalize
several minor issues.
</P>
<P>
This could be a prelude to the signing of an agreement this
month on a 13 percent West Bank redeployment by Israel, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat are planning to visit New York around
September 23 to attend the session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, reports said.
</P>
<P>
A possible Ross visit was discussed in a phone conversation
Wednesday night between Clinton and Netanyahu, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio cited officials in the Prime Minister's Office as
saying that the U.S. president, who phoned from Moscow after his
summit meeting with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin,
promised that he would work together with Netanyahu to advance the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Clinton also phoned Arafat, who was
attending a summit of the non-aligned countries in Durban, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
A senior aide to the president said during both the
conversations with Netanyahu and Arafat, Clinton expressed his
disappointment that no agreement has been concluded over the
second Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the aide was quoted as saying that "we're closer
than we have ever been before," referring to Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on the conditions for the Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
There have been quiet meetings this week between Israel's
chief negotiator Yitzhak Molcho and Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala) in a bid to resolve the
differences blocking a West Bank pullback deal.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said the two negotiators have drawn up a
draft agreement over the Israeli proposals that Israel pull back
its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank but 3 percent of the
land will be turned into a "nature reserve" where Israel will
maintain overriding security responsibility and the Palestinians
are not allowed to settle.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Pilots Willing to Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Talks could soon resume between
Air Canada and its 2,100 striking pilots, the Financial Post
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides indicated willingness Wednesday to restart
negotiations, which broke down late Tuesday after the pilots
refused Air Canada's wage offer.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marc Belanger, head of the Air Canada Pilots Association
said the union was willing to return to the table soon.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada said it is anxious to negotiate, although it added
the onus is on the pilots.
</P>
<P>
But by late Wednesday, no dates were set for resuming the talks
and negotiators from both sides were exhausted after six days of
intense bargaining, including an 18-hour session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, who say they are paid up to 30 percent less than
their U.S. counterparts, had lowered their wage increase demand to
12 percent over two years from an initial request of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada offered nine percent over two years. It had agreed
to stock options, pension and working condition improvement.
</P>
<P>
The strike has being causing inconvenience at airports across
the country since the carrier moves up to 60,000 people a
day.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Inspects Flood-Ravaged Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUNAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged continued vigilance along the Yangtze River and
pledged that the government will provide for the daily needs of
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The president arrived in Hunan Province this morning to begin a
fact-finding tour of flood-ravaged areas. Local officials briefed
the president on flood control operations and Jiang said that
receding flood waters along the Yangtze do not indicate the end of
this year's flood season. He noted that water levels in many
sections remain above danger levels.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued vigilance and urged people engaged in
the flood control effort to take effective measures to ensure the
safety of levees and strive for ultimate success.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission, said efforts must be made to guarantee the basic daily
needs of people in flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure victims have adequate food, clean drinking
water and clothing. They must have adequate shelter and access to
immediate medical care," Jiang told local officials, adding that
local governments should make arrangements to help victims cope
with the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the great importance in stablizing social order
and maintaining security in disaster areas. He said efforts must
be made to ensure that schools open on schedule and noted that
universities should provide assistance and provide financial aid
to students from disaster areas if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also discussed reconstruction and stressed that special
attention should be attached to reducing burdens on
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Has Limited Effect on EU: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
president said on Thursday that the current Russian financial
crisis has a limited direct effect on the economy of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer made the statement after his commission met for
the first time after the summer break to review the economic and
political development in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The commission president attributed the limited effect to the
limited trade between the 15-nation union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
EU exports to Russia account for 3.5 percent of the union's
total annual trade while its imports make up for 4 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The potential effects through the banking sector are likely to
be manageable even though European banks are more exposed to
Russia than American banks, Santer said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union, made
its first assessment of the potential impact on the European
economy by Russia's deteriorating crisis on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners agreed that the crisis is most likely to have
severe negative consequences for the Russian economy and the
Russian people and that the main responsibility for ending the
crisis lies with the Russians themselves.
</P>
<P>
They warned that Russia risks reversing the progress it has
made over recent years toward establishing a market economy unless
the economic stabilization and reform program agreed with the
international financial institutions are fully and decisively
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner responsible for
external relations with Russia and central and eastern Europe,
said that if a country like Russia ran into such a financial
crisis, there must be something politically wrong.
</P>
<P>
The commission appealed that it is vital for Russia to
establish a new government quickly and to put in place a credible
economic program to cooperate and render outside assistance
effective.
</P>
<P>
Santer told the press that the commission's efforts under
present circumstances will concentrate on using the maximum
flexibility within the commission's TACIS program to mobilize
expertise and should focus technical assistance in priority areas
such as public finances, finance sector restructuring and
institutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1997, the European Union has granted Russia
aid worth 1.6 billion ECU (1.76 billion U.S. dollars) through the
TACIS program that is designed to offer technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The total yearly available funds under the TACIS program is 500
million ECU (550 million dollars) and a third of this fund usually
goes to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia has received 400 million ECU (440 million dollars) in
1998 already, according to commission sources.

CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The chairman of the Egyptian investment authority
Ibrahim Fawzi has announced the establishment of a river shipyard
in the governorate of Qena in the form of a full-fledged Egyptian
joint stock company for ship building and construction of metal
structures.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Thursday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" as saying
that by establishing this company, Egypt would embark on ship
building for the first time in upper Egyptian governorates, within
the framework of a government plan to promote those areas and to
afford further job opportunities and overcome unemployment in
upper Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the investment cost of the company would
amount to 80 million Egyptian pounds (23.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- A Tunisian Ministry of Industry source has disclosed
that 60 new oil wells will be dug to make up for the registered
decline in the volume of domestic production due to the scarcity
of the reserves in the principal oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the source, "Al Hayat" reported Thursday that digging
the new wells will take five years, at the rate of 12 wells a year
and that Tunisian authorities plan to permit private sector
companies to take part in digging.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian Minister of Industry Munsif Bin Abdulla expects an
annual average investment of 200 million dollars in petroleum and
natural gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- A total of 1.2 million tonnes of wheat is lost in
Iran due to the lack of combines, Iranian Agriculture Minister
Issa Kalantari said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari said in Hamadan, western province of Hamadan, that
the loss was estimated at 300 million U.S. dollars, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country needs 3,000 combines to meet the
demand, adding that the value of the lost wheat is that of 6,000
combines.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's harvest this year, the minister
said that Iran would enjoy a good one this year thanks to the mild
weather with more rain.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the government has so far bought 6.56
million tonnes of wheat from farmers, showing an increase of about
54.8 percent from the figure of 4.236 million tonnes last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's wheat consumption is reportedly 10 million tonnes
annually and 5 million tonnes of which were used to meet the
domestic demand last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Courage, Reconciliation for N. Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday said courage and reconciliation will be the watchwords
for Northern Ireland's hard road ahead.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at Belfast's Waterfront Hall with the
attendance of 2,000 politicians and community leaders, Clinton
said, "Courage and reconciliation are the heart of your commitment
to peace."
</P>
<P>
"There will be a hard road ahead. The bombing at Omagh ... was
the opening shot of a vicious attack on peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at Belfast from Moscow earlier in the day to
pay a one-day visit to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, the president urged the people of Northern
Ireland to continue on the path towards peace.
</P>
<P>
"As you work to change the shape and future of Northern Ireland
you can count on America."
</P>
<P>
But he warned the audience that the future is "up to you."
</P>
<P>
"Difficult, sometimes wrenching decisions lie ahead but they
must be made," said the president, urging people to "rise above
feuds, not fuel them".
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of reconciliation must be rooted in all you do," he
said, as must courage, which he added was the most important
quality required.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Northern Ireland that the outrage there may not
be the last bombing.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on conflicts around the world, he pointed out that
"people still hate each other."
</P>
<P>
"From here on in Northern Ireland you have said only one
dividing line matters. The line between those who embrace peace
and want to destroy it."
</P>
<P>
Before Clinton's speech, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
lauded praises on Clinton for the help he has given to the
Northern Ireland peace process, saying Clinton has done more to
the Northern Ireland peace process than all other U.S. leaders.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the president held talks with the members of
the newly-established assembly of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's last visit to Britain was in 1995 which was said to
have given a substantial boost to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president will visit Omagh later in the day and lay a
wreath to the victims of a car bombing that killed 28 people. He
will visit the Irish Republic on Friday.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Assembly Minister Urges IRA to Give up Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, first minister
designate of the Northern Irish assembly, on Thursday urged Irish
Republican Army (IRA) to scrap its arms in order to win
ministerial places for their Sinn Fein political allies in the
province's new government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Belfast's Waterfront Hall to welcome U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Trimble said Sinn Fein's readiness to cooperate with
international decommissioning commission was a welcome move, but
that did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
"If the so-called war is really over, then there is no
justification for holding onto illegal weapons," said Trimble,
also leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the main group
representing Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority.
</P>
<P>
"Words alone cannot heal the mistrust but deeds will. People
want not just to hear of peace, they want to see it," Trimble
added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, declared to give up
violence for ever early this week and then appointed a senior
party figure to contact an international commission on guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said that in line with the Northern Ireland peace
agreement reached last April, IRA must hand over its arms before
Sinn Fein can join the local government.
</P>
<P>
"As First Minister and leader of Northern Ireland, I can not
reconcile seeking positions in government with a failure to
discharge responsibilities under the agreement to dismantle their
terrorist organizations."
</P>
<P>
He also showed good signs of dealing with Sinn Fein which he
has refused to talk directly in the past.
</P>
<P>
"As First Minister I will speak to anyone who has the good of
Northern Ireland at heart. But no democrat can tolerate coercive
threats," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Aid to Education Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J.
Habibie Thursday urged local governments and businessmen to
provide financial aid to the education sector, saying the
deepening economic crisis has led to a drastic drop in the number
of children in school.
</P>
<P>
"In fiscal year 1996-97, the number of children going to school
reached 72.26 percent, but due to the crisis, this has gone down
to 54 percent, similar to the figure five years ago," the
president said in Semarang, Central Java, during a ceremony to
award scholarships to students.
</P>
<P>
The government has thus decided to provide scholarships to 4
million elementary and high school students and 500,000 college
students and allocate funds to support the operations of 130,000
schools across the country, reports reaching here quoted Habibie
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing scholarships, the government has also
abolished various levies usually collected by the School
Assistance Board, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts, he added, are aimed at protecting the poor
as well as developing the country's human resources.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the number of people living in poverty has soared
to 40 percent this year from 11 percent in 1997. Some 80 million
out of 202 million Indonesians are considered poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
In eradicating poverty, the government will introduce the right
technology, particularly to those who live in urban areas, he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Confiscate Part of Iranian Assets: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States is planning
to seize part of Iranian assets frozen in the U.S. to pay for
former American hostages in Lebanon, local daily Tehran Times
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Iranian presidency told the daily on
Wednesday that according to a recent court verdict, the U.S. is
planning to draw 65 million U.S. dollars out from the frozen
Iranian assets.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. federal judge ruled on August 28 that Iran must pay 65
million dollars in damages to three former hostages and their
families for Tehran's role in their abduction.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. does so, it will violate international law,"
warned the Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He stated that only the International Court of Justice is
entitled to rule on the possible dispute between the two
countries and the American courts are only responsible for
settling litigation related to domestic issues inside the country
and not about foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, a group of people from western countries were
taken hostages in Lebanon. The hostages were freed in 1988 after
Tehran agreed to use its influence on the pro-Iran Lebanese groups.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi also refuted the U.S. court rule, arguing that "how can
one judge of a country issue a verdict against a sovereign,
foreign government?"

<HEADLINE> China's Index of Consumer Expectations Picks Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Index of Consumer
Expectations (ICE) picked up 3.5 percentage points on a monthly
basis to 89.4 points in August, according to State Statistics
Bureau figures released today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a consumer index has ever been released
in China. Bureau spokesman Qiu Xiaohua said the bureau will
continue to release this information monthly to make it another
important indicator by which to judge the trend of China's
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indexes, including ICE, Index of Consumer Sentiment
(ICS) and Index of Current Economic Conditions (ICC), are used
internationally as an indicator to analyze economic situations and
reflect consumers confidence.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the increased index figure indicates
that China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the third quarter
will be higher than it was in the first half year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the consumer index reversed its declining July
trend because China's economy continues to develop amid the Asia
financial crisis, market prices are steady or declining to some
extent, and the RMB exchange rate is stable.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, facing the biggest flood in a century, the
Chinese people have united with one heart and one mind to fight
against floods, increasing the cohesion of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
China's Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center under the SSB
set up Surveys of Consumers system in December 1997 and took the
month's ICE as the base of 100 points. It used a random selection
method of 700 samples in each of six cities including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The survey results for August show that about 41 percent of the
respondents believe that in the coming years China's overall
economy will be booming, though 12 percent think it will not be
good.
</P>
<P>
Also, 35 percent said they believe that in the next 12 months
their financial situation will be better than now, and 13 percent
think their situation will be worse.
</P>
<P>
In August, the ICS figure climbed two points to 88.6 and the
ICC remained at 87.3 points.

<HEADLINE> China-Japan Non-Governmental Personages Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The seventh Sino-Japanese
Non-Governmental Personages Council meeting concluded here
Thursday after adopting a resolution calling on the two countries
to expand cooperation and coordination in various fields.
</P>
<P>
While looking into the economic development in East Asia in the
21st century, China and Japan should seek cooperation and
coordination in such fields as regional economy, finance and
currencies, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting, which was held to mark the 20th
anniversary of the signing of Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship
Treaty, some 60 celebrities from the two countries exchanged views
on world situation, Sino-Japanese ties, Asian financial turmoil
and Sino-Japanese scientific and technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chinese Committee described the Sino-Japanese
ties as generally good, noting that remarkable achievements have
been made in political, economic, technological and cultural
spheres.
</P>
<P>
However, they also pointed out that some problems such as
recognization of history and the Taiwan issue, which could affect
the smooth development of bilateral relations, are still existing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Committee members also urged the Japanese
government to make clear that Taiwan would not be included into
the scope of the new guidelines on Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They said that celebrities of the two countries should continue
to play their active role in promoting governmental exchanges
between the two countries and make contributions to the
establishment of good-neighboring cooperative ties toward the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Japanese Committee said that Japan-China
economic exchange has entered a new development phase, adding that
the two countries should expand cooperation in fields like
investment and technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
As two important countries in Asian and world economy, Japan
and China should take lessons from the current Asian financial
crisis and set up governmental and non-governmental economic
consultative bodies as soon as possible, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The celebrities also decided that the next meeting would be
held in Beijing two years later.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israeli-Turkish Cooperation Boosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the Israeli-Turkish cooperation
is aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Turkey's Daily News newspaper
which was published Thursday, Netanyahu said that the countries
in the region need not worry about the close ties between Israel
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with Turkey is not directed against any
country. It is directed to the benefit of the entire region,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the world is becoming more unstable in the
absence of an East-West structure and the only sensible
arrangements and frameworks are regional security arrangements
that will try to induce stability where instability prevails.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is exactly the kind of relationship that Israel
has with Turkey," said the Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly growing Turco-Israeli military and defense
cooperation has drawn harsh criticism from the Muslim world and
Arab countries who fear it would change the region's balance of
power.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed a series of military and defense
accords which enable their air forces to train together and Israel
to help Turkey upgrade its aged fighters and tanks.
</P>
<P>
The naval forces of Israel, Turkey and the United States held
joint exercises in the international waters of the eastern
Mediterranean last January, prompting strong protests from Iran
and Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
"In any case we are not directing this (Israeli-Turkish
alliance) against any countries, but we are trying to create an
axis of stable and responsible countries," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"We sometimes see impoverished countries producing ballistic
missiles and atomic warheads and threatening everyone in
sight. This is becoming a very fluid and dangerous situation,"
Netanyahu said.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced here Thursday a package of proposals to liberalize the
television broadcasting and program services as well as to further
open up the telecommunications market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are set out in two separate documents, the 1998
Review of Television Policy and the 1998 Review of Fixed
Telecommunications. Both review documents are intended for a
one-month public consultation, starting from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing details at a press conference, K. C. Kwong, secretary
for information technology and broadcasting of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said that the liberalization
of pay television broadcasting and program services would speed up
technology transfer, attract investment, stimulate the growth of
related industries, and create new employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"All this will, in turn, enhance Hong Kong's position as a
leading broadcasting hub in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the further opening up of the telecommunications market,"
he continued, "will enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a
place for investment in telecommunications, encourage competition
and innovation, and maintain Hong Kong's position as the
pre-eminent telecommunication center in Asia," Kwon said.

<HEADLINE> Fowler to Pair With Owen in Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Former international striker
Robbie Fowler, sidelined for injury for over six months, could
rejoin his Liverpool and England successor Michael Owen "within
weeks", the club said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joint Liverpool boss Roy Evans said the 23-year-old Fowler,
who snapped cruciate knee ligaments in February, had come through
a reserve match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"He could be back in a matter of weeks," said Evans, "but he
will need a few more run-outs before that, if he keeps working at
it, it will be a lot sooner than we expected."
</P>
<P>
Evans was satisfied with the way Fowler played, saying that he
is tired but looked sharp in the game.
</P>
<P>
Fowler scored 13 goals last season but his career was cast
into doubt by his injury.
</P>
<P>
Since his absence, the 18-year-old Owen, who signed a new
five-year deal with Liverpool last month after his huge success
in this year's World Cup, has rapidly replaced Fowler as
Liverpool and England's brightest striking prospect.
</P>
<P>
Both players are small and rely instead on electrifying pace
and skill on the ball.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Appeals to Reduce Weight of School Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Education
Department on Thursday called for actions from schools, teachers,
parents and publishers to reduce the weight of school bags.
</P>
<P>
Principal Education Officer (Curriculum Development Institute)
Lau Kwong-mo said that the department is very concerned about
overweight school bags, in particular their harmful effects on the
formation of spines on primary and junior secondary students.
</P>
<P>
Surveys by local social organizations have showed that school
bags are getting heavier and heavier these years and the society
is appealing for an easing of burden on the children.
</P>
<P>
"For years the department has recommended and encouraged
publishers to use thinner and lighter paper to print textbooks,
particularly those for primary schools. We have also suggested
publishers to print textbooks in loose-leaf form or in split
sections," Lau said, adding that publishers have taken measures
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The officer noted that guidelines are issued every year to
schools on reducing the weight of school bags.
</P>
<P>
Schools are urged to regularly review their time-tables so that
students would not have to bring to school a large number of
textbooks, exercise books and heavy materials such as atlas,
drawing paper, or sportswear on a particular day, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Schools are also advised to avoid using excessive supplementary
exercise books or workbooks, said Lau.
</P>
<P>
On the role of parents, he said, they should select light
school bags and stationery for their children, help them develop
the habit of packing school bags every day and bring only
necessary items according to the timetable.
</P>
<P>
"Parents should discourage their children from bringing
magazines, toys and other unnecessary items to school," Lau
suggested.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the weight of school bags, many primary schools were
furnished with lockers for students to keep books, dictionaries
and crayons.
</P>
<P>
Lau urged that schools encourage students to make full use of
these lockers.

<TEXT>
<P>
The company announced its interim results here, which showed
that profit attributable to shareholders totaled 622 million HK
dollars (80 million U. S. dollars) in the first six months of
1998, a sharp rise of 43 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share grew by 28 percent to 74 cents (nine U.S.
cents), and the Board of directors decided to pay an interim
dividend of 11 cents (1.4 U.S. cents) per share.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure is the biggest profit contributor, accounting
for 54 percent of the company's total in the first half of this
year. Two purchased road projects in Shanghai, Inner Ring Road and
Yan'an Elevated Road, turned in steady cash revenues for the firm.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the company's profit comes from
manufacturing and sales of consumer products, including
cigarettes, printing goods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and diary
products.
</P>
<P>
Cai Laixing, Shanghai Industrial's chairman, told a press
conference Thursday that the Asia financial turmoil had slight
impact on the diversified businesses of the company, which went
public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Industrial now holds 3 billion HK dollars (380 million
U.S. dollars) in cash, outweighing its borrowing from banks, said
the chairman, who added that its total liability is less than 25
percent of its capital.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Despite the financial turmoil, we are confident about
the prospects for long-term economic growth in Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland."
</P>
<P>
The company will continue to tap the potential of the existing
businesses and explore new investment opportunities, according to
Cai.

<HEADLINE> Australian Voters Offered Three Tax Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven million Australian
voters have been offered three different tax reform plans in a
matter of 20 days by competing political parties.
</P>
<P>
The three tax plans were described as risky, lazy and easy,
respectively and Australian voters have until October 3 to decide
which tax plan is their favorite. Last week, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard set October 3 as the date for a federal
election.
</P>
<P>
The first tax reform plan, unveiled by the ruling Australian
Liberal Party and National Party on August 13, was described by
Australia watchers and even some within the two parties as a
courageous but risky one in an election period.
</P>
<P>
The ruling parties introduced their tax reform package,
including a 10-percent goods and services tax (GST), which was
generally welcomed by industrial and business circles and farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, a similar GST tax plan proposed in 1993 cost the
Australian Liberal Party so dearly that the party lost the 1993
federal election because many voters dumped the party as they
feared an introduction would increase the prices of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 election campaign, Prime Minister John Howard, then
leader of the Liberal Party, promised voters that he would "never
ever" introduce a GST tax.
</P>
<P>
The "lazy" one was offered by the Australian Labor Party
several days after the release of the ruling parties' tax plan,
which rejects a GST tax, but offers more benefit to middle and
lower income earners.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's tax plan was rejected as a lazy one by
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, who released the ruling parties'
tax package with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, an "easy" tax reform plan was released by
Pauline Hanson, founder of racist One Nation Party, in her
hometown Ipswich in east Australia's Queesland state,
</P>
<P>
Under One Nation Party's plan, a flat two-percent income and
transaction tax is proposed, which Pauline Hanson said would leave
every Australian 17 percent better off.
</P>
<P>
Describing the plan as visionary, Hanson said the easy tax
system was fairer for all and would create jobs by lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was immediately ridiculed by Treasurer Peter
Costello as economic madness, while the Australian Society of
Certified Practicing Accountants said it would lead to the
collapse of the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
Under One Nation's plan, the two-percent tax would be levied on
the sale price at each change of ownership of property, goods and
services, including wages.
</P>
<P>
All the parties say their tax plans are better for the country
and beneficial to almost every Australian voter.
</P>
<P>
As Prime Minister John Howard said on August 30 the election
would be fought on economic competence, voters' acceptance of the
three plans is expected to decide who will be the next prime
minister of Australia.

Nalla, during the 1995 general election.
</P>
<P>
Nalla, who is the author of the book "50 Dalil Mengapa Anwar
Tidak Boleh Jadi PM" (50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become PM),
often followed him (Anwar) abroad and acted as middleman in
activities that allowed Anwar to be used by undesirable elements
to threaten national security, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
The allegations were contained in the affidavit filed by police
officer Musa Hassan who heads the investigation into the book "50
Dalil Mengapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM."
</P>
<P>
Along with affidavits by Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah,
Prisons Director-General Omar Mohamed Dan and special branch
officer V. Ramasamy, Musa's affidavit was filed to support an
application to set aside Nalla's application for a transfer of his
detention from the Bukit Aman lockup to the Sungai Buloh prison.
</P>
<P>
Nalla is being detained at Bukit Aman under the Internal
Security Act pending his trial for unlawful possession of 125
rounds of Fiocchi 6.35 mm ammunition which police found in Nalla's
house while carrying out investigations into the book.
</P>
<P>
Musa in his affidavit said seven witnesses had given written
statements during the investigations.
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, while police were carrying out
their investigations another police report was lodged by a
corporate figure claiming that Anwar tried to entice his wife.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations proved that Nalla too was involved in the
complaint made by the corporate figure.
</P>
<P>
Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked Wednesday as Malaysia's Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister, said Thursday that there is a
conspiracy at the highest level to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference at his own house here that he was
given a choice by the prime minister to resign or to be removed.
</P>
<P>
"I was not prepared to resign as I was already aware of a pact
or conspiracy at the highest level to ruin me," said Anwar,
claiming that a dirty and disgraceful way had been resorted to in
order to oust him.
</P>
<P>
This is because there was no reasonable truth or basis in
allegations against him to justify his removal, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is still the deputy president of the ruling
United Malays National Organization (UMNO) as he was elected to
the post.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO Supreme Council is scheduled to meet Thursday night.
Anwar said, "I will use tonight's forum to defend myself."
</P>
<P>
Anwar also disclosed that he had undergone two DNA tests,
including an independent test outside the country, which proved
that an allegation that he was the father of an illegitimate child
was false.
</P>
<P>
"What I speak (of) is justice. It is tragic that government
institutions have been used by people who plotted against me to
frame up and fabricate charges. If I, as the number two man in the
country (until yesterday), cannot get justice and have become a
victim of these allegations, then I am sorry for this country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming he was given an ultimatum by the Prime Minister
Wednesday whether to reign or to be removed, Anwar said that he
was not prepared to resign and had repeatedly told the prime
minister that there was a conspiracy at the highest level to
topple him.
</P>
<P>
It included certain cabinet ministers, UMNO Supreme Council
members, corporate figures, people of substantial means and
outsiders, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He however said that this action against him did not originate
from UMNO as a political party.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had already expected to be arrested to face
charges under the Official Secret Act (OSA) and possibly the
Internal Security Act (ISA) or other laws.
</P>
<P>
Anwar however said that he would defend himself and his family
members and had initiated the legal process.

<HEADLINE> No Survivors in Swiss Plane Crash Off Canadian Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- There are no survivors from
the crash of the Swissair plane off the coast of Canada's Nova
Scotia province, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A massive search-and-rescue effort has been under way for
several hours since the wide-bodied jet crashed into the ocean
with 228 passengers and crew about 10:30 p.m. local time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke on the coast, 18 bodies had been recovered from
the sea, according to the CBC Television here.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Ottawa, which had been alerted to be prepared for
victims, sent extra staff home early Thursday as hopes for
survivors diminished.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no survivors to date," Chris Power, VC nursing
services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital of Halifax, said earlier
at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The three-engine MD-11 plane, which was carrying 213 passengers
 and 15 crew en route from New York to Geneva, reported smoke in
the cockpit around 10:30 p.m. and asked for emergency landing in
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
Yet shortly after that, the plane disappeared from the radar
screen, lost contact with the air control tower in Moncton, N.B.,
and crashed 11.2 kilometers off the Canadian coast, south of
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers on board were thought to be Swiss, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
A Hercules aircraft and military aircraft led the search, which
was aided by flotilla of fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Yet the inky and rough water made it difficult for rescue teams
to navigate through the debris field, which spread a couple of
kilometers across the sea.
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke on the southwest coast of Nova Scotia, a
shoreline search got under way.
</P>
<P>
The weather there was reported to be overcast, with a light
sprinkle of rain.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the makers of the jet, was sending a team to Nova
Scotia to help in the investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The United States also sent a team of investigators to the
crash site, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Boost Peace Efforts in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived at Belfast Thursday morning to begin his two-day visit to
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the Aldergrove airport by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair after flying in from Moscow where he paid a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at the provincial capital, Clinton immediately
went into talks with members of the newly-elected Northern Ireland
assembly, including the assembly's First Minister David Trimble
and his deputy Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
This is Clinton's second visit to Northern Ireland in three
years. His last visit to Britain in 1995 gave a substantial boost
to the peace process in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
The president will deliver a speech to local politicians and
community leaders and hold a private meeting with Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams before visiting Omagh later in the day to meet with
relatives of the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
The current trip comes at a delicate time. Nearly three weeks
ago, a car bomb in Omagh town center killed 28 people and injured
220, casting a heavy shadow on the peace process in Northern
Ireland since the historic peace agreement was reached in April.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Omagh blast aimed at wrecking the peace process,
this week has witnessed an upbeat turn when the Irish Republican
Army (IRA)'s political wing Sinn Fein announced to let violence be
"a thing of the past, over, done with and gone," and appointed a
senior party leader to represent Sinn Fein in talks with the
independent international decommissioning committee set up to
oversee the disarmament of all paramilitary groups in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In another development, both the British and Irish parliaments
on Wednesday passed their draconian anti-terrorism bills, which
will make it easier for the two countries to crack down on
terrorism in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been a pivotal supporter of British and Irish peace
moves that gained new life in July 1997 with a ceasefire by the
anti-British Irish Republican Army. He is expected to use his
political influence this time again to add momentum to the current
peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Just as a White House spokesman put it, President Clinton sees
his visit to Omagh as "a way of continuing to support the peace
process and make it clear that those who would use violence to
stop the peace process will not succeed."

<HEADLINE> First Pan-African Dance Festival Opens in Kigali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The first pan-African dance
festival has unfolded itself in the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day festival, jointly sponsored by the Rwandan
government and the Organization of Africa Unity, has "African
Dance for Peace" as its central theme, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Tuesday, the festival is aimed at encouraging
the youth to foster the spirit of tolerance and peace, after
decades of conflicts and atrocities that rocked the continent and
which culminated into the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Among the objectives of the festival will be the
re-vigorization of political and diplomatic relations between the
states, which go beyond linguistics and ideological barriers.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Rwandan Ministry of Culture have indicated that
the festival will cost about 544,396 U.S. Dollars. Out of
seventeen delegations invited to attend the festival only a few
responded positively.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), and Rwandans living in Belgium, were present at the
opening ceremony. There was no word about countries like Angola,
Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Zambia, South Africa, and the
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here believe that the on-going conflict in Congo
(K) might have affected the participation when some delegations
might have felt not secure enough in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Others like Zimbabwe, and Angola which have divergent views
over the Congo crisis have seen relations with Rwanda growing
strained.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda wants to be the capital of the African Dance Festival,
as Ouagadougou of Burkina Faso is for the African film, and
Brazzaville of Congo for the African Music.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets With Malian Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here today with a delegation
led by Ibrahima N'Diaye, general secretary of the African Party of
Solidarity and Justice of Mali (APSJM).
</P>
<P>
Hu voiced his thanks for Mali's adherence to the "one China"
position and its support of China's peaceful reunification effort.
</P>
<P>
China and Mali enjoy a traditional friendship and the two have
always supported each other with fruitful cooperation in every
area despite dramatic changes in the international situation.
</P>
<P>
The frank and in-depth exchange between the CPC and the APSJM
have increased mutual understanding and given new impetus to the
growth of friendly ties between the two countries, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will make unremitted efforts together with the APSJM to
advance relations between the two parties and the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also Chinese vice-president, briefed the visitors on
China's current flood-control campaign.
</P>
<P>
N'Diaye expressed his solicitude to China's flooded areas and
his admiration for the victory of the Chinese people over the
flood.
</P>
<P>
The flood-fighting effort has demonstrated the united and
heroic spirit of the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
N'Ddiaye also donated 30,000 francs to China's flooded region
on behalf of the APSJM and President Alpha Konare of Mali.
</P>
<P>
He said Mali-China relations have witnessed a constant growth
over the past decades. The APSJM values its ties with the CPC and
is confident of further developing bilateral relations in various
fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China at the invitation of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Police Disperse Striking Workers at Mando Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 South Korean riot
police Thursday morning raided six factories of Mando Machinery
Corp., breaking up striking workers who had occupied and paralyzed
the nation's largest auto parts maker for 18 days.
</P>
<P>
Riot police armed with tear gas and water canons stormed into
the factories at around 6 a.m. Thursday and arrested some labor
leaders and strikers.
</P>
<P>
Police said several striking workers and police were wounded
when strikers in Mando's two plants in Asan in South Chunchong
Province and Munmak in Kangwon Province fought back violently with
stones and pipes.
</P>
<P>
Police dispersed most of the striking workers and hauled away
some 1,600 union workers while they met with little resistance in
the other four factories.
</P>
<P>
However, police, who reportedly failed to arrest top union
leaders, said they will arrest the key organizers of the illegal
strike on charges of obstructing commerce.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the South Korean government has used
police force to solve a labor dispute, which the government fears
have made foreign investors to suspect its determination to ensure
a flexible labor market.
</P>
<P>
Government officials defended the police raid, saying that it
was inevitable given the strike's negative impact on the nation's
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
The police raid was also seen as a show of the government's
strong determination not to allow illegal strikes after its
intervention in the labor dispute at Hyundai Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU)
denounced the police raids and said it would launch an
anti-government campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We can not tolerate the police raids. We will stage a general
strike and consider pulling out of the tripartite committee of
labor, management and government, " said a spokesman for the
KCTU.
</P>
<P>
Mando's workers have been on strike since August 17 this year,
protesting the corporation's plan to lay off 1,090 of a total of
4,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
Mando, which supplies auto parts to domestic car makers and
exports its products to foreign automakers such as GM and Ford,
went bankrupt last December in the wake of the nation's financial
crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
A slumping domestic auto market has dealt a more serious blow
to the struggling company this year, with its sales plunging 32
percent from a year earlier in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Mando management said the strike has made the company suffer a
loss of 97.6 billion won (about 72.7 million U.S. dollars) in
production.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian CPP, Sihanouk Discuss Ways to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen and three other senior members of the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) met with King Norodom Sihanouk
Thursday here to discuss ways to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, CPP leader, told reporters after the meeting that they
discussed the convening of the first session of the new National
Assembly (parliament) and formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in order to resolve the current political crisis, the
CPP insists that the King presides over the session and approves
the formation of a new government. The other political parties
should respect the people's will."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, if the new National Assembly starts to operate but
the new government could not be formed, the current government led
by (First Prime Minister) Ung Hout and I will continue to work as
a caretaker government. We will never agree to form an interim
government."
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, it would be a worse situation if neither the new
Assembly nor the new government can operate. But the present
government will continue to exist," Hun Sen added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a special meeting of the three main political
parties to be held here on September 5-7, which King Sihanouk will
preside over in a hope to solve the month-long political crisis,
Hun Sen said he and CPP President Chea Sim will attend on behalf
of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Funcinpec Party and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP)
will also send their top leaders to the meeting, which, in his
point of view, will help break the deadlock Cambodia is currently
facing.
</P>
<P>
But it was learned that Funcinpec Party leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy Party leader Sam Rainsy have not yet had
any plan to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen quoted the King as saying amending of the country's
constitution should be carried out in the new National Assembly
and the power-sharing must be done according to the people's will.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Hun Sen may put forward his idea of getting
Assembly members to amend the constitution so that the CPP could
form a government with only a simple majority rather than
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the July 26 Assembly election according to the
final official results announced by the National Election
Committee (NEC) on September 1. But it did not win the two-thirds
necessary to form a new government on its own.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Funcinpec and SRP rejected the election results
and insisted they would not join any government headed by Hun Sen,
whom they accuse of staging a coup d'etat to oust Prince Ranariddh
as first premier last year.
</P>
<P>
CPP Honorary Chairman Heng Samrin and Treasurer Chea Soth were
also present at Thursday's meeting.

BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Those who will attend the
Asian Games will be cut for the lingering Asia's financial crisis
but all the venues will be ready, said Thailand's deputy prime

are also to take a hard look at expenditure for the Games.
</P>
<P>
All sports venues for the Asiad will be completed by the end
of this month or early October, Bhichai added.
</P>
<P>
The official also promised that the three main stadiums and
other facilities plagued by delays and funding shortages would be
finished on time.

<HEADLINE> Australian Voters Offered 3 Tax Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven million Australian
voters have been offered three different tax reform plans in a
matter of 20 days by competing political parties.
</P>
<P>
The three tax plans were described as risky, lazy and easy,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The first tax reform plan, unveiled by the ruling Australian
Liberal Party and National Party on August 13, was described by
Australia watchers and even some within the two parties as a
courageous but risky one in an election period.
</P>
<P>
The ruling parties introduced their tax reform package,
including a 10-percent goods and services tax (GST), which was
generally welcomed by industrial and business circles and farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, a similar GST tax plan proposed in 1993 cost the
Australian Liberal Party so dearly that the party lost the 1993
federal election because many voters dumped the party as they
feared an introduction would increase the prices of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 election campaign, Prime Minister John Howard, then
leader of the Liberal Party, made a promise to the voters that he
would "never ever" introduce a GST tax.
</P>
<P>
The "lazy" one was offered by the Australian Labor Party
several days after the release of the ruling parties' tax plan,
which rejects a GST tax, but offers more benefit to middle and
lower income earners.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's tax plan was rejected as a lazy one by
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, who released the ruling parties'
tax package with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, an "easy" tax reform plan was released by
Pauline Hanson, founder of racist One Nation Party, in her
hometown Ipswich in east Australia's Queesland state,
</P>
<P>
Under One Nation Party's plan, a flat two-percent income and
transaction tax is proposed, which Pauline Hanson said would leave
every Australian 17 percent better off.
</P>
<P>
Describing the plan as visionary, Hanson said the easy tax
system was fairer for all and would create jobs by lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was immediately ridiculed by Treasurer Peter
Costello as economic madness, while the Australian Society of
Certified Practicing Accountants said it would lead to the
collapse of the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
Under One Nation's plan, the two-percent tax would be levied on
the sale price at each change of ownership of property, goods and
services, including wages.
</P>
<P>
All the parties said their tax plans are better for the country
and beneficial to almost every Australian voter.
</P>
<P>
As Prime Minister John Howard said on August 30 the election
would be fought on economic competence, voters' acceptance of the
three plans is expected to decide who will be the next prime
minister of Australia.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices gyrated from
positive to negative territory on Singapore Stock Market Thursday
as market was decimated by worries over dramatic changes in
Malaysia's government and its financial policy
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index dropped 15.15 points to end
at 812.70 points.
</P>
<P>
Both the dismissal of Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim and the country's latest move to ban overseas trading of
its currency and stocks had big impact on Singapore since the two
countries are closely linked with their economies intertwined.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares were among the hardest hit on renewed concerns
about Singapore banks exposure to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover edged up to 277.78 million units valued at
225.69 million Singapore dollars (about 128.23 million U.S.
dollars). Decliners outstripped advancers by 301 to 39 with 246
counters unchanged
</P>
<P>
SingTel was the most active stock of the day with a turnover of
17.70 million stocks. It was followed by Renong that had 17.22
million units traded. M Res was next with 15.69 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Asean topped the gainers of the day as it rose by 20 cents to
close at 3.00 U.S. dollars. SingTel was up 10 cents to finish at
2.60 Singapore dollars. Both HL Fin and Republic edged up five
cents and they closed at 1.06 and 0.43 Singapore dollars
respectively. RothmansI also inched up five cents and it ended at
6.65 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Genting 200 lost 98 cents to end at 2.00
Singapore dollars. Tasek slid by 59.5 cents to close at 0.805
Singapore dollars. Rothmans M shed 50 cents to finish at 7.50
Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Angola Involvement in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Nelson Mandela said Thursday it was reasonable that
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola had deployed troops in Democratic
Congo (DRC) after they received the government's invitation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the International Convention
Center here, Mandela said it was reasonable for the Congolese
government headed by President Laurent Kabila to request foreign
countries to offer military support when it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela said, it was also reasonable for countries
like Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola which sent their troops to
Congo early last month to help the Kabila government quell the
rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's remarks have apparently shown his tendency toward
military involvement in Congo by some member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the current chairman of the 14-member SADC.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who was here to attend the 12th Non-Aligned Movement
summit which opened Wednesday, told reporters Wednesday night
that the military involvement by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia was
at the invitation of his government.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that as Rwandan and Ugandan troops illegally
entered into Congo, they must be withdrawn immediately. "It is
aggressors who should cease fire," Kabila stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has been accusing Rwanda and Uganda of backing the
Tutsi rebels who launched a revolt against his government on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
However, the charges have been strongly denied by the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters that he met all the leaders of the SADC
countries except Kabila and President Sam Nujoma of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was back home late last night because of the tense
situation in his country, while Nujoma had gone for other
engagement. However, both Kabila and Nujoma were represented at
the meeting, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders discussed the tense situation in Congo at
working breakfast, Mandela said, but he declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
In the joint press conference, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who participated in the SADC
mini-summit, said the meeting was "useful" and "constructive".
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress," said Annan. He also declined to
specify the progress.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), also attended the conference. He said the
OAU would continue its efforts with the SADC countries to make
peace settlement of the Congo conflict.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updates with Speech at News Conference hke090344 --Sacked Anwar Ibrahim Says There is Conspiracy Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Anwar Ibrahim, who was
sacked Wednesday as Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister, said Thursday that there is a conspiracy at the highest
level to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference at his own house here that he was
given a choice by the prime minister to resign or to be removed.
</P>
<P>
"I was not prepared to resign as I was already aware of a pact
or conspiracy at the highest level to ruin me," said Anwar.
</P>
<P>
This is because there was no reasonable truth or basis in
allegations against him to justify his removal, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is still the deputy president of the ruling
United Malays National Organization (UMNO) as he was elected to
the post.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO Supreme Council is scheduled to meet Thursday night.
Anwar said, "I will use tonight's forum to defend myself."
</P>
<P>
Anwar also disclosed that he had undergone two DNA tests,
including an independent test outside the country, which proved
that an allegation that he was the father of an illegitimate child
was false.
</P>
<P>
"What I speak (of) is justice. It is tragic that government
institutions have been used by people who plotted against me to
frame up and fabricate charges. If I, as the number two man in the
country (until yesterday), cannot get justice and have become a
victim of these allegations, then I am sorry for this country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming he was given an ultimatum by the prime minister
Wednesday whether to reign or to be removed, Anwar said that he
was not prepared to resign and had repeatedly told the prime
minister that there was a conspiracy at the highest level to
topple him.
</P>
<P>
It included certain cabinet ministers, UMNO Supreme Council
members, corporate figures, people of substantial means and
outsiders, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He however said that this action against him did not originate
from UMNO as a political party.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had already expected to be arrested to face
charges under the Official Secret Act (OSA) and possibly the
Internal Security Act (ISA) or other laws.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, however, said that he would defend himself and his
family members and had initiated the legal process.
</P>
<P>
Four affidavits were filed Thursday morning by Attorney-General
Mohtar Abdullah, Prisons Department Director-General Omar Mohamed
Dan and two senior police officers at the High Court here in
response to the application of Magnum public affairs director S.
Nallakaruppan who is the author of the book "50 Dalil Mengapa
Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM" (50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become PM)
which contained allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The affidavits contain various allegations against Anwar,
including sexual misconduct and posing a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was alleged to have very close relations with
Nallakaruppan who is now being held under the Internal Security
Act and is facing charges under the ISA for unlawful possession of
125 live bullets which were recovered from his Bukit Tunku home in
the course of investigations.
</P>
<P>
Manjeet Singh, one of the lawyers for Nallakaruppan, told
reporters after meeting Anwar earlier Thursday that he required
time to study four affidavits.
</P>
<P>
Anwar told reporters earlier Thursday when was leaving the
Deputy Prime Minister's official residence for his own house that
all charges against him are totally fabricated.
</P>
<P>
"It's total fabrication. I'm going to fight it all the way,"
Anwar told reporters from his vehicle.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday urged Russian acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
to tackle Russia's political crisis, a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters on board Clinton's Air
Force One plane from Moscow to Belfast that the president held 25
minutes' conversation with Chernomyrdin before he wound up a
two-day visit to Russia, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged Chernomyrdin to do everything
possible to try to get beyond this current political crisis so
that the country can get behind a strong economic program,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, putting the government together and resolving some
of the political questions that are still lingering is a necessary
predicate to start putting together strong economic policies that
can move the country forward," he quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The president's observation to Chernomyrdin was that you need
to resolve these political issues about the formation of the
government so you can get on with the urgent task of fixing the
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at Northern Irish capital of Belfast Thursday
morning to show his support to the peace process in Northern
Ireland. He will meet the relatives of the Omagh bombing victims
later in the day and pay a one-day visit to the Irish Republic on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Marginally Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
only marginally higher in subdued trading Thursday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
It reached a high of 58.73 U.S. cents before closing at 58.36
U.S. cents, just up from Wednesday night's close of 58.27 U.S.
cents, as market participants awaited fresh directions.
</P>
<P>
Guy Reynolds, director of foreign exchange division director of
Macquarie Bank, said the Australian dollar was dragged down to its
low for the day of 58.23 U.S. cents by an Australian
dollar/Japanese yen order from a U.S. hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said the Australian dollar had been very steady for
the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
In a market commentary published Thursday, Stephen Koukoulas,
Citibank chief economist, said the recent recovery in the
Australian dollar from its all-time low of 55.30 U.S. cents to
levels around 58.00 U.S. cents had been supported by a number of
factors such as solid data on Australia economy, a yen pick-up and
a moderate upturn in some commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
In offshore trade Thursday night Reynolds expects the
Australian dollar to trade higher, probably to 59.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was trading at 79.63 Japanese yen from 80.10
yen and 1.0161 German marks from 1.0186 marks.

<HEADLINE> China, Israel to Further Cooperation on Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Israel today agreed
to strengthen their cooperation on higher education.
</P>
<P>
The China Scholarship Council and Israel's Bar-Ilan University
signed here today a memo of understanding on dispatching 100
Chinese post-doctors to Bar-Ilan University for further study,
starting from next month.
</P>
<P>
These post-doctors will study physics, biochemistry,
mathematics, social sciences and Jewish studies at Bar-Ilan
University in the coming years, thanks to a fellowship program
sponsored by Fred Kort, a Jewish American.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Israeli Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is expected
to facilitate academic and scientific ties between the two
countries. It is also the largest academic exchanges between
Israel and China.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1955, Bar-Ilan University has grown to become
Israel's second largest university. Its faculties include natural
and social sciences, humanities, Jewish studies and law.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, Chinese vice-minister of education and director of the
China Scholarship, expressed the hope in the signing ceremony that
the results of the program will contribute to the growth of
Sino-Israeli friendship.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to China Ora Namir said that the two
countries will strengthen their ties "based on mutual work on
education cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Overbooking Strands Hundreds of Passengers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of passengers have
been stranded at the Beirut International Airport since last
Saturday due to overbooking by Lebanon's national carrier Middle
East Airlines (MEA), the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Airport sources estimated that the overbooking stands at 30
percent for some destinations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
All airlines overbook to avoid having vacant seats on their
planes. When a plane is full, those passengers who show up last at
the airport are the first to lose their seats.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this happened a lot over the last two
weeks, the high season during which Lebanese expatriates and
foreign tourists return home.
</P>
<P>
The passengers who failed to get the seats complained that MEA
has not offered any accommodation for the passengers. Many of them
are foreign tourists who have nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
They said that "certain people can get seats on the flight
through connections or by paying MEA officials 100 U.S. dollars or
even more."
</P>
<P>
The chaos at the airport has prompted the intervention of
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
He summoned MEA's chairman Mohammed Hout for a meeting about
the airline's booking system.
</P>
<P>
Hout said the accusations were highly exaggerated, adding that
the company offers compensation for passengers and provide hotel
rooms for those who are stranded.
</P>
<P>
MEA, 99 percent of which are owned by the country's central
bank, has a total of 4,500 staff with only 10 aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
It lost 10 million U.S. dollars last year and is expected to
lose the same amount this year, according to Hout.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall in Tokyo on Hitachi Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Thursday
for the first time in four trading days on news that Japan's major
electrical machinery maker Hitachi Ltd. is expected to suffer a pretax
loss of 100 billion yen (about 725 million dollars) this business
year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 115.38 points, or 0.80
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 14,261.24.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 4.99 points or 0.45 percent to 1,113.77.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 375 million
shares from Wednesday's 485.31 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi's share price plunged moments after the opening bell
following a newspaper report that the flagship company may record an
annual loss for the first time in its 78-year history.
</P>
<P>
The news also triggered a drop in other technology shares,
including NEC, Fujitsu, Toshiba and Rohm.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many banking shares got a lift on indications that the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and opposition parties are
coming closer to passing legislation to rescue ailing big banks by the
use of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, losers

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Writes to Mugabe to Clear up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has written to Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe "hopefully to clear any misunderstandings" in South
Africa's handling of the Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter, which was also sent to Southern African
Development Community (SADC) leaders, has been leaked exclusively
to The Star, the daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki included a copy of a front-page report of The Sunday
Independent newspaper, in which Mugabe was quoted as saying the
South African-led peace plan for the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) had reached a dead end.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Mugabe also accused Mbeki of being
discourteous by not returning his telephone calls, and not
telling him where and when the meeting of SADC heads of state
over Congo crisis would take place.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe did not attend the summit on August 23 in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki wrote: "I consider the matters raised (in The Sunday
Independent report) of such gravity that I thought it would be
proper that I write to you, hopefully to clear any
misunderstandings which may exist."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki explained that South Africa had originally planned two
meetings -- the first involving Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda,
Rwanda and South Africa; the second including SADC's heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
When Mbeki contacted Mugabe over the arrangements of the
meetings, Mugabe said only one meeting should be held because too
short notice had |3n given for a SADC summit, Mbeki wrote.
</P>
<P>
"This would be attended by Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Zambia, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa."
</P>
<P>
However, South African President Nelson Mandela had then
contacted SADC heads of state who said they would be able to
attend the meeting in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"It therefore became clear that... it would be incorrect to
tell them that the SADC summit should be canceled, in favor of
the meeting you, Mr. President, had proposed."
</P>
<P>
"I then called you to report on this development, having
undertaken to come back to you in any case," Mbeki wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Your office in Harare told me that you had already knocked
off. When I sought to speak to your senior staff, I was told that
they also had knocked off. The only people remaining, I was
informed, were the telephonist and the typist."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he subsequently sent the message to Mugabe through
Zimbabwe's High Commission to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On August 22, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano told
Mandela that Mugabe would not attend the Pretoria summit as he
insisted there should be only one meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure you, Mr. President, that no
discourtesy was ever intended, and no information was ever
deliberately kept away from you," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also told Mugabe that reports that South Africa and
Tanzania were involved in training DRC rebels, and that South
Africa was supplying arms to Rwanda and Uganda, were false.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's letter pointedly goes on: "Part of the tragedy, of
course, is that when the dust has settled over the current Congo
crisis, the inextricable ties among us and the common interest
will still require that all of us cooperate with one another for
the mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his government had no desire to impose itself on
anybody.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, and other SADC member states, are pushing for a
diplomatic solution to the Congo conflict, while Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola are militarily involved in propping up
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Mandela hosted a breakfast meeting of southern African leaders
in Durban Thursday morning on the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Neither Kabila nor his ally, Namibian President Sam Nujoma,
were there. They left Durban Wednesday night and early Thursday
morning respectively and asked Mugabe to represent them at the
meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said government troops operating ahead of
defenses sniped and killed three rebels in west of Olumadu in the
north of the country on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday in Kilinochchi in the Northern
Province, government troops backed by armor and artillery launched
a limited operation in places west and east of kilinochchi town to

government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Approves Pay Rise for Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved a pay rise package for civil servants, with effect from
last Tuesday, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
With the new package, civil servants at the lowest level will
now receive a monthly salary of about 5,200 Naira (61 U.S.
Dollars), a 500 percent rise from the previous 800 Naira (nine
Dollars), while those at higher levels may earn as much as 30,000
Naira (353 Dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The pay rise was conveyed to all ministries and government
bodies in a circular dated August 31, 1998, and signed by Alhaji
Gidado Idris, secretary to the federal government, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The circular, however, said the pay rise was only for civil
servants working for the federal government, while workers of
state governments have to negotiate with their respective
employers for necessary adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The decision to review the salary of civil servants was based
on recommendations by a special committee formed by the Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the committee submitted its report in
June last year, but the matter was abandoned until General
Abdulsalam Abubakar took over the power three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Contractors Called to Bid for Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh on Thursday called on Iranian contractors to bid
for the country's oil and gas development projects, after foreign
bidders showed less enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar to introduce the country's oil and gas
projects, Zanganeh said that it was a good opportunity for Iranian
contractors to take part in the country's development projects.
</P>
<P>
"If the Iranian contractors bid for the projects, surely they
will win," he said, expressing regret that Iranian contractors
showed little interest in the development projects.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day seminar opened on Wednesday, the National Iran
Oil Company (NIOC) introduced 29 oil and gas projects with a total
cost of about 80 billion U.S. dollars to domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was scheduled to be held early in August, but was
postponed due to "lack of enthusiasm" shown by foreign bidders,
according to local media.
</P>
<P>
"The NIOC has decided to give the projects mainly to domestic
companies," local daily Iran news said last month.
</P>
<P>
The projects were also introduced to foreign companies in
London early in July. According to Iranian deputy oil minister
Mehdi Husseini, so far about 72 foreign companies, including
three American, have shown "interest" in the projects.
</P>
<P>
Iran expects to promote the country's oil and gas production
capacity by 1.4 million barrels per day and 70 million cubic
meters per day respectively through the 29 projects on a buyback
basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the buyback mechanism, companies are paid and receive a
profit for developing projects by receiving crude or condensate
from the field. The formula gets round the constitutional
prohibition of foreign ownership or production rights in Iran's
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Some European and American companies have expressed their
interest in the projects, but they are facing the challenge of the
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of the U.S., which threatens to impose
sanctions on foreign firms that invest more than 20 million
dollars a year in Iran.

<HEADLINE> New Investment Funds Weather Bearish Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The five newly listed
securities investment funds have weathered a sluggish stock market
recently, reducing their losses in face value to an average of 3
percent while stock prices dropped more than 12 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy for the funds to achieve such results since they
have heavy positions and the market has been quite bearish while
moving downward, according to stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strong support for the fund managers' rational way of
investment since the stocks the fund managers have selected
outperformed the market," they said.
</P>
<P>
China started launching securities investment funds in April,
with an intention to create new market stabilizers. The five funds
are worth 2 billion yuan (241 million US dollars) each, and have a
term of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Wise judgement of the market movement also shielded the funds
from losses, analysts said. The Hua'an Fund Management Co. Ltd.,
for instance, was founded on June 22 when the Composite Stock
Index in Shanghai was around 1,400 points. Instead of buying
heavily, the company managers waited until the market moved to a
lower level.
</P>
<P>
The fund managers also invest in a flexible way: they usually
put money into companies with good quality and prospects, but they
also sell stocks when the prices are high and buy again at lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
"Long-term investment in good companies surely yields good
returns, but we also managed to reduce our costs by taking
advantage of the market movement," said a fund manager.
</P>
<P>
Based on the fact that all five new funds have successfully
outperformed the market so far, market analysts have predicted a
bright future for the funds.

<HEADLINE> Women Scientists Need More Support and Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lack of understanding and
support from society have kept down the number of women scientists
who have achieved major scientific achievements as compared with
their men colleagues, a female scientist said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Hui, deputy head of the Life Science Institute of the
Jilin University in northeast China, made her remarks at the
ongoing Eighth National Congress of Chinese Women.
</P>
<P>
"The number of female scientific workers has increased a lot in
recent years, but the higher the degrees they attain, the greater
the pressures they will face both from the society and their
families," she said, adding that some excellent women, even those
with doctorate degrees, have difficulty finding a spouse.
</P>
<P>
Childbirth is another burden female scientists have to
shoulder, and bearing a child can cost two years out of her career
because of the low socialization level of Chinese family household
chores.
</P>
<P>
She called on the government and society to offer special help
to female scientists, reducing their time away from work to three
months after giving birth, and then providing them with child care
assistance, the standard for many advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics shows that China had 9.9 million female
scientists, 37 percent of the scientific sector.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Anwar Ibrahim, who was
sacked Wednesday evening as Malaysia's deputy prime minister and
finance minister, broke his silence and said Thursday all charges
against him are totally fabricated.

"It's total fabrication. I'm going to fight it all the way,"
Anwar told reporters from his vehicle as he was leaving the Deputy

GENEVA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A Swissair jet with 229 people
on board crashed in the Atlantic ocean off eastern Canada at about
0:30 GMT Thursday, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Swissair Flight 111 of the wide-bodied MD-11 was on its way
from New York to Geneva when it disappeared from radar screens and
crashed about 10 kilometers off the Canadian coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers say they cannot confirm reports that survivors
have been found.
</P>
<P>
Swissair says the aircraft was carrying 215 passengers and a
crew of 14. It is not yet known what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the plane was attempting to make an emergency
landing at Halifax when it went missing. The pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit shortly before losing contact with air controllers.
</P>
<P>
Swissair has set up hot lines for relatives of those on
board. In Zurich, the number is 41-1-803 1717, and in Geneva it's
41-22-717 8300. There's also a number in New York, 001-800-801

<HEADLINE> Militiamen in Somali Capital Demobilized with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A new hope is present for
the militiamen supporting Mogadishu's faction leaders who
recently claimed the establishment of a joint administration for
the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
The aspiration of the militiamen started with salary payment
for the first time since the withdrawal of the multi-national
forces -- United Nations Operation for Somalia -- from Somalia
in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of Mogadishu's administration, the
three faction leaders, Ali Mahdi, Hussein Aidid and Mohamed
Qanyare, have been trying to commit themselves to making a
functioning administration for the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Colonel Abdi Hassan AwalempTY 1did, chief police
commander for Mogadishu's administration, more than 1,300
militiamen who had been in the camps for 20 days were demobilized
after receiving their first wages Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The police commander who is a military colonel himself said
every militiama will be taking 300,000 Somali Shillings (37.5
U.S. Dollars) for each of the first three months in which they are
being trained for their jobs. He added that each man will be
receiving 100 Dollars as their permanent salary afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Qeybdid, who seems to have fallen out with Osman Ali Atto for
whom he had been the interior secretary, said the money has been
a contribution and donation from Somali businessmen who are
working hard for the stability of Mogadishu and their nation at
large.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters Thursday for the first time since he was
nominated for the post that the businessmen are also paying for
the meals for the 1,300-strong militiamen encamped for
Mogadishu's administration.
</P>
<P>
"Despite pledges, we have received no foreign assistance so
far," said Qeybdid.
</P>
<P>
The Colonel said 800 more militiamen and 900 former policemen
will also be encamped in the next few days for the completion of
the first round of the militia demobilization.
</P>
<P>
Besides, dozens of battle wagons including those mounted with
double barrel anti-aircraft heavy machine-guns were demobilized
in the former Police School in south Mogadishu and the main
former Police Transport Headquarters of north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"The second round of the demobilization which will be another
3,000 men will begin in 45 days," said Qeybdid.
</P>
<P>
Fears of inter-clan or factional clashes in Mogadishu seem to
be diminishing despite strong words from Osman Ali Atto, General
Mohamed Sheikh Osman and Hussein Hajji Bod following the
announcement of Mogadishu's administration.
</P>
<P>
More militiamen are likely to turn for Ali Mahdi, Hussein
Aidid and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah as long as they are offering jobs
with payments for them.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the streets in the capital will be much safer with
the increasing number of demobilized militiamen.

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen experts from the Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine have been sent to help prevent and
control diseases in the flood-stricken areas, according to the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The medical personnel, specialists in epidemic-disease
prevention and food and environmental hygiene, are on their way to
Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Illnesses such as colds, pink eye and dermatitis are
under control in the flooded areas, but the potential danger of
outbreaks of epidemic diseases still exists, said a health
official.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of August, the incidence of disease in the
flooded areas has been on the rise, and the Ministry of Health
recently issued an emergency circular requiring close supervision
and prompt reporting of the health situation.
</P>
<P>
Experts sent to the flooded areas will cooperate with local
doctors in investigating into the situation and directing doctors to
deal with the difficulties of disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to train more grassroots personnel in
disease prevention and help local governments plan disease
prevention and control, said the official.

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture is working on effective measures to help flood-ravaged
areas restore agricultural production in an effort to secure an
autumn harvest.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chen Yaobang said that flooding along the Yangtze and
Songhua rivers and the Nenjiang River Basin since June has
affected the rice crop in the southern part of the country, and
the maize, rice and bean harvest in the northeastern region.
</P>
<P>
China has had 21 million hectares of crop fields affected by
the worst flood disaster since 1954.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the broad use of electric draining machines
on flood-affected farmlands, and rush repairs of flood-damaged
water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
Cash-crop vegetables with short growing period should be
encouraged for autumn planting and the harvest management
intensified, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also asked fishing departments at various levels to take
time to organize workers to dredge fish ponds and reduce the
amount of fish lost to the floods.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, attention is also being paid to precautions
for preventing epidemics among farm animals and resuming
production in township enterprises.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Men Paddlers Languish in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In 1986, they won Asian
champion; in 1988, they took the world's first Olympic men's
singles champion; in 1990, they were still Asia's number one --
even China found no way to conquer their traditional rivals.
</P>
<P>
But the 1990 Asian Games became the South Korean men paddlers'
last glory. For around eight years, they have never won a single
Olympic or world title. When their Chinese counterparts resumed
dominance, the South Koreans found they are facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The table tennis is just like our economy, it's in a crisis,"
said Lee Sang Kook, who heads the South Korean national team
competing in the Chinese Grand Prix here.
</P>
<P>
"Except Yoo Nam-Kyu and Kim Taek Soo, we can hardly find a
third one in the team," Lee lamented.
</P>
<P>
But the two veterans, pillar of the South Korean team for over
10 years, can overcome all the difficulties but their age en
route to regaining their form as Yoo, the 1988 Olympic champion,
is 30 and Kim, 1992 Olympic bronze medalist, 28.
</P>
<P>
Yoo and Kim, who brought South Korea's table tennis to the
peak that their successors can hardly scale in the coming years,
have seen their confidence shaken with the emergence of young
Chinese stars like Olympic champion Liu Guoliang and 1995 world
champion Kong Linghui.
</P>
<P>
"Kong has made a great improvement since last year," said Kim,
ranked 11th in the world and a losing finalist to Kong at last
week's Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
"His backhand, speed, topspin have all been improved. He has
a better chance if we meet again in the final," Kim said. "China
has a lot of promising young stars, so the gap between us is
getting wider."
</P>
<P>
Coach Lee hoped Kim can regain flair and form to reach the
final again in the Chinese Grand Prix, which will run until
Sunday. On the other side, he said they took the Grand Prix as a
training ground and warm-up chance for the 13th Asian Games
scheduled in Bangkok, Thailand, in December.
</P>
<P>
"Asian Games is the most important thing for all of us. The
government want us to win at least two gold medals in Bangkok or
the team will be greatly changed." said Lee, who took over the
national team last year, meaning that he would be sacked if his
team failed to win two golds at the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
But the coach found he could do little to revive the sport in
a financial crisis-hit nation. "The money they (the government)
give us is getting less and less, how can we win gold medals
without money?" Lee said. "We had more than 10 players in the
national team years ago, but now we can only support six or sev
en."
</P>
<P>
The national coach also has difficulties in finding young
talent across the country.
</P>
<P>
"There are less than 2,000 young people playing table tennis
in the whole country." Lee said.
</P>
<P>
In his team, Lee said the 21-year-old Oh Sang Eun has a lot of
potential but the 16-year-old Yoo Seong Min might be the person
who will shoulder the responsibility for renaissance of the
nation's table tennis.
</P>
<P>
"Oh is very good but too weak mentally," Lee said, "Yoo has
showed his talent in the recent China-Japan-South Korea
friendlies for the youths. He is very talented and only 16. But
it takes time."

SIEM REAP, CAMBODIA -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen,
accompanied by a senior Cambodian People's Party (CPP) delegation,
had an audience with King Norodom Sihanouk Thursday in Siem Reap
to discuss ways to avoid a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the most seats in the July 26 National Assembly
election, according to the final official results announced by the
National Election Committee (NEC) on Tuesday. But the party failed
to win two-thirds of the Assembly seats needed to form a new
government by itself. Hun Sen is hoping for a revision of the
Constitution to allow his CPP to form a government with a simple
majority. (Cambodia-CPP-Audience)

JERUSALEM -- A nationwide general strike organized by Israel
Histadrut (National Trade Union) began Thursday morning
in Israel, hitting all public sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike was caused by the unsettled wage conflict between
the Histadrut and the government. The Histadrut is asking for an 8
percent wage increase for public sector workers, but the Finance
Ministry only agreed to a 0.75 percent wage increase, which the
ministry said is in addition to the recent cost of living increase
of 0.5 percent and other salary increases, such as seniority
increments. (Israel-General Strike)

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced Wednesday a
series of measures to prevent Turkey from suffering heavy losses
from the current financial crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The measures aimed at curbing inflation and easing tax burden
have evoked positive reactions among Turkey's business and
financial circles.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Semdin Sakik, former leading member of Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has reportedly called on the PKK
militants to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Sakik has been standing trial in a Turkish state security
court since he was arrested by a team of Turkish special forces in
northern Iraq on April 13.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):

Turkish and Greek Cypriots to end the 14-year division of the
island of Cyprus. But this was rejected by Nicosia and Athens.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Strains to Prevent Financial Risks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China has been steadily
accelerating financial reforms and regulating the economic order
to guard against financial risks, said Liu Mingkang, vice-governor
of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"With the deepening of financial reforms, a multi-layer and
multi-type modern financial system has begun to take shape," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil which erupted last July in Thailand swept
across southeast Asian countries, seriously damaging the economy
of Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Asian financial crisis, the most serious
since the 1950s, resulted from an unscientific financial structure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has drawn lessons from the crisis and
promoted timely financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The head office of the PBOC just last year completed the
restructuring after it decided to disband the provincial
subsidiaries step-by-step and establish larger trans-provincial
branches, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The state-run financial institutions are also speeding up their
pace of commercialization. For instance, the country pushed its
commercial banks into the market by revoking the ceiling on bank
loans in January.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have also been given the right to run
themselves in accordance with their asset-to-liability ratio.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has established the State Security
Regulatory Commission to supervise the securities market, and a
special insurance supervisory organization will also be
established.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Allied Armies Agree on Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of army chiefs of
staff of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Democratic Congo (DRC)
ended Wednesday night with a resolve to safeguard militarily the
stability of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting also noted that coalition military intervention in
the Congo conflict is aimed at preventing the rebels of ethnic
Tutsis from taking power by armed force.
</P>
<P>
Joao de Matos, chief of the general staff of Angolan army,
told the press after the meeting that the move taken by the
allied armies in the Congolese crisis is "positive" despite some
obstacles at the moment.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the allied troops have made "remarkable
achievements" in the first stage of action, and the victory will
surely belong to them in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Vitalis Zvinavashe, a Zimbabwean general and commander of the
allied armies, noted that they have controlled the entire
situation although tension remains in certain areas in the east
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, soldiers of the ethnic Tutsi Banyamulunge
community started a rebellion against President Laurent Kabila in
the east of Congo (K). The fighting soon spread to the east and
southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to help the
Laurent Kabila's government stabilize the situation in the
southwest of the country.

Liu disclosed that the PBOC will introduce a new loan
classification system at the end of this year in line with
international practices.
</P>
<P>
The country also is expected to set up professional financial
assets-management companies to prevent various risks for financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mi Jianguo, an economist from a research center under the State
Council, said that establishing a sound financial order is an
important part of China's financial reforms. "The current basic
strategy of guarding against financial risks is to avoid
non-performing loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the State Council published a directive to deal
with illegal financial institutions and businesses, which was
warmly greeted by insiders.
</P>
<P>
At the national financial working conference held in November
of 1997, China decided to adopt measures to alleviate the negative
impact of the Asian financial turmoil and to guard against
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
And, in the first half of this year, China severely punished a
number of banks and securities firms for breaking regulations,
resulting in the withdrawal of a considerable amount of illegal
capital from the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that this move has largely cut down the
"bubbles" in the market, providing a better regulated and
healthier environment in which the market can develop.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC and the State Foreign Exchange Administration have
also started to tackle the issue of existing black markets. Liu
recently warned speculators not to bet against the yuan, "China is
a big player," he said with confidence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Former U.S. Secretaries of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor and
Defense Minister Chi Haotian met here today with a U.S.-China
Society delegation led by Dr. Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance,
both former U.S. secretaries of state.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who also serves as vice-chairman of China's Central
Military Commission, said he is pleased to meet again with old
friends, and praised the efforts that Kissinger and Vance have
made in promoting Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both sides are working hard for a constructive
Sino-U.S. strategic partnership geared to the 21st century, which
is in line with the common aspirations of the peoples of both
nations.
</P>
<P>
The current relations between China and the U.S. have been hard
earned, Chi said, citing the Chinese proverb "when drinking
water, think of its source."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people will never forget those
U.S. friends who contributed to promoting Sino-U.S. friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed the visitors on the Chinese military and mass
efforts in fighting the devastating floods this summer.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger joyfully recalled his first visit to China in 1971
and those who have made great efforts to open the gate for
bilateral relations, saying he is glad to see increased exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Vance said he feels happy to have such a chance to visit China
again, during which he is seeing China's changes with his own eyes.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Investors Oppose Burundi Sanctions: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's business community
wants the sanctions imposed on Burundi by the regional
governments to be lifted, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We denounce economic sanctions because they make us less
k+WW-]Z;e against our competitor from non-sanction implementing
areas," Chairman of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Kassim Owango was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was backed by the chairman of the Kenya Association of
Manufacturers, Chris Kirubi.
</P>
<P>
Owango said that sanctions had the effect of closing the doors
of development while providing unfair and undue advantage to
other players in the market place.
</P>
<P>
He said they become a draw back to economic growth of the
Great Lakes region at a time when it is facing economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more painful when the sanctions are imposed by
our leaders who are at the same time urging us to invest in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kirubi said the sanctions on Burundi only benefited the West.
</P>
<P>
"We must declare the sanctions illegal; they have not served
any purpose," said the KAM boss.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's neighbors imposed sanctions against the small
central African country in August, 1996, just a few days after
Major Pierre Buyoya seized power in Bujumbura.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Population Triples in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim population in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has tripled since
the autonomous region's founding 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the Muslim population in this region,
which has the largest number of Hui people in China, has
risen from 580,000 in 1958 to 1.78 million this year.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims now account for 33.8 percent of the region's total
population.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the region's Health Bureau attribute this
population growth to economic development and the improvement of
health conditions.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the special population policy implemented in
the autonomous region also has helped increase the Muslim
population.
</P>
<P>
A Muslim couple there is allowed to have three children, while
a Han couple in a Chinese city is only allowed to have one child.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of New China in 1949, the ratio of births
to deaths in Ningxia stood at 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
In the past 40 years, the number of hospitals and clinics has
been tripled, and the death rate for pregnant women and new-born
babies has dropped from 15 per thousand and 200 per thousand, to
0.97 per thousand and 37.9 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
And over the past 40 years, the life expectancy for Muslims in
Ningxia has been extended from 35 years to 69.5 years at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- As the teachers' unions
continued their strike on Thursday, Israeli Education Minister
Yitzhak Levy is expected to find a way out of the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after negotiations between teachers' unions and
Finance Ministry broke down Wednesday night, Levy said that he
would go to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seek a way to
prevent pupils from being kept home.
</P>
<P>
Levy indicated that he would try to restart negotiations after
his meeting with Netanyahu, asking the teachers' representatives
not to leave Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Angry teachers' representatives blamed the Finance Ministry for
the breakdown of the talks, saying that their unions had shown
responsibility by compromising on many subjects in order to solve
the issue.
</P>
<P>
But a statement issued by the Finances Ministry said that the
Ministry had offered the teachers fair offers to maintain their
real wages, accusing the teachers' organizations of intending to
use pressure and extortion to increase their salaries beyond any
logic.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said that the teachers wanted to
increase their salaries by 8 percent, while they agreed only to a
5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' unions launched the strike on Tuesday as the new
school year was scheduled to open, keeping 1.2 million students at
home.

ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 84,000 telephone
lines which have been newly installed in Addis Ababa and other
towns during the 1997/98 fiscal year have gone operational, the

</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's 1997/98 fiscal year ended on July 7, 1998.

<P>
Besides, Berhe said, over 14,000 new lines have been installed
in Arada, Dessie, Kombolcha, Woldia, Jijiga and Hosana towns.
</P>
<P>
Berhe said preparations are finalized to install 10,250 new
telephone lines this year in various regions.
</P>
<P>
The general manager described the installation of over 84,000
new lines in a single year as ''a dramatic move in a country''.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- With Tibet's opening-up wider to
the outside world, the mysterious highland autonomous region
southwest China is becoming more and more appealing to overseas
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional complaints of its incomplete facilities and
services, many foreign visitors are attracted by its beautiful
landscape and unique ethnic features.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan student Bayron Galindo and his American wife Kay
Reneolayo are now studying the Tibetan language in Lhasa-based
Tibet University.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be a teacher of a kindergarten or an orphanage in
Lhasa after graduation, because I love children here very much,"
Galindo said.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago Galindo met some Tibetans in Beijing Foreign
Studies University and found that their customs and skin color
were very much like Guatemalans. From then on, he said, he
cherished the dream of visiting Tibet.

He made two visits to Tibet before making up his mind to study
there. In March, the couple became overseas students at Tibet
University.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Tibet, Galindo said that he was deeply impressed
by the distinctive ethnic and religious features during his first
visit. But the communication in the region was inconvenient and,
in Lhasa, there was very little grassland or trees.
</P>
<P>
He said the streets in Lhasa have been widened and the city has
a nicer appearance.
</P>
<P>
Johannes Balzer, a German, was one of the first group of
overseas students to attend Tibet University. As soon as he
graduated from the university in 1995, he set up a company in
Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> No Survivors from SwissAir Plane Crash: Canadian Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A spokeswoman for Queen
Elizabeth hospital of Halifax denied that up to now there have
been any survivors from the crash of the SwissAir jet off the
coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, reports said early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no survivors to date," Chris Power, VC nursing
services at the Queen Elizabeth hospital of Halifax, near the
crash site, told a news briefing carried live on CBC Television.
</P>
<P>
The alert at the hospital has been called off and things have
returned to normal proceedings, Mrs. Power said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier another local TV station reported that there were some
survivors and that some victims have been rushed to local
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew en
route from New York to Geneva, crashed seven miles off the
Canadian coast, south of Halifax.
</P>
<P>
Canadian ships and aircraft were searching the crash site,
where plane debris was scattered a couple of kilometers across.
</P>
<P>
Some bodies have been picked up from the sea, which was rough
and dark, said the CBC Television.
</P>
<P>
Search is continuing in the crash area, which is about seven
nautical miles off Peggy's Cove on Nova Scotia's South Shore,
early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MD-11 jet declared an emergency at 10:30 p.m. local time
and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax airport.
</P>
<P>
The crew reported an engine fire and dumped tons of fuel. The
plane crashed moments later.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of ambulances and fire trucks were gathered along the
Canadian coastline. A Hercules aircraft and four military
helicopters were leading the search.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they heard sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the smooth sound of an airplane," one witness was
quoted as saying. "I heard the crash and a clap of thunder shook
the house."
</P>
<P>
The weather was reported to be overcast, with a light sprinkle
of rain and calm seas.

The company, near the famous bustling market on Bargor Street
in the downtown area, is engaged in local handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
"I only invested 100,000 yuan at first because I was not sure
about the market," Johannes said. "The local government helped me
go through the formalities in a short time."
</P>
<P>
Because of the booming tourism in the region, his business has
been growing rapidly. His employees have increased from three to
24 and his investment reached 300,000 yuan. Besides selling
handicrafts, the company also runs a hotel with 58 beds designed
to accommodate foreign tourists.

<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's economic crisis took a dangerous political turn
Wednesday when Aleksandr Lebed, the gruff presidential hopeful,
told President Clinton that the country faced a greater threat than
in 1917 on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Sinn Fein agreed for the first time yesterday to join the
process intended to lead to the disarmament of paramilitary groups
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Sinn Fein Wednesday took the first historic step towards
persuading the IRA to dismantle its arsenal of weapons, as the
Government pushed its "draconian" anti-terro bill through the
Commons.
</P>
<P>
The Independent
</P>
<P>
-- The Northern Ireland peace process moved into a new phase
Wednesday night as it emerged that the Ulster Unionist leader David

face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Opposition UNIP Threatens to Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's United National
Independence Party (UNIP) has threatened to boycott the country's
forthcoming local elections to be held later this year if the
government manipulates the on-going voters' registration.
</P>
<P>
Bweendo Mulengela, secretary for publicity and information of
the country's largest opposition party, told a news briefing
Wednesday in Lusaka that if fraudulent registration practices and
their subsequent demands were not attended to before the polling
date, they would have no option but to boycott "a sham and
stage-managed election".
</P>
<P>
The Post, an independent newspaper, Thursday quoted Mulengela
as saying that there were reports of anomalies in some
registration centers in the capital city of Lusaka and other
districts.
</P>
<P>
His party had uncovered anomalies in the registration of
voters in which some UNIP members were denied chance to obtain
the national registration cards, a situation he said was aimed at
creating artificial apathy.
</P>
<P>
Mulengela elaborated how the UNIP cadres were denied voters'
cards and charged that they were being intimidated and
interrogated by registration officers, who were pretending to be
teachers as required.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the government's move to sell registration
forms, saying the consequence of this move would make voting a
right to only those who had extra money to spare.
</P>
<P>
UNIP had written formally to both the country's Electoral
Commission and the Department of National Registration to express
its concern over the anomalies, according to Mulengula.
</P>
<P>
UNIP boycotted the 1996 general elections and burnt their
registration cards to protest against the disqualification of its
leader and former president Kenneth Kaunda to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling party, however, decided last July to
participate in the forthcoming local government elections, the
date of which is to be announced by the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's registration of voters started on August 24 and runs
up to September 13. The Electoral Commission hoped to capture
3.7 million voters out of a total of 4.3 million eligible voters
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the turnouts are disappointing since there is
countrywide apathy on the practice. Local reports said fewer
people have been registered in registration centers since the
exercis began.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Romanian Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with a Romanian military delegation led by Minister of State
Victor Babiuc, who also serves as minister of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Romanian relations have developed smoothly and the
governments, parliaments and armies of the two countries are
increasing contacts day by day, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believes the visit of Babiuc would promote
friendship and cooperative ties between the two nations, and
especially the ties between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic situation, Li said citizens and soldiers are
fighting against floods all over China and they later will face
the difficult tasks of resuming production and rebuilding homes,
which will be China's major post-flood tasks.
</P>
<P>
In general, China's economic situation is good, he said, but some
difficulties have appeared because of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government is taking steps to
overcome the negative impact.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the Romanian delegation on China's situation in
deepening reforms and strengthening the construction of a
democratic legal system.
</P>
<P>
Turning the topic to international affairs, Li said China is
pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, and working to
promote the development of multi-polarization and the
establishment of a new order in the global politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
Babiuc praised China as an important role model in safeguarding
world peace, security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the traditional friendship between
Romania and China would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Babiuc also expressed sympathy of the Romanian people for flood
victims in China, and admiration to the Chinese People's
Liberation Army for its bravery in the battle against the floods.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Judges Responsible for Illegal Trial Practices (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China will enforce an internal
supervisory mechanism in its courts beginning today which will
hold courts of law and their staff members responsible for illegal
trial practices, Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme
People's Court, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This move is to promote clean and honest courthouses and
ensure justice is served," he said at a press conference on the
issuance of a "trial method on investigating and affixing
responsibilities for illegal trial practices by court staff."
</P>
<P>
Staff members, including judges, shall be deemed responsible
for intentionally breaking the law in court trials, or when
carrying out court verdicts, and responsible for unintentional
legal offenses which result in serious consequences, according to
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism is based on a decade-old method called the
"wrongful verdict responsibility system" which exclusively
governed judges. The new system covers all court staff members,
including presidents of people's courts, chief judges and court
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Illegal practices, as defined in the new method, cover the
application of both substantial and procedural laws, intentional
or unintentional violations of the law, and both ongoing and
past illegal activities.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sets Aside Fund for Kenya's Nutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has earmarked over 480 million Shillings (8.07 million U.S.
Dollars) to help Kenya improve public health and nutrition in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF project has been designed to address the high
levels of preventable disease in women and children in the most
disadvantaged areas of this east African country, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The program focuses on chronic malnutrition levels through
the community based approach, building and expanding on the
Bamako Initiative," UNICEF was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program will improve access to quality services through
support and promotion of community nutrition and care. It will
also support the control of micro nutrient deficiencies, safe
motherhood and reproductive health issues, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The project will aim to reduce the incidence of vaccine
preventable diseases by 50 percent and sustain an expanded
program of immunization (EPI) coverage of 90 percent for infants.
It also aims to eradicate poliomyelitis and reduce child
mortality due to diarrhoeal diseases by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Adequate case management of malaria will be increased by 50
percent, while the Health Ministry's institutional services will
be strengthened from 33 percent to at least 90 percent in all the
districts in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF noted that health conditions all over the country
deteriorated significantly in late 1997 and the first quarter of
this year, due to the floods caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in an upsurge in communicable diseases such
as malaria and cholera, inaccessibility of health facilities,
displacement and severe damage to the infrastructure, the UNICEF
4ilented.

<HEADLINE> Internet Improves Students' Grades: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by AT&AMP;T
last month said the Internet "helps students get better grades."
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 2,416 American respondents to the survey,
whose results were released Wednesday, agreed that "the Internet
has become a necessary tool for success in school."
</P>
<P>
Almost 70 percent of the parents, students and teachers who
participated in the survey said they had seen students' grades
improve through the use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is to school research in the '90s what the
calculator was to math in the '70s," said Dan Schulman, president
of AT&AMP;T World Net Service, which conducted the on-line survey, in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tool that lets students learn more in less time. In
keeping with that belief, we're encouraging kids to use the
Internet in a variety of ways." AT&AMP;T has created several Web
programs to introduce children to the Internet and advise parents
on helping children use the Internet safely.
</P>
<P>
While the survey confirmed the Internet can be an educational
tool, other studies have revealed its "negative impact."
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, for example, found
that people who spend even just a few hours a week on-line
experience higher levels of depression and loneliness than they
would have if they used the computer network less frequently. The
results of their study, with AT&AMP;T as one of the sponsors, were
released last week.

<HEADLINE> Six Arrested for Bribery in Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Six people have been arrested
for charges of bribery in the case of the Beijing Western Railway
Station, the Chinese capital's new rail gateway.
</P>
<P>
The six expected to be put on trial are manager Su Qingfu of
the Qingdao Power Station Valves Plant, Baoji Material Company's
deputy manager Zhang Yan, materials dealers Tong Yan and Zhao
Zhixiang, surveyor Li Chunbo, and Huabao Real Estate Company's
deputy manager Guo Xueliang.
</P>
<P>
Of the six defendants, one has been bailed out and is waiting
for trial.
</P>
<P>
To sell poor-quality valves to the railway project, Su Qingfu,
the main figure in the case, bought two cars and gave them to the
five other defendants in addition to 300,000 yuan (about 37,500
U.S. dollars) in cash, according to court sources.
</P>
<P>
Su also said he spent more than one million yuan to "entertain"
the five people. His bribery worked and he signed a contract to
sell 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) worth of the
famous Qingdao brand valves in the name of the Qingdao Power
Station Valve Plant.
</P>
<P>
But, only one-fourth of the valves were of the Qingdao brand,
and the other valves were a cheap assortment Su reportedly got
from other areas.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the station was commissioned in January of 1996,
almost all the valves began to break down. Paint peeling down from
walls and ceilings and leakage are common. Small fountains drown
the underground consignment warehouse's floor, and the roof of
the multifunction hall on the third floor of the waiting building
is almost completely separated from its walls.
</P>
<P>
The station's waiting building cannot pass the state acceptance
inspection.
</P>
<P>
All investigations about the case have been closed.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Western Railway Station cost the Beijing Municipal
Government five billion yuan (about 580 million U.S. dollars) and
took three years to build.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Detect Lead Content in South Pole Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
used an advanced technology to detect lead content in
nearly 100 samples collected from South Pole ice.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has obtained accurate data for
South Pole ice lead content, an important index of global
environmental pollution, said Ma Wanyun, an atomic sciences
researcher at Qinghua University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the study shows that the lead content of ice and snow
in Antarctica is higher than was previously thought, and the
eastern region of Antarctica has more lead pollution than the
western region.
</P>
<P>
Lead in the ice sheets of the South Pole can indicate current
global air pollution and the influence of human activities at the
South Pole, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is very difficult to accurately detect the lead
content there using traditional technology, because 1,000 tons of
ice only contain several milligrams of lead," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Scientist at the Qinghua lab adapted a technology called
single-atom detection and control to design a laser-excited
fluorescence spectrometer, which can distinguish the weak
information sent out by a single atom despite background
interference.
</P>
<P>
"Another difficulty is to avoid contamination in the
experiment," said Ma. "It took us three years to complete
detection in nearly 100 samples."
</P>
<P>
In addition, single-atom detection technology can also be
used to explore large gold deposits several hundred
meters deep underground, according to Ma.

<HEADLINE> 5-Year Plan for Industrial Zone Drafted in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is drafting a five-year
plan for the development of industrial zones to boost the
country's industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The plan was preliminarily coordinated here Wednesday by the
Myanmar Industrial Development Work Committee, chaired by Minister
of the Second Industry Major-General Hla Myint Swe, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has set up 17 industrial zones across the country in an
effort to promote the development of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
These zones include those in Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Hinthada,
Myaungmya, Myeik, Yenangyaung, Pyay, Mingyan and Meiktila.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the industrial zones is aimed at
manufacturing import substitute goods and promoting export,
ensuring regional development and creating more job opportunities
for local people, according to the country's Industrial
Development Committee, formed with a number of ministers in July
1995 to give greater impetus to the industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
In this respects, Myanmar has called for extensive
participation of the private sector which shared 72 percent of
the production value of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Myanmar has also induced foreign investments in
the infrastructural development of the zones with companies from
Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand building up three zones
out of five in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country's industrial
sector grew by 5.3 percent in its output value in the 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March, sharing 9.2 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and standing as the second largest
contributor to the GDP after agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector amounted to 1.43 billion U.S.
dollars in 113 projects at the end of the fiscal year, taking up
the second position after the oil and gas sectors out of a total
of nearly 7-billion-dollar foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian CPP Leader Hun Sen Has Audience with King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen, accompanied by a senior Cambodian People's
Party delegation, had an audience with King Norodom Sihanouk
Thursday in Siem Reap to discuss ways to avoid a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the delegation were the party's Honorary Chairman Heng
Samrin, President Chea Sim and Treasurer Chea Soth.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the most seats in the July 26 National Assembly
election, according to the final official results announced by the
National Election Committee (NEC) on Tuesday. But the party failed
to win two-thirds of the Assembly seats needed to form a new
government by itself.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is hoping for a revision of the Constitution to allow
his CPP to form a government with a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties, FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP), rejected the election results and refused to join a
government headed by Hun Sen, whom they accuse of staging a coup
d'etat to oust then First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh last
year.
</P>
<P>
The King decided Wednesday to preside over a working session of
the three main political parties in Siem Reap in hope of resolving
a month-long constitutional crisis, which led to 12 days of
opposition-backed demonstrations in Phnom Penh.

<HEADLINE> Rain Causes Cancellation of Night Matches at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Rain caused the
postponement of four singles matches tonight at the U.S. Open
tennis championships, including those of top seeds Pete Sampras
of the United States and defending champion Martina Hingis of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Both will play Thursday afternoon. Sampras will continue his
quest for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam title when he battles
unseeded countryman Paul Goldstein. Hingis will take on unseeded
Croatian Iva Majoli, who defeated the Swiss sensation in last y
ear's French Open final.
</P>
<P>
Two singles matches were in progress when the rains came at
about 8 p.m. Officals waited almost 90 minutes before calling off
play for the evening.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Alex Corretja of Spain and Italy's Gianluca Pozzi
will resume their first-round match on Thursday, with Pozzi on
top 6-2, 3-6, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
In a suspended women's second round match, American Mary Joe
Fernandez took the first set 6-3 over Alexandra Fusai of France,
but trailed 2-3 in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Germany's Bernd Karbacher recorded the first major
upset of the tournament as he stunned mistake-prone fourth seed
Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Among women, eighth seed and five-time champion Steffi Graf of
Germany stormed into the third round by annihilating countrywoman
Marlene Weingartner 6-0, 6-1 in only 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Korda, the reigning Australian Open champion, was plagued by
57 unforced errors and lost his serve seven times as he suffered
his fourth U.S. Open first round loss and 14th overall in the
Grand Slam, including this year's French Open. He knocked off
Sampras in the fourth round last year.
</P>
<P>
Graf never faced a break point and was helped by Weingartner's
27 unforced errors as she won her 16th consecutive U.S. Open
match and 29th in her last 30. She is making her U.S. Open
return after missing last year due to season-ending knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had that many matches like that for a while," Graf
said, "I don't feel great. It feels good if you play well, but if
you don't really get challenged, then it is not so satisfying."
</P>
<P>
Graf will face Croatian teenager Mirjana Lucic in the third
round. Lucic rallied past Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu 4-6, 6-1, 6-1
to reach the third round for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
In other men's seeded play, second seed Marcelo Rios of

player,got back on the winning track by disposing of Daniel Vacek
of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.

<P>
Also 10th seed Spaniard Carlos Moya was leading 6-1, 7-6
(7-4),6-7 (3-7), 4-4 when Argentina's Mariano Puerta retired with
cramps in his right hip flexor. No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia stormed past Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen 6-1, 6-2, 6-4
and No. 13 Tim Henman of Britain downed Australian Scott Draper
6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
Former finalist Michael Chang of the United States crushed
Isaeli qualifier Eyal Erlich 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
For the women, third seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic
got past Frenchwoman Amelie Cocheteux 6-2, 7-6 (7-1); two-time
champion Monica Seles of the United States, the sixth seed,
dumped South Africa's Joannette Kruger 6-2, 6-3; and ninth seed
Irina Spirlea of Romania, a semi-finalist last year, downed
Germany's Miriam Schnitzer 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In other seeded matches, No. 11 Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland,No. 14 Dominique van Roost of Belgium also sailed
into the next round. No. 16 Ai Sugiyama of Japan was leading
Spain's Gala Leon Garcia 3-2, but was forced to retire with a
left ankle sprain.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Down in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals for the first
seven months of this year have reached 202,670, down 1.2 percent
compared with the same period last year, according to Ceylon
Tourist Board (CTB) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CTB indicates that tourist arrivals declined for the fifth
consecutive month, falling by 4.3 percent to over 29,500 persons
in July this year.
</P>
<P>
This follows a 3.2 percent and nine percent falls in June and
May respectively.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons of decline in the tourist arrivals may have
been partly deterred by the spate of Tamil rebel attacks in key
cities in Sri Lanka during late last year and early this year, the
CTB said.
</P>
<P>
The tourist industry, one of the top foreign exchange earners,
has been recognized by the government as an essential industry for
the economic and social development of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of over 366,200 tourists visited Sri Lanka in 1997,
while 302,000 came to the country in 1996.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) A high school football player
who collapsed during practice was declared dead Wednesday

San Bernardino County coroner's deputy Jim Sedgwick said that
Chino high school linebacker Scott Maughan took a head-to-head
hit Tuesday during tackling drills, and he died on Wednesday
afternoon. His body was kept on ventilation machines at a

<P>
The 16-year-old player collapsed and was taken unconscious to
a medical center nearby.
</P>

<HEADLINE> General Strike Hits Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide general strike
began Thursday morning in Israel, hitting all public sectors of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Organized by Israel Histadrut (National Trade Union), about
30,000 public sector workers joined the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike was caused by the unsettled wage conflict between
the Histadrut and the government. The Histadrut is asking for an 8
percent wage increase for public sector workers, but the Finance
Ministry only agreed to a 0.75 percent wage increase, which the
ministry said is in addition to the recent cost of living increase
of 0.5 percent and other salary increases, such as seniority
increments.
</P>
<P>
Following discussions on this issue during the last several
days, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz and Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman negotiated Wednesday midnight in a last-ditch attempt to
prevent the strike, but failed.
</P>
<P>
After midnight, Peretz suggested a compromise proposal, asking
only for forming a framework of wage increases and details to be
discussed later, but no agreement was reached with the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's strike closed down government offices, post offices,
local authorities, regional councils, transportation services,
hospitals, national insurance institutions, port and railway
authorities, telephone and electric corporations and national TV
and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry so far stood firm on its position against
any wage increase, saying the government can not afford it. It
said even 1 percent wage increase would need 2 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the Histadrut said the strike is of indefinite duration.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said the strike would cause great damage
to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the last several days, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu tried his best to help reach an agreement, but also
failed.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka eager to get Food aid for Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
requested donors to expedite shipment of foodgrain for flood
victims in the wake of the severe flood, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Thursday, quoting official sources.
</P>
<P>
The country's food aid requirement has been estimated to be
around 1.38 million tons in the current fiscal year, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The government's eagerness to get the food aid shipment early
has been already conveyed to donors through a representative of
the United Nations agencies in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of about 880 million U.S. dollar-aid requirement,
250 million dollars are required as food aid, according to an
official of the Economic Relations Division (ERD) under the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program had already sent messages to its
headquarters seeking early shipment of food aid, the Food Ministry
and the ERD said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has confirmed its readiness to provide 86,000 tons of
wheat this month, a month earlier than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
It would take a few more days for the country's development
partners to come up with specific aid offers, a Food Ministry
official said. "We have urged donors to expedite already committed
aid."
</P>
<P>
The already-committed foodgrain aid includes 140,000, 81,000
and 86,000 tons of wheat from United States, the European Union
and Australia respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, import of foodgrains by traders is likely to
supplement the government drive to meet the food shortage due to
severe floods, officially estimated to be 830,000 tons, the
official said, adding that various other assessments put the
shortfall at two to four million tons during the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Crop loss caused by the nearly two-month-long floods might
stand at three million tons since 60 percent of rice crop had been
seriously affected, an expert said.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Year Plan Worked Out to Develop Thai Pineapple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year, 9.7-billion-baht
(242.5-million-U.S. dollar) plan has been worked out to solve the
problems of Thailand's pineapple industry, the Bangkok Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan would maintain Thailand as the world's largest
exporter of canned pineapple and canned juice, the newspaper said,
quoting Agriculture Minister Pongpol Adireksarn.
</P>
<P>
Running from next year to 2005, the plan would overcome the
annual problem of an oversupply or scarcity of the fruit, which
caused problems for canneries planning their production, the
minister said during a committee on national pineapple development
policy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year, supply is far below demand because of drought, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pineapple growers and canneries both experienced cost
fluctuation every year.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol said he had asked planners to draw up a proposal to be
put to the government.
</P>
<P>
Of the 9.7 billion baht, five billion baht (125 million
dollars) will be earmarked for growers, 2.5 billion baht (62.5
million dollars) for canneries and the rest for maintaining buffer
stocks that would be used to stabilize the pineapple price.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Expresses Concern Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is deeply concerned
over the deteriorating situations in Kosovo, said Bulgarian
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Radko Vlaikov Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo conflict retains its explosive potential despite the
extraordinary concerted efforts of the international community and
the countries in the region,Vlaikov said.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Kosovo is intolerable and must be
changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
To end this and bring success to the negotiating table, Vlaikov
said the cessation of hostilities between the two warring parties
is a necessary condition.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the identification of the representatives of the
Kosovo Albanians, whether they will be legitimate in the talk, is
an important factor towards the success of the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, a form of broad autonomy should be sought
which would provide lasting satisfaction to the demands of both
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
``I believe nothing has changed in the stand of Bulgaria and
other countries in the region, in that we categorically oppose any
revision of boundaries in the region," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov called on the international community to coordinate on
their decisions concerning matters in Kosovo. The unity of action
with the Contact Group should be guaranteed and the stands of the
countries in the region should be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized that the economic sanctions imposed on
Bosnia and Herzegovina were counterproductive and would affect
adversely other third countries, like Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Release Three Iranian Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A joint Pakistani and
Iranian delegation flew to Afghanistan Thursday to receive three
Iranian drivers freed by the Islamic Taliban militia, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Ayaz Wazir, Director of Afghan Affairs in
Pakistani Foreign Office and Abdullahi, a senior Iranian diplomat
in Pakistan, has gone to Kandahar, Taliban's southern stronghold,
on a special plane Thursday morning and it will come back in the
afternoon, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's Supreme leader Mohammad Omar announced Wednesday that
"as a good-will gesture", the militia would release three out of
30 Iranian drivers they arrested last month when they overran
Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the rival northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed that these Iranian drivers were sending
weapons to the pro-Iranian northern alliance and Iranian
government said they were carrying humanitarian aids to northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian government claimed that its 11 diplomats
in the Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of Kabul, have also
been kidnapped by the Taliban. But the accusation was denied by
the Taliban authorities.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Projected GDP Growth Over 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economic growth in
terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to be in the
range of 5 to 5.5 percent this year, according to Central Bank
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank sources said the projection was slightly lower than
the 5.8 percent achieved during the first quarter of 1998 while
the original target for 1998 was 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economy had performed satisfactorily up to the first half
of 1998 but external factors such as the recession in Asia and
the Russian crisis were causing difficulties, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, locally, the drop in rubber and coconut output as
well as low growth in some industrial exports had an impact of
slightly lower GDP projection.
</P>
<P>
the sources expressed confidence that interest rates would
stabilize between 12 and 14 percent though it was under some
pressure a few months back.
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis in South East Asia and its effect on the
world economy, Sri Lanka's exports had succeeded in maintaining an
8 percent growth from a high base in 1997 when exports went up by
13.3 percent. Imports during the first half of 1998 had increased
by 1 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Wants Secret Fund to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Central Bank
Governor Chatumongol Sonakul has voiced opposition to the move to
use the 373.8 million U.S. dollar secret fund deposited at the
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank on government spending.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Nation newspaper quoted the governor as saying the
fund should remain as part of the country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Finance Ministry recently stumbled across the fund
under a Thai government account which had been used by the Thai
military to receive U.S. military aid and transfer money for arms
purchase for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the account had been known to few outside the
Defense Ministry until U.S. government officials recently
mentioned it as a possible source of downpayment for Thailand's
planned acquisition of F-18 fighter jets, which was later
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said he had instructed the Central Bank to keep the
fund at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank as part of Thailand's
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul earlier said he had
asked the Finance Ministry to find a way to use the money as the
government had a shortfall in its revenue collection as a result
of the economic malaise. So far there has been no instruction from
the Finance Ministry to withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said: "The funds are gaining attention because the
country has faced tight liquidity. The Finance Ministry's stand in
keeping the funds as reserves has helped boost the country's
coffers."
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank acknowledged the fund's existence and
had always submitted a monthly statement on the fund to the
Comptroller-General's Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of the Office of the Auditor-General
Noppado Nimsomboon said the office is seeking to examine the
military's "secret funds" for the past 10 years and check the
income of army-owned television channels 5 and 7 and its more than
200 radio stations countrywide.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been criticism over the misuse of secret
funds and the public demands transparency in spending by all
government agencies.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows Despite Negative Impact, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China can achieve its
projected economic growth despite the further deterioration of the
Asian financial crisis, a visiting senior Chinese official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, director-general of China's State Statistical Bureau,
told a press conference that the complex environment in
international economy has had negative impacts on China's foreign
trade, foreign investment and economic development in general.
However, the government policies have enabled China to get along
well with the situation.
</P>
<P>
The policies, announced early this year, are designed to expand
domestic demand and reinforce infrastructure development to offset
the possible drop in export resulted from a strong currency in the
waves of devaluation in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
China has vowed not to devaluate Renminbi to head off a new
round of devaluation. However, it is predicted that the decrease
in its exports could be hardly avoided.
</P>
<P>
"China's gross domestic product for the first six months of the
year was 3,473.1 billion yuan, representing a relatively high
growth of 7 percent over the same period of 1997 at comparable
prices. This is no easy achievement," said Liu, who has been a
professor of macroeconomic analysis since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The 7 percent growth rate is short of the 8 percent target for
this year. "We are hopeful that we can achieve the goal," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the remaining months of this year, so long as we succeed in
implementing the policies and measures of the government to
promote domestic demand and turn the unfavorable factors into
favorable ones by boosting the reconstruction in disaster-hit
areas, our overall economic development will accelerate," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that major problems still exist in the economic
development including difficulties facing some enterprises in
production and management, the irrational economic structure and
the deterioration in the efficiency of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there are also many favorable factors,
including the encouraging situation in energy, raw materials,
transportation and communications, the low price level and the
great financing potential.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen steady or even accelerated growth in such leading
indicators as investment in fixed assets, bank loans and
production of capital goods," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
By his account, the total investment in fixed assets from
January to July rose by 15.6 percent over the same period last
year, of which the growth in June as compared with June of 1997
was 16.3 percent, and that in July, 22.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth in investment, mainly in agriculture, transportation
and communications, has become the main stimulating factor for the
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
July also saw a significant pick up of the growth in money
supply. M2 rose by 15.5 percent as compared with the same period
of 1997, while M1 increased by 10.5 percent and M0 by 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tourism in Thailand May Be Affected by Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry
may become another victim of the recent global economic woes, the
Bangkok Post Thursday quoted Prime Minister's Office Minister
Jurin Laksanavisit as saying.
</P>
<P>
Economic problems in countries and territories like Malaysia,
Hong Kong and Russia will undoubtedly affect Thailand's tourism
industry, Jurin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Jurin, who is in charge of tourism affairs, said that
the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) will carry on its plan to
promote the two-year Amazing Thailand campaign in major markets.
</P>
<P>
The TAT plans to continue promotion in high-potential markets
including China, India, Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is one of the few countries in the region to report an
increase in foreign tourist arrivals compared with last year. In
the first half of this year, foreign arrivals rose by 4.8 percent
to about 3.75 million, higher than the TAT targeted 4 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists spent 130 billion baht (3.25 billion U.S.
dollars) during the period, an increase of 17.6 percent over the
first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, new currency controls imposed by Kuala Lumpur,
including limits on how many ringgit Malaysians can take out of
the country, could hurt the tourism industry in southern border
provinces of Thailand, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
There is also concern about Russia, the fastest-growing new
sources of tourists to Thailand, he said. In the first half of
this year, the number of Russian tourists soared by 48.4 percent
to 30,314.
</P>
<P>
According to Jurin, the TAT is looking for new sources of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand would do more to attract Vietnamese people,
who have settled overseas and were returning to Vietnam for family
visit or vacations, to stop over in Thailand for brief holiday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Asian Games, to be held in Bangkok in December,
will help to attract 800,000 more tourists, many of whom might
stay on to celebrate the Christmas and New Year in Thailand, Jurin
said.
</P>
<P>
Given all the factors, Jurin said he was confident that the TAT
would reach its target for the year of 8.28 million tourists and
300 billion baht (7.5 billion dollars) in revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's prices will still be
kept at a low level in the second half of this year, though the
inflation rate is expected to turn to a positive one in the

Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"With the overall economic climate turning better, the
situation of a negative inflation rate will end in the second half
of this year," he said at a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fact of a "buyer's market" and the impact of the
Asian fianancial crisis, China witnessed sluggish market this
year and China's inflation rate has been dropping for several
months, Qiu noted.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the consumer price index dropped by 1.4
percent over the same period last year and the retail price index
dropped by 3.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:Thailand Reacts Strongly to Malaysian Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai has voiced optimism over Malaysia's currency control
decision, but government officials and businessmen expressed fears
that the move might hamper border trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said on Wednesday that he believed Malaysia would succeed
in tackling its financial woes by its new measures to shore up
currency stability.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in a last-ditch
effort to save the country's embattled economy, on Tuesday
announced that the government would ban trading of the ringgit
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, however, said should Malaysia falter on its currency
control measures, Thailand, as its neighbor, might be adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has instructed the Prime Minister's Office Minister Jurin
Laksanavisit to closely monitor the impact of the Malaysian
decision on Thailand's tourism, according to Thursday's Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was also cautious about the possibility of
emulating the Malaysian measures on currency control, saying that
conditions in the two countries were different.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia has comfortable foreign exchange reserve
to back up as it concocted its remedies for the economic ailment.
Thailand is relying on loans from the International Monetary Fund
to shore up its reserves, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian move to impose foreign exchange
controls has prompted fears from Thai government officials and
businessmen over border trade with Malaysia and the adverse effect
on tourism in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The officials and businessmen said that since the introduction
of the Malaysian currency peg system, Thailand has already
experienced a sharp drop in Malaysian tourist arrivals and the
currency control would further inhibit cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will seek urgent talks with Malaysia to try to divert
the impact of the Malaysian decision on tourism and cross border
trade between the two countries, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak
Chutiku said.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand will ask whether any flexibility could be
exercised in implementing this decision which will take effect on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's southern province, in particular Songkhla, benefit
most from tourism and cross-border trade with Malaysia. Some 80
percent of business in Songkhla depend on Malaysia. About one
million Malaysians visit Thailand each year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Malaysian border trade amounts to about 300 billion
baht (about 757 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency control measures, Malaysians would
find it difficult to bring ringgit out of the country and
therefore would be discouraged from spending outside.
</P>
<P>
Charn Leelaporn, chief adviser to Songkha Chamber of Commerce,
said he foresaw immediate repercussions for trade and tourism in
Southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said the cross-border business transactions usually rely on
cash and cashier's cheques so the limit on Malaysian currency
movement will have an adverse impact on trade.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the southern border provinces expect the black
market for foreign exchange to mushroom as businessmen on both
sides of the border try to bypass the artificial control of the
Malaysian currency, Charn added.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of the trade is cash transactions in baht
and ringgit. In the past, Thai traders were paid in ringgit
directly by their partners or received cash transfers through
banks.
</P>
<P>
"It was a convenient system which is no longer relevant,"
Charn said.
</P>
<P>
"The new Malaysian measures are obstructing the free flow of
border trade. What will happen instead is a cash-only non-banking
trade system," he said, "costs will rise and it will be harder to
monitor data and other information. Soon it will become a black
market transaction."
</P>
<P>
Baht was traded at 10.10 per ringgit (buy) and 10.25 per
ringgit (sell) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Somboon Ponglertnapakan, chairman of the Hat Yai-Songkhla
Hotels Association, said he was alarmed about the plunging hotel
occupancy rate owing to the drop in Malaysian tourists.
</P>
<P>
Somboon revealed that hotel revenues in the southern region
have already declined 30 percent so far this year and that the
cancellations by Malaysian tour groups had risen sharply even
before the currency control announcement.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian tourists would be further discouraged from visiting
southern Thailand, he predicted, saying the southern hotel
industry was hard-hit by the Malaysian economic malaise and that a
number of hotels might have to close if falling occupancy rates
continue.
</P>
<P>
In a longer term, the switch in the Malaysian currency regime
might trigger a fall in Thai exports, said Kumron Kumkaew, a
tourism official in the southern region.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Opposition Calls For Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
the United National Party (UNP) has called for talks with the
rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), according to
the local newspaper The Island Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Karunasena Kodituwakku told the Island that the
government should resume negotiations with the LTTE without delay,
and should not lay down any conditions except for agreeing on a
time frame to conclude negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said all options available to resolve the North-East crisis
should be probed.
</P>
<P>
There was no need to call off the ongoing military operation in
the North and the East and elsewhere during the talks. Previous
cease-fires had been used by the LTTE to consolidate its position
and resume hostilities resulting in heavy losses among the
government forces, the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kodituwakku added his party did not support the involvement of
a negotiator. However the idea of a mutually acceptable
Facilitator was crucial in bringing the LTTE back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate Tamil state since
1983 and over 55,000 people have been reportedly killed in the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The present government had held peace talks with the LTTE
during the period from October, 1994 to April, 1995. On April 19,
1995 when the LTTE attacked government troops in the east of the
country, signaling an end to peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government had expressed willingness to reopen a
dialogue with LTTE, subject to conditions including a substantial
laying down of arms and an arrive at a settlement within a
stipulated time frame.

<HEADLINE> Italy Reaffirms Position on U.N. Security Council Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Wednesday reaffirmed Italy's position that the U.N. Security
Council should include the addition of two rotating seats open to
all member states.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will declare again its position at the
U.N. headquarters in New York during the General Assembly session
scheduled for September 9.
</P>
<P>
While most U.N. member states are in favor of improving
Security Council procedures, transparency and expansion are
recognized as one way to ensure this. But opinions have so far
differed over how it should be done.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, Germany proposed making two industrialized
countries new permanent members of the council, while giving
developing countries nothing more than rotating seats.
</P>
<P>
But Italy is strongly against the German proposal because it
claims it would introduce a distinction between the northern and
southern hemispheres, recreating at the U.N. an inadmissible
dualism between rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that Italy's involvement in the Security Council
reform has "prevented extremely prejudiced developments not only
in terms of our country but in terms of the effectiveness and
legitimacy of the council itself."
</P>
<P>
Germany and Japan both aspire to permanent seats, which are
currently limited to the United States, Britain, China, France and
Russia and carry a veto right.
</P>
<P>
Dini reconfirmed Italy's opposition to the entry of Germany and
Japan as permanent members of the council and said that a solution
which is truly representative of the new world should be sought.
</P>
<P>
"We must reaffirm our point of view also in light of new facts,
such as the risk of a renewed nuclear arms race, the development
of other countries and continents, and the outlook for Germany --
the heart of Europe -- itself."

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Refineries Cut Production Due to Demand Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Six oil refineries of Thailand
cut their production by 7 percent in July from the previous month,
and further cutbacks are expected for the rest of the year as the
domestic demand is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post reported Thursday that the July cutback of
53,600 barrels was spurred by a 10 percent drop in local oil
product demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exporting surplus output has grown more difficult
due to a market glut.
</P>
<P>
World oil product prices have plummeted to the lowest level in
a decade, the newspaper said, quoting Metta Banthurngsuk, deputy
secretary-general of the National Energy Policy Office (Nepo).
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy slump in Thailand is demand for diesel oil,
which contracted by 17.4 percent in the first half of this year to
271,750 barrels per day, figures from the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT) showed.
</P>
<P>
Consumption is likely to drop further through the rest of the
year, and no one can predict when the contraction will end, Metta
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, refineries have been forced to reduce production
as most are unable to export excess supplies. They also face
foreign-exchange losses as most are funded by offshore loans,
Metta said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Commercial Registration reported that total
production of all six refineries in July was 709,800 barrels a
day, compared with 763,400 barrels a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The combined production capacity of the six refineries is
825,000 barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Devalues National Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of
Colombia announced Wednesday it was devaluing the national
currency by nine percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's decision was made after the peso came under
increasing pressure, closing at 1,443 to the dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government had spent 210 million dollars since
last Friday in foreign exchange markets trying to prop up the peso.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo said Wednesday that the
currency was devalued because of "the recent evolution of
international financial markets". He said the government would not
allow the peso to depreciate more than 23 percent by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
He also announced measures to pare the burgeoning budget
deficit, including strengthening tax collections and reworking the
government pension system.
</P>
<P>
Global markets have been hit by the economic troubles of Asian
nations and the more recent travails of the Russian
economy. Investors fearful the contagion will spread to other
developing countries have pulled out of financial markets in Latin
America, battering stocks and currencies in the region.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for More Support for Its Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy needs a reformed foreign
ministry with increased resources to better support its evolving
role in the world, Italy's prime minister and foreign minister
agreed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the close of an Italian ambassadors
conference, Prime Minister Romano Prodi promised to boost funds
for the ministry, saying "money invested in this direction pays
immediate dividends".
</P>
<P>
In an earlier speech, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini urged the
government to raise his ministry's share of the state budget to at
least 0.4 percent, the average in other developed countries, from
the present 0.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dini also promised that the planned reform of the foreign
ministry would be implemented as soon as possible, ushering in a
phase of "greater initiative, responsibility and flexibility" and
of constant dialogue between Rome and its embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
The conference, during which ambassadors discussed Italy's
foreign policy and how to further its aims, also served as a
platform for Prodi to outline "the three pillars" of that policy.
</P>
<P>
The three pillars were: an ever greater involvement in the
European Union; a close but free relationship with the United
States; and a strategic involvement in the Mediterranean and the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On the first of the three, Prodi reaffirmed Italy's support for
the enlargement of the EU and for institutional reforms, including
an overhaul of the Common Agriculture Policy, which Prodi said
would mean sacrifices for Italy.
</P>
<P>
As for Italy's Mediterranean and Middle East policy, Prodi said
it was where the nation had shown "originality" in its foreign
policy by pursuing dialogue with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the policy, while sometimes different from that of
the U.S., had never been facile or polemical and had been
developed "honestly and without any craftiness".
</P>
<P>
When talking about the success of the Italy-led mission in
Albania, Prodi said it had lent Italy much credibility. "In the
Mediterranean and the Balkans, we are now considered a strong part
of Europe," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Italy's position on the economic crisis in Russia was also
touched on by Dini in his closing speech.
</P>
<P>
"The clear message, which also comes from other countries, is
in the invitation to Russia not to turn back. Confidence in Russia
will depend on its timely and clear decisions on continuing its
policy of reforms and cooperation with the West," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is also the condition for every form of support,
including financial aid," Dini added.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino," Financial Crisis Blamed for Drop in Peru's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian exports dropped by 26.2
percent during the first seven months of 1998 because of the
weather phenomenon "El Nino" and the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports reached 2.984 billion U.S. dollars from
January to July in 1998, compared with 4.044 billion dollars in the
same period in 1997, the Customs Tariffs Department said.
</P>
<P>
The fishery sector was the most affected by "El Nino," with
exports totaling 167 million dollars, 79 percent less than in the
same period of 1997, while mining exports were 1.793 billion
dollars, dropping by 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the tariff department, the Asian crisis
contributed to the reduction in prices of mining goods, including
copper, iron, lead and tin exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the sale of gold in the international market has grown
by 13 percent, totaling 321 million dollars from January to July
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the sales of non-traditional
products rose by 2.3 percent in the period. The items with the
greatest success were mechanic-metal and craft goods.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Study Center of the Association of Exporters said
that the trade deficit reached 2.108 billion dollars from January
to July of 1998, 179 percent more than the same period in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Hui Region to Invest in Irrigation Network Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region plans to invest 2.17 billion yuan (about 261.56 million
U.S. dollars) on a gigantic water irrigation improvement project
carrying over into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The project, already ratified by central government
authorities, is designed to expand the areas irrigated by the
Yellow River to some 666,600 hectares from the present 423,300
hectares.
</P>
<P>
An arid inland region in northwest China, Ningxia Hui from
ancient times has relied on diverting the Yellow River, which runs
through it for 397 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Successful water diversion programs have already helped turn
Ningxia into one of China's 12 leading grain-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project, expected to be completed in 5-to-10
years, calls for the building, expanding and transforming of 412
pumping stations and water gates, and the construction of 550
kilometers of irrigation ditches.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to help resettle 300,000 people
from Ningxia's poor mountainous areas, and to improve the ecology
in the Yellow River irrigated areas.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Clinton in Waiting Game with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
leaves here Thursday in the middle of a waiting game with Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the Russians grapple with a financial crisis and political
chaos, Clinton sets the ground rules of the game: the United
States will only throw in more financial and economic assistance
when it is sure that Russia is sticking to its course of economic
reforms and democratization championed by the West.
</P>
<P>
"America and the international community are, I am convinced,
ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path of
reform," Clinton told a press conference Wednesday at the end of
his summit meeting with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Russians will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
As the two presidents talked, Russia's national currency,
dropped over 15 percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Russia's central bank, which has been forced
to let the ruble freefall, set Thursday's official exchange rate
at 12.8198 to the dollar, a drop of 17.8 percent in a single day.
</P>
<P>
Prices soared. In Moscow's neighborhood grocery stores, some
goods, such as flour, sugar, detergents and toilet paper, are
vanishing from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
Although few people expect the Russian consumer market to
return to the old days of empty shelves and long queues, residents
are hoarding things so as to lessen their vulnerability to a weak
ruble and price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia is without a fully functioning government to
tackle the dire economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's nominee for prime minister, was
rejected overwhelmingly by the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, last Monday.
</P>
<P>
And his chances of succeeding in the second ballot on Friday
are slim.
</P>
<P>
The Duma on Wednesday passed a resolution asking Chernomyrdin
to spare deputies the trouble by simply rejecting the post.
</P>
<P>
"Your voluntary rejection of the position of prime minister
could significantly reduce the tension and lead to a search for a
compromise," the Duma told Chernomyrdin, who was called back to
his old job after five months in political wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the nomination is blocked
three times, the president has to select a new candidate or
dissolve the State Duma, which would plunge Russia into further
political upheaval and economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, however, seems to have no intention of producing a new
nominee.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was prepared to dismiss the
opposition-dominated Duma if it refused to confirm Chernomyrdin,
Yeltsin simply ducked the question.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I must say, we will witness quite a few events for us to
be able to achieve all those results. That's all."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, was trying to help Yeltsin from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
When meeting leaders from Russia's various political factions
Wednesday at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence, he
urged them to "bridge their differences to agree on ... a program
to stabilize the current situation."
</P>
<P>
"But if the basic framework is not in place, as a friend I say
I do not believe that you can defy the rules of the road in
today's global economy anymore than I could defy the laws of
gravity by stepping off the top floor of Spaso House," Clinton
warned.
</P>
<P>
But before the haggling among the political forces dies down,
any reform program has little chance of being followed through
consistently in a volatile Russia, given the severity of the
economic mess.
</P>
<P>
After offering moral support and laying down the rules,
Washington has to go on waiting.
</P>
<P>
"The ball I think is very much in their court. We do not have
any new or additional aid or plan in our pocket," a senior White
House official said, summarizing the situation.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Extends Education Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic plans to
spend an additional two billion korunas or 64.5 million
U.S. dollars on education this year, and another 7 billion korunas
or 225 million dollars in 1999, an official from the education
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the year 2002 expenditures on public education
would rise to 6 percent of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP), catching up with the level of European countries.
</P>
<P>
Spending on education so far this year was 61.7 billion
korunas, or 1.98 billion dollars, or 4.2 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The expenditures have been cut repeatedly in the past. In 1994,
the amount was 5.4 percent of the GDP, 5.3 percent in 1995 and
1996, and 4.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This situation has resulted in negative consequences. Many
school buildings have not been repaired for a long time,
educational equipment is in short supply and some schools have had
to close.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is one of the central and eastern European
countries where spending on education accounts for only a small
percentage of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Hungary tops the list of spending by committing 6.7 percent of
its GDP toward education, followed by Slovenia with 6.2 percent,
and Bulgaria ranks third with 5.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Water Control Workers Play Big Role in Fighting Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Water control workers with the
Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee have played a big role
in combating this year's major floods in many areas of Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "People's Daily," 3,600 workers of the
committee have worked in shifts to patrol and check the
6,300-kilometer main stream of the Yangtze around the clock since
the flood season began in late June.
</P>
<P>
They have been able to forecast flood crests three days in
advance, with an error rate of zero to 0.07 meters in predicting
water levels.
</P>
<P>
The high volume of information -- telegrams, short-term
rainfall forecasts, reports on water and rainfall, bulletins on
water situations on the Yangtze -- generated by the workers has
been used as an important reference for central flood control
experts in working out detailed plans for combating flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Flood Control Headquarters introduced a
24-hour duty system for workers' shifts since early April.
</P>
<P>
Based on information provided by flood control headquarters on
the possible development of flooding on the section of the Yangtze
in central China's Jingzhou Prefecture in mid-August, China did
not have to use the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area when the river
rose to alarming levels.
</P>
<P>
This decision saved more 10 than billion yuan of property from
destruction and the cost of relocating more than 500,000 local
residents, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Anger Sends Tyson to Therapist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Embattled Mike Tyson is
being counseled for anger, the banned heavyweight champion's
chief boxing adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He has been going for therapy," Shelly Finkel said. The
volatile ex-champion's latest incident came Monday after a
traffic accident in Gaithersburg, near Washington D.C., and
threatens to derail his boxing license application on September
19.
</P>
<P>
"This does not help Tyson," said Luther Mack of the Nevada
Athletic Commission, which already had requested Tyson's medical
records.
</P>
<P>
Tyson allegedly punched one man, who suffered a cut inside his
lip, and kicked another in the groin after the car that Tyson's
wife was driving was rear-ended, police spokesman Derek Baliles
said. No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
In 18 days, the Nevada athletic commission will decide the
fighter's immediate boxing fate, Commissioners say the issue of
self-control and Tyson's tempestuous nature, which suddenly
erupted when he twice bit Evander Holyfield in 1997, will be
paramount in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The commission already has asked Tyson's boxing adviser Finkel
for Tyson's medical records, which include a diagnosis of
"intermittent explosive disorder."
</P>
<P>
Tyson's latest brush with aggression could be used against him
during the hearing in Las Vegas. Tuesday, commission chairman
Elias Ghanem wondered:"Was it his temper? that provoked the
confrontation with the motorists."
</P>
<P>
In March a woman accused Tyson of throwing coffee in her face
at a Washington, D.C., restaurant, and witnesses said he loudly
cursed her.
</P>
<P>
In July, He blurted out an obscenity to his attorney during a
license hearing in New Jersey, stunning observers.
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you anything that has happened in his life since
June 28, 1997, is open to discussion," commissioner James Nave
said, "I certainly think the commission will look into Tyson's
self-control issues."
</P>
<P>
"I think the commission will do the right thing and ask the
hard questions," commissioner Luther Mack said, "You have to look
at the last year -- the restaurant incident, the New Jersey
incident and now this. We just hope Mr. Tyson comes before us
and tried to explain why these things occurred. No one hates
Mike."

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Ethnic Region Benefits from New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly developing
aviation industry in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region is improving transportation between the formerly remote
ethnic region and the country's inland and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
"The distance between Ningxia and Zhejiang was shortened by
days," said Wang Liangqi, vice-president of the Ningxia-Wenzhou
Industrial and Commercial Association.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Yinchuan Hedong Airport to traffic in August
saved time for Wang on his return to east China's Zhejiang
Province, but for Ningxia it was a historical accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yuankang, deputy director of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), said that operation of Hedong
Airport for a total investment of 538 million yuan is a symbol
that all of the capitals of China's provinces now have modern
airports.
</P>
<P>
As China's only Hui autonomous region, Ningxia has 1.7 million
Hui people. Until the operation of the new Yinchuan Hedong
Airport, the only airport in Ningxia had been used for 60 years
and was one of the shabbiest in China's provincial capitals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, in the first five months, the new airport
handled 64,000 passengers, 600 tons of freight, up 9.2 percent and
11.7 percent, respectively, over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the airport should be able to handle 600,000
passengers and 1,500 tons of goods annually.

<HEADLINE> Falling Copper Prices Drive Chilean Mining Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chile's mining exports are
expected to drop to 7.1 billion U.S. dollars this year, a fall of
1.3 billion U.S. dollars from last year, according to the latest
appraisals of the National Mining Association (SONAMI).
</P>
<P>
The reason for the drop is blamed on the fall in copper prices.
</P>
<P>
The current annual price of copper is 76.8 U.S. dollars per
pound. But in August, the price fell to 73.5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The situation has caused the Chilean mining sector to reduce
its exports by an average of 50 percent since 1997. This year,
exports have fallen by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 months, there have been announcements of
temporary and permanent closures of more than 60 mines as well as
small and medium size plants.

<HEADLINE> Jews' Shanghai Story Revived on Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- "Shanghai's Ark," a
documentary released recently on Shanghai's Oriental TV, depicts
the odyssey of 25,000 Jewish refugees which ended in Shanghai 60
years ago.
</P>
<P>
This 50-minute film explores abundant historical anecdotes,
including interviews with 22 former Jewish refugees, among them
the former U.S. Minister of Finance, Michael Blumenthal, and the
first violin of the Vienna Philharmonic, Heinz Grunberg.
</P>
<P>
And it will be distributed internationally in both English and
Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
As a renowned Chinese artist based in the United States,
director Yi-Fei Chen held his personal art exhibition eight years
ago in New York, where he came across a Jewish lady who said hello
to him in fluent Shanghai dialect.
</P>
<P>
She recalled her secure life in Shanghai during those turbulent
days in the 1930s and 1940s, which marked the start of Chen's
project to unveil on screen this little-known phase in war-time
history.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if this movie makes a profit or not -- what
matters is that I want to emphasize the everlasting brotherhood of
Chinese and humankind," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In World War II, in order to escape the Nazis, more than 20,000
Jewish refugees fled to Shanghai. They lived there in their own
community maintaining Jewish customs.

MADRID, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Economy Rodrigo Rato Figaredo said
Wednesday that Spain should strengthen reforms to enhance
competitiveness in order to cope with the effects of the economic
crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Rato said at Santa Cruz De Tenerife in the Canary Islands that
the crisis would slow economic growth around the world. Spain
would have to adjust manufacturing costs and incomes and maintain
low inflation through control of the national deficit to increase
Spain's ability to compete.
</P>
<P>
Because of the growth in domestic demand and investment, the
Spanish government believed that it was not necessary to change
its 1998 and 1999 macroeconomic plans, Rato said.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 macroeconomic plan, economic growth will
be 3.9 percent and inflation rate will be 2.1 percent.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
lifted subsidies on wheat flour, sugar and soybeans,
simultaneously liberalizing their importation and scrapping
applicable import duties to reduce its burden in meeting people's
needs for the commodities.
</P>
<P>
The move is also meant to accelerate implementation of its
market-oriented economic policy, Minister of Industry and Trade
Rahardi Ramelan said on Wednesday when announcing the new policy.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more subsidy and monopoly. We will leave it
to the market mechanism," the Jakarta Post daily Thursday quoted
the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said other costs imposed for basic commodities will be
also lifted as a part of the government's efforts to curb
inflation. The inflation rate from January to August this year has
reached 69.12 percent, and it was predicted to hit 80 percent at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
General importers were completely free to import the
commodities and they would be exempt from import duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was confident the measures
would be able to stabilize prices at affordable levels for most
people.

<HEADLINE> Expedition to World's Highest River Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Organizers from the Government
of the Tibet Autonomous Region announced today that bad weather
has forced the cancellation of an expedition to the Yarlung Zangbo
River, the highest river in the world.
</P>
<P>
The expedition was scheduled for this month, but heavy rains,
storms, landslides and flooding on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have
caused extreme difficulties for the planned expedition, according
to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
"There are problems in logistics, support, rescue, equipment
and funding," they explained.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of the scientists and reporters, the
government canceled the expedition, which featured plans of flying
across the world's biggest valley on the Yarlung Zangbo and
collecting data about its ecology, natural resources and disasters.
</P>
<P>
The Yarlung Zangbo Valley attracts adventurers from all over
the world. A number of teams have tried to raft the river, but all
failed.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they might launch another expedition to the
river if conditions are better next year.
</P>
<P>
However, some members indicated that they would ignore the
government's decision and continue the expedition.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China will build an
expressway from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, a city in the east end of
the Great Wall in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
As an extension of the Dandong-Lhasa national highway, the
Beijing-Zhangjiakou expressway will be the main passage for
expanding economic and cultural exchanges among regions in west
China.
</P>
<P>
The construction, estimated at 3 billion yuan, is expected to
be completed within three years.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the travel time by bus between Beijing and
Zhangjiakou will be shortened from the current four hours to two.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Zhangjiakou expressway will be helpful for the sale
of farm and side-line produces from Zhangjiakou, transporting coal
from Datong in north China's Shanxi Province, and stimulating the
economy of poverty-stricken areas along the expressway.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite alternating periods of
drought and flood, Guangdong's 1998 summer grain yield is setting
a record, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quoted an official from the
Provincial Bureau of Agriculture as saying that summer grain
yields in this southern Chinese province are more than 9.1 million
tons, up 52,800 tons compared with the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Guangdong has enjoyed five successive years
of increasing summer grain yields from 1994-98.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed Guangdong's sustained growth in grain
yield to an expansion of investments in agricultural production
and to improvements made in agricultural production since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong grew grain on 1.5 million hectares this year, an
increase of 3,000 hectares compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the province reported more than 2.2 million
hectares of sown croplands, up 15,600 hectares compared with
1997.

<HEADLINE> Lakers VP Jerry West Agrees to 5-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers vice
president Jerry West, considering retirement just five months
ago,reportedly has agreed to terms on a new five-year contract
that will pay him 3.5 million U.S. dollars a season.
</P>
<P>
Citing the pressure of trying to build a championship team,
West spoke of taking some time off at a news conference on April
19. He was responding to numerous reports that he would retire
this summer due to his strained relationship with top executives
and coach.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, West added O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Robert Horry to a young strong team that included guards Eddie
Jones and Nick Van Exel, both of whom blossomed into All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers won 61 games this season and were among the
favorites to represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals,
but they were swept in the conference finals by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
A new deal would also be instrumental in O'Neal and Bryant
remaining with the team. O'Neal can opt out of his seven-year
deal following next season and Bryant will be a free agent next
summer.
</P>
<P>
As a player, he was an All-Star in each of his 14 years. As a
coach, he had a 145-91 record from 1976-1979 and served as a
special consultant for three years before being elevated to
general manager in 1982.
</P>
<P>
West sitll ranks as the Lakers' all-time leading scorer with
25,192 points. He was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
1979 and was named to the list of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> World Population Continues Rapid Growth: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The chance of a world
population explosion could occur in the near future, the United
Nations warned in its annual world population report released on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The global population may reach 6 billion in mid-1999 and it is
expected to increase at more than 80 million a year in at least
two decades to come, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the world population is characterized by the
simultaneous rapid growth of the young and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"Past high fertility means more young people than ever before
-- over one billion between the ages of 15 and 24 -- are entering
their child-bearing years. At the same time the numbers and
proportion of people over 65 are increasing at an unprecedented
rate," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people over the age of 65 is now 578 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The report said the growth of the younger population is fueling
the development potential of many countries, while the increase in
the number of elderly is pushing the age for retirement up.

<HEADLINE> Non-ferrous Metal Sector Suffers Loss from Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The unprecedented floods that
swept the Yangtze River basin and Northeast China for over two
months have caused great losses in the non-ferrous metal sector,
although these losses have had little impact on the overall
production and markets up until now, according to today's "China
Daily."
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics from the State Bureau of Non-ferrous
Metals Industry predict that the total flood-imposed losses will
account for one percent of the sector's total output this year.
</P>
<P>
The floods have affected 31 companies, resulting in temporary
production shutdowns. Direct losses are nearly 60.24 million US
dollars and indirect damages are expected to be more that 24
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The floods aggravated the current poor business climate which
has affected non-ferrous metals companies since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts said that the floods can also serve as an
opportunity to upgrade the outmoded technologies and equipments
used by these companies touched by the floods.
</P>
<P>
To promote capital flow into the industry, groups of large
enterprises will be established.
</P>
<P>
As an effective way to slash the production costs, the State
Bureau of the Non-ferrous Metals Industry intends to cut 15,000 to
20,000 employees by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The task ahead is extremely difficult for the 285 enterprises
involved in the sector because they cannot offer any re-employment
capital since more than half are not registering any profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Museum of Natural
History is now offering visitors a glimpse of a tropical rain
forest environment.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located in a northern temperate zone, recently
opened its highly popular tropical botanical garden.
</P>
<P>
One primary school student visited the exhibit in the
sweltering August heat and said he felt as if he were visiting a
real tropical rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-sq.-m. garden, or the so-called "Green Home",
attracts over 5,000 people daily, with visitors pouring in even on
the hottest days.
</P>
<P>
The museum has installed hallway air conditioners for the
comfort of the many visitors.
</P>
<P>
"The color green symbolizes life, but random forestation has
substantially diminished the earth's green coverage, said Curator Li
Jianjun, adding the "exhibition exhorts people to protect plants
and cherish life."
</P>
<P>
The museum spent over 1.6 million yuan (about 200,000 US
dollars) for exhibits and multi-media equipments. Visitors have
the opportunity to stroll through a tropical forest featuring
scenery much like that found in Xishuangbanna in southwestern
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Numerous primary and secondary schools have contacted the
museum for information concerning, with students groups charged
less than half of the normal 15 yuan admission fee.
</P>
<P>
"We must assume responsibility for promoting environmental
protection," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He noted that museum organized very few plant exhibitions over
the past decade, with businessmen often renting exhibition halls
for furniture show and sales.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing people adore plants and animals. We realized that we
should take full advantage of our expertise by organizing
exhibitions," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"People throughout the world must care for the earth, and
museums must make their due contributions," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said the Green Home Exhibition will be around for a long
time.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Better than expected growth has helped Australia defy the
Asian crisis, bolstering the Howard government's core economic
management credentials and underwriting its boast to deliver
budget surpluses, plus hefty tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The former chiefs of Sydney Water Ltd. confused the public
and acted inappropriately when they attempted to "kill" a major
health alert, according to a damning report on the city's
contamination crisis released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The Coalition has moved marginally ahead of Labor in the
first poll conducted since the federal election was called on
Sunday. However, the Howard government still does not have the
numbers to ensure it can win the election on October 3.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has been forced into another
Asia-induced downgrade of its growth forecasts, despite receiving
a political boost Wednesday from figures revealing the economic
growth at a robust 3.9 percent rate in the June quarter.

<HEADLINE> Young Italian Women Rank Third in Jobless Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian women were third in
the 1997 jobless rankings issued by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD, almost 40 percent of young Italian women
between the ages of 15 and 24 are out of work, a figure that is
only beaten by Spain and Greece. The proportion of women who stay
in school or a university was not reported.
</P>
<P>
While the trend in Spain has been improving for three years,
and in Greece it turned around in 1996, things have been getting
steadily worse for young female Italian job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, only 35.4 percent of young women between 15 and 24
were out of work, but the figure rose to 39.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The comparable figures for young Italian males were 23.4
percent in 1990 and 28.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The OECD average was 11.2 percent in 1990 and 12.9 percent for
males, and 12.1 percent and 14 percent for females.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, Italy's neighbor, has the lowest unemployment rate
for young females, just 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other countries with very low jobless rates for young women
were Japan with 6.3 percent, South Korea 6.6 percent, Mexico 8.4
percent and Germany 9.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules out Foreign Exchange Control Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
dismissed rumors on Wednesday that Indonesia would follow Malaysia
and impose foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the free foreign exchange system for the time
being, but we will continue to study new developments,"
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said here Wednesday evening after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia on Tuesday imposed currency controls in attempts to
fend off speculators by setting a fixed exchange rate for the
ringgit by year-end and allowing the currency to be traded only
within the country.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian drastic policy has prompted speculation that
Indonesia will soon announce a similar measure, a dealer said. But
economists warned the government not to copy Malaysia's move as it
would only further damage investor confidence in the crisis
economy.

<P>
Indonesia has been the hardest hit by the currency woes with
the rupiah losing almost 80 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar at one stage.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia made world headlines early this year when it said it
was considering the adoption of a currency board system, in which
the rupiah is pegged at a fixed rate to the U.S. dollar. The
government, however, decided not to adopt the system.

<HEADLINE> New Water-Absorbent Material Developed for Environmental Uses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A new water-absorbent polymer
has been developed by a group of scientists from Beijing
University for such environmental uses as planting trees in the
country's rapidly expanding desert land.
</P>
<P>
The new material -- a super high-speed, high-absorbent polymer
-- was developed by a research team headed by Professor Li Fumian
from the Chemistry Department at Beijing University. The material
passed a formal assessment for industrial production Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The material has proven able to absorb water 1,000 times its
own weight in less than 30 seconds and then slowly release the
water," said Zhang Zhongyue, a senior engineer with the Beijing
Academy of Chemical Industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yiming, a research fellow from the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the new material's excellent
water absorption and preservation capabilities will allow it to be
effectively and widely used in a number of environmental fields
such as combating desertification, soil conservation, flood
control and afforestation.
</P>
<P>
"In deserts, the main problem for afforestation is that water
evaporates very rapidly," he said. "This material can help to
solve the problem and thus help to change deserts into oases."
</P>
<P>
The new material can also raise the survival rate of newly
planted trees from the current average level of around 30 percent
to more than 80 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the countries facing the world's most severe soil
erosion and desertification situation, China is now losing 2,460
square kilometers per year of its land area because of
desertification.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 3.6 million square kilometers,
or 38 percent of the country's total land area, is undergoing soil
erosion and 27.3 percent of its total land area has become
desert.

<HEADLINE> Agitators Present During May Riots, Admit Indonesian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian government
officials admitted that there were agitators present during the
May riots in Jakarta and other cities which left 1,200 people
dead, an investigating team member was quoted by national
newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating the riots on
Wednesday questioned Armed Forces Intelligence Agency (BIA) chief
Maj. Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim to collect more inputs which the
team needed before drawing its conclusions on the bloody riots.
</P>
<P>
Zacky was the fourth government official questioned by the
investigation team. Last week, the team questioned former Jakarta
military commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie, Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso
and former city police chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata.
</P>
<P>
The government established the team in July which includes
representatives from the Armed Forces, government agencies, the
National Commission on Human Rights and non-governmental
organizations to investigate reports that the riots were
masterminded.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that all four officials admitted
that there were agitators present during the riots," Bambang W.
Soeharto, a member of the team, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Based on the information gathered from the four officials so
far, Bambang said the conclusion could be drawn that all four of
them were "quite aware of and alert to the happenings" on those
days.
</P>
<P>
"From the BIA chief we received the input that the ABRI (the
Armed Forces) was not involved in any action to orchestrate the
unrest, organize or incite the masses to commit destructive acts,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zacky nevertheless admitted there were a number of agitators
behind the riots.
</P>
<P>
Bambang added that Zacky said he had done his utmost to monitor
rising tension in the country from as far back as April 9.
</P>
<P>
"The intelligence agency had detected signs (of trouble) and
warned all units to be on the alert back in April," Zacky was
quoted by Bambang as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zacky said that his organization predicted that "something"
would happen on May 20, the day Moslem leader Amien Rais planned
to stage a march involving one million people to demand former
president Soeharto's resignation. However, Amien canceled the
rally for fear of clashes between marchers and the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
When pressed further by the reporters as to why the military
were non-existent during the riots, despite Zacky claims that all
units had been placed on the alert, Bambang said: "Zacky revealed
that the troops were tired and depressed... they had been almost
constantly on the alert since the election (last year) and the
general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (in March)."
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the meetings so far held were not sufficient and
added that the team plans to question other officials to establish
if the riots were masterminded or not.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Seed Korda Beaten in U.S. Open First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Fourth seed Petr Korda of

the first round competition at the 14 million U.S. Open tennis
championships in New York today.
</P>
<P>
Karbacher recorded the first major upset when he stunned
mistake-prone Korda 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. Korda the reigning
Australian Open champion who uspet Pete Sampras of the United
States in the fourth round last year, was plagued by 57 unforced
errors and lost his serve seven times as he suffered his fourth
U.S. Open first-round loss and 14th overall in a Grand Slam
including this year's French Open.

<P>
Eliminated in the first round of the U.S.Open for the first
time since 1993, Korda said that mental fatigue was the main
reason for his early departure.
</P>
<P>
"I had one bad game, and from that moment everything went
downhill," said Korda. "I'm a little bit tired because I really
depend on my family, and the last six months I saw them only four
months. It is too much for me and it really is probably one of
the keys why I am tired."
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked 155th in the world, the 30-year-old Karbacher
earned his first victory over Korda in three meetings. He
reached the U.S. Open quarter-finals in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Call for New National Flag Raised in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley is supporting a call for debate on a new national
flag, a Wellington-based newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted Mrs. Shipley as saying Wednesday that New
Zealand should consider whether its flag reflects its confident,
modern identity as it heads into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The basis of the current national flag of New Zealand is the
Union Jack in the upper left quarter, and on a blue ground to the
right the Southern Cross is represented by four five-pointed stars
with white borders.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed Minister of Cultural Affairs Marie Hasler, who
raised the call for a new New Zealand flag, said that the current
national flag "too much reflects our former colonial status.
Rather, it has become, over time, almost meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Shipley said that she supports Hasler's call for debate on
the merits of New Zealand's flag. "The debate should be wider than
just the national flag," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a wonderful idea to look at the symbols of New
Zealand and ask if it is time to reflect on who we are as we turn
the corner into the next century," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
A change might reflect New Zealand's increasing confidence in
its culturally rich, multi-ethnic identity, she added.
</P>
<P>
"For some years I have believed our flag no longer catches the
essence of contemporary New Zealand," the paper quoted Ms Hasler
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Ms Hasler favors the silver fern on a
black ground, but believed that New Zealanders should debate which
design its flag should bear.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Sales Reduced in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The recessionary economy of
New Zealand is taking its toll on magazine sales, with several
suffering falls in the first half of the year, according to
figures recently released by New Zealand's Audit Bureau of
Circulation.
</P>
<P>
The biggest selling women's magazine, Woman's Day, took a big
hit with sales dropping by more than 17,800 to 171,571 for the six
months to June 30 from 189,398 in the previous six months. But it
still held its number one position.
</P>
<P>
Over the same time, New Zealand Woman's Weekly, the second
top-seller, also suffered a fall of 3,333 to 127,373 from 130,706.
But New Idea gained ground, adding 3,748 sales to take its total
sales to 58,268 from 54,520.
</P>
<P>

at 90,967 for the first half of this year down more than 5,500
from 96,490 in the half-year to December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leading the paid-for monthly magazines is the Sky TV magazine,
SkyWatch, with 225,600 sales in the first half of this year, down
on the 283,000 recorded in the previous six months. Reader's
Digest, with 135,556 sales in the half-year, was down slightly on
the 136,966 in the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Gardener dropped more than 6,500 sales to 70,550
from 77,077. North and South fell slightly to 35,707 from 36,350.
Auckland's Metro magazine dipped by 1,800 to 20,269.
</P>
<P>
Monthly paid-for magazines with rising sales included women's
magazine Next, with sales up nearly 2,000 to 59,369 for the
half-year, and NZ House and Garden, rising by 224 copies to
48,923.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Tony Adams, who criticized
England manager Glenn Hoddle in his new book, said on Wednesday
that he did not mean to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal defender criticised Hoddle for making crucial
mistakes during the World Cup in the serialisation of his
forthcoming book "Addicted" in The Sun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Adams, who will marshall England's defence in their European
championship qualifier against Sweden in Stockholm on
Saturday,said: "I did not want to hurt Glenn Hoddle because I've
got tremendous respect for him.
</P>
<P>
"Take the football away and he's still a great guy. Our
relationship is healthier than it's ever been at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Adams, sitting alongside Hoddle at a press conference near
their training base at Bisham Abbey, added: "The book was
something I needed to do to get things off my chest.
</P>
<P>
"There were also a lot of positives about Glenn Hoddle in the
book -- but people have jumped on the negatives."
</P>
<P>
Adams, the only player in the current squad who played in the
same England team as Hoddle in the 1980s, claims in his book that
Hoddle was wrong to pick Alan Shearer as captain ahead of him,
encouraged Paul Gascoigne to drink before his World Cup axing and
treated senior players like children.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hoddle insisted his relationship with Adams had not
been damaged by the comments in his book.
</P>
<P>
"It is all about opinions and I have got no problem with
that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a problem with me and Tony and as far as
I am concerned there never will be."

<HEADLINE> Media Partners: No Loser in Super League (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Media Partners, the company
behind a proposed European Super League, said on Wednesday that
there would be no losers in his plan to revolutionise the sport
of soccer in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Hecht, a 38-year-old Italian leading the Milan-based
company, spent the day in London giving details of how the new
league will not only satisfy the continent's big clubs but also
pour unprecedented riches into the game.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely nothing harmful for European football in
our proposal -- far from it," local reports quoted Hecht as
saying. "It is a proposal with no losers.
</P>
<P>
"The league is built on a merit concept with 100 percent
ownership in the hands of the clubs, on a similar model to the
English premier league.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally transparent and the benefits are so impressive
-- to all levels of the game -- that football could not be
insensitive to it."
</P>
<P>
Hecht said that competing Super League clubs would receive
about three times as much as they currently get from the
Champions' League and promised huge investment at grass roots
level.
</P>
<P>
After further consultations with the clubs this week, Media
Partners have come up with a revised plan for how the league
would work.
</P>
<P>
It would feature 18 "founder member" clubs, two more than
announced in the original plans.
</P>
<P>
They would be selected on their performance over 10 years and
would be guaranteed a place for three seasons. A further 18(also
up from 16) would be invited to play based on their performance
during the previous season.
</P>
<P>
The 36 teams would be divided into three groups of 12, each
club playing the others once. The top five in each group plus
the sixth placed team with the best record would advance to a
knockout last 16 and on to a one-off final.
</P>
<P>
A secondary competition, the Pro Cup, would involve 96 clubs
from all 51 UEFA countries in a knockout competition. Clubs would
qualify on the basis of domestic league and cup performances.
</P>
<P>
Sixty four clubs would play in an initial round with the 32
winners advancing to play a pre-selected 32 and then straight
knockout.
</P>
<P>
Hecht said the new competitions would be played in midweek to
complement, not replace, the current domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep alive the dream of clubs like Wimbledon,who
can not only dream of making it to the Super League but also of
winning it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This plan makes the dream financially sustainable because the

<HEADLINE> Media Partners: No Loser in Super League (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For that to happen the new league must have the approval of
world and European governing bodies FIFA and UEFA, a scenario
that looks unlikely at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"We want their approval and are seeking to get it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have offered them (UEFA) a regulatory role and really do
not understand why they feel they have to own the competition,"he
added, before warning that if approval was not forthcoming then
he would be happy to follow the alternative route.
</P>
<P>
UEFA have already said they want no part of it and are
planning their own new competition, likely to be based on a
further expansion of the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has threatened to ban Super League clubs from playing in
domestic leagues and ban their players from representing their
countries but Hecht is confident such steps would be illegal
under European Community law.
</P>
<P>
He also said UEFA's current monopoly on selling TV rights
through its own marketing arm would be unlikely to stand up to EC
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"Not a penny has been pledged nor have there been any
negotiations with anyone regarding TV rights.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been far easier for us to have sold everything
in advance to a multi-media giant -- and we had several
approaches -- but that would have delivered the future of the
game to them.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan keeps control with the clubs and the fans and we can
go to the EC and get the exemption we would need as a result of
those benefits."
</P>
<P>
Hecht said Media Partners were able to resist the pressure to
sell the product in advance because of a three billion
U.S.dollars guarantee given by merchant bankers JP Morgan.
</P>
<P>
"They obviously hope they will not have to spend that money
once we have sold the TV rights but it means we can be able to
present to concept to the clubs and offer them control."
</P>
<P>
Hecht, who pioneered digital TV pay-per-view coverage in
Italian soccer, said that that technology would play an important
part of the deal but promised that there would still be plenty to
see without payment.
</P>
<P>
"The semi-finals and final of the league and the entire Pro
Cup will be available free and there will be highlights of the
other games available 30 minutes after they finish," he said.
</P>
<P>
He is meeting the chairmen of the 20 English premier league
clubs on Thursday when he will outline the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
The plan is still for the new league to begin in the 2000/2001
season but Hecht promised there was still ample time for
changes.

further enhance the province's flood control capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The list of projects includes the construction of levees
stretching 1,014 km along the banks of six major rivers. Said
project will be carried out at a cost of 3.6 billion yuan (435
million US dollars). Other projects include a 1,000-km sea wall
enforcement program expected to cost 690 million yuan, a 160
million yuan project to reinforce 220 flood gates and channels,
and 10 medium to large reservoirs which carry and estimated cost
of 1.77 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Internet Child Pornography Ring Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States and 11
other countries have started a battle against child pornography
through Internet and on Wednesday arrested almost four dozens of
suspected members of a ring committing such crime worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The ring, Wonderland Club, was allegedly traded pictures of
children as young as 18 months old over the Internet. It has
exchanged thousands of pornographic images of children via
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
A database of more than 100,000 pornographic photos of children
were uncovered after five months of investigations by the British
National Crime Squad, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
"People try to smuggle in smut just like they try to smuggle
dope across the border and we're ready to pounce on them," said
Dick Weart, a special agent for the U.S. Customs Service, which
carried out 32 raids in 22 U.S. states with the help of state and
local police.
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated boxes of pornography, various software
materials and hardware that were part and parcel of the ring
during the raids, Weart said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 arrests worldwide were made Wednesday, and U.S.
Customs predicted there would be more as officials evaluated the
evidence collected. Hundreds of people are suspected of being
connected with the pornography ring.
</P>
<P>
"The people who exploit children in this way think they can
hide in cyberspace. They are wrong. We will find them and bring
them to justice," U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
The raids occurred in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
To join the child pornography ring, members had to have
multiple images of child pornography, and some had as many as
10,000 pictures, U.S. Customs said. The ring allegedly began in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, code-named "Cathedral," linked members of
the Wonderland Club through the types of images they allegedly
sent to each other.

<HEADLINE> Super League Organisers Reveal More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 132 clubs from all
of UEFA's 51 member countries would take part in a planned
European Super League and associated Pro Cup, according to
proposals announced by the organisers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners, the Milan-based company behind the Super
League plans, said it had met representatives of Europe's leading
clubs on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Its president Rodolfo Hecht said he was confident the new
structure would be in place for the 2000/2001 season.
</P>
<P>
Hecht said in a statement that the league would feature
18"founder member" clubs, two more than announced in the original
plans.
</P>
<P>
They would be selected on their performance over 10 years and
would be guaranteed a place for three seasons. A second division
of 18 (also up from 16) would be invited to play based on their
performance during the previous season.
</P>
<P>
The Pro Cup would involve 96 clubs in a knock-out
competition. Clubs would qualify on the basis of domestic league
and cup performances.
</P>
<P>
Hecht said the new competitions would take place midweek so as
not to interfere with domestic leagues.
</P>
<P>
That would seem feasible only if Media Partners operated
within UEFA's authority or if the European Community outlawed
UEFA or FIFA attempts to ban Super League clubs from playing in
domestic leagues or banned their players from representing their
countries.
</P>
<P>
UEFA and FIFA have both come out firmly against the Media
Partners' plans.

BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The JVC Asian Badminton
Championships entered its second day Wednesday with all star
shuttlers entering the third round.
</P>
<P>
After the 99 matches in the two days, the top 16 players or
pairs for men's singles, ladies' singles, men's doubles and
ladies'doubles have emerged, while the top eight pairs for the
mixed doubles were also decided.
</P>
<P>
China's Sun Jun, No. 1 seed for men's singles and the world's
No. 2, moved one step closer to the championship with a
convincing two-game victory over his opponent, Thushara
Edirisinghe of Sri Lanka, in the third round of men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Other seeds all won easily as their rivals were rather weak.
</P>
<P>
However, the game will be harder on Thursday, the third day of
the five-day events, as some 32 matches will be held to decide
the top four players or pairs in each of the five events, namely
men's singles, ladies' singles, men's doubles, ladies' doubles

<HEADLINE> British Sports Authorities Consider Blood Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British athletics and cycling
chiefs are considering independently to introduce blood test to
find drug abuse in their sports.
</P>
<P>
Dave Moorcroft, the former 5,000 meters world record holder
who now heads the athletics federation, said on Wednesday: "It is
a hugely complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
"But we must explore the possibility of introducing random and
voluntary blood tests, even if it is only initially in the form
of research."
</P>
<P>
British Cycling Federation president Brian Cookson said he had
been "appalled and dismayed" by the scandals surrounding this
year's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Cookson said he intended to call for tougher doping control
measures, including blood tests, at a conference to be staged by
the international cycling body, the UCI, in the Netherlands next
month.
</P>
<P>
Two perfomance-enhancing substances -- Human Growth
Hormone(HGH) and erythropoietin (EPO) -- are now believed to be
in widespread use, mainly because they remain undetectable in
urine tests.
</P>
<P>
EPO, by acting on the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood,is
believed to have become hugely popular in endurance
sports,including cycling, distance running and swimming.
</P>
<P>
"I'm keen to see blood samples introduced, so that we can test
for a range of drugs, not just EPO and growth hormones,"Cookson
said.
</P>
<P>
"With blood tests you get better, more accurate results than
is possible with urine analysis and you are able to detect the
use of masking agents which many people suspect are in use by
steroid takers."

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips and Fails to Continue Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A late selling spree today
cut short the Dow industrial's strive to extend Tuesday's rebound
from August's scary selloff.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, down 512.61 on Monday and up
288.23 Tuesday, fell 45.06 points to close at 7,782.37. The
average of 30 blue chips had been holding onto gains until the
final minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Dow was up as much as 125.13 at 7,952.56, or
44 points above where it began the year, at 7,908.25.
</P>
<P>
Some other major indicators rose, however, including the Nasdaq
composite index, which added to Tuesday's record point gain.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by about a 13-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 891.58 million
shares, down from 1,204.93 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.99 at 990.27, the
NYSE composite index was down 1.30 at 494.63, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index was up 13.93 at 602.61.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 15.41 to
1,590.50.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.21 to 353.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street came roaring back Tuesday with the Dow gaining 288
points, the second-biggest daily point gain ever. The market came
on record trading of more than 1.2 billion shares on the New York
Stock Exchange. Trading was heavy today, but volume of 891.6
million was well below Tuesday's pace, when the Dow gained 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's decline left the Dow 16.7 percent below its record of
9,337.97 set on July 17.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK to Resume Talks on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will resume talks in
New York on Thursday, the State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said DPRK's negotiators, who called
off planned talks in New York on Tuesday while awaiting
instructions from Pyongyang, had agreed to meet with U.S.
officials on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"So we're going to start talks again tomorrow morning," the
official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union
had planned a meeting on Tuesday to discuss how to fund
construction of two nuclear power reactors for the DPRK, but the
meeting was suspended after the DPRK test-fired a new longer-range
missiled over Japanese islands and into the Pacific Ocean on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We were on the verge of doing a burden-sharing agreement but
we felt at this particular time it wasn't the moment to be
moving forward with that particular part of it," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the four partners will "come back to it a little
later when the environment is better."
</P>
<P>
The four partners in KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization) want to see "what comes from these
talks" between the United States and the DPRK, the official
added.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Trade Deficit Is Forecast to Over Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 2 (Xinhua) - Analysts here estimate that
1998 will score for Romania the "sad" record of getting to a
foreign trade deficit of 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance deficit for the first half of this year
stands at 1335.7 million U.S. dollars, which means 24.4 percent
higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production constantly fell, while Romanian
export companies confined themselves to sell low-processed
products. In the meanwhile, the Romanian companies prove to be
unable to face foreign competition and the domestic market is
envaded with much cheaper import products.
</P>
<P>
"The downgrading of Romania's foreign trade is easy to
forecast," the President of Romania's Association of Export and
Import Companies Mihai Ionescu pointed out, adding that the
"Romanian exports quality has seriously degraded".
</P>
<P>
For instance, said Mihai Ionescu, the imbalance between the
cattle export and the beef and beef products one is worth
mentioning. In 1993, Romania exported about 24 thousand head of
cattle, while in 1997, 100 thousand heads, which marks a four-time
increase. Figures show that Romania's exports of fresh beef, which
is the first processing stage, went down from 6,500 tones to 564
tones, over the same period. Besides, this happened in a field
where Romania did have the necessary equipment to process meat so
to get a better price.
</P>
<P>
The same thing occurred also in metallurgy, where the 1997 iron
and steel bars export rose three times against 1993, while the
wire export reached 133 thousand tones at 1997-end, against 58
thousand tones in 1993. In exchange, the export of metal products
with a higher processing stage fell down. The rolled bars exports
slumped from 37 thousand tones to 18 thousand tones, over
1993-1997. The products in the third stage of processing, such as
cookers, television receivers, cars (with an eight-time drop in
exports over 1993-1997), vans.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical industry also registered important losses,
as, while coke, oil, caustic soda and soda ash were quite
successfully sold abroad, the toluene (a most refined product)
exports diminished.
</P>
<P>
The export protection lacks almost totally, Mihai Ionescu says.
Until 1997, there had been a 50 percent cut in the tax on profit,
but it was consequently cancelled. Romania has become Europe's only
country not to have export incentives, Mihai Ionescu added.

<HEADLINE> Senior Kenyan Official Dies in Blazed Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A top Kenyan governmental
official died Wednesday in a mysterious blaze at his Nairobi
home, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kiptanui Sawe, 54, as Permanent Secretary of the
Directorate of Personnel Management at the Office of the
President, was one of Kenya's top three civil servants.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Joan Jebichii, suffered serious burns all over her
body and was admitted to Nairobi Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The couple were trapped in their first floor bedroom when fire
broke out at 5:45 a.m. local time. Neighbors alerted by smoke
billowing from the windows called the police and fire brigade and
then smashed their way into the blazing home through the roof in
a desperate bid to rescue the family.
</P>
<P>
They found Mrs. Sawe clinging to the window grille in the
toilet where she had run for safety.
</P>
<P>
The dead was due to fly out of the country for a meeting on
Tuesday evening but it was rescheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Only the top floor of the home was destroyed in the blaze. The
ground floor remained intact.
</P>
<P>
The couple's only child, 18-year-old Nicholas Sawe, who
returned to Braeburn School in Nairobi on Tuesday had escaped the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what caused the blaze. Fire experts are
investigating," said the police.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi issued a condolence message to
Sawe's family in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sawe, born in 1944, was named as an under secretary in the
Office of the President in June, 1987.
</P>
<P>
In February 1990, he was transferred to the Department of
Dfense as Deputy Secretary, a post he held until January 1997
when he was appointed Permanent Secretary and Director of
Personnel Management.

<P>
(by Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
DURBAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said Wednesday night that
it is rebel forces that should cease fire first.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who is here to attend the 12th Non-Aligned Movement
summit, told reporters that it is "aggressors" who should start
cease-fire first, apparently referring to the rebel forces in the
DRC and the alleged troops from Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Referring to deployment of troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, Kabila insisted that the troops from the three southern
African countries should not be described as foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
"They are not foreign troops. We invited them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when they will leave the DRC, Kabila said: "It all
depends on the situation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kabila also made commitment to hold free and fair
elections by June 1999, despite what he termed as the aggression
of neighboring Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The conflict would not deter his adminsitration's efforts to
rebuild the DRC into a great nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila confirmed that he met United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan here early in the day, but he declined to give any
details about their talks.
</P>
<P>
The DRC president said that he was due to leave for home
Thursday morning.
