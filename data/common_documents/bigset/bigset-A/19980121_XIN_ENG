<HEADLINE> Greece Determined to Extend Territorial Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed its
determination to the extension of its territorial waters beyond
the current six-mile limit despite the increased pressure from
neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas stressed that it had the "inalienable right" to
extend its territorial waters to twelve miles and would do so
whenever it saw fit.
</P>
<P>
Turkey reportedly voiced its opposition to the decision by
Athens to extend its territorial waters on Monday, saying that
such an extension would contravene international law as well as
the spirit of the agreement signed in Madrid last July between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that it was not possible for Turkey to cite
international agreements when Turkey itself now "violates
international law both outside the country and domestically."
</P>
<P>
He added that Athens' choices were in line with with that which
was in force internationally and in this sense there was no
question of "our negotiating with anyone our right to extend our
territorial waters to twelve miles."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A South African
organization grouping motoring broadcasters and journalists
has called on the traffic authorities to sustain a campaign
which has been launched to cut the road deaths toll during
the Christmas holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Department has launched "Arrive Alive" campaign
since October last year. The four-month campaign, designed to be
ended this month, is said to have reduced the road carnage by
about 400 so far.
</P>
<P>
"The sad part is that the campaign is now over and the
situation on our roads is very likely to return to its normal
unacceptable state until the holiday campaign is launched," said
Ian Auret, Chairman of the Committee for Active Road Safety,
today.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to attain success in curbing the carnage on our
roads, a campaign like Arrive Alive needs to be ongoing," Auret
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports by the traffic authorities,
the death toll on South African roads since December 1 last year
had risen to 1021, most of them passengers and pedestrians.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Army Deployed to Quell Riots in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
deployed an unspecified number of army members in Harare
today while others were put on standby to help stop riots which
have been rocking the capital since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa told a press conference
the army will not hesitate to shoot trouble markers.
</P>
<P>
This is not a state of emergency, he said, but a move by the
government to stop further looting and damage to property by
rioters.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts estimated the cost of damage and loss
of property caused by the riots on Monday alone to 70 million
Zimbabwean Dollars (four million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The riots which were mainly confined to high density areas
had spread to low income areas by
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the army is meant to complement the efforts
being made by the police whose 300 support unit members are
battling to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we should take additional measures to control
the rampant looting and hooliganism in the demonstrations, and
because of the deteriorating situation," Dabengwa said.
</P>
<P>
"The army is not trained to use baton sticks, the army carries
guns and live ammunition, and they will not hesitate to shoot any
people who are trouble makers and want to engage in looting," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were sparked by an average
increment of 20 percent on almost all basic commodities with the
private sector blaming the increases on the devaluation of the
Zimbabwean Dollar, high interest and inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Harare's Riots Enter Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The riots in Harare entered the
second day today despite the Zimbabwean government
announced that the price hike of mealie-meal by 21 percent
intended to be effected on Monday had been reversed.
</P>
<P>
The government also said it was going to review prices of all
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The riots were sparked by a recent increment by an
average 20 percent on basic commodities due to the devaluation of
the Zimbabwean Dollar, high interest rates hovering around 41
percent and the high inflation rate which currently is above 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation began relatively quiet today in most suburbs. But by
mid-morning, riots started again in some suburbs particularly
Mbare, the poorest and volatile suburb on the southern edge of
the city centre where rioters continued to battle police and
looted the shops.
</P>
<P>
In other suburbs such as Marren Park and the dormitory town of
Chitungwiza, riots which had died down resumed around mid-morning
today.
</P>
<P>
Riots which had been confined to Harare's high density
suburbs spread to low density areas today, prompting police to
mount a heavy presence on almost all major roads leading into the
city center.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts estimated today that the capital could have
lost 70 million Zimbabwean Dollars (four million U.S. Dollars)
worth of business due to continuing food riots which first broke
out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the city's low-income suburbs, almost all shops were looted
and burnt by angry mobs yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Trade Surplus Surges to Nearly $65 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade surplus surged to
118.6 billion marks (64.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
eleven months of 1997, which was already a new record since the
1990 German reunification, the German Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released the statistics office,
Germany's exports in the first eleven months of 1997 totaled
809.3 billion marks (439.8 billion dollars), up 12.7 percent from
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the country's imports also increased by 10.1 percent
to total of 690.7 billion marks (375.4 billion dollars) during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1997 alone, Germany's exports expanded by 12.4
percent over the level of a year ago to 79.3 billion marks (43
billion dollars) while imports growing by 9.9 percent to 66.2
billion marks (36 billion dollars), so that the country's trade
surplus was 13.1 billion marks (7.1 billion dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
The country's record trade surplus of 134 billion marks was
achieved in West Germany in 1989. After the German reunification,
the largest trade surplus was 107 billion marks in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the latest expansion in trade surplus, Germany's
current account, which includes trade both in goods and services,
also swung back to a surplus of 2.6 billion marks (1.4 billion
dollars) in November from a deficit of 4.4 billion marks (2.4
billion dollars) recorded in October.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first eleven months of 1997 as a whole, the
country's current account deficit was still 8.8 billion marks (4.8
billion dollars).

<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today warned that the government would be forced to
introduce a state of emergency in the country if present food
riots continue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists, Mugabe blamed the riots on the
opposition political parties which he accused of taking advantage
of the current economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
"Those behind the riotous demonstration should be warned that
the government does not want to impose strict rules," he said,
adding that there was no reason for people to resort to
demonstrations in a riotous manner as everyone was affected by
the current economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue this trend we will become a violent nation
and all efforts we have been trying to inculcate to the nation as
values will be lost," he said, adding "we cannot, as government,
allow this to continue. We cannot allow hooliganism to continue."
</P>
<P>
He revealed that his cabinet will be meeting soon to look at
the prevailing situation.
</P>
<P>
The riots started on Monday in Harare in protests against the
steep increases in the prices of basic commodities, which follows
the fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar against other major currencies.
The prices of basic commodities have gone up by an average of 20
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian investors continued to
pour a record amount of money into mutual funds last year despite
market volatility.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure shows that Canadians contributed a record
52.3 billion dollars (36.6 billion USD) in new money in mutual
funds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This has boosted the country's mutual fund industry's assets to
283.2 billion dollars, according to the Investment Funds Institute
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The activity far outpaced the year of 1996, when mutual funds
attracted 41 billion dollars in new money.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, Canadians invested three billions in new
investment in mutual funds despite the Asian financial crisis and
its impact on world market.
</P>
<P>
That was down from November's net sales of 4.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that about 70 percent of the new money
invested in 1997 was put into equity mutual funds, with the
reminder going into bond, money-market and mortgage funds.
</P>
<P>
"Money will continue to flow into mutual funds because there
really isn't another alternative for a return of between eight and
nine percent," a research with the institute was quoted as saying
by reports Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Rules Out Immediate Overall Raise of Welfare Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin Tuesday ruled out an immediate and overall raise of minimum
unemployment aid, because he said the government simply could not
afford it.
</P>
<P>
"All is not possible, immediately," said Jospin when
answering questions at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But Socialist Party officials have hinted that the government
is considering releasing some packages of social aid frozen by the
former rightwing government, and providing three to four billion
francs of emergency aid to long-time unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government is under increasing pressure from the
unemployed, unions, the Communist Party and some other left
parties within the majority for a raise of minimum unemployment
aid, which now stands only at 1,500 francs (300 U.S. dollars) a
month.
</P>
<P>
But the government said it would cost 60 billion francs (10
billion U.S. dollars) and would destroy the budget designed for
joining the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also rejected a request by the unemployed and unions for
a special aid for the young unemployed under 25, which he said
would cost an extra 10 billion francs (167 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We cannot increase the deficit of 70 billion francs... Nor
can we ask the French people to support it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday hoped to make some progress on Middle East peace process
in his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a good-faith, detailed, frank discussion
and do our best to make some progress, and I think we've got the
chance to do that," Clinton said at a photo session with
Netanyahu at the White House before their talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would focus his discussions with Netanyahu on the
peace process that has been deadlocked since last March, and
large part of the discussions would be on Israel's redeployment
at the West Bank in an accordance with Oslo interim agreements
signed in 1993 by the former Israeli Labour government and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington last night, just
repeated his long-standing position, saying any withdrawal of
the Israeli troops from the West Bank should "ensure our
defenses."
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Israeli prime minister would bring a very
modest pullback offer to Clinton, who has been pressuring Israel
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth meeting between Clinton and Netanyahu and
political analysts expected no dramatic breakthrough the meeting
would bring to the currently moribund peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A man accused of helping IRA
bombers launch a mortar attack against Heathrow Airport went on
trial in London on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Gallagher allegedly provided "vital support to the
bombers", but he denies charges of conspiring to cause explosions
and "making a contribution towards acts of terrorism" in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The court heard that the mortar bombs were packed with plastic
explosive but the detonators failed to trigger the blast.
</P>
<P>
However, that was not what IRA commanders had intended to
happen when they gave the orders for three salvoes to be fired,
prosecution lawyer Richard Horwell said.
</P>
<P>
"That they were intended to explode is beyond doubt," he told
Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London.
</P>
<P>
"They were packed with high-performance plastic explosive and
the contained detonators...It is plain that at the very least
widespread destruction to property was intended," Horwell said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Open Lesotho Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will fly to Lesotho on Thursday to inaugurate a
giant water project supplying water to South Africa, the
president's office said today.
</P>
<P>
He will deliver an inaugural address at the ceremony at Muela
in northern Lesotho, and jointly commission the transfer of water
with Lesotho King Letsie III.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho highland water project, which took about 10
billion Rand (2.03 billion U.S. Dollars) and 11 years to
complete, was designed to provide much needed water to South
Africa while benefiting under-developed Lesotho with wanted funds
and hydro-electric power.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Botswana President Sir Ketumile
Masire, and South African and Lesotho Water Affairs Ministers
will also attend the ceremony at the Muela hydro-power complex,
in the heart of the enclave kingdom's mountain foothills.
</P>
<P>
However, Thursday's inauguration is overshadowed by untimely
rainstorms at the site in recent days. Downpours destroyed two
giant marquees intended to house 2,500 guests invited to the
ceremony, left the site ankle-deep in water and flooded the
underground hydro-electric power station.
</P>
<P>
It was somewhat ironical that the water flowing into Gauteng
Province, which usually suffers water shortage and was designed
the major recipient of the project's water, was now unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
As heavy rains unusual for this season of South Africa have
filled most water supply reservoirs of the province, some of the
incoming water is being diverted to other dams and rivers, local
reports said.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Sees Rise in Global Piracy Attacks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of seamen killed last
year in increasingly violent pirate attacks around the world
doubled over the previous year to 51, according to a report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the UK International Maritime Bureau
(IMB), said that there were 229 pirate attacks in 1997, up from
188 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
More pirates are carrying guns and knives, the report said.
Last year, pirates carried guns on 68 occasions, up from 32 times
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It's the brutality of the attacks and the fact that the
pirates are never caught which is causing us concern," said Eri
Ellen, executive director of the IMB.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that more than 400 crew members were taken
hostage during 1997, compared with 194 in 1996, and ships were
fired on 26 times, up from only six times in 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the attacks last year took place in the
following six countries: Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, the
Philippines, Sri Lanka and India.
</P>
<P>
The report urged governments to clamp down on piracy and called
for better policing of the high seas.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- In their first meeting,
Chief United Nations arms inspector Richard Butler and Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz had agreed to hold technical
meetings on missile warheads related issues on the first of
February, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said today.
</P>
<P>
"In their first meeting, Richard Butler and Tareq Aziz
discussed the procedures for the technical evaluation meetings on
the missile warheads, chemical and biological weapons. They agreed
the technical meetings on missile warheads related issues will
take place on the first day of February followed shortly
afterwards by the technical meetings on chemical weapons," Eckhard

Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, indicated that technical experts form China,
France, Russia, Germany, Britain and the United States will
participate in these meetings," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived in Iraq on Monday in a bid to save the
inspection regime which Baghdad had hampered.
</P>

<HEADLINE> GM Staff in Germany Agree to Less Pay to Save Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The 46,800 employees in General
Motors' German subsidiary Opel signed an accord with the company
Tuesday on less pay rise in exchange for no forced layoffs by the
end of 2002, said reports reaching here from Ruesselsheim.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to pay rise 1.25 percent lower than their fellow
workers in other companies for four years from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
In return, Opel is to use no-pain methods to curb 3,000 to
4,000 jobs at its main plant in Ruesselsheim, west of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Workers above the age of 50 will be retired with top-ups to
their pensions contributed by the U.S.-owned company, and
volunteers will b sought for shorter work weeks on reduced pay at
Opel's three plants.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which is expected to save Opel 40 million marks (22
million U.S. dollars) every year, is prompted by recent call by GM
president Louis Hughes for 20 to 30 percent reduction in staff at
GM plants in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's 1998 Deficit Down by 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's parliament Monday
approved the country's 1998 draft state budget which predicts a
deficit of 37 million Jordanian dinars (about 52 million
U.S. dollars), a 34 percent decrease over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 59 out of 74 deputies present voted for the budget
that envisages total revenues at 1.95 billion dinars (about 2.75
billion dollars), a 5 percent increase over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The expenditures are estimated at 1.987 billion dinars (about
2.806 billion dollars), a 4 percent increase over that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan increases spending on education, health
services, social security, tourism, youth and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In the budget for fiscal year 1997, Jordan's revenues stood at
1.86 billion dinars (2.6 billion dollars), expenditures at 1.916
billion dinars (2.7 billion dollars) and deficit at 56 million
dinars (78 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech at the parliament, Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali confirmed that the country's foreign debts
stand at 6.7 billion dinars (9.5 billion dollars) compared with
5.6 billion dinars (8.3 billion dollars) in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the four-day debate of the budget at the
Lower House, deputies blamed the government for the ever larger
population under the poverty line, the increase of unemployment
and the unsuccessful economic reforms and they asked the
government to spare no efforts in solving the issues this year.
</P>
<P>
Poverty rate is now estimated at 30 percent and unemployment
rate ranges from 15 percent at the official level to 27 percent as
calculated by independent institutions.
</P>
<P>
Deputies also claimed that Jordan's commitment to the current
economic reform structured by the International Monetary Fund has
aggravated the problems of social poverty and unemployment.

<HEADLINE> mee012001hke - Khatami Reiterates No Need to Have Ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) - Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has reiterated that there is no need for Iran to resume
ties with the United States since Washington still adopts
hegemonist policies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA Tuesday, Khatami
made the remark Monday night while addressing a large group of
people at the mausoleum of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"Today we do not need to have the United States at our side, we
can go ahead without the help of the United States," he said,
accusing Washington of "behaving like lords of the world and
imposing sanctions on every country."
</P>
<P>
In his first televised speech to the American people as
president on January 8, Khatami said "Iran feels no need to have
diplomatic ties with the U.S." since Washington did not change its
policies towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he called for cultural dialogue between the Iranian
and American nations. His call was interpreted as a goodwill
signal that, if handled well, could lead to a thaw in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Washington welcomed Khatami's signal but call for direct
government-to-government dialogue. And it set as conditions that
Tehran stop "sponsoring international terrorism, seeking weapons
of mass destruction and sabotaging the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, nevertheless, on
Friday ruled out ties between the two governments, saying any
relationship with the U.S. would be harmful to the Iranian nation
and the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei stressed that the Iranian nation would never give up
its values and beliefs under pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khamenei's stance, Khatami also said "We have decided
not to succumb to oppressive pressure and as long as there are
people who apply coercive pressure on others and resort to force,
and as long as there are world powers which seek to base their
relations with other nations on the principle of oppressive
pressure on those nations, they cannot expect anything from the
Iranian nation."
</P>
<P>
He said the fruit of the Islamic Revolution has been Iran's
liberation from the yoke of the U.S. The Iranian people "attained
their lost dignity after paying a very high cost for it and they
would never give it away at any price," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran aims at eliminating tension in the world and
forging relations with world nations on the basis of mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
He further diagnosed the "main reason for Washington's improper
policies as the existence of the Zionist regime (Israel) in the
region" and termed Israel as the main cause of tension in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It is a group of terrorists that want to oppress world nations
and impose their own selfish will, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Exports to Asia Fall in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli exports to the Far
East shrank by 200 million dollars, or 20 percent, in the fourth
quarter last year, largely due to the economic crisis spreading
across Asia, The Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report presented to the Knesset
(Parliament) by the Industry and Trade Ministry as saying that
Israel's exports to Far East last year declined by 1 percent to
3.644 billion dollars from 3.679 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list, food and agriculture exports fell by 22
percent last year, while diamond exports declined 12 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset Economic Committee convened a meeting of trade
officials and Asian diplomats Monday to discuss Israeli-Asian
trade and economic relations in light of the Asian monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Ministry Director-General Dov Mishor told
the meeting that despite the International Monetary Fund speaks
of decreased growth in world trade during 1998, the Israeli
government is still predicting a 9 percent growth in exports to
Asia this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Ambassador to Israel Ronarong Nopakun said he
expected Israeli defense industries to be heavily hit by the
ongoing economic crisis in Asia because some countries lack hard
currency to pay for the purchase of advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturers Association's Textiles Division head Yair
Rotlevy estimated that the Asian crisis could cause Israeli
industry to lose 1 billion dollars in total. He said, to South
Korea alone, Israeli exports could shrink by 260 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Korean bilateral trade topped 700 million dollars in
1996, and was expected to rise to 1 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky urged Israeli
companies not to lose faith in the Asian tigers. He said Israel
would not change policies toward Asia despite the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Trying to allay concerns of Israeli exporters, South Korean
Ambassador Eui Yong Chung also played down the long-term major
impact the Asian crisis might have on Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said, of Israel's 530 million dollar exports to South Korea
in the first 11 months of 1997, about 400 million dollars were
high-tech products exports. The remainder principally comprised
components destined for end products in South Korea and 15 million
dollars in diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any major impact, rather it's a good time for
potential investors from Israel to look at expanding their
interests in the region," Chung said.

<HEADLINE> US Opposes Iranian Involvement in exploiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Commerce William Daley has said that Iran should not be a
cooperation partner in exploiting the Caspian oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Daily News published here
Tuesday, Daley said that Washington takes such a stand because
there are no changes in the policies of the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran continues to support terrorism, development of weapons
of mass destruction and so on," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, accompanied by 64 businessmen, arrived here
Sunday on a four-day visit to Turkey aimed at furthering
U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the energy field.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of energy sources, such as Russia. We do not
see Iran being part of the (Caspian energy) equation," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Daley is conveying to Ankara such
a message that the U.S. administration is opposed to any kind of
energy cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starving country in the oil-rich Middle East
region, Turkey has to import oil and natural gas from neighboring
countries to meet its increasing demands.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has tried to cooperate with Iran in some oil and gas
projects, but it has met sharp criticism from the United States.
</P>
<P>
On which pipeline is the better choice to transport the
Caspian oil, Daley said that the planned Baku-Ceyhan (a southern
Turkish port) pipeline has its advantages.
</P>
<P>
This pipeline will not only help provide energy for Turkey,
but for the rest of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, however, also said that his country is not
against the planned "Blue Stream" pipeline between Russia and
Turkey, which is under the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Turkey agreed in principle to buy the Caspian
oil and natural gas from Russia, annoying the United States, whose
oil companies are involved in the Caspian oil exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Daley and his delegation will leave Turkey on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Creditor Institutions Urged to Cancel Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Archbishop of
Canterbury and Primate of the Church of England, Rev. George
Carey today urged creditor institutions to cancel Africa's heavy
burden of debt.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the diplomatic community at Africa hall here, Carey
said the suffering of the people of Africa is immense and the
west has a moral responsibility to find ways of reducing
substantially the crushing burden of debt which compromises the
economies of entire nations and sends millions to early graves.
</P>
<P>
Carey said more children would die unnecessary deaths before
the year 2000 as a result of the debt crisis that enslaves poor
countries today than were killed in a passage during the infamous
Atlantic slave trade.
</P>
<P>
''In 1997 the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
estimated that 21 million children would die before 2000 unless
the debt crisis is resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''We need to work together to confront the crisis directly and
urgently so that the millennium can truly be seen to be a time
of new beginnings for this great continent of Africa,'' he said,
adding that if there is to be a solution to the problems, it will
eventually come at some moment when creditor institutions finally
agree decisively to forgive debt.
</P>
<P>
The external debt of African countries was 340.5 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 and African countries paid 24 billion US Dollars
in debt servicing in 1996 alone, according to the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Doubts Israeli Withdrawal Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has denied that Syrian pressure prompted Beirut to take a
lukewarm stance toward Israeli offer of conditional withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution (of the U.N. Security Council) is clear. It
calls for an unconditional withdrawal, " Hariri said in an
interview with local newspaper Daily Star published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel is serious about implementing the resolution, then
why attach conditions?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has proposed that
after proper security guarantees from the Lebanese government,
Israel would be willing to implement the U.N. Resolution 425 and
pull out its troops.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks were apparently in response to reports at home
and abroad that Lebanon cannot positively react to the Israeli
offer just because Syria does not allow it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Syria now has 40,000-strong troops in Lebanon. With specially
relations and common interests, the two countries insisted on
holding peace talks with Israel simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that Lebanon has learned lessons from Palestinians'
experience in dealing with Israeliut the current one has to double
the effort to make peace because of a serious credibility crisis,
stemming from its handling of the Palestinian question and its
refusal to honor agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They claim it is difficult to m is not so in Israel's
case," he added.
</P>

Syrian and Lebanese talks with Israel have been frozen since
Netanyahu came into power more than one and a half year ago. The
new Israeli prime minister was accused of refusing to recognize
the previous Labor government's promise to withdraw from Syrian
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that if Israeli withdrawal offer from the south
that has been conveyed though the media is serious, then why
hasn't it been made through proper channels.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had approached the Europeans and the
Americans to inquire whether they were asked to convey a
"concrete proposal" to Beirut, but both denied receiving anything
official.
</P>
<P>
"There is a sponsor for the peace process, the American
sponsor, and any overture has to come through that channel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged Israel to rethink its strategy urgently if it
is serious about continuing the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Tourism Sinks 3 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2.3 million tourists
visited Israel last year, a drop of 3 percent compared to 1996,
according to figures released Tuesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) and Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decline was actually less than what had
been predicted, despite the three major suicide bombings attacks
in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem last year.
</P>
<P>
"The predictions had been for a catastrophe, but after all the
terror attacks this year, the number was more or less the same as
last year," ministry spokeswoman Orly Doron said.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said there had been a major decline in the number of
incoming tourists during the first half of 1996 following a series
of terror bombings launched early that year by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
But this leveled off during the second half of 1996, and the
number of visitors remained stable through last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Civil Aviation Authority found
that there was a 5 percent increase in the number of passengers at
Ben-Gurion Airport last year compared to 1996. This resulted fruthority report'
 that the number of passengers flying
charter lines increased by 17 percent, accounting for a market
share of 18.3 percent for these companies, while scheduled
airlines only increased their load by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Israeli airline EL AL carried 38 percent of all passengers
last year, a drop from 39.6 percent from 1996. The leading
foreign carriers were Turkish Airlines, British Airways,
U.S. Tower Air, Lufthansa of Germany and TWA of the U.S., in that
order, the report added.

mee012007hke -- Lebanese Pound Devaluation Predicted
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Merrill Lynch, one of the
world's leading investment banks, has turned thumbs down to a
strong Lebanese pound, the lynchpin of the Lebanese government's
economic policy, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the firm warned against investing in long-term
Lebanese pound instrumens, saying the Lebanese pound is facing
risks of devaluation in the future if the government does not make
policy adjustmeely in the next three months after Lebanese central bank
reserves were bolstered by a 600 million U.S. dollars capital
injection from Saudi Arabia in December.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is finalizing another 400 million U.S. dollars
deal from the Gulf, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, Antoine Papadopodo, a financial engineer at Lebanon
Invest, a leading Beirut securities firm, downplayed the
likelihood of the currency's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the Lebanese pound would continue to appreciate,
even when most of the world's currencies are succumbing to the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Human Rights Body Condemns Turkish Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Human Rights
Commission (IHRC) Tuesday condemned the closure of the Turkish
pro-Islamic Welfare Party and violation of Turkey's Muslims
rights, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the IHRC termed the closure of Turkish Islamic
party as the most regrettable events in Turkey during the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Constitutional Court Friday closed the Welfare
Party, Turkey's biggest party in the National Assembly led by
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, on charges of violating
the secularist tenets of the Turkish Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish court's rule was considered by mass media here as a
measure against Islamic movement. But the Iranian government has
so far remained silent toward the issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed the hope that the rights of the Turkish
people will be fully preserved immediately.
</P>
<P>
The IHRC was founded in 1995 with the aim of defending the
Iranian government against Western accusation over human rights
issues. After Mohammad Khatami was elected Iranian President in
May 1997, the IHRC has become more active.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Youth Hostile Toward Arabs: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty-four percent of Israeli
youth believe Israeli Arabs should be stripped of at least some
of their rights, said a poll released here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted in early January by the Israel
Geocartography Institute among 400 Israel's high school pupils,
said that "19 percent of the respondents believe the Israeli
Arabs endanger the state security and should therefore be
expelled from Israel."
</P>
<P>
Among all the respondents, 18 percent said "the Israeli Arabs'
rights should be taken away because they do not serve in the
defense forces," while seven percent said "the Israeli Arabs do
not deserve to have equal rights in a Jewish state."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two percent said they believe Israeli Arabs should have
equal rights, but 24 percent of them made this conditional on
their serving in the defense forces, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Abuav, head of the committee which commissioned the
poll, said the findings should serve as a warning to the
educational system in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The poll has caused angry reaction from Tourism Minister
Moshe Katsav, who on Tuesday described it as a racist attitude
toward Israeli Arabs, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his anger and concern for this kind of attitude,
Moshe said the Israeli Arabs are equal citizens.

<HEADLINE> UAE Says It Supports UN Ban on Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) remained firmly committed to the U.N. ban on smuggling of
Iraqi oil, the UAE's WAM news agency quoted a senior official as
saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been implementing the decisions taken last year
which provide for confiscating any vessel breaking the U.N. ban,
UAE's Minister of Sate for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan told WAM.
</P>
<P>
"We have already confiscated six vessels, whose shipments
were sold and the proceeds were credited to a special account,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE Authorities will not be lax in implementing these
measures and ensuring full compliance with the U.N. resolutions,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The statement came days after an oil barge sank off the UAE
coastline on January 7. The 11-member crew of the ill-fated
vessel were suspected of smuggling oil from iraq.
</P>
<P>
The crew members, including the Iraqi captian, an Egyptian
sailor and eight Philippine seamen are now kept in police custody
pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was banned from freely exporting oil after the
U.N. decided to impose economic sanctions against Baghdad for its
1990's invasion of kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Though Iraq was allowed to sell a limited number of oil worth 2
billion dollars every six months to get food and medicines in a
deal with the U.N. signed in 1996. But oil exports from Iraq are
strictly supervised by the U.N..

BAGHDAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Tuesday held talks with U.N. chief arms inspector
Richard Butler on Iraq's relationship with U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Both sides put forward their views on the topics under
consideration and agreed to hold a number of technical assessment
meetings starting from early next month, Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
These meetings, which are due to be attended by experts from
the five U.N. Security Council permanent member states, in
addition to experts from Germany and some UNSCOM members, will
deal with two main topics, namely, missile heads and the VX
element, a chemical composition.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Butler held the first session of talks Monday evening
and are due to hold a third one Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua correspondent learned that Butler, who arrived here

<HEADLINE> Oman Calls for Urgent Oil Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Oman has called on the
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to hold an urgent
meeting of oil ministers to discuss the issue of oil price slump
in the world market, the Omani News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a meeting of GCC oil ministers to coordinate
stands to face the decline of the global oil price, and discuss
the best way to support the price and avert negative effects on
our economies," Omani Minister of Oil and Gas Mohammed al-Ramhi
said in an appeal to GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's members need to adopt a common strategy to help
shore up the oil price, which is falling drastically, he said.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil in world market has dropped to about 15 U.S.
dollars a barrel in recent weeks, the lowest level since mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
Oil Experts here have attributed the drop to the declined
demand of East Asia due to the current financial crisis, an
unusually warm winter in the northern hemisphere, the return of
Iraq to the oil market and the increase of output ceiling decided
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last November.
</P>
<P>
The economy of GCC states, namely Oman, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, is seriously
reliant on oil exports, which account for nearly two thirds of
their annual revenues.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel Enhances Commercial, Trade Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Facing a collective economic
block by Arab neighbors, Israel has been enhancing commercial and
trade links with Cyprus, an island country just 400 kilometers
away across the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade stood at about 1 billion U.S. dollar in
1996, Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday, citing latest official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus exported a total of 15 million Cyprus pounds (about 30
million U.S. dollars) of goods to Israel in 1996, in variety of
fish, animal and vegetable fats, gypsum, fruit juice, tobacco
products, pharmaceutical products, plastics and plastic articles.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports to Israel recorded a 35 percent increase in
the two years of 1995 and 1996 and re-exports an impressive 75
percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israeli exports to Cyprus in 1996 reached 31 million pounds
(about 62 million dollars), including petroleums, chemicals,
machinery and plastics.
</P>
<P>
In the field of tourism, Cyprus has become a very popular
holiday destination for the Israelis and in 1997 more than 50,000
Israelis visited the island.
</P>
<P>
Louisa Varaclas, Director of the Cyprus Tourism Organization
(CTO) office in Tel Aviv, was quoted as saying that "Israelis like
travelling and although prices in Cyprus are not very cheap,
compared to other nearby destinations, they are prepared to pay
the extra cost for quality tourism."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency also quoted Cyprus' Commercial Attache in
Tel Aviv Eleni Pitsillides as saying that Cyprus' trade office in
Tel Aviv and exchange of visits by businessmen and trade ministry
officials have contributed a great deal toward increase trade.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been confronting an economic block by Arabs in
protest against its occupation of their lands for decades. Cyprus
and Israel signed in 1994 a general trade agreement to promote
bilateral trade and facilitate participation in each other's
fairs.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM on US Attitude Toward Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioanuis Kasoulides said Tuesday that the U.S. is now convinced
that the settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem will bring
stability to the region and improve Greco-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides was commenting on statements made by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in a recent interview, during which
she pledged to press on with efforts to improve ties among Greece,
Turkey and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Albright was quoted as saying that the U.S. is concerned about
Greek-Turkish maneuvering in the Aegean and about the lack of
progress toward the settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will keep Richard Holbrooke, who was appointed last
year as U.S. Presidential Special Emissary for Cyprus, on the job,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides noted that the present situation in the Eastern
Mediterranean "has already convinced the U.S. for the need of a
Cyprus settlement, which will bring stability to the region and
mainly improve relations between Greece and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Manolis Christofides Tuesday
told his daily press briefing that Albright's statement reassured
that the Cyprus issue remains a priority of U.S. diplomacy and
that progress toward a settlement should be made.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey landed its troops and took over
the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Somalia Enters New Phase of Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul Meguid Tuesday said Somalia has already started a new
phase toward restoring security and stability after long years of
crisis and difficulties, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between the Somali faction leaders and Arab
Seven-man Committee in charge of following up the Somali crisis
here, Abdul Meguid said economic aid requested by the Somalis
should not become an obstacle to efforts to restore unity and
stability in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He added that some Arab states have offered assistance via the
league to meet the Somali demand.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting covered the latest developments in Somalia
after the Somali factions signed a reconciliation agreement, he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
After months of Egyptian brokerage, warring Somali factions
signed an agreement in Cairo on December 22, 1997 to end conflicts
and form a federal government in the Horn of Africa state for the
first time in more than six years of clan war.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo agreement calls for Somalia's independence,
integrity and security as well as holding a national
reconciliation conference in the central Somali city of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader said the agreement has won the support of the
Seven-man Committee, which is composed of Egypt, Libya, Sudan,
Tunisia, Yemen, Mauritania and Djibouti. The permanent delegates
of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the Arab League attended Tuesday's
committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Two Arab League officials will accompany the Somali leaders to
Mogadishu on Thursday to discuss ways to implement the Cairo
agreement, said Abdul Meguid. He called it "premature" to discuss
dispatching an Arab force to secure the convocation of the Somali
reconciliation conference next month.
</P>
<P>
The 465-member conference, the biggest gathering of warring
factions in years, is supposed to set up a 13-member Presidential
Council to select a president and a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Somali faction leaders began talks in Cairo on November 12 to
try to find a solution to their conflicts. At least three previous
agreements on ending the fighting, including the one signed in
Cairo on May 29, have proved unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 300,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Forms Special Team to Investigate Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has appointed a special
team to investigate the murder of six Iraqis and two Egyptians in
Amman, a Jordanian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The team has found two cars in the suburb of the capital, which
are suspected to be used by the murderers, Jordanian Minister of
State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe told reporters after a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that a diplomatic license has been found in one of the
cars, but he declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
The victims, allegedly killed by four to five people with Iraqi
accent early Sunday, include Hikmet Al-Hijo, charge d'affaires at
the Iraqi Embassy in Jordan and an Iraqi millionaire who is
believed to have done business for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe disclosed that an Iraqi delegation arrived here Monday
to look into the case. But he said that the delegation will not
participate in the investigation carried out by the Jordanian team.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials have claimed that Iraqi opposition was
involved in the assassination, which has been denied by Al Wefaq
or the Iraqi National Accord, a major Iraqi opposition movement in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Iraq became tense after Iraq
executed four Jordanians on charge of smuggling car parts last
December. Jordan recalled the charge d'affaires at its embassy in
Baghdad and expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
However, ties improved in late December after Iraq renewed
an agreement to sell oil to Jordan at prices below market levels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes "Sizable" Pullback by Israel from West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
called for a "sizable and credible" pullback by Israel from the
West Bank so that the peace process in the Middle East could be
pushed forward, State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would put
forward to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during
their 90-minute talks, which was a meeting separate from the one
between President Bill Clinton and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that it needs to take place in a way that it
is credible, that the size needs to be significant," Rubin said,
but he provided no details of the scope the United States has in
mind.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the size the United States has demanded was
believed to be about 12 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But what Netanyahu could offer to Clinton during their
one-hour talks might be 9 percent of the land, far away from the
demand of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, who has insisted
on 80 or 90 percent of the territory, and also half of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Netanyahu, Clinton indicated he was not
planning to pressure the Israeli leader on the issue of
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we ought to talk about is what both sides can
do now," he said at a photo session with Netanyahu, who arrived
in Washington last night to present his modest pullback offer.
</P>
<P>
His possible 9 percent pullback of the West Bank certainly
falls short of the Clinton administration's goal, not to say the
demand of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will have "a detailed, frank, good
discussion" with the Israeli leader, "We are going to work hard
to make progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth time that Clinton met with Netanyahu.
Clinton, claiming to be the sponsor of the Middle East peace
process, has not been very happy with Netanyahu constantly
turning a deaf ear to U.S. repeated warning over Israel's moves
that were in contradiction with Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
has suspended for over ten months because of Israel's decision to
build Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem and refusal to
withdraw from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After failures of U.S. mediations by its envoy Dennis Ross
and Albright, Clinton has to come out to deal directly with
Netanyahu and Arafat, whom Clinton will meet on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Banker Hails Success in Fiscal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Central Bank Governor
Paul Ogwuma said today the positive macro-economic development the
country witnessed between 1995 and 1997 is attributable to a
combination of fiscal discipline on the part ofs of one billion
Naira (about 13 million U.S. Dollars), the first time in several
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
A larger surplus of 37 billion Naira (about 463 million
Dollars) was recorded in 1996 while that of 33 billion Naira
(about 413 million Dollars) was achieved in 1997, the governor
told a policy seminar on the 1998 budget held here.
</P>
<P>
"Inflationary pressures moderated significantly from a high of
72.8 percent in 1995 to 29.3 percent in 1996 and 8.5 percent in
1997, while reasonable stability was achieved in interest and
exchange rates," he added.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the governor said, the growth of real gross
domestic product improved from 2.2 percent in 1995 to 3.3 percent
in 1996 and 3.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the efforts by the Central Bank to maintain
monetary stability has strongly complemented the government
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Apex Bank would continue to make its best
endeavors to ensure the price and exchange rate stability were
maintained this year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government efforts to tighten fiscal
discipline, 26 local distressed commercial and merchant banks
have been closed down in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the start of the liquidation process, Ogwuma said
in the capital Abuja Monday that the liquidation of distressed
banks will enhance restoration of full viability and confidence
in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The governor also announced that the closed banks have been
put under police protection to prevent the loss of any
properties.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to sanitize the banking system, Nigeria shut down 282
ailing community banks in one operation last November.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program has commended Tanzania's efforts in
developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Tanzanian government's efforts in reviving the economy

crisis in Dar es Salaam last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Province Wants Cigarette Poison Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of British
Columbia (B.C.) has said that it wants cigarettes sold there to
have a detail list of poisons and health hazards on their
packages.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to this effect will be introduced soon, B.C. Health
Minister Joy MacPhail has announced.
</P>
<P>
The proposal represents the strongest warning in Canada and
perhaps the world, according to the country's leading newspaper
the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
The list of diseases attributed to smoking include lung, month
and throat cancer, heart disease, cataracts, stomach ulcers, skin
damage and others.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers can get more information from a can of insect killer
that they do from cigarettes. There is something terribly wrong
with this picture and B.C. is going to make it right," the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation to impose the new labeling
requirements goes far beyond warnings required on cigarette
packages by Canada's federal government.
</P>
<P>
Under the federal law, Canadian-made cigarette packages must
devote about one-third of the main panels to one of the several
health warnings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the B.C. government hired a law firm to
launch a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry for
health-related damages.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that cigarette smoking costs B.C. taxpayers 1.5
billion dollars (1.1 billion USD) and caused about 6,000 deaths
each year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Tourism Sinks 3 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2.3 million tourists
visited Israel last year, a drop of 3 percent compared to 1996,
according to figures released Tuesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) and Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decline was actually less than what had
been predicted, despite the three major suicide bombings attacks
in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem last year.
</P>
<P>
"The predictions had been for a catastrophe, but after all the
terror attacks this year, the number was more or less the same as
last year," ministry spokeswoman Orly Doron said.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said there had been a major decline in the number of
incoming tourists during the first half of 1996 following a series
of terror bombings launched early that year by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
But this leveled off during the second half of 1996, and the
number of visitors remained stable through last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Civil Aviation Authority found
that there was a 5 percent increase in the number of passengers at
Ben-Gurion Airport last year compared to 1996. This resulted from
a drop of 4 percent in the number of foreign arrivals and an
increase by 10 percent of Israelis travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
The authority reported that the number of passengers flying
charter lines increased by 17 percent, accounting for a market
share of 18.3 percent for these companies, while scheduled
airlines only increased their load by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Israeli airline EL AL carried 38 percent of all passengers
last year, a drop from 39.6 percent from 1996. The leading
foreign carriers were Turkish Airlines, British Airways,
U.S. Tower Air, Lufthansa of Germany and TWA of the U.S., in that
order, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Pound Devaluation Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Merrill Lynch, one of the
world's leading investment banks, has turned thumbs down to a
strong Lebanese pound, the lynchpin of the Lebanese government's
economic policy, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the firm warned against investing in long-term
Lebanese pound instrumens, saying the Lebanese pound is facing
risks of devaluation in the future if the government does not make
policy adjustment.
</P>
<P>
However, the report recommended investing in short-term
Lebanese treasury bills only, noting that devaluation was
unlikely in the next three months after Lebanese central bank
reserves were bolstered by a 600 million U.S. dollars capital
injection from Saudi Arabia in December.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is finalizing another 400 million U.S. dollars
deal from the Gulf, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, Antoine Papadopodo, a financial engineer at Lebanon
Invest, a leading Beirut securities firm, downplayed the
likelihood of the currency's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the Lebanese pound would continue to appreciate,
even when most of the world's currencies are succumbing to the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> 2,372 Drug Traffickers Netted in Nigeria in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's drug control agency
announced today it arrested 2,372 suspects carrying hard drugs
last year, up from 1,187 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,683.12 kg of hard drugs were caught with the
suspects in 1997, a slight drop from 19,834.26 kg in 1996, the
National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to NDLEA chairman Maj.-Gen. Musa Bamaiyi, the 1997
arrests can be broken down into 2,143 persons for Indian
hemp-related offenses and 129 for illegal involvement with
psychotropic substances.
</P>
<P>
The other 60 and 40 persons were arrested for trafficking in
heroin and cocaine respectively, the chairman said at a news
briefing in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi said in 1997 heroin seizure accounted for 10.49 kg, a
drop from 19.37 kg in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Trafficking in cocaine would have continued to decline but for
30.51 kg intercepted when nine suspects tried to bring the drug
into Nigeria through neighboring Niger, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, once regarded as a drug transshipment center in west
Africa, has witnessed an increasing number of addicts of drugs,
mainly Indian hemp.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Textile Industry to Face Fierce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's weaving industry is to
face fierce competition from foreign textiles which are at low
prices as the country lifted a ban on import of textile products
this month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt lifted the ban on January 1 to comply with World Trade
Organization (WTO) regulations, causing fear among local producers
that the move will expose them to unfavorable competition.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said the producers
have already been cautioned to strengthen their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned textile firms that they must develop production
so that they can compete internationally, but they are still
slow," Mubarak said on television recently. "We are not going
to protect the industry forever."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed belief that the Egyptian textile
industry is able to stand up to foreign competition after the
country opens its market.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, one of Egypt's major foreign currency
earner, is witnessing low-level competitiveness due to higher
cotton price and lack of renovation.
</P>
<P>
The volume of textile exports slumped to 2.5 billion Egyptian
pounds (740 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 from 3 billion pounds
(880 million dollars) in 1995, according to a report by the
Egyptian Committee of Industrial Production and Energy.
</P>
<P>
But economists say that the industry will have a better future,
if it can get high-quality cotton and skilled labor, and lower its
cost.
</P>
<P>
When the Egyptian government lifted the ban on importing
textiles, it imposed an import tariff of 54 percent on textiles,
which is in line with WTO regulations allowing its members to levy
a 60 percent of tariff to be reduced by 3 percent a year from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO accord that took effect three years ago,
signatory members agreed to phase out all forms of restrictions
and barriers to open up their markets to foreign products.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Install 2.8 Million Phones in 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- About 2.8 million new
phone lines would be installed in South Africa in the next five
years in one of the world's fastest telecommunications roll-out
programs, South African Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo
said today.
</P>
<P>
The new lines included 1.2 million pay-phones and 1.6 million
new lines in under-serviced areas, bringing telephone penetration
in economically qualified households in all provinces to over 50
percent, South African Press Association quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Schools, clinics, libraries, community centers and small
villages would be the priorities of the program, Naidoo said at
the launch of a digital enhanced cordless telecommunications
network at Sandfontein in North-West Province.
</P>
<P>
"According to our program, around 55 percent of these priority
customers will be connected within three years and 80 percent of
the small villages within four years," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 community telephones had been installed and
more than 172 villages connected over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
A telephone service could allow the government to introduce
new services, such as distance learning and the Internet, to
remote parts of the country at an affordable cost, bringing power
of communication and knowledge there, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
North-West Premier Popo Molefe said at the launch that
effective communications systems were the key to the development
of any geographical area.
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa wishes to be globally competitive, it needs
to revolutionize its communications networks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those historically forgotten people under apartheid were for
the first time being exposed to the benefits of mass and
individual communications systems, which would open a whole new
world to them, Molefe said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's 1998 Deficit Down by 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's parliament Monday
approved the country's 1998 draft state budget which predicts a
deficit of 37 million Jordanian dinars (about 52 million
U.S. dollars), a 34 percent decrease over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 59 out of 74 deputies present voted for the budget
that envisages total revenues at 1.95 billion dinars (about 2.75
billion dollars), a 5 percent increase over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The expenditures are estimated at 1.987 billion dinars (about
2.806 billion dollars), a 4 percent increase over that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan increases spending on education, health
services, social security, tourism, youth and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In the budget for fiscal year 1997, Jordan's revenues stood at
1.86 billion dinars (2.6 billion dollars), expenditures at 1.916
billion dinars (2.7 billion dollars) and deficit at 56 million
dinars (78 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech at the parliament, Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali confirmed that the country's foreign debts
stand at 6.7 billion dinars (9.5 billion dollars) compared with
5.6 billion dinars (8.3 billion dollars) in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the four-day debate of the budget at the
Lower House, deputies blamed the government for the ever larger
population under the poverty line, the increase of unemployment
and the unsuccessful economic reforms and they asked the
government to spare no efforts in solving the issues this year.
</P>
<P>
Poverty rate is now estimated at 30 percent and unemployment
rate ranges from 15 percent at the official level to 27 percent as
calculated by independent institutions.
</P>
<P>
Deputies also claimed that Jordan's commitment to the current
economic reform structured by the International Monetary Fund has
aggravated the problems of social poverty and unemployment.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for End to Violence in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today called
for help from the world community, vowing to make "every
endeavor" to ensure that the escalating violence in Rwanda was
brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
The South African Foreign Ministry reiterated in a statement
its concern over the escalating violence in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven people were reportedly killed and 30 others
injured in violent attacks in the past two days in northwestern
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses claimed that members of Rwanda's former Hutu army
and the extremist Interahamwe Youth Militia were responsible for
an early-morning attack on a bus-load of workers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said the assailants ordered passengers on the bus to
divide themselves on ethnic lines into Hutus (the majority group
in Rwanda) and Tutsis. When the workers refused, the attackers
opened fire and set the vehicle on fire.
</P>
<P>
The South African government condemned such acts of senseless
violence in the strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
"It calls on the people of Rwanda and the international
community to isolate and refrain from assisting those involved in
such acts of violence and to ensure that they are brought to
justice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
There was also a danger that the situation in Rwanda might
deteriorate to the point where the violence would again spill
over into neighboring countries, given that conflicts in the
region were closely interlinked, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
"It (South Africa) therefore appeals to the international
community to assist the Rwandan government in bringing the
violence to an end and constructing a democratic Rwanda in which
all its citizens can live in peace and harmony," the statement
added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel Enhances Commercial, Trade Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Facing a collective economic
block by Arab neighbors, Israel has been enhancing commercial and
trade links with Cyprus, an island country just 400 kilometers
away across the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade stood at about 100 million U.S. dollars in
1996, Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday, citing latest official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus exported a total of 15 million Cyprus pounds (about 30
million U.S. dollars) of goods to Israel in 1996, in variety of
fish, animal and vegetable fats, gypsum, fruit juice, tobacco
products, pharmaceutical products, plastics and plastic articles.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports to Israel recorded a 35 percent increase in
the two years of 1995 and 1996 and re-exports an impressive 75
percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israeli exports to Cyprus in 1996 reached 31 million pounds
(about 62 million dollars), including petroleums, chemicals,
machinery and plastics.
</P>
<P>
In the field of tourism, Cyprus has become a very popular
holiday destination for the Israelis and in 1997 more than 50,000
Israelis visited the island.
</P>
<P>
Louisa Varaclas, Director of the Cyprus Tourism Organization
(CTO) office in Tel Aviv, was quoted as saying that "Israelis like
travelling and although prices in Cyprus are not very cheap,
compared to other nearby destinations, they are prepared to pay
the extra cost for quality tourism."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency also quoted Cyprus' Commercial Attache in
Tel Aviv Eleni Pitsillides as saying that Cyprus' trade office in
Tel Aviv and exchange of visits by businessmen and trade ministry
officials have contributed a great deal toward increase trade.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been confronting an economic block by Arabs in
protest against its occupation of their lands for decades. Cyprus
and Israel signed in 1994 a general trade agreement to promote
bilateral trade and facilitate participation in each other's
fairs.

<P>
Last year, a total of 229,147 existing houses were sold in the
country's 25 major markets, up 3.7 percent from 1996, the reports

<P>
The big engines of growth were Calgary, Toronto and Montreal,
which saw sale increases of 21.3 percent, four percent and 12.6
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country's housing market is expected to hold steady in 1998

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The ECOWAS Ad-Hoc Committee on
Monetary Questions is to meet early next month to review issues
connected with the implementation of the ECOWAS travelers cheque.
</P>
<P>
The committee is working toward a single currency for the
sub-region by the year 2000, one of the main objectives of the
16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) set
to lead to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The committee would evaluate the reservations of some member
states which stalled last month's launching of the scheme, said
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Central Banks of eight Francophone member states -- Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Niger, Mali, Senegal
and Togo -- frustrated the December 4 launching at the last
minute, insisting other member states, including Liberia, pay up
arrears owed them before the take-off.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the involvement of commercial banks,
preferably Ecobank, in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
But Kouyate dismissed the later request, pointing out that the
Southern African Development Commission had implemented a similar
scheme with the inspiration of ECOWAS without such involvement.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the February 6 meeting in Abuja will find
solutions to these problems," added the former United Nations
official, who became the scribe of the sub-regional economic bloc
at the ECOWAS summit last August.
</P>
<P>
The ad-hoc committee is made of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali,
Nigeria and Togo.

Moussa Tuesday received two phone calls from U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine on the latest Mideast peace developments.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described the two conversations as having covered
"extremely important topics" and that he kept Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat updated.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, at the end of his two-day visit to Egypt, left here
Tuesday morning for Paris to drum up support of the European
leaders before his meeting Thursday with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington in a make-or-break attempt to save the
faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday in the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Arab and European countries display considerable interest in
the peace drive developments and hope the Washington meetings
would come up with results likely to get the peace train back on
track," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"Albright assured me that the U.S. would be quite serious
during the Washington meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu and that
the American stance would be crystal-clear toward the current
peace conditions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disputed the idea of crafting a new agreement between
the Palestinians and Israelis, saying that "there is only one Oslo
(convention) and there is no amendments thereto."
</P>
<P>
"Oslo (convention) is Oslo: You can either take it all or leave
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy has paralyzed the peace drive, said Moussa,
calling on the U.S. to give a push to the talks on the Palestinian
track on the bases of land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
"Although all indicators are pessimism-inspiring about the
Israeli stance, we still cherish the hope that the American stance
would rescue the peace drive and face up to the Israeli
expansionist policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reportedly wants Israel to withdraw from more West
Bank territory and freeze Jewish settlements, and wants the
Palestinians to crack down harder on violence as a prelude to
jump-starting talks on a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his Cairo visit, the Palestinian leader warned
that if the peace process failed, the Palestinians would be open
to all options, including a return to Palestinian uprisings in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has helped mediate between Israelis and the
Palestinians, has repeatedly urged the Clinton administration to
force its Israeli ally to honor the signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab officials and commentators see the talks in
Washington as a last chance to break the 10-month-old impasse and
demand that Washington induce Israel to modify its hard line
policy on peace.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Begins Debate on 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Tuesday
began a debate on the 1998 budget, which a number of parliament
members (MP) have vowed to vote against due to two contentious
topics.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget proposes that road taxes and car registration
fees be increased by six times as much as the existing level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it outlines a plan to issue treasury bonds of up to
2 billion U.S. dollars abroad to cover internal debt, which has
reached 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two proposals are aimed at keeping the 1998 budget deficit
below 40 percent to avoid last year's deficit of 59 percent, 22
percent higher than the expected.
</P>
<P>
But they have sparked strong criticism from opposition and
independent deputies.
</P>
<P>
MP and former prime minister Salim Hoss said issuing bonds
abroad will bring about negative results, and that increasing car
registration fees will widen the gap between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his readiness to vote against the budget.
</P>
<P>
MP Sami al-Hatrib criticized the government for spending money
only in the construction of airport or news conference center,
instead of improving people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
He said issuing the bonds can not radically improve the
money-strapped economic situation.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Exports in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian exports set a record
last November rising by 1.5 percent to 25.6 billion Canadian
dollars (16.6 billion U.S. dollars), Statistics Canada said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 0.9 percent decline, imports remained near record
levels at 24.5 billion Canadian dollars (17.8 billion
U.S. dollars), the agency said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Canada's trade balance rose to 1.03 billion
dollars (750 million U.S. dollars) from 432 million Canadian
dollars (315 million U.S. dollars) in October.
</P>
<P>
In November, Canada exported more industrial goods, forest
products and consumer goods, and less machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The strong performance of industrial goods exports in November
was due to a jump in exports of precious metal (gold), mostly to
Hong Kong," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
On the import front, Canada bought from its trade partners less
machinery and equipment, automobile products and industrial goods,
which were the main factors for the 0.9 percent slide.

MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An European Basketball Super
League, Europe's equivalent of the NBA tournament, will be set up
on the turn of the century to challenge its much successful
American counterpart, according to reports from the Russian-Tasse
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Basketball Federation (FIBA)
announced on Wednesday that they are set to transform the current
EuroLeague into a more appealing one which could attract bigger
money and larger following crowds.
</P>
<P>
Major European basketball clubs leaders will meet at the FIBA
Headquaters in Munich, German on January 23 to discuss the
proposal and form a working pannel to handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
Under the FIBA's plans, a total of 24 clubs from 12 countries
will make up the Super EuroLeague competitors, with each country
not able to send more than two teams.
</P>
<P>
Country's records at the major European tournaments will decide
the qualifying berths while a soft policy will apply to the
underdog countries which have strong economic background such as
the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, FIBA said.
</P>
<P>
FIBA believe those countries will pump more money into the game
when the traditional powerhouses such as Italy, Spain and Turkey
have hit their balance sheet break-even point.

<HEADLINE> Greece Wants Committees of Experts to Continue with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said today that Athens wanted the Greek-Turkish
committees of experts to continue their contact conditionally.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pangalos said that his country
would put forward the issue of the committees of experts at next
Monday's General Affairs Council, underlining that Greece believed
the process should continue under two conditions, namely the
preservation of its European Dimension and the need for
encouraging signs from Turkey regarding a meeting between the
members of the two countries which would be "of a procedural
nature."
</P>
<P>
He complained that from the beginning, Greece insisted that the
experts should focus on the procedural aspect of differences
between the two countries, but Turkey wanted "substantial talks on
all issues."
</P>
<P>
It was very important for the two countries to agree on the way
in which each dispute would be settled in the event that they
disagreed during their talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the European Union (EU), Greece and Turkey set
up the committees of experts in May last year in order to review
procedural aspects of efforts to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The committees of experts had exchanged memorandums and replies
through the EU, But, in fact, the contact between the committees
has been frozen following the deterioration of Greek-Turkish
relations late last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also stressed that Turkey should have
recourse to the international court at the Hague if it questioned
the ten-mile limit of Greek air space.
</P>
<P>
As for the extension of Greece's territorial waters from the
current six to twelve miles, he said that Greece had the right to
do so in accordance with the provisions of the law of the Sea
Convention, but Greece would do it "in a responsible manner as a
major sea power."

<HEADLINE> IBM Earnings Jump in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- World giant computer maker
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) posted a 3.3 growth in
revenue and a 4.09 percent jump in net income in 1997, according
to figures released by the company on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue stood at 78.5 billion U.S. dollars against 75.95
billion dollars for 1996, while net income reached 6.1 billion
dollars compared to 5.86 billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
IBM chief executive officer Louis Gerstner called the results
"especially satisfying" in the face of a negative currency impact
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue in 1997 rose 3.6 percent to 23.7 billion
dollars from 23.1 billion dollars a year earlier, IBM interim
chief financial officer Lawrence Ricciardi said after the New
Stock Exchange closed on Tuesday..
</P>
<P>
The computer-services business was again IBM's growing
engine, with revenue up 18 percent to 5.9 billion dollars in the
fourth quarter, while computer hardware sales fell 1 percent to
11.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ricciardi said North American sales of IBM products were up 9
percent, but European sales fell 4 percent and the Asia Pacific
market was flat at 4.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
IBM estimated that the Asian financial crisis caused it a 10
percent revenue loss in the region in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
IBM computer sales slowed down in Japan, but Australia and
China remained strong markets, Ricciardi said.
</P>
<P>
IBM's first quarter profit in 1998 is expected to fall short of
a year ago because of the continued negative impact of s strong
dollar and weak market in some Asian countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Nail Down New Airport Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) --- A scheme of airport charges
for the newly built Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap
Kok will be gazetted on Friday, the Airport Authority (AA)
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will comprise three charges -- a landing charge, a
parking charge and a terminal building charge (TBC), said the AA,
which is responsible for the construction and operation of the
Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok. The new airport
is scheduled to go into operation on July 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The charges represent, in aggregate, an increase of about 20
percent over those at Hong Kong's existing international airport
at Kai Tak, said a press release by the AA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In determining the structure of these charges, the AA has taken
 care to ensure that charges are simple, non-discriminatory and
based on "user pays" principle, and that they are comparable with
those at other major international airports.
</P>
<P>
Capable of running round the clock in all weather, the new
airport will provide greater capacity and operational flexibility,
 and a wider choice of world-class facilities than Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
The AA estimates that the total revenue from airport user
charges for the financial year 1998-1999 will account for 37
percent of its total commercial and aeronautical revenue.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion compares favorably with many other
international airports in the world," said the authority. The
average proportion was 64 percent for Asian airports, 44 percent
for Pacific airports, and between 50 and 60 percent for airports
in other regions, according to a survey conducted by the Airport
Council International in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The AA held eight rounds of consultations with local and
international airlines and freight operators during the period of
devising the scheme between February 1996 and October
1997.

<HEADLINE> Conditions Will "Kill" 53,000 S.Korean Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 21 (Xinhua) -- About 53,000 South Korean
companies will go bankrupt or out of business this year because of
high market interest rates and low economic growth imposed on the
country as a result of its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a report on Wednesday, the Korea Institute of Finance
predicted that the country's economy will grow by 0.7 percent this
year, falling short of the 1 to 2 percent growth suggested by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is imposing constraints.
</P>
<P>
If the nation's economic growth reaches a mere 0.7 percent in
1998, the defaulted bill ratio will come to 0.75 percent with
market interest rates soaring to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The defaulted bill ratio indicates that 4,300 companies in the
country will go "belly-up" every month, bringing the total number
of business failures to 53,000 in 1998, a more than threefold
increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the international
community, sustained the serious financial crisis because of the
failure of a slew of conglomerates, and bad loans of financial
institutions after late 1997. These saw saw the country's per
capita productivity down to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the previous
year's 10,548 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic situation is expected to worsen this year
as, under an agreement reached with the IMF for rescue loans of 57
billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to completely restructure
its economy. Closing ailing financial institutions and legalizing
mass layoffs are the harsh conditions tied to the rescue loans.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Developing High-Technology to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- While China is facing the
pressing issue of building a robust and highly efficient economic
structure at the turn of the century, its capital is focusing on
developing high-technology and related industries.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the 11th Beijing Municipal People's
Congress which ended here today, Beijing's Mayor Jia Qinglin said
that high-technology and related industries should be given
priority for they are the key areas in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has the intellectual and industrial potential for
developing high-tech industries, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has nearly 100 colleges,
universities and research institutions. And about 10 percent of
its residents are scientists or technicians.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of China's reform and opening-up, some experts
and technicians came out of their studies and built a "computer
street" at Zhongguancun in western Beijing, which was later
referred as the cradle of Beijing's high-tech industry. During the
following two decades more, more state, private and overseas
investors flocked to Beijing's new industries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Association for Science and
Technology, the number of high-technology enterprises in the city
has exceeded 6,000, with foreign enterprises reaching 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Legend Computer Group Co., based on Zhongguancun, has become
China's personal computer giant and its second largest electronic
enterprise. Stone Corp., founded in 1984, has expanded its
business from manufacturing lighting equipment to developing
computer software and trade, grossing 6.5 billion yuan (780
million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the city's high-tech enterprises are in
Beijing's pilot and economy and technology development zones. The
high-technology industry development pilot zone generated 10
percent of the city's GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that Beijing's high-tech development should be led by
the information industry and such new industries as electronics,
bioengineering, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
High-technology will also be applied to rejuvenating
traditional industries and improving their technological level,
the mayor said.

<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Eight kidnap suspects were
killed Wednesday in two separate shootouts with police in Caloocan
city, Metro Manila, the Philippine National Police said.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation suggested that those suspects belonged to
a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate operating in the capital area,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Four of the eight suspects, who were believed responsible for
an earlier kidnapping, were killed in an encounter with police
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The other four were also killed in an alleged safehouse of the
syndicate by an anti-kidnap police force hours later.
</P>
<P>
Police said they trailed the four suspects from Quezon city,
another part of Metro Manila, where the kidnappers received
200,000 peso ransoms.
</P>
<P>
Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates have been rampant in the
Philippines in recent years. More than 200 kidnapping cases were
reported to the police in 1997.

</P>
<P>
This year's series has attracted two more cities to become the
host and the event is extended to South America and the Oceania
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong meet, the fifth annually staged in a row, has
been postponed from the usual date of January so as to give way to
the world swimming championships staged in Perth, Australia
earlier this month. And to facilitate swimmers, Sydney has become
the designated host of the opening leg, for January 21-22, of the
World Cup series, according to a spokesman of the Hong Kong leg's
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The third leg is scheduled for February 25-26 in Beijing. The
World Cup Series then move on to Rio de Janeiro of Brazil,
Shefield of Britain, Malmo of Sweden, Gelsenkirchen of Germany,
Imperia of Italy and Paris of France.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong organizing committee has so far received entries
for participation from 20 national or regional swimming
associations -- 10 from Europe, two from Oceania, one each from
Africa and America and six from Asia. The organizers expected for
more entries by the deadline at February 6.
</P>
<P>
Each of the nine legs will have 34 events both for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
The four past Hong Kong World Cup meets had witnessed two new
short-course world records -- the men's 100 meters freestyle
record of 47.83 seconds set in 1994 by Russian Alexandre Popov and
the 31.11 seconds mark set in 1996 by China's Han Xue in women's
50 meters breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
The world marks were later recognized as new world records by
the sport's world governing body, the International Amateur
Swimming Federation.
</P>

The World Cup Hong Kong '98 is organized jointly by the
Provisional Unban Council and the Hong Kong Amateur Swimming
Association.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- About 24,700 criminal cases
occurred in Mongolia in 1997, a 10.2 percent rise over the
previous year, says the Chief Directorate of Police (CDP) of
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The incidents caused a total property loss of 23.5 billion
togrog (about 29 million U.S. dollars), as well as leaving 1,132
people dead and 5,501 disabled, the government agency said in an
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Larceny, robbery, hooliganism, abuse of power and crime
committed by military personnel were on the rise. Larceny
accounted for 54.1 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
Since the transition of the social system in the early 1990s,
Mongolia has been plagued by economic difficulties. Criminal
cases have proliferated because of widespread unemployment and
poverty and 66 percent of the criminals are jobless, official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with leading senior police, judiciary and procuratorial
organs last year, Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy called
for tougher action to combat crime and restore social stability.
</P>
<P>
An anti-larceny commission was set up for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Police solved 86.2 percent of the criminal cases last year, 2.2
percent more than in 1996, the CDP said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Send 60 Inspectors to Iraq, Says Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to send 60 experts
to join the international inspectors monitoring Iraq's program of
dismantling weapons of mass destruction, a Russian diplomat said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Egypt Vladimir Gudev made the statement
following a meeting Wednesday with Egyptian Assistant Foreign
Minister for Arab and Middle East Affairs Sayyed Abu Zeid.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed steps taken by the Russian side to improve
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) missions, which
have been stranded again over the composition of the UN arms
inspection team, Gudev said.
</P>
<P>
"Among those steps is a proposal of sending 60 Russian experts
to take part in the international inspectors," he said, adding
that Russia has proposed to dedicate a reconnaissance plane to be
used by the commission.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Russia's proposals have won wide approval
and voiced hope that other states would take part in the mission
to "increase the effectiveness" of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, complaining there are too many Americans in the team, has
threatened to cut off cooperation with the U.N. inspectors if the
inspections are not completed by May 20.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Russian proposals are not at Iraq's direct
request, yet they go in line with the stance of Iraq and a large
number of other states such as China and France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid told reporters that his meeting with Gudev also dealt
with the latest developments of the Iraq-U.N. standoff as well as
Russia's view on the Washington's recent efforts to broker an end
to the Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Russian and Egyptian diplomats came as
chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler failed in his latest bid to
get Iraq's approval to have his arms monitors inspect the
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is pushing an end to the crushing U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after it's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which can not be
lifted until the inspectors say Iraq has eliminated its long-range
missiles, chemical and biological weapons and the means to produce
them.
</P>
<P>
In November, Iraq threw Americans on the U.N teams out of the
country. The U.N. withdrew the rest of the inspectors until Russia
brokered a deal three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Last week the dispute flared again, with Iraq failing to
provide the necessary escorts for an inspection team led by an
American.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-based Journalists Look Back at 1997, Ahead to 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- With a lot of big events
happening in China, 1997 was a busy yet exciting year for
journalists working in the country.
</P>
<P>
That was the feeling expressed by journalists attending a new
year's gathering held here today by the All China Journalists'
Association (ACJA).
</P>
<P>
Gilles Campion, Beijing Bureau chief of Agence France-Presse,
said the past year was the busiest since he came to China five
years ago. Campion referred to the historical events of Deng
Xiaoping's passing, Hong Kong's return to China and the
convocation of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China.
</P>
<P>
"1997 was really very important and exciting for journalists,"
Campion said.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to 1998, the French journalist predicted the
two big issues will be the forthcoming annual meeting of China's
National People's Congress, at which China's new chief of
government will be elected, and how China reacts to the monetary
crisis now sweeping Asia.
</P>
<P>
"With China playing an increasingly important role on the world
scene, people are hungry for information about China," said
Frederic Bobin, China correspondent for the French newspaper Le
Monde.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with his French colleague, Joseph Anil, China
correspondent for Press Trust of India, said that what journalists
are doing is closing the information gap between China and the
rest of the world by getting more information about China to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, ACJA Chairman Shao Huaze called 1997
"a most extraordinary year in the history of our Party and our
country"
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, he said, Chinese journalists made new
achievements in reporting on China's modernization drive and
increasing the understanding and friendship between Chinese and
overseas journalists.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation of overseas journalists'
efforts in presenting China's achievements to the world and
enhancing the understanding and friendship between the Chinese
people and people around the world.

<HEADLINE> Indian Election Commission Bans Publication of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission
Wednesday banned for two weeks from February 14 publication and
broadcast of opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
It also put similar restrictions on exit polls from February 16
to 28.
</P>
<P>
The 12th Lower House of Parliament general elections are to be
held from February 16 to March 7 in four phases.
</P>
<P>
Announcing guidelines for publication and dissemination of
results of opinion and exit polls, Chief Election Commissioner Dr.
M.S. Gill made it clear that no result of any opinion poll could
be published or broadcast during the specified fortnight.
Contravention of the guidelines could be treated as a penal
offense punishable with imprisonment up to two years or with fine
or both.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Election Commission had arrived at the
decision after consulting 43 recognized political parties, most of
whom favored such restrictions. It was strongly felt that voters
should be left alone for a while to cast their ballot according to
their best judgment. Such dissemination, particularly on the eve
of polls or when the polling process is in progress, has the
potential to influence the electors when they are in the mental
process of making up their minds to vote or not to vote for a
certain political party or a candidate.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission also stipulated that those conducting
opinion or exit polls while publicizing it must indicate the
sample size of the electorate covered and geographical spread of
survey. They must give the details of methodology followed, likely
percentage of errors, the professional background and experience
of the organization and the key professionals involved in the
conduct and analysis of the polls.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, met here Wednesday with British Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Tung exchanged views on a wide range of issues of common
interest with Cook, who arrived here Tuesday after a trip to
Beijing on January 19-20.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tung told Cook that the "one country, two
systems" policy had been successfully implemented in Hong Kong
since it returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government is determined to ensure that
the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a "high
degree of autonomy" is fully implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the regional financial turmoil, Tung told Cook that Hong
Kong was fully committed to maintaining the linked exchange rate
between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar and he believed
that Hong Kong will be the first one to bounce back from the
financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said that elections to the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR would be open, fair and honest.
"We are committed to the development of democracy," Tung said.
"Our political process will evolve in accordance with the Basic
Law. I believe this is in the best long-term interest of Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
Tung also told Cook that Hong Kong had put an end to the Port
of First Asylum policy for Vietnamese people arriving in Hong Kong
illegally in future and appealed to the British government to
accept more Vietnamese refugees and lobby other resettlement
countries to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he was pleased to note an improved Sino-British
relationship and added that a mutually beneficial partnership
between China and Britain is good for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, Cook told reporters
that facts have proved that the "one country, two systems"
principle had been successful in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that he was confident in Hong Kong despite the
financial turmoil in the region. He said that he believed Hong
Kong will weather the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition of Hong Kong has offered an opportunity
for a fresh start of the relationship between Britain and China
and Hong Kong can become a bridge for Britain to China, Cook
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A ferrocement barge was sunk
Wednesday in the northwest sea of Hong Kong, marking the beginning
of an artificial reefs project launched by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD), which
implemented the natural conservation project, said the deployment
of artificial reefs is one of the ways to alleviate the adverse
impacts on local marine habitat caused by coastal development,
pollution and overfishing.
</P>
<P>
An AFD spokesman said Wednesday that this redundant vessel was
among the 10 boats to be deployed as artificial reefs to serve as
a habitat for marine life in the first stage of the project.
</P>
<P>
Artificial reefs are very effective in aggregating fish and
would enhance existing habitat and fisheries resources, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The 10 vessels, including wooden fishing boats, steel and
ferrocement river barges, will be placed in the seas over the next
 three years. The AFD has secured 100 million HK dollars (about
12.8 million U.S. dollars) for the project.

<HEADLINE> Workshop on African Conflict Resolution Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA (Tanzania), January 21 (Xinhua) -- An international
workshop on African conflict resolution opened here today, at
which experience will be exchanged among African leaders and
mediators in a bid to stem widespread conflict in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni called for the establishment
of a regional mechanism to prevent and resolve conflicts in
Africa in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony held at the
Arusha International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
He said there must be a regional mechanism with consistent
principles if conflicts are to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
He attributed African conflicts to underdevelopment and called
for industrialization and the political empowerment of the
people.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the empowerment of the people must be
tailored to specific circumstances of a nation. "Empowerment must
be flexible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said there must be punishment in the process of
conflict resolution. "There must be hanging of some people, as
soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in Africa could be traced back long ago but western
colonialism and the "ideological poisoning" and manipulation by
colonialists are blamed for most conflicts in modern times, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The three-day gathering is also expected to discuss the role
played by civil society and African women in conflict resolution,
and institutional arrangements for conflict prevention,
management and resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere and Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakayna Kikwete
were present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The forum, sponsored by the United Nations Development
Program, was jointly organized by the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry
and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The workshop attracted some 200 African leaders,
peace-brokers, representatives from governments and international
organizations, and scholars from some 50 countries and more than
20 institutions.

CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Pete Sampras easily
disposed of Italian David Sanguinetti in Melbourne Wednesday to
reach the third round of the Australian Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Sampras took just 70 minutes to beat Sanguinetti, ranked 94th
in the world, 6-2 6-1 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The world top player dominated the court and never gave his
opponent a chance to break into the match.

his serve had not been at its potent best in the cold, heavy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted the surprise loss of Australian Mark
Philippoussis earlier Wednesday to Moroccan Hicham Arazi would
help him.
</P>
<P>
"You're not looking that far ahead, but he's definitely someone
who's very dangerous when he gets his game going," Sampras said of
the Australian.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Insurance Business Reaps 8.759 Billion Yuan in Premiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's insurance business
reaped 8.759 billion yuan (1.05 billion U.S. dollars) in premiums
last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese insurance companies got 8.159 billion yuan in premiums,
up 53.6 percent from last year, Wang Huaqing, deputy governor of
the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, here today.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance is the fastest-growing sector in the business,
said Wang, adding that companies based in Shanghai, both Chinese
and overseas, earned 5.721 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang expects competition in the life insurance market to
intensify in 1998, and the participation of overseas-funded
insurance companies in the market to enhance the vitality and
competition in the market.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of overseas-funded companies that are
applying for business licenses in Shanghai are in life insurance,
and the three Sino-overseas joint insurance companies that have
been approved will go into business this year.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 14,000 certified insurance agents in
Shanghai, and two more examinations for more agents will be held
this year, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military, Muslim Rebels Clash Anew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on Wednesday accused the
government troops of shelling again their positions in a southern
Philippine town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, was
quoted by a local television as saying the military bombardment
started around 1:00 a.m. Tuesday and stopped some three hours
later.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the military unleashed 50 rounds of 81 mm mortar
projectiles and some 10 rounds of 105 howitzer cannon shells on
the MILF defense lines near Buldon town in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
But he said nobody was hurt on the rebel side, adding that MILF
forces retaliated with several mortar fires on military positions
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Army's Sixth Infantry Division, whose troops are deployed
in Buldon, has not yet answered the MILF's accusations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a series of renewed clashes erupted between the MILF
and the government troops near Buldon, killing one government
militiaman and four MILF rebels after an exchange of projectiles.
</P>
<P>
The latest rash of violence, which occurred after the signing
of a general ceasefire agreement last December by the two sides,
will probably affect the next round of peace talks in February.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled peace talks are expected to discuss the
possibility of and the agenda for reaching a preliminary peace
agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to be included in the peace treaty signed last
year by the government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), and began its own peace talks with Manila in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 12,000 members, the MILF is currently the
largest anti-government force in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Partnership Between Reserves, Communities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The idea of balancing community development and nature
protection, which we call co-management, can be traced back
several decades, but so far it is still in a pilot stage in
China," said Scott McCormick, senior consultant working for the
GEF-China project.
</P>
<P>
According to McCormick, who has worked in many parts of the
world with co-management, "very positive channels have been
established to communicate with villagers, and all the eight
demonstration villages now have the potential to be very
successful."
</P>
<P>
In Foping National Nature Reserve in northwest China's Shaanxi
province, the reserve helped local villagers last year introduce
better bee varieties and improve edible fungus-growing
techniques. In neighboring Zhouzhi National Nature Reserve, an
agreement has been reached between the reserve and a surrounding
village to reduce the cutting of firewood in exchange for
assistance with community projects.
</P>
<P>
"Now the villagers are all eager to do something for the
reserve," said Zhang Jian, director of the Foping reserve
administration.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, most of the reserve's work was only to prevent
local villagers from illegal cutting and hunting, but now I have
begun to recognize that the way to do my job better is not to
conflict with the villagers, but to help them."
</P>
<P>
The consciousness of co-management is also becoming a common
concern in the Shennongjia National Nature Reserve in central
China's Hubei Province. Zhang Quan Yi, the reserve's
administration chief, said during an exclusive interview with
Xinhua that "good nature conservation can be only achieved when
good community development is achieved."
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Forestry, a countrywide drive to
improve relations between reserves and local communities will
begin soon after the year 2000 when initial experiences are drawn
from the GEF-China project.
</P>
<P>
"This will give the nation's nature conservation cause a real
good starting point," an official with the ministry said.

ventures while speeding up industrial readjustment in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sectors such as retail sales, finance,
insurance, tourism and cultural services will continue to

Petrochemical Co. and the Dongfang Chemical Plant, and electronic
parts and power generating equipment groups will be established.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to further develop the Capital Iron and
Steel Group, Legend Group and Stone Group, etc., he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's gross domestic product is expected to reach 200.8
billion yuan (24.2 billion U.S. dollars) this year, up 9 percent
allowing for inflation, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The city expects to export 2.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of
goods and use a total of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
funds.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Names Vice Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced Wednesday that Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo will be
the candidate of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party for the country's
vice president in the May general elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the announcement after Macapagal-Arroyo's tiny KAMPI
party formally merged with the Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) led by the president.
</P>
<P>
Macapagal-Arroyo, a proclaimed presidential aspirant and one of
the top-notchers in many opinion polls, took her oath as a member
of the Lakas before Ramos Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas-KAMPI merger, finalized after nearly one month of
negotiations, was a precondition for Macapagal-Arroyo to be the
running mate of the Lakas party's presidential candidate Jose de
Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
At the merger ceremony, Macapagal-Arroyo said she made her
decision to join the ruling party after a series of consultations
with her party mates and many religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Macapagal-Arroyo declared herself the presidential candidate of
her own party in November last year, but many had doubted she
would win the coming presidential polls because her party was too
weak.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is to proclaim the de Venecia-Macapagal-Arroyo tandem and
the ruling party's 12 senatorial lineup at the Lakas national
convention on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Charity Group Raises 4.9 Million Yuan for Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation
(CCF) announced here today that over the past week and more, it
has raised 4.9 million yuan (about 600,000 US dollars) in donation
for the quake-stricken area in Zhangjiakou of Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiakou, a major city in northern Hebei, was hit by an
earthquake measured 6.2 on the Richter scale on January 10. The
tremor killed 50 people, injured more than 10,000, and damaged
over 100,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
Yan Mingfu, vice president of CCF, said that the federation
began to receive social donations on the first work day after the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"Within one week, we received donations worth one and a half
million yuan, as well as nearly 2,000 clothes from Beijing
residents," he said, adding that all the donations had been sent
to the quake-afflicted areas on January 13, 16 and 19.
</P>
<P>
Starting on January 19, he said, the CCF started a new round of
fund-raising to help the reconstruction in the quake-stricken
areas, especially the rebuilding of schools, old folks' homes and
local people's houses.
</P>
<P>
"To date, we have received two million yuan from the
headquarters of Bank of Communications, Guangzhou Jockeys' Club
and a charity fund based in Hong Kong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 50 noted TV hosts and performers, who are now busy
rehearsing on a soiree to be broadcast live on China Central
Television on the eve of the Chinese lunar new year, informed the
CCF by phone that they would each donate a makeshift house to
students in quake-afflicted areas as temporary classrooms. The
houses are estimatedly worth nearly 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
CCF offices across the country also received donations worth a
total of one million yuan, Yan added.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that due to the bitter cold that has frozen the
surface of earth, it would not be possible for the reconstruction
work to start until May.
</P>
<P>
"But I promise that the CCF will try its best to make full and
proper use of every penny of the donations," he said.

KHARTOUM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese security official
has accused the United States of supplying the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), the rebel movement in southern Sudan, with
mines.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese newspaper "Akhbar El-Yom" Wednesday quoted the
official who declined to be named as saying that the supplies had

carrying relief supplies from Uganda to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "The U.N. aircraft are involved in carrying
these mines from Uganda to Sudan under the guise relief supplies."
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that these mines will be on display
within a few days after they are removed from where they are
planted.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA guerillas have been fighting with government forces in
the south of the country for more autonomy rights from the Islamic
government for the southerners who are mostly Christians.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese nature conservation
staff members are beginning to doubt the traditional philosophy of
keeping people away from wild areas.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to establish a partnership between the nation's
nearly 800 nature reserves and their surrounding villages to seek
more cooperation and participation.
</P>
<P>
In Xiahuibian, a remote Hani ethnic group village bordering the
Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, villagers recently received a group of nature reserve
staff members with a grand feast.
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating with the villagers for better cooperation
by investing in a hydro-power station and helping to improve the
villagers' farming methods and incomes," said Cai Jialin from the
reserve administration.
</P>
<P>
According to Yin Hong, deputy section chief in charge of the
nature reserve management with the Ministry of Forestry,
Xiahuibian is now one of eight pilot villages in China.
</P>
<P>
Starting two years ago, Yin said, the Ministry of Forestry and
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) launched a project to
improve China's nature conservation and especially encourage more
involvement of local communities in conservation. The project will
last six years and cost 23.6 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Quake-Stricken Area and Social Welfare Receive Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Five enterprises and a charity
groups from China's interior areas, Hong Kong and Taiwan today
provided donations worth several million yuan for the
quake-stricken areas in Zhangjiakou of Hebei Province and China's
elderly's and children's welfare.
</P>
<P>
The donations were received by the China Charity Federation
(CCF), China Senior Citizens Foundation and China Children's
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiakou, a major city in northern Hebei, was hit by a
magnitude 6.2 tremor on January 10, which damaged over 100,000
houses and left tens of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
To assist the reconstruction in the quake-afflicted region,
Guangzhou Jockeys' Club, a charity group from south China's
Guangdong Province, donated one million yuan (about 120,000 US
dollars) to the CCF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two companies from Beijing and Hong Kong donated
7,600 woollen blankets and 500 cotton overcoats to the homeless
people to fight the bitter cold of north China's winter, and a
food company from Taiwan donated 1,000 boxes of instant noodles.
</P>
<P>
A CCF official said that all the donated blankets, overcoats
and food have arrived at the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
Two pharmaceutical companies in Beijing and Hebei Province
today donated their own products to the senior citizens and
children's foundations.
</P>
<P>
The medicines, with a market value of 1.05 million yuan, are
said to be good for old people's health and children's growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenfan, president of the China Senior Citizens
Foundation, noted that it is the traditional virtue of the Chinese
to esteem and support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"With the backing of the whole society, we have scored
remarkable achievements in seeking benefits for the elderly people
in the past year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foundation would distribute the donations it
received today to senior citizens associations in 20 provinces
across the country.

<HEADLINE> Outlook Stable for Australian Wool: Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The long-term outlook for
Australian wool sales remained generally stable despite the Asian
currency crisis, the Wool Council of Australia (WCA) said
Wednesday in its latest analysis.
</P>
<P>
"While there has been a fall-off in demand and a price
deterioration in recent weeks, we are hopeful this is short term,
driven principally by currency instability and uncertainty in
Asia," WCA Executive Director Greg Evans said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The council analysis ... suggests in the longer term the
fundamentals remain sound with reasonable gross domestic product
(GDP) growth in our key markets and a modest production outlook
providing a platform for improving prices."
</P>
<P>
Evans conceded that the crisis has an impact on specific
markets and has given buyers a reason to temporarily retreat from
the market.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that it is important for the wool industry to
maintain a proper perspective on the extent of the Asian financial
meltdown and its probable impact on the industry's fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
South Korea only took about 6 percent of Australia's wool
exports in the fiscal year of 1996-1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the turmoil, other key markets including China, Europe
and the Americas appear to be remaining firm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Evans said conditions over the next six to 12 months would
largely be dictated by the ongoing stability of the Chinese
market, Japan's ability to meet its 1998 GDP growth forecast and
European demand.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), held a meeting here today
with delegates attending the Sixth Chinese National Catholic
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li extended congratulations on the success of the congress on

</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese

in running the churches in the past 40 years, especially since
their fifth national congress.
</P>
<P>
They also have played a positive role and achieved much in

<HEADLINE> Taylor Denies Asking for ECOMOG's Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has denied that he is demanding the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG to leave his country by February 2,
saying that what he wants is the change of their mission and
mandate.
</P>
<P>
"The February 2 deadline is not for the withdrawal of ECOMOG
forces from Liberia. February 2 is for the technical change of
the mandate. What we are asking is that their mission and its
mandate must change on February 2," Taylor told the Voice of
America on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He accused some people in the ECOMOG of trying to exercise the
same control over Liberia as they did before the election and
made it clear that he did not want anyone to share his power as
the president.
</P>
<P>
"There is no parallel government in Liberia. Whatever unit
would be here would work with the president and the government of
the Republic of Liberia," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, a sub-regional force under the command of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has been in Liberia
since 1990 when the Liberia civil war broke out.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who emerged the winner of the successful presidential
election monitored by ECOMOG, had agreed with ECOWAS that the
ECOMOG will stay in Liberia until August to help rebuild its
national army.
</P>
<P>
He, however, seemed to have changed his mind later, accusing
the ECOMOG of trying to be an independent power center and
demanded its total pullout by February 2.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that he had urged the United States to
train the national army for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Preparing for a final pullout, Nigeria, the main contributor
of troops to the ECOMOG, had already called back 1,205 soldiers
last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi has been busy
with consultations with west African leaders over the fate of the
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Acting on the mandate of the ECOWAS Chairman and Nigerian Head
of State, General Sani Abacha, Ikimi had visited Ghana, Togo,
Guinea and Liberia last week and is expected to visit more ECOWAS
member states this week.

<HEADLINE> "Green Rally" to Highlight Environment-Friendly Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China will hold an
international "green rally" in July to provide auto manufacturers
an opportunity to present their environment-friendly cars and
draw closer public attention to reducing car pollution.
</P>
<P>
Contestants of the rally will start in Guangdong Province's
Zhuhai, an environmental protection model city, for Beijing on
July 1, and drive 3,200 kilometers across Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei,
Henan and Hebei provinces, and Tianjin City within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Instead of racing cars, the rally will only involve
environment-friendly cars, which are currently in use or will be
put in use soon. Contestants will be judged by environment indexes
about their cars, tested during the race.
</P>
<P>
Advertisement of the prevention and control of car pollution
will be carried out in provinces and municipalities, which the
race will cover.
</P>
<P>
The output of China's auto industry has been increasing at an
average annual rate of 20 percent since 1991. The number of
automobiles in the country has exceeded 11 million. Experts
predicted that more and more families will buy cars in the next
five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has taken tough measures to check increasingly
serious car pollution. Beijing and some other big cities banned
the use of petrol with lead-content last year, and the unleaded
petrol will be in use all over the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The rally, the first of its kind in China, will be sponsored
jointly by the State Environment Protection Agency, and the State
Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and the State Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 Chinese and foreign auto manufacturers, including the
German Volkswagon Co. Ltd, have already expressed their intention
of attending the contest.

<HEADLINE> Butler Rejects Iraqi Proposal on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector
Richard Butler has rejected an Iraqi proposal to freeze the
inspectors' access to presidential and sovereign sites, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, Butler said Iraq has proposed to freeze
U.N. arms inspectors' access to the sites until technical
evaluation meetings come to an end in April.
</P>
<P>
He said he had told the Iraqis that he "can not or will not"
agree to this proposal until he received different instructions
from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tariq Aziz proposed that we should freeze any further
discussions or actions with respect to the issue of inspecting
presidential and sovereign sites until the results of those
technical evaluation meetings come out," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Aziz) said if when those meetings are finished, and I have
the positive results that he foresees, the only obstacle to the
lifting of the embargo was this question of access to
presidential and sovereign sites, then he and I should meet again
in April to talk about it," he told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Aziz ruled out the possibility that Iraq would
provide any new information.
</P>
<P>
"He (Aziz) said that all of the information as to Iraq's
disposal is known to us, it would be compiled in specific forms
suitable for each of those meetings, but he did not expect there
will be any new information," said Butler.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said technical evaluation meetings would
begin on the first of February in Baghdad, one meeting on missile
warheads, another on chemical weapons, in particular on the
chemical "VX", and a few weeks after that, a meeting will begin on
the whole biological file.
</P>
<P>
Butler said the aim of establishing those meetings is to solve
differences between UNSCOM and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Those meetings will be participated by international experts
from five permanent member states of the Security Council and
Germany in addition to experts from Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said he expressed his "very serious doubt that
the terms of technical evaluation meetings could have the outcome
that he (Aziz) foresaw."
</P>
<P>
Butler said the (Security) Council's instruction to him as of
today was for him to continue full work of this commission in
pursuit of its mandate.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not rule out the possibility that he would
authorize U.N. arms inspectors to go to a place in one of these
presidential and sovereign sites.
</P>
<P>
"I can not rule out that tomorrow, the next day, whenever, my
professionals might put to me a proposal which is justified by
evidence available to us, they would have me authorize the
inspection to go to a place of one of these presidential and
sovereign sites," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "if that is the case, I would do it,
unless the Council instructs me otherwise."
</P>
<P>
Butler said he had come to Baghdad as the Council's
representative with a very specific brief, a brief to "get Iraq to
come back into compliance to accept its obligation to allow us to
go anywhere in the country without conditions, without hindrance,
to carry out our work."
</P>
<P>
He said that he could not predict what the Council would make
of that.
</P>
<P>
Butler said the Iraqi side had identified eight presidential
sites throughout the country, but said he did not know the number
of buildings in them.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mayor Re-elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Jia Qinglin was re-elected
mayor on the final day of the first session of the 11th Beijing
Municipal People's Congress today.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old mayor is also the secretary of the Beijing
Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He is among
the top city and provincial officials who hold both the top posts
of party and government concurrently.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, eight deputy mayors were elected, four of
whom are new.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqin, Meng Xuenong, Lin Wenyi and Yue Fuhong remained as
deputy mayors. Wang Huangtao, Liu Haiyan, Liu Jingmin and Zhang
Mao were elected deputy mayors for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The average age of Beijing's top officials is 51; six of them
are post-graduates and the rest have received university
educations.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wenyi, the only woman deputy mayor, had been a tutor for
doctoral degree candidates at Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangtao, 55, has a post-graduate degree in urban
construction. The Shanghai native was mayor of Harbin before he
was elected today as Beijing's deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan, chairman of the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical
Group, has rich experience in managing large state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinmin had been working in the city's urban construction
department for many years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Mao, 43, is the youngest of the deputy mayors. He had
been deputy head of the Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation and head of Beijing's New Technology
Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the new deputy mayors have been
chosen to deal with such pressing city problems as urban
construction, management of state-owned enterprises and
development of high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianmin was re-elected as chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress at today's

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Develops Fiber System Over Cellular Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's LG Telecom has
developed a fiber system that will improve call quality of a
mobile phone network and cut the cost of network construction, the
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new system uses fiber optic cable networks and small
transceiver units, called remote radio frequency (RF) heads, to
connect with a cellular phone communication hub.
</P>
<P>
These RF heads receive optical signals from a communications
service hub into another's air frequencies for transmission to
subscribers' handsets.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with antennae, the heads can also receive calls from
subscribers and convert them into optical signals for transmission
to a communication hub, which then delivers the calls to their
destinations through telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
The main advantage of the fiber system is that installation of
the small RF heads and their antennae is very easy and flexible.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the RF units doesn't require those high
steel towers needed to deploy base transceiver systems. They can
be installed on electrical poles, buildings or other structures.
</P>
<P>
This means that the time and costs to build PCS networks can be
reduced significantly.
</P>
<P>
The new system also improves call quality since it can be
located closer to subscribers.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Fireworks will light up the
night skies of capital Beijing on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New
Year on Jan.28.
</P>
<P>
Municipal government sources said Beijing will start a firework
display at 8 p.m. that evening at six launch sites in suburban
counties circling the city proper so that the skyline of the city
will be colorfully illuminated.
</P>
<P>
The public transport department will open special bus lines
that day to shuttle people to watch the fireworks on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The firework display will last 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of safety and environmental protection, Beijing
issued a ban on firecrackers and fireworks in 1993.
</P>
<P>
On important holidays like spring festival, the city government
also designates some sites in suburban areas for those people who
like to explode fireworks and firecrackers by themselves.

<HEADLINE> East China Improves Literacy Among Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The literacy rate of the young
and middle-aged in East China's Anhui Province was raised from
80.5 percent in 1990 to 96.25 percent this year thanks to the
government effort to wipe out illiteracy, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
One concrete measure the local government took was to provide
courses to spread basic knowledge among more than 600,000
illiterates and semi-illiterates in the province, 69 percent of
whom have passed the exams.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 25,000 classes covering practical skills
of agriculture were held in the province last year; 1,015,000
farmers attended these classes, and 5,940,000 rural people went to
county- or village-level training classes.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial education committee, Anhui is
expected to raise the literacy rate of the young to more than 97
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded great progress in eliminating illiteracy,
with some 60 million Chinese people, including 25 youngsters and 35
million adults.
</P>
<P>
However, some 145 million Chinese people are still illiterate,
37.5 million of whom are youngsters, or approximately 25 percent of
the total. Females living in poverty-stricken and mountainous
areas account for the vast majority of the illiterate
population.

<HEADLINE> HK Strives for Good Environment for Trade: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Trade Department
made continued efforts in 1997 to ensure that Hong Kong has the
best possible external and internal environment for trade,
Director General of Trade Alan Lai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Externally our main objective is to promote liberalization of
international trade through efforts at the multilateral, regional
and bilateral levels, and internally, we made further steps in
ensuring that our trade regulation systems achieve their purposes
in ways that are most facilitating and business-friendly," Lai
told a media session.
</P>
<P>
The main fora at the multilateral and regional levels are
respectively the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory and a separate
member of the WTO, continued to participate actively in the work
of the WTO during the year, Lai noted.
</P>
<P>
The successful conclusion of the negotiations on basic
telecommunications and financial services and the conclusion of an
agreement on information technology during the year in the WTO
were very beneficial to Hong Kong's export of services and goods,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the WTO,
will be held in May this year to pay tribute to the achievements
of the multilateral trading system. The second WTO Ministerial
Conference will be held prior to the anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will pursue the idea of launching a new round of
broad-based multilateral negotiations by the turn of the century
actively in the WTO with a view to achieving our ultimate goal of
global free trade and investment," the trade official said.
</P>
<P>
On the regional level, 1997 was the first year that the Special
Administrative Region participated in the APEC Economic Leaders
Meeting and Ministerial Meeting under the name of "Hong Kong,
China". "Hong Kong remains a separate and full member of APEC in
its own right," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, Canada, APEC member economies agreed to pursue
early voluntary trade liberalization in 15 sectors, with nine
sectors under fast track action.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly encouraged to see our toys proposal
selected as one of the nine fast track items. It is estimated that
about 1.5 billion HK dollars (192 million U.S. dollars) of Hong
Kong's domestic export of toys will benefit," Lai said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 2 Sudanese POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has released two Sudanese
prisoners of war (POW) captured during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
local daily Jomhuri Eslami reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the two Sudanese were sent to the Sudanese
Embassy in Tehran Sunday according to an agreement reached between
the two countries on the sidelines of the eighth Islamic summit
held here last December.
</P>
<P>
The report did not identify the freed Sudanese, nor did it give
any further details. But it said they were sent by former Sudanese
government to join the Iraqi army fighting Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's envoy here thanked Iran for the "humanitarian measure"
and expressed regret that the Sudanese were involved in the
Iran-Iraq bloodshed, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
Iran had released last month two Jordanian POWs following
talks between Iranian and Jordanian officials at the Islamic
summit.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, many Arab mercenaries
joined the Iraqi army to fight Iran, a non-Arab country in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Iran released most of the Arab POWs in 1991. It was reported
that Tehran is still keeping several hundreds of POWs, most of
them Iraqis.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Manufacturing Output Increases in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output rose by 10.3 percent year-on-year in November 1997, with
the cumulative output for the first 11 months of the year jumping
by 4 percent over a year earlier, the Economic Development Board
(EDB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the increase in November was broad-based with
growth recorded in the electronics, chemicals and engineering
clusters.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew by 10.3 percent in November
compared with a year ago. Growth in semiconductors, computer
peripherals and printed circuit boards assembled (PCBAs) bolstered
the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the EDB said growth in disk drives was not as vigorous
as before because of over-capacity worldwide while the output of
telecommunication equipment, personal computers and consumer
electronics declined.
</P>
<P>
Electronics output for the first 11 months of 1997 rose by 2.9
percent over the same months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
As for the chemicals cluster, the cumulative output for the
period between January and November was 14.4 percent higher than
the corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The output of petrochemical products soared by 121.3 percent in
November, it said, adding that while new plants increased their
production, output from some existing plants was disrupted due to
short maintenance shutdowns in the month.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output of the 11 months went up by a hefty 81.2
percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The output of the pharmaceuticals sub-cluster decreased by 22.3
percent year-on-year due to less export orders from Europe.
Cumulative output for the first 11 months of the year was 1.8
percent lower than the same period of 1996, the EDB said.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- As a major step to reform the
country's financial system, China will gradually close the
provincial branches of the People's Bank of China(PBOC) and set up
a number of regional branches.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities are determined to continue the
nationwide reforms and have a framework for financial sector
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Major moves are a reorganization of local branches of the
central bank and state-owned commercial banks and increasing
supervision of financial institutions and markets. The ultimate
goal of the new round of reforms is a modern financial system and
a sound financial order over the next three years to keep up with
socialist market economy developments.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will draw on international
financial management practices for administrative reforms to
increase independence, authority, and professionalism of the
central bank, and provincial PBOC branches will be gradually
closed and a number of regional branches set up.
</P>
<P>
The local branches of the state-owned commercial banks that are
not performing well will be closed or merged, and local commercial
banks will be gradually established in large and medium-sized
cities.
</P>
<P>
Capital markets with risk funds and industrial funds will be
developed so that individual capital can be directed to
enterprises with a good record and banks will raise funds
indirectly.

<P>
Commercial banks will become real banks with autonomy in
business decisions and a modern banking system established with
boards of directors and internal control systems.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with international loan practices, China will
develop a new loan classification system to improve commercial
banks' loans.
</P>
<P>
Although the SE Asian financial crisis does not seem to pose a
direct threat to China, the hidden dangers that led to the crisis
also exist to some degree in China's financial sector, and the
central bank has taken heed and decided to further increase
financial controls.
</P>
<P>
Central bank sources say that illegal financial institutions
will be stopped, and the banking, trust, securities and insurance
sectors separated, and financial institutions will have to
increase self discipline to improve order by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
To balance supply and demand, China will continue to try to
avoid a bubble economy in real estate and securities and to
maintain a rational structure in foreign debt, monetary system,
and exchange rate. The convertibility of the renminbi will come
gradually and conditionally.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of the past few years have provided good conditions
for the financial sector reaching its three-year reform
goals. Since 1994, the financial sector has developed steadily, at
a time when many Asian countries have been dragged into financial
crises and are suffering heavily. China's financial system is
still healthy, demonstrating China's ability to avoid economic and
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
China is now pushing its financial reform to higher levels, a
move that is needed by a socialist market economy and one that is
a realistic way of coping with the new international economic
conditions, and the central bank says it is confident that the
reform measures will achieve the desired results.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Project Developer Listed in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Huaneng Power International,
a large-scale power project developer in China, went listed on the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Wednesday, adding the total number of
H shares to 40.
</P>
<P>
The company Wednesday listed its 1.25 billion overseas shares
on the Hong Kong bourse by way of introduction. The shares were
first issued in October 1994 and listed on the New York Exchange
in the form of American Depository Shares (ADSs). Now each form
may be converted through the Depository Bank to trade on the other
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The dual listing is expected to enlarge the shareholder base of
the energy company and bring it long-term benefits, sources from
Huaneng Power International said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-listed H share company postponed its original plan to
issue 250 million new overseas shares because of the recent down
string on the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Founded in June 1994, the company develops, constructs,
operates and owns large coal-fired power plants in China, with a
total installed capacity of 5,300 MW. Its four more power
projects, with an aggregate designed capacity of 2,800 MW, are
under construction and scheduled for commercial operation before
the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Foreign Trade Tops 130 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province reported robust growth in its foreign trade last year,
with total exports and imports valued at more than 130 billion US
dollars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume of Guangdong was about 40 percent of
the national total.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that Guangdong's exports surged 24
percent to 74.56 billion US dollars last year, while its imports
rose 10 percent to 55.56 billion US dollars. The trade surplus of
19.9 billion US dollars was 1.2 times more than that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that Guangdong reported a 15 percent increase
in its processing trade, which accounted for 70 percent of the
Chinese province's total foreign trade volume last year.
</P>
<P>
Also last year Guangdong's general trade soared 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the figures have combined to indicate that
Guangdong has basically countered the negative effects brought by
reductions in the export rebate rates and has successfully
improved its ability to ward off risks related to foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, exports and imports of Guangdong's
state-owned foreign trade enterprises rose 24 percent in 1997, 9.4
percentage points higher than that of overseas-funded
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Computerized System for Logistics Exercise Put into Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Academy of Logistics
Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put into
use a computer-aided system to simulate logistics exercises.
</P>
<P>
In a recent logistics exercise, commanders, staff officers and
students at the academy were divided into 22 teams, each of which
represented a division.
</P>
<P>
In the 22 simulated division headquarters, more than 150
computers ran fast to process varied battle information. The large
screens of six computers, which received battlefield situation
from network computers, handled military supplies in good order.
</P>
<P>
A general in charge of the exercise said that the system is an
unprecedented success in large-scale logistics exercises of the
Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
He said that if logistics supply for 22 divisions is carried
out by servicemen in an area covering tens of thousands of sq km,
it will consume large amounts of financial, material and human
resources.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Moderate Export Performance in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports are
projected to have grown by around 4 percent in value terms to
1,453 billion HK dollars (186.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997,
Trade Department statistics showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After netting out a small decline in export prices, the growth
rate in real terms was about 6 percent, higher than the 5 percent
increase recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Trade Alan Lai noted that export
performance remained moderate in 1997, dampened largely by price
and demand factors.
</P>
<P>
The sustained strength of the U.S. dollar, and hence Hong Kong
dollar, weakened the price competitiveness of Hong Kong products
in overseas markets while import demand in Japan and Britain was
generally slack.
</P>
<P>
But Lai pointed out that exports to China's inland areas and
the United States, the two biggest trading partners of Hong Kong,
showed sustained growth in 1997, underpinned by the generally
robust performance in these two economies.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the substantial currency depreciation in
some East Asian economies since the middle of 1997 did not
materially affected Hong Kong's overall export performance in the
latter half of 1997 as their combined share in Hong Kong's total
exports was relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Within total exports, domestic exports are estimated to have
declined by about 1 percent in value terms to 211 billion HK
dollars (27.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997. After discounting a
small decrease in prices, the growth in real terms was about 2
percent, in contrast to the 8 percent decline in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports are estimated to have increased by about 5 percent
in value terms to 1,242 billion HK dollars (159.2 billion U.S.
dollars). The growth rate in real terms was about 7 percent,
slightly slower than the 8 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total trade in goods is estimated to have grown by around 5
percent in value terms to 3,073 billion HK dollars (394 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997. After netting out price changes, there was
an increase of about 6 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was placed seventh in world trade in 1996 by the
World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Make Donations for Quake-Hit Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents are enthusiastic
about making donations to the earthquake-hit Hebei Province in
northern China despite a sluggish economic performance in the
territory over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives of the local business community and
companies came to the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch to hand over
the donations over the past few days. The total sum of donations
Xinhua received had reached 3.41 million Hong Kong dollars (about
440,560 U.S. dollars) by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The largest single donation came from the Macao Development
Promotion Association, which is mainly composed of real estate
business people. Their contributions added up to 1,369,250 patacas
 (about 171,156 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Apart from companies and communities, individual residents also
came to Xinhua to make donations. They included one elderly who
asked not to be identified but contributed 500,000 Hong Kong
dollars (about 64,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, charity groups and the Macao Red Cross also
publicized their special bank accounts for donations.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua staff in Macao donated a total of 126,300 Hong Kong
dollars (about 16,300 U.S. dollars) themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zong Guangyao, deputy director of the Xinhua Macao Branch, said
many Macao residents called Xinhua to ask about the earthquake
after it happened on January 10. He praised Macao residents'
enthusiasm despite an economic slowdown in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake that rocked Zhangbei and Shangyi counties killed
more than 50 people and injured more than 10,000 others. Tens of
thousands of people were left homeless in the biting cold of minus
30 degrees Celsius.

<HEADLINE> British FM Optimistic About One Country, Two Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The first six months after
Hong Kong returned to China make people optimistic that "one
country, two systems" has been transformed from an imaginative
concept to a concrete reality, visiting British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organized by the British Chamber of
Commerce in Hong and Asia House in his honor, Cook said that the
first six months after the handover have provided welcome evidence
that the Chinese government is able and willing to give Hong Kong
the autonomy promised in the Basic Law, and to let Hong Kong
people govern Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They are six months that have shown the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) continuing to run Hong
Kong fairly and efficiently, to the benefit of the people of Hong
Kong, said Cook, who arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday following his
visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They are six months that have shown the rule of law is alive
and well, along with the impartiality and excellence of the Hong
Kong civil service, Cook added.
</P>
<P>
"So far, in spite of the new economic challenges, our
confidence in the future of Hong Kong has been reinforced," the
foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The business relationship between Britain and Hong Kong
continues to grow, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the largest foreign investor in Hong Kong and many
British companies have decided to use Hong Kong as a base for
their activities in China and the rest of Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the other direction, Britain already receives 80 percent of
all Hong Kong's investment in Europe, investment in the production
of everything from silicon chips in South Wales to compact discs
in Belfast, he added.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, Hong Kong can become a bridge for Britain
to China.
</P>
<P>
The new government in Britain and the success of the handover
here has given both Britain and China a chance for a fresh start
of the relationship between Britain and China, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with China have entered a new phase, and are
strengthening across the board," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
This is in the interests of everyone, the British and the
Chinese, including the people of Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has a key place in the world, and there is huge scope for
Britain and China to work together, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not need to tell anyone here about the attractions of
doing business in China. British companies have seen the
opportunities, and are by far the largest European investors,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"But above all, what we are aiming to do is develop a closer
relationship that recognizes the global importance of China's
remarkable recent progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
China is not just a market, it is one of the global powers of
the 21st century, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook paid a visit to Beijing On January 19-20, during which he
met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Remarkable successes have been
reported in seeking for underground water in northwest China's
Tarim Basin, Gansu Corridor and Loess Highlands.
</P>
<P>
The finds will greatly help relieve water shortage in the
areas, according to an official with the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China is rich in natural resources and has great
potential for development. However, economic development of the
areas has been restricted by the shortage of water. In 1996, the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources initiated a plan of
looking for water in northwest China in order to boost local
economic development and improve local people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, potable underground water was discovered in the inner
area of Tarim Basin, which had been known as the "sea of
death". In Xitong township, Yieshi city in Gansu, a well with a
capacity of 720 cubic meters per day has been dug, offering
drinking water for more than 6,000 local residents.
</P>
<P>
Wells with high quality water have also been dug in Shaanxi
Province. And freshwater has been found in Ejin Plain in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, benefiting 10,000 local residents.

<P>
Freetown, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people who fled
the fighting in Tongo Fields in the east of Sierra Leone over the
weekend to Kenema Tuesday spoke of seeing dozens of headless
corpses along the 35 mile route.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the corpses were males between the ages of 18 and 20
and some wore without shoes or clothes, said a middle aged man in
a telephone interview in Kenema.
</P>
<P>
A woman said, "It is difficult to express just what I saw. It
was as if they were just rags discarded for dumper trucks to
collect them."
</P>
<P>
She explained that many of the corpses were bound by hide
ropes and naked.
</P>
<P>
A lorry driver who was one of the last civilians to flee Tongo
Field before government troops recaptured Tongo Field Sunday
night said the area has been completely devastated by stray
shells and rockets.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in Kenema said they were worried over a
possible epidemic outbreak because of the abandoned corpses, many
of which are lodged in thick bushes.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have vehicles and even if we do, we will be faced
with the shortage of fuel, " a health officer added.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone Red Cross personnel in Kenema said the Food they
now have will run out within the next two weeks and they would be
forced to undertake humanitarian crossborder operations to bring
food in from the stock in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said they are puzzled as to who or what
group is responsible for the corpses.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the fighting between soldiers and the Kamajors
have become nasty as both sides are disregarding some of the
basic elements of treating prisoners of war.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe: Land Reform to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not accept
perpetual occupation of most of its fertile land by white
commercial farmers and will go ahead with its land reform to
ensure equality in land distribution, President Robert Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of people at the Ellerton farm in Beatrice
near Harare, Mugabe lambasted the foreign media for giving
impression that the Zimbabwean Government wanted to abandon the
land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, could never be an extension of Britain and
since the government was acting on the basis of principle, there
was no going back.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going back on the land issue. We cannot accept
perpetual occupation of most of our fertile land by a few white
commercial farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As we take the farms, we are not saying that those capable
should go away. We simply do not want them to continue to have
the most fertile land than most of us. We want equal
distribution," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently released a list of 1480
commercial farms for compulsory acquisition and decided to
redistribute these farms to landless families in its efforts to
accelerate the land resettlement program.

a commitment to inject 29 billion Hong Kong Dollars (3,718 million
U.S. Dollars) equity into KCRC".

the dumping, storage, recycling or incineration of foreign waste
in Namibia.

Earthlife Africa last week wrote the letter demanding
clarification on the government's policy after rumours surfaced
that a South African company was hoping to import New York city's
waste into Namibia or Mozambique for burning.

<HEADLINE> Pak Bank Deregulates Currencies Except U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) has granted a general permission to authorized currency
dealers to determine their own rates of exchange for various
currencies except the U.S. dollar, it was officially announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank issued a circular to all authorized dealers in
foreign exchange on Wednesday stating that its Foreign Exchange
Rates Committee (FERC) will not publish the exchange rates of
various currencies other than the U.S. dollar to the Pakistan
rupee with effect from February 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The FERC, to date, has been fixing the rates of 25 currencies
including the U.S. dollar, British pound and Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the greenback to the Pakistani rupee will
continue to be determined and published by the State Bank of
Pakistan, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the permission granted, the SBP decided to delink
the purchase of foreign exchange other than the U.S. dollar by
importers from the relative letter of credit/registered agreement,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The SBP's move is seen as a big step forward to suppress rumors
about the devaluation of the U.S. dollar and an effort to tackle
the fallout of the financial turmoil in Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good omen that the government has taken measures to
ease the pressure of the dollar on the economy of Pakistan by
deregulating other currencies," a local banker pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani exporters have virtually been brought at par
with international competitors particularly those in Europe and
Far East.
</P>
<P>
"The international fluctuations in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar will greatly benefit trade and industry," he added.

<HEADLINE> Capital Investment Requests Fall in Israel in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The volume of capital
investment requests dropped by 27 percent in Israel in 1997 to 3.4
billion U.S. dollars from 4.6 billion dollars in 1996, figures
released Wednesday by an investment center showed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign involvement in approved projects also dropped by 42
percent in 1997, according to the center of the Israeli Ministry
of Industry and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the center approved a total of 444 projects valued
at 2.4 billion dollars in industry, tourism and agriculture
sectors, a drop of 30 percent in number and 3.8 percent in value
respectively compared with that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The center said the decline in investment requests was due in
part to the slowdown in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In tourism, it said, there was a significant slowdown in
investment, with the number of approvals for new hotels dropping
by 75 percent, and a 23 percent drop in the number of project
implementations compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
The center also attributed the drop to the reduction in
capital investment aid and the high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Many Israeli companies do not have much capital due to the lack
of market conditions for share offerings on the stock exchanges,
the center said, adding that foreigners were investing more in
high-tech companies through share purchases.
</P>
<P>
The center said that in 1998, foreign investment in high-tech
would continue to increase without any connection to the political
situation, since the main export market for these industries is
the United States.
</P>
<P>
But local economists said the stalled Mideast peace process
and the unstable political environment in Israel were the main
reasons for the reduction of investment requests and foreign
capital investment in 1997.

LANZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province has become self-sufficient in major agricultural
products, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province harvested 7.66 billion

strong demand for U.S. dollars by local companies to pay maturing
short-term debts and the negative reaction to the criteria set for
Indonesia's vice president candidate by House Speaker Harmoko
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, the offshore debt of the
Indonesian private sector was 65 billion dollars as of last
September and most of the loans were short-term debts with a
maturity of between one and two years.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko disclosed Tuesday that President Soeharto was ready to
run for the seventh term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the candidate for vice president must have
a vision on science and technology and deep knowledge of industry
and its usage.
</P>
<P>
The People's Consultative Assembly will convene in March to
elect a president and a vice president and work out state policy
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah fell, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
rose 4.01 percent to close at 466.003 points.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Restructuring Starts with Mergers, Bankruptcies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Chinese metallurgical
enterprises went bankrupt in 1997, and 38 were involved in mergers.
</P>
<P>
These steps were part of a major restructuring of metallurgical
enterprises, according to officials in the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The 16 bankrupt enterprises had combined assets of 1.746
billion yuan and a total staff of 42,000. The 38 merged
enterprises had total assets of 10.797 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fifty business firms were involved in the "personnel-reduction-
and-efficiency-enhancement" (FREE) program last year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 package of merger, bankruptcy and PREE requires the
104 companies to lay off 111,231 workers. Of the total, 66,106
will seek jobs through re-employment centers.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the reform, the Chinese government allowed banks
to write off 2.53 billion yuan, of which 820 million yuan was
listed as bad debts of the 16 bankrupt enterprises, 941 million
yuan for bank interest exemption and 769 million yuan for
settlement allowance.
</P>
<P>
Many large businesses were merged through selling stocks. A
typical example was the merger between the profitable Handan Iron
and Steel Group in north China's Hebei Province and the
debt-ridden Wuyang Iron and Steel Company in central Henan
Province.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mineworkers Try to Protect Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
mining union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), has
launched a campaign to halt further job losses.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to protect jobs was proposed after threats of
further down-sizing on gold mines.
</P>
<P>
Employment on mines falling under the Chamber of Mines has
declined from a peak of 534,255 in 1986 to 304,917 in October
last year, while thousands more jobs were lost between October
and December when the gold price plummeted.
</P>
<P>
The NUM said a total of 51,000 jobs were lost last year.
</P>
<P>
NUM Acting General Secretary Gwede Mantashe said that instead
of "barking at the growth, employment and redistribution
strategy, unions had to develop job creation strategies with
employers and government."
</P>
<P>
The NUM believed the crisis in gold mining had domestic and
international dimensions and had to be addressed at both levels.
</P>
<P>
It would launch a "protection of jobs" campaign culminating in
regional marches and a gold mining conference involving labor,
employers and government, next month.
</P>
<P>
The conference would be aimed at developing strategies to
ensure the industry remained a sustainable labor-intensive
employer, NUM officials said.
</P>
<P>
A NUM delegation reportedly left last night to meet unionists
in London and lobby reserve bank governors and finance ministers
at the annual World Economic Forum conference in Davos,
Switzerland, next week.

<HEADLINE> Chocolate Consumption Low in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The annual output of chocolates
in China has risen from several thousand tons in 1980s to more
than 80,000 tons at present. But per capita consumption of
chocolates by the Chinese people is only one percent of the people
in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the nutritive value of chocolate and its marketing
was held recently. Experts said that the main reason for the low
consumption of chocolates in China is that the overall consumption
level of the Chinese remains low. Another reason was that many
consumers think chocolates may lead to overweight and diseases
such as diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"Their worries are groundless," said some nutriologists,
"Eating an appropriate amount of good-quality chocolate does no
harm to health. Moreover, chocolate can help prevent
cardiovascular diseases and improve body's immunity."
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that the poor quality chocolates produced
by some small enterprises have ruined the reputation of China's
chocolate industry.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, experts and businessmen appealed that the
standards of chocolate and chocolate products should be perfected
and management over chocolate industry should be improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices finished mixed
on the Singapore Market although the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) rose by 14.49 points to close at 1311.4
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that as the Indonesian rupiah fell to an all time
low, investors were spurred to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
They noted that local and foreign funds continued to nibble
mainly on blue-chip stocks, helping to prop up the STII. In
addition, while property shares rose, bank shares were mostly
lower on renewed fears about their exposures to the Indonesian
economy, which were sparked by the rupiah's fall.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume shrank to 275.42 million units, valued at
462.87 million Singapore dollars (about 262.99 million U.S.
dollars). Declines led advances by 231 to 139, while 239 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 15.72 million units. It was followed
by the Singapore Technologies Engineering which had 11.83 million
shares traded. MBf Capital was next with 11.35 million shares
traded.
</P>
<P>
Yeo HSS led the gainers of the day as it rose by 62 cents to
finish at 5.6 Singapore dollars. The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
Foreign increased by 60 cents to end at 11.5 Singapore dollars,
while Khong Guan and the Singapore Land were up by 40 cents each
to close at 4.2 and 3.4 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) was the
biggest loser as it declined by one dollar to end at 16 Singapore
dollars. Creative 50 and the SPH Foreign fell by 70 cents each to
close at 32.8 and 21.9 Singapore dollars respectively. Elec lost
50 cents to finish at 5.5 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dumped Oil Seen as Hazard in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Millions of liters of
used lubricating oil are dumped down drains or set alight in
South Africa each year, creating an enormous environmental hazard
and causing huge waste in the country, the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the approximately 330 million liters of lubricating oil
purchased in the country each year, less than a fifth is
recovered, the Recovery of Oil Saves the Environment (ROSE)
Foundation, which manages the recovery and recycling of used oil
in South Africa, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Durban-based FFS Refiners, a leading processor
of waste oil in the country, showed that about 10 percent of used
oil was recovered in 1995, 12 percent in 1996 and an estimated 15
percent last year. This is well below the average rate of 30
percent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists believe that the improper disposal of used
lubricating oil contributes more to environmental pollution than
all the tanker accidents around the world.
</P>
<P>
A FFS Refiners manager said that the more oil the country
recycles, the more it saves on importing oil. However, only less
than 46,000 tons of used oil was collected in 1996 and the
remainder was poured down the drain or thrown away with the
rubbish, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the concern of the oil collectors and their call for
more stringent environmental controls, the Water Affairs
Department said that it has not found any major incidence of
deliberate dumping of used lubricants or organic solvents into
water resources.
</P>
<P>
The department said that legislation such as the Water Act and
the Hazardous Substance Act is in place to monitor and control
the dumping of chemical substances, including oil.
</P>
<P>
The dumping of used lubricant oils into domestic drains is
invariably done by do-it-yourself mechanics who do not know the
correct disposal methods, a spokesman of the department said.

Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, have withstood the test of
the time and can continue to develop.

<P>
President Kerekou said that he is here to convey to the Chinese
people the good sentiments of the people of Benin, that his visit
has been successful and his talks with President Jiang Zemin good,
and that he believes his visit will advance bilateral relations.

leadership, and that Benin's government and its people have made
an effort to develop democracy and introduce a legal system and to
govern the country according to law. The government has maintained
political stability and managed to have sustained economic
development and improve people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Kerekou said that China is a friend of the African people and
has always supported developing countries in safeguarding their
independence and dignity. In the future, he said, developing
countries should continue to help each other, unite, and cooperate
with one another for common development.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Falls to New Low Against Greenback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah plunged
to a new record low of 12,000 against the U.S. dollar in morning
trading Wednesday from 9,650/9,750 at the close session Tuesday,
but the spot rupiah recovered to close at 11,050/11,400 per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the rupiah has broken the level of
10,000 per dollar. On January 8, the currency fell to 11,000 per
dollar, compared with 2,400 per dollar in early July last year. On
Tuesday, the spot rupiah opened at 10,100/10,200 against the
dollar and closed at 9,650/9,750.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers contributed the rupiah's weakness to strong
demand for U.S. dollars by local companies to pay maturing
short-term debts and the negative reaction to the criteria set for
Indonesia's vice president candidate by House Speaker Harmoko
Tuesday.
</P>

According to government estimates, the offshore debt of the

maturity of between one and two years.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Fossils Found in Southwest China's Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Some dinosaur fossils in
Gongxian County in southwest China's Sichuan Province were
recently discovered after they had been buried under ground for
about 150 million years.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that the newly found dinosaur fossils date
back to the early Jurassic age, and most of them belong to
sauropoda, a group of gigantic, plant-eating, four-footed
dinosaurs with long necks and tails. Others include theropodas,
flesh-eating dinosaurs that walked mainly on the hind legs.
</P>
<P>
Last May, a geological prospecting team found the fossils in
Gongxian County in southern Sichuan, and local governments
immediately took measures to put the fossils under protection.
</P>
<P>
Liu Baojun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said the discovery is of great significance. So far, most of the
Jurassic dinosaur fossils found in China belong to the middle or
late period of Jurassic age, and the fossils of the early Jurassic
age are very rare.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that similar fossils have been found in India and
some other countries, but they are not as well preserved as those
found in Gongxian County. "They provided important and sufficient
evidences for the research of the origin and evolution of
sauropoda," said Liu.

<HEADLINE> Israeli People Want Peace with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli non-governmental
organization is seeking to contact Lebanese civilians in an
attempt to jointly work for an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon, local newspaper Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview conducted through email with the newspaper,
Shaul Zadka of the "Four Mothers" organization said that there is
nothing to gain from the occupation, which served only to isolate
Israel from its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if we declare a will to put out, we will
change the average attitude of the Lebanese to Israel. It would
not happen overnight but we have to start building bridges," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The "Four Mothers" was established following the mid-air
Israeli helicopter collision on February 4 last year, in which 65
soldiers and eight airmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters were en route to south Lebanon and the crash
was the final straw for four mothers of Israeli soldiers serving
in the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
"Their children lost a friend in the disaster. They concluded
that it was time to do something about the situation, which has
been dealt with before only by the military and political
establishments," Zadka said.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people signed our petitions and hundreds are
registered as members, many of them activists," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are organizing various activities which include
demonstrations, picket lines every Friday on the main road
junctions in the country, participating in panels, as well as
lobbying politicians and ex-officers and maintaining constant
contact with the press in Israel and abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the organization announced it would seek to
contact Lebanese civilians to lobby for an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We want them (the Lebanese) to believe us, if not the
(Lebanese) government, and understand our leaving their country
is not only for the sake of our soldiers but for the future
relations between the two countries," Zadka said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer
security zone in south Lebanon, clashes between Lebanese
resistance groups fighting for the ouster of the Israelis, and
Israeli troops have never stopped.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, 192 people were killed and more than 300 wounded
in the clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, has spared no effort to strengthen its
protection of copyright in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city opened its first copyright office some 10 years ago,
and has since established several special organizations and
societies to effectively protect the copyrights of local authors.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal copyright protection department
said that the vast majority of the city's publishers, printers and
editors have attended on-the-job training classes covering the
protection of copyright.
</P>
<P>
The city has also hosted several symposiums on copyright
protection and regularly publicizes the copyright information
on television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has successfully handled over 20 major copyright
cases, including a case involving the work entitled New Concept
English, a popular book for Chinese citizens learning English.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the city's legal environment has
resulted in a booming copyright industry, with the number of
copyright contracts signed annually rising from less than a dozen
in previous years to over 120 at present.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nazi (Nationalsozialist,
National Socialist) background of Heinrich Harrer, the hero of the
film "Seven Years in Tibet" which was produced in Hollywood, has
been exposed at the same time the film is being screened in the
United States and various other countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's Xinhua News Agency release of an article by Ren Yanshi
notes that the movie based on Harrer's original book of the same
title was produced to promote so-called "Tibet fever" by depicting
the experiences of Harrer who once taught the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the movie distorts historical facts
and exaggerates the stature of both the Dalai Lama and
Harrer. Various members of the Western media have lavished praise
on Harrer with titles such as "hero", "the guardian of human
rights" and the "best ambassador to Tibet".
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Harrer's true scandal has been exposed just as
some members of the media are extolling him as a
"superstar". Valid documents prove without a doubt that Harrer was
a former Nazi who has successfully hidden his identity for more
than half a century.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, Austrian correspondent Gerald Lehner discovered an
80-page document in the U.S. National Archives which detailed
Harrer's Nazi ties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a reporter from the German weekly "Stern"
discovered a file directly related to Harrer's Nazi background in
in the Federal Archives in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
According to the file, Harrer served with the German Nazi
Sturmabteilung (SA, storm troopers) as early as October 1933. The
file also points out that the unit was illegal in Austria at that
particular time.
</P>
<P>
Hitler annexed Austria on March 15, 1938, and shortly
thereafter Harrer joined in German Nazi Schutzstaffel (defence
echelon). He was assigned to Squadron 38 with a designation 73896,
and was promoted to Oberscharfuehrer (squadron leader). On May 1
that same year, Harrer joined the Nazi's with membership number
6307081.
</P>
<P>
Harrer, a "favorite of the Nazi leaders", was received by
Hitler, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Harrer and several other Germans scaled the northern slopes of
Mt. Eiger in Switzerland in July 1938 and a short time later posed
for a group photograph with Adolf Hitler. Harrer continues to have
the photo in his possession.

<P>
According to a report New York's Daily News on July 19, 1997,
Hitler held Harrer in high regard for "conquering the Eiger".
Hitler assigned Harrer to train crack Nazi troops (SS) who later
became ruthless murderers resolutely carrying out the Fuhrer's
final solution, or the extermination of Jews.
</P>
<P>
In December of 1938, Harrer married a so-called "pureblooded
Aryan". Heinrich Himmler, head of the Gestapo and commander of
the Nazi Schutzstaffel approved the marriage.
</P>
<P>
Harrer was captured by British army in India in September 1939,
with his actions while in prison proving that he was a diehard
Nazi.
</P>
<P>
On November 1, 1943, the foreign ministers of the allied
nations -- the United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain
-- announced the "Moscow Declaration" which called for the
reconstruction of Austria and cited the fact that the nation was a
victim of Nazi aggression. The declaration called on Austrian
people to liberate themselves and fight against Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after release of the declaration, Austrians in regions
controlled by Britain forces and other allied nations organized
anti-Nazi resistance groups and broke their ties with Hitler and
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, British forces accelerated efforts to screen war
prisoners, with those refusing to accept the declaration remaining
in custody.
</P>
<P>
Harrer was amongst the remaining prisoners following the
screening program.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1944, six months after release of the declaration,
Harrer succeeded in his fifth attempt to escape from
prison. Harrer and Peter Aufschneiter, a Nazi and fellow prisoner,
fled to Tibet, rather than Austria.
</P>
<P>
Various documents related to Harrer's imprisonment clearly show
that at time he wanted to go and seek refuge in Japan, Nazi
Germany's alliance in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Harrer arrived at Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, in 1946 and
became the tutor for the Dalai Lama who was 11 years old at the
time. Harrer fled Tibet in 1951. He concealed his Nazi history and
returned to Austria before resettling in Leichtenstein where he
wrote the book entitled "Seven Years in Tibet".

<P>
Harrer is a political con man living on fabricated mistruths.
Many people suspected Harrer's Nazi connections long before his
past life was fully exposed. Harrer flatly denied all accusations
and successfully concealed his Nazi past for a half century.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the discovery of the files provided indisputable
proof of his Nazi ties. Harrer then resorted to habitual trickery
and attempted to gloss over his crimes and continue to deceive the
world.
</P>
<P>
Harrer spoke in vague terms and attempted to prolong the deceit
when questioned about his Nazi files. According to Stern's
article, Harrer vehemently denied having a Nazi past even after
learning that his files had been discovered. He, in fact, denied
having ever applied for membership in the Schutzstaffel (SS -
defence echelon) or any other Nazi organization.
</P>
<P>
When shown his Racial and Residential Administration
Investigation Form and handwritten resume, both of which
demonstrated the fact that Harrer had served in the Sturmabteilung
(SA - storm troopers) in Austria and the Schutzstaffel in Germany,
Harrer was forced to acknowledge his inglorious Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
According to the Austrian Weekly Profil (43rd edition, 1997),
Harrer offered the following response to a staff reporter's
question concerning the files, "That was 60 years ago...it was
nothing. You discovered it, so you answer the question." Harrer
went so far as to proudly proclaim: "I have something to show off,
too."

<P>
Secondly, Harrer claimed that he joined the Nazis as simply a
passive act and that they, in fact, approached him.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, 1997, following the exposure of his background,
Harrer contacted Simon Wiesenthal, the well-known researcher on
Nazi atrocities, claiming that he had no close contact with the
Nazis, but asserting that they had indeed approached him.
</P>
<P>
However, Harrer's former colleague and Austrian mountaineer
Reinhold Messner refuted his assertions and said that "Harrer can
in no way claim to be simply a follower, since no one was coerced
into joining the the Nazis in 1933." The fact remains, however,
that Harrer did join the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Yet another case in point is that Nazism was illegal in Austria
in 1933. Ample documents indicate that Harrer associated
himself with the Nazis at that time in an attempt to achieve
a meteoric rise.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Harrer attempted to disavow his crime of serving the
Nazis by claiming that mountaineering was "nothing more than a
hobby."
</P>
<P>
Harrer claimed that climbing the Eiger was a personal goal,
and that he in no way intended to please the Nazis, nor obtain
Hitler's favor. Nonetheless, Stern's report claimed that Harrer
exhibited great excitement after scaling the Eiger and having the
opportunity to meet Hitler.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Harrer as saying: "It was an invaluable
reward for us to meet and talk with the Fuhrer. We scaled the
northern slope of Eiger, reached the summit and had the
opportunity to meet the Fuhrer."
</P>
<P>
Messner noted that Nazism was popular with mountaineers in
Germany and Austria in the 1930s, with the majority of Nazis in
Austria at that time having mountaineering backgrounds. The
German-Austrian Mountaineering Association which Harrer joined was
an organization with close links to the Nazis.

<P>
According to an article in the Austrian weekly Wochen Presse,
the major task of an expedition Nazi Germany sent to Tibet in 1939
was to investigate the possibility of establishing the region as a
base for attacking the British troops stationed in India. The
expedition's second major assignment was to verify Heinrich
Himmler's Nazi racial theory that a group of pureblooded Aryans
had settled in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed to the fact that Harrer had direct contacts
with the expedition. It noted that Harrer eventually managed to
escape imprisonment and made his way to Tibet. His primary
objective in going to Tibet was to recontact the expedition and
continue his "special mission."
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, Harrer attempted to conceal his connections with the
Nazis by disclaiming familiarity with members of the Nazi
expedition.
</P>
<P>
Harrer attempted to demonstrate that he had nothing to do with
the Nazis by steadfastly claiming he had absolutely no personal
familiarity with any member of the German expedition. However,
Bruno Beger, an expedition member, said he and Harrer were good
friends, and that his friend was an acquaintance of Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
Profil, the Austrian weekly, carried a later report asserting
that Harrer obtained photos from members of the expedition to
Tibet for a private exhibition, and that he had in turn published
an album of Tibetan scenery in his own name.
</P>
<P>
The Heinrich Harrer Museum in Harrer's hometown is known to
house numerous exhibits of suspicious origin. Beger verifies that
the exhibits were collected by the German expedition prior to
1939.

<P>
Hollywood has transformed Harrer, a man who rose from his
position as an ordinary mountaineer to become a favorite of Nazi
leaders, from nothing more than a notorious Nazi thug into a
"hero". The key to the miraculous transformation to a large extent
lies in his speciality at opportunism.
</P>
<P>
-- Harrer joined the Sturmabesteilung (SA -- storm troopers),
when the Nazi movement was gaining momentum in Austria in the
early 1930s. He betrayed his country and sought refuge with the
German Schutzstaffel (SS) six months after the Nazi invasion of
Austria.
</P>
<P>
His pursuit of power and fame was rewarded with an eventual
personal meeting with Hitler, who promoted him to the rank of
captain in the Schutzstaffel and ordered him train an elite Nazi
unit.
</P>
<P>
-- Harrer escaped from prison, fled to Tibet in 1944, and
became a tutor for Dalai Lama in 1946. This particular period of
experience in his life earned him the admiration of a select group
of people in the west.
</P>
<P>
Harrer hurriedly fled Tibet in 1951 just after the arrival of
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1950 and returned to Austria
in 1952. That same year, Harrer, who was fully cognizant of the
fact that his history as a Nazi would be exposed if he remained in
Austria for a prolonged period, resettled in Lietchtenstein, a
principality bordering on Austria.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, he set about fabricating the book entitled "Seven
Years In Tibet" and represented himself as an "authoritative
Tibetologist" and brave "hero" who dared engage in exploration.
</P>
<P>
"Seven Years In Tibet", which was published in 1952 and has
since been translated into some 40-odd languages, has been widely
distributed with sales exceeding five million copies.
</P>
<P>
Harrer's decision to resettle in the Lietchtenstein enabled him
to hide his Nazi past, and "Seven Years In Tibet", a pure
fabrication, provided the foundation for later "success".

<P>
Harrer's alliance with Dalai Lama was designed to build up
himself. Despite the fact that Harrer tutored the 11-year-old
Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama flatly denies the
existence of an "intimate friendship" with Harrer at first. The
Dalai's assertions that he had little, if any, impression on
Harrer have been source of utter disappointment to the latter.
</P>
<P>
Harrer launched a full-scale public relations campaign as a
means of forging a relationship with Dalai Lama. He regularly
touted his deep friendship with the Dalai and finally forced the
latter to recognize the existence of such a "relationship".
</P>
<P>
Harrer and the Dalai formed the shaky alliance in which each
pursued their own interests. Harrer strengthened his position by
claiming an intimate friendship with "the leader of the Tibetan
Buddhism", and the Dalai in turn looked to Austria as an ideal
retreat.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the disclosure of his Nazi background, Harrer and
the Dalai Lama introduced emergency revisions to "Seven Years In
Tibet".
</P>
<P>
Harrer's background was disclosed last May at a crucial stage
in promoting sales of the movie. Brad Pitt, who plays the part of
Harrer, announced that he would most likely have refused the part
had he known of the protagonist's Nazi background.
</P>
<P>
Harrer's lawyer, a representative for the producer and the
director reached a secret agreement in London to cope with the
emergency situation. A minor revision in movie added various plots
which portrayed Harrer as, though had a relationship with the
Nazi, resented and disavowed the organization. The revisions drew
a distinct line between Harrer and the Nazis.

<P>
The Dalai Lama faced a dilemma following public disclosure of
the scandal. On the one hand, he addressed the situation by
consulting with the movie producer and director, and on the other
attempted to cover Harrer and divert public attention.
</P>
<P>
"Seven Years In Tibet" was screened last October following
repeated schemes and intrigues undertaken by Harrer and the Dalai
Lama. Harrer did not attend the Los Angeles premier due to the
disclosure of his Nazi past, and the Dalai exhibited his lack of
courage by failing to attend the Austrian premier.
</P>
<P>
Harrer, a faithful Nazi, found it quite easy to eulogize feudal
serfdom and lavish praise on the Dalai Lama, the single largest
owner of serfs in old Tibet. The perplexing aspect lies in the
fact that Harrer managed to escape punishment despite his verified
Nazi affiliation. Instead, he found favor in Hollywood which
meticulously established and vigorously promoted his tainted image.
</P>
<P>
Related efforts on the part of Hollywood enabled Harrer to gain
great fame, a level of acclaim which he far from deserved.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disclosure of Harrer's Nazi background, and much to
the surprise of many people, Hollywood continues to feature Harrer
at center stage, while at the same time lying to the public to
camouflaging his heinous past.
</P>
<P>
Art, the moral nutrient of the mankind, should eulogize
rightness and rationalism. However, "Seven Years in Tibet"
lavishes praise on a notorious Nazi and induces people to admire
an officer of the Schutzstaffel dedicated to the destruction of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Extreme approaches of this nature, which blaspheme art and
diametrically oppose human spirit, lead people to believe that the
movie producer and director totally lacked rationalism and
conscientiousness, and cast doubts on the quality of Hollywood
productions.

<HEADLINE> IWA Calls on US Congress to Back off on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic World
Association (IWA) has called on the U.S. Congress to back off an
earlier resolution that considers Jerusalem the capital of Israel,
reports from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This came in a long message sent by IWA Secretary General
Abdullah Al-Obeid to the U.S. Congress last Sunday and released
Wednesday, Kuwait News Agency reports said.
</P>
<P>
The message called on the U.S. to stop dealing with Israel in a
manner that hints the acceptance of the fait accompli imposed by
Israel in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution, recognizing
Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel and calling for
moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The IWA, which said it represents 1.25 billion Muslims in the
world, said this stance undermines the credibility of the
U.S. and involves it in international law complications.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is currently divided into two parts and the
Palestinians want the Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state.

QINGDAO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The city of Qingdao, an old
industrial center in China's Shandong province, had industrial
sales of 83.66 billion yuan last year, up 26.3 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate outstripped that of the total industrial
output by 0.8 percentage points, and 97.5 percent of products were
sold during the year, up 0.6 percentage points from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The city used to emphasize increasing output and suffered from
stockpiling of goods. But since 1996, the city has developed ways
of stopping the production of five-billion-yuan-worth of
slow-selling goods. It also supported production of 19 items with
market potential like beer, color TV sets, and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The city also developed new products, spending four billion
yuan in 11 technical improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
The idea of marketing is now popular in the city. The Haier
Co., a home appliances manufacturer, for example, has more than
6,000 outlets world-wide.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Investigation Urged Against Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish deputy has started
collecting petitions among the lawmakers in a bid to launch a
parliamentary probe into former prime minister Tansu Ciller over
the slush fund scandal.
</P>
<P>
Fikri Saglar, deputy of the Republican People' Party, said
that so long as one tenth of the parliamentarians sign the
petition, the Parliament has to open an investigation against
Ciller, Turkish Daily News said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the parliament rules, the job of collecting petitions
must be completed within ten days.
</P>
<P>
Saglar said that the ruling of a lower Turkish court had
proven that Ciller, chairwoman of the opposition True Path Party
(DYP) misused the slush fund while she was prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If more than half of the deputies vote for the probe,
Ciller will have to stand trial in the Constitutional Court on
charges of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
The lower court ruling said that Ciller was swindled out
of thousands of U.S. dollars by a man who purported to be
a close friend of her. The sum of money was part of the
slush fund.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's High Appeals Court upheld the ruling later,
increasing the possibility of a judicial probe into the Ciller
case.
</P>
<P>
"The High Appeals Court decision has proved that the slush
funds were allocated outside their purposes," Saglar said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ciller had said that she was not afraid of
any kind of investigations, adding such allegation would only
make the DYP stronger.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some parties in the parliament tried to launch
a corruption investigation against Ciller, but the attempt was
smashed by then coalition government formed by DYP and the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party led by Necmettin Erbakan.

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
concluded his second round of talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu without reaching agreement over his offering of

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton started the second
round of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over
his fresh ideas aimed at pulling the derailed Middle East peace
process back on track.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of the 90-minute talks between the U.S.
and Israeli leaders Tuesday morning, Clinton said the United
States believed the important thing "would be a credible
withdrawal plan" for a pullback of the Israeli troops from its
occupied West Bank, a senior administration official
said. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
after her separate meeting with the Israeli prime minister that
the talks were "very useful" but gaps remains on various issues.

TIRANA -- Two commandos were injured on Tuesday during a police
rebellion in Shkodra, a large town in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that about ten rebel policemen
carrying machine guns rushed into the streets at 11:30 a.m. (local
time) and fired shot in the air. Later, the rebels opened fire on
the Shkodra police station and exchanged fire with the police in
the station. Two commandos were wounded and two rebels were
arrested during the clash. However, a report from the Interior
Ministry said in the evening that the situation in Shkodra had
returned to normal and all the key organs of the town were under
control of the local police and the commandos coming from
Tirana. (Albania-Police Riot)

MOSCOW -- If the Baltic countries' bid to join NATO becomes a

Tarasov said Tuesday.

<P>
Russia's stance toward the charter, Tarasov stressed at his
Tuesday news briefing, would depend on how its implementation
affected security and stability in the Baltic region and
Europe. Four days ago the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, signed a partnership charter with the United States in
Washington. Though no timetable has been set, the U.S. voiced in
the charter its support for the Baltic countries' admission into
NATO. (Russia-Baltic-NATO)

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar failed
at its third attempt to break 67 US cents Wednesday, as the
continuing financial crisis in Asia eroded offshore gains.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed unchanged at 66.23 US cents, but
well off its opening highs of 66.78 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia corporate foreign exchange
senior dealer Stavros Nitis said it was the third consecutive day
the local currency had begun near that level, but proved unable to
sustain any further strength.
</P>
<P>
Nitis said the Australian dollar continued to track the
fortunes of the Japanese yen against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said for the Australian dollar to reach 67 US cents, the US
dollar/yen would need to break through the 127.00 level, which he
said appeared unlikely at this stage.
</P>
<P>
At the close Wednesday, the Australian dollar was at 85.10 yen
from 85.61 in Sydney Tuesday and at 1.2144 marks, from 1.2188.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Fall May Delay UAE Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The slide in world oil
prices might delay the announcement of the UAE federal budget, a
local newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Financial sources said that the downturn in oil prices ...
might delay the issue of the federal budget because officials have
to review initial estimates concerning revenues for this budget,"
the Arabic-language Asharq Al-Awsat reported.
</P>
<P>
Oil earnings account for nearly two thirds of the UAE's total
revenues each year. Estimates on oil prices are decisive for the
Gulf country to formulate its budget.
</P>
<P>
World crude prices have fallen dramatically in the past weeks
to around 15 dollars a barrel, the lowest level since mid-1994.
Such a level is much lower than the widely projected 16 dollars a
barrel by the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The price collapse has forced Iran, another Gulf state to
reconsider its initially-made budget. Informed sources here said
most of the other oil-reliant Gulf countries have also begun to
review their budgets.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts attributed the collapse to some bearish
factors including declined Asian demand cause by a currency
crisis, an unusually warm winter in the northern hemisphere and
the return of sanctions-hit Iraq to oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Another key factor is the agreement signed by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in November last year to increase
the group's official output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million
barrels a day. The deal has given buyers confidence to bet on
ample supply and low prices in 1998.

regulations submitted to the provincial People's Congress for

the total number of draft regulations tabled.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Uses More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an
economic power house of China, is expected to set a new record in
the use of overseas funds in the past year, provincial foreign
trade officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that in the first 11 months of last year, the
southern China province utilized 12.94 billion US dollars in
overseas funds, a year-on-year rise of 10.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated the figure for the whole year at over 13.9
billion US dollars for 1996. It will be the fourth consecutive
year that the province's use of foreign capital surpasses 10
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Guangdong had utilized a total of 81
billion US dollars in foreign funds, with an average annual growth
of over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have not only supplied over one quarter of the
money needed for its construction, but also provided jobs for
about 10 million people, generated over 40 billion yuan (4.82
billion US dollars) in tax revenues for the central and local
governments, and helped the province to contribute about 40
percent of the country's exports, up from about 10 percent
previously.
</P>
<P>
The province has attracted investors from over 70 countries and
region to pump funds into its agriculture, industry, and service
sector in the forms of direct investment, and processing and
assembling with supplied materials, samples or parts, and the
compensation trade.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Surmount Financial Crisis: Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said on Wednesday that he was firmly convinced that Asia would
soon surmount the financial crisis and resume its dynamic economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a yearly foreign correspondent conference in
Manila, Ramos said the financial storm, which started from
Thailand in June last year, has brought difficulties to economies
of Southeast Asian nations, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he believed that Asian nations would soon
enough surmount the crisis, adding "it was just a matter of when".
</P>
<P>
For the part of the Philippines, Ramos said the country was
"less stricken" than its neighbors in the current financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It should be said that we have not suffered here the collapse
of financial institutions and customer panic that has happened in
other Asian countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
But given the uncertainties facing the country and the region,
he said, the Philippines must take measures to ensure that this
crisis would not paralyze the economy and inflict more harm upon
the people.

<P>
Although foreign borrowing by the private sector and rapid
credit expansion was relatively short in the country, and limits
were set on real estate loans, the country must work to strengthen
its capital markets and financial institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, we must continue with our tight monetary policy that
has helped sustain a low inflation environment, maintained price
stability and kept money supply within targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos added that the government would also cut its spending by
implementing fiscal austerity measures, promote export growth as
the key to recovery and continue with its various structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Ramos also said that the country would
have honest, peaceful and orderly elections in May this year and
that he would step down as his term expires in June this year.

<HEADLINE> Laid-Offs Become Top Concern of Chinese Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off workers and corruption
have ranked first and second among a list of problems Chinese
citizens are most concerned about, according to a survey of 5,000
residents in 10 major Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Beijing-based Horizon Market Survey
and Analysis Corporation, said that 92.7 percent of citizens
believed that the unemployment problem is quite serious in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that "environmental pollution," "crime"
and "inadequate social insurance" were among the top concerns.
</P>
<P>
It said only 34.8 percent and 22.7 percent of citizens believed
that "inflation" is serious.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed the citizens' concern over unemployment
to its impact on many people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
They said the crime problem ranked fifth on citizens' list of
concerns, indicating that social security has been improved in the
country while the problem had been ranking at the top of lists in
the past few years.

LOS ANGELES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Most big banks and
securities firms of the United States Tuesday reported higher
earnings for the fourth quarter of 1997, despite "difficult market
conditions in Asia," said news reports here.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's largest bank, said earnings
rose to 874 million U.S. dollars, or up by 4.5 percent, in the
fourth quarter, from 836 million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, the second largest bank, said net earnings rose to
1.06 billion dollars, or increased by seven percent, from 987
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bank of New York had biggest percentage of profit increase
among the banks. It said net earnings rose to 298 million dollars,
or up by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similar results were also reported by large U.S. securities
firms.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the second-largest securities firm, said
that its profit was up by five percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that strong markets in the United States and
Europe helped offset difficult conditions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although Asia dampened profits at many Wall Street firms in the
fourth quarter, it did not stop them from posting exceptional
results for the year as investors and companies were captivated by
the raging bull market, they said.

<HEADLINE> State Sector in Northeast China Recovering From Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises in
Liaoning Province, a leading industrial area in northeast China,
ended an eight-year period of economic losses in 1997, a
provincial official reports.
</P>
<P>
State-owned firms produced 66 million yuan in profits last year
and a combined output value of 152.3 billion yuan, a 10-percent
rise over the previous year's figure. The number of money-losing
firms dropped by 63 and their losses fell by 350 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official attributes the changes to adjustments in the
industrial structure over the past two years, when 139 small firms
were merged with others, 162 poorly-managed enterprises declared
bankruptcy, and 60 large enterprise groups were built. Over 80
percent of small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have
changed their property rights and management systems.
</P>
<P>
As a result, state assets worth 17 billion yuan were put to use
again and liabilities were down an average of 4.3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The province spent 24 billion yuan on technology changes last
year.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem of workers laid off by state-owned
enterprises, 155 re-employment centers have been set up, providing
new jobs for a million people, or half the unemployed workers in
Liaoning.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Build Five New Cities by 2015: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will build five new
cities to tackle housing and service problems under a proposed
plan for a growing population within 17 years, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
According to local Arab Times Wednesday, Director of the Third
Kuwait Master Plan Waleed Al-Jassim said Kuwait is swiftly heading
for an enormous shortage of housing and services unless the
government endorses and executes the plan.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures projected a population increase of 1.6
million, or 70 percent, from the current 2.2 million to 3.8
million by the year of 2015.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jassim said "our projections show that Kuwait requires
357,970 new houses and apartments by the year 2015," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait's metropolitan area has nearly reached the
maximum tolerable density, indicating that new cities are needed
to build houses for the people.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the only way for the government to solve the
growing housing shortage is to transfer initiative for
construction to the private sector and prospective house owners.
</P>
<P>
The Third Kuwait Master Plan lays down the country's planning
strategy for the period between 1995 to 2015, but it has yet to be
endorsed by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the plan to clear all remaining
administrative and technical hurdles by the beginning of next
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he also regretted that "too many committees and
bodies are involved in the decision making process, while too
many people are waiting for housing" in the country.

<HEADLINE> Lanzhou to Attract Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu province, has become increasingly popular for
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that Lanzhou, once a major city along
the "silk road" in history, had established 1,137 overseas-funded
enterprises by the end of 1997. They have brought in 1.51 billion
U.S. dollars of contractual investment from 34 countries and
regions, including the United States, Japan and Thailand, as well
as Hong Kong and Taiwan. And 715 million U.S. dollars has been
utilized.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city introduced more than 81.8 million
U.S. dollars, 55.1 million U.S. dollars of which was actually
used, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures, co-operative enterprises and wholely
overseas-funded companies operate in 28 fields, covering
petrochemical, pharmaceutical and real estate sectors. More than
61 percent are involved in production.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the local investment environment and
attract more overseas funds, the city, which ever played an
important role in the economic and cultural interchange during the
Western Han (206B.C.- 24A.D.), has paid close attention to the
construction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The overseas-funded enterprises have contributed greatly to the
city's economic growth, and the city would provide more favourable
terms for overseas investors, said Vice-Mayor Yang Yongzhong.

HEFEI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Opening wider to the outside
world has enabled east China's Anhui Province to witness
substantial growth in foreign trade and the introduction of
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The province's foreign trade volume for 1997 hit three billion
US dollars, up nine percent from 1996, with exports jumping 14

<P>
The province attracted foreign investments totalling 771
million US dollars in 1997, up 16 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas-funded businesses has increased

<HEADLINE> Economists: Latin America, Market for U.S. West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Latin America could be an
alternative for California in the United States West Coast as
eastern Asian market is sagging, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
In a report released last week, a team of economists from Bank
of America, California's largest and third-largest in the United
States, said that Latin America could make up the expected decline
in California's exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
California's exports to all markets are forecast to reach 113.5
billion U.S. dollars this year, up three billion dollars from that
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
As exports to the Asian countries account for slightly more
than half of its total, the state will be more affected by the
Asian economic slowdown than the rest of the United States, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the economists said, higher interest rates in
Asian countries will affect the region's ability to import capital
goods, which make up a high percentage of California's exports. If
economic conditions in the Asian countries worsen, California's
export growth will be reduced from the current estimates.
</P>
<P>
Set against this backdrop, Latin America becomes more
attractive a destination for California exports in 1998, the
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The report expects California's exports to the region to grow
by 17 percent to 16.7 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting the region's increasing demand for electronic products,
computers, telecommunication networks and related equipment as
well as automotive and infrastructure equipment, the report said
that the massive privatization of key state-owned industries in
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina will sustain the high demand for
California's capital export products.
</P>
<P>
"The current economic environment provides an ideal time for
exporters to explore means of tapping the growing potential of the
Lation America market," the report said.
</P>
<P>
California used to have little interest in opening trade with
the region. Outside Mexico, which is California's third-largest
trading partner, Latin America right now accounts for less than
one percent of the state's total exports.
</P>
<P>
But things have been changing as seen in the first half of last
year, when California's exports to Brazil, Argentina and Chile
jumped by nine percent over the previous year, and exports to
Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador increased by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
While with an eye on Latin America's growth of capital,
stability of markets and increasing size of the middle class,
business executives here minded each other with the pitfalls in
doing business in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also mentioned poor infrastructure, currency crisis
particularly in Brazil and drop in oil price, which will hurt many
Latin American countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin has
said that making a cleaner and more efficient government is an
urgent matter.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while giving a report at the first session
of the 11th Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which is being
held here.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Jia pointed out that bureaucratism and formalism
prevent the government work from being perfect, so the municipal
govewrnment in the next five years will work to improve efficiency
and develop a more democratic and scientific approach to decision
making.
</P>
<P>
To do this, Jia said, officials will need a better
understanding of economics, finance and some other subjects. But,
most importantly, officials must serve the people whole heartedly
and do their utmost as public servants.
</P>
<P>
As the reforms continue, government departments are expected to
streamline themselves, unqualified officials will be dismissed,
and more competent people will be selected through examinations.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the anti-corruption efforts will continue to
work for cleaner government and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Crashes Out, Fromberg Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Mark Philippoussis crashed to
a humiliating defeat while fellow Australian Richard Fromberg
pulled out a career-best performance at the Australian Open today.
</P>
<P>
In a match he should have and could have won, Philippoussis was
out-served, out-run and generally outplayed by a
moderately-performed Moroccan with a greater will to win.
</P>
<P>
Hicham Arazi, a 24-year-old from Casablanca, beat Philippoussis
1-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 9-7 in a second round match that left the
Australian short on explanations.
</P>
<P>
For Fromberg, the second round brought a victory he said was
one of the most important of his career and his best in a grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
He beat last year's runner-up and seventh seed Carlos Moya of
Spain 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4, ending a year of frustration and
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
As a result he came into today's match ranked 56th against
Moya's ninth.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Venus Williams defeated her younger sister Serena
Williams 7-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The pair, braided, black and blessed with talent, slugged it
out on center court before a crowd which was not sure who to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
In the opening set they traded service breaks but Venus, 17,
quickly took control as 16-year-old Serena succumbed to a knee
injury, a legacy from last week's Aadidas International in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The two are intent on wasting little time marching to the top
of the world rankings in women's tennis and this match is sure to
be the first of many between them.
</P>
<P>
"What you saw today was something for the future to watch,"
Serena said later.
</P>
<P>
While the attention was on the extrovert duo, fellow American
Lindsay Davenport was involved in a titanic fight on an outside
court with Slovakian Karina Habsudova.
</P>
<P>
The No.2 seed eventually clawed her way through to the third
round, beating Habsudova 2-6, 6-0, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
Australia's day was completed by the defeat of Australian Scott
Draper who went down 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 to sixth seed Petr Korda of the
Czech Republic.

NANJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered the ruins of 4,000-year old buildings in east China's
Jiangsu Province which are similar to modern construction.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000-square-meter ruins was found in Yunzhong, a town

structure belonged to the Longshan Culture, a late Neolithic

</P>
<P>
Archeologists have discovered remnants of four ancient
residential houses at the site. The architecture
design and building structure of the houses are similar to
farmers' houses in the province, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The ruins of one two-room house looks just like a popular rural
residence in the area. The house is 23 square meters with its door
facing the southwest for more sunshine in winter.
</P>
<P>
The building remnants proved that the residential design has
been followed from generation to generation, and is still in use

MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian
Development Bank (ADB) assured Wednesday the Philippine government
of its full support to help the country weather its current
currency problems similarly plaguing other Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
In a working breakfast meeting with President Fidel Ramos, ADB
president Mitsuo Sato said the ADB is also preparing in 1998 more
assistance to the country in the event that the government may
require additional bank resources.
</P>
<P>
Sato reaffirmed ADB's commitment to the country to make
available the bank's financial and technical resources to assist
the government in overcoming the present difficulties and reaching
the social and economic goals and objectives set out in
Philippines 2000.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ADB has granted from 1992 to 1997 a total of
long term loans of two billion U.S. dollars to the Philippines, in
addition to some 38 million in grant assistance.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, the ADB has lined up 500 million U.S. dollars
in total assistance to the country for various environment,
agriculture, education projects.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has indicated that at present there would seem
to be no immediate requirement for the provision of large-scale
balance of payments support by the ADB in the current currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
ADB vice president Peter Sullivan said the ADB believes that
the Philippine government has managed the currency crisis
effectively.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Increase Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- In 1998, Cuba will exert more
efforts in exploring domestic oil resources in a bid to increase
production, Cuban oil department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said in 1998, Cuba plans to drill 17 new oil wells
compared with four wells in 1997. At present, Cuba produces 29,600
barrels of crude oil everyday.
</P>
<P>
To explore its oil resources, Cuba began to introduce foreign
investment in recent years. So far the Cuban national oil company has
reached 40 agreements on its oil exploration with foreign companies
with a total foreign investment of 250
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cuba mainly produces diesel oil and heavy oil which can be used
in sugar, power and mining industries. And most wells also produce
natural gas that is estimated by the oil department to reach 200
million cubic meters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cuba used to rely on the former Soviet Union for oil supply and
now has to buy from the expensive international market, creating
somewhat economic crisis for herself.
</P>
<P>
Last year Cuba adopted the policy of self-reliance and began
to explore domestic oil wealth to reduce imports.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Netanyahu Start Second Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton started the second round of talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his fresh ideas aimed at
pulling the derailed Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of the 90-minute talks between the U.S.
and Israeli leaders Tuesday morning, Clinton said the United
States believed the important thing "would be a credible
withdrawal plan" for a pullback of the Israeli troops from its
occupied West Bank, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters after
her separate meeting with the Israeli prime minister that the
talks were "very useful" but gaps remains on various issues.
</P>
<P>
"There are gaps. We are trying to narrow those gaps,"
Albright said. "I think we're doing well, given the fact that
we're working on very, very difficult issues."
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about are the appropriate elements for a
further redeployment -- that is timing, the quality, quantity
and, of course, security aspects involved in that," she said.
</P>
<P>
Before the second round of the talks, Netanyahu told Fox News
Channel that he had discussed with Clinton and Albright an
agreement to cede certain territory to the Palestinians under the
condition that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat keeps his promises
to crack down Muslim extremists.
</P>
<P>
It is "a deal... in which as the Palestinians comply with their
promises, Israel withdraws from territory that is not vital to its
defenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Netanyahu had brought with him a modest offer to
Clinton on Israel's pullback from the West Bank, which was
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to conduct a further redeployment to advance
the peace process, provided we don't touch on Israel's basic
security requirements," he said during the interview with Fox.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any possibility to meet with Arafat on
Thursday when the Palestinian leader came to Washington for
talks with Clinton on the same subject.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Officials Asked to Declare Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
asked all government officials to submit immediately their annual
return of assets in a bid to ensure accountability and
transparency in the conduct of civil servants, the local press
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Establishment recently issued a circular asking
government officials at all levels to submit their annual return
of assets and declare their properties in accordance with the
Government Servant (Conduct) Rules 1979.
</P>
<P>
Officials working with ministries, departments and directorates
shall submit their papers to the Discipline and Inquiry Cell under
the Ministry of Establishment headed by Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, the circular was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Newly recruited government officials have been asked to make a
declaration, at the time of entering the public service, of all
movable and immovable properties held by themselves or by members
of their families, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Section 13 of the rules stipulates that "Every government
servant shall make a declaration to the government ... of all
immovable and movable properties belonging to or held by him or
her or a member of his or her family" when entering government
service and "submit to the government ... an annual return of
assets ... showing any increase of property afterwards."
</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, the rules have not been adhered to by
government officials, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> Police Riot in Northern Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Two commandos were injured on
Tuesday during a police rebellion in Shkodra, a large town in
northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that about ten rebel policemen
carrying machine guns rushed into the streets at 11:30 a.m. (local
time) and fired shot in the air.
</P>
<P>
Later, the rebels opened fire on the Shkodra police station and
exchanged fire with the police in the station. Two commandos were
wounded and two rebels were arrested during the clash.
</P>
<P>
One report said that several armed rebels entered the Shkodra
government building, holding some officials hostage and ordering
the local police chief and his commandos to leave Shkodra.
</P>
<P>
However, a report from the Interior Ministry said in the
evening that the situation in Shkodra had returned to normal
and all the key organs of the town were under control of the local
police and the commandos coming from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The riot was crushed, said the ministry, adding that all the
rebels had been suspects of some smuggling and robbery cases.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Shkodra, a strong base of the current largest
opposition party, the Democratic Party, remained strained in
recent days when the Interior Ministry dismissed and replaced the
town's police chief and dispatched a group of commandos.
</P>
<P>
The riot broke out when the new police chief started an
investigation into a number of smuggling and robbery cases in
which some local policemen were involved.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the Democratic Party accused the current
government of making vindictive attacks on the opposition and
called for the withdrawal of the new police chief and his
commandos to avoid more clashes.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling Socialist Party charged the local leader of
the Democratic Party for instigating the riot and asked law
enforcement agencies to check into all anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party also called on the people in Shkodra to
draw a clear line of demarcation between themselves and the
criminals.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held informal talks
Tuesday on the future of Europe and the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, here on a five-hour visit, said the planned single
European currency, to be named euro, "will arrive and will
continue on it track and no one will stop it."
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the European home will continue to move
forward," the German chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
After the adoption of the new currency on January 1, 1999,
"even those who are against it today will claim that they had
always been in favor of the single currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Kohl was facing heavy pressure to support
Italy's aspiration of joining the first wave of European Union
countries switching over to the single currency system.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to speculations that Germany opposed Italy
in the euro, Kohl said "there is too much comment on something
which has not taken place, and this seems absurd to me."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Prodi said Italy and Germany share a "common
objective of building Europe" and both want Europe to be
economically strong and politically united.
</P>
<P>
A united Europe must be governed by strict criteria and this
was "not only in Germany's interest, but also at this historic
moment, in Italy's," Prodi said.

VIENNA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Viktor Klima said here Tuesday that the EU was making progress in
pursuing common foreign policy by sending a mission to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Klima made the remark after the EU council meeting of ministers
on Tuesday. He said sending a mission to Algeria was a "very
important step" for the EU in pursuing common foreign policy,
although the result of the mission could not be expected to have
an enormous effect.
</P>
<P>
According to local TV station reports, the Austrian
representative of the EU mission to Algeria, Benita Ferrero
Waldner, maintained that the mission was not very fruitful but it
was making progress.
</P>
<P>
Three junior ministers from the European Union departed on
Monday for a 24-hour mission to Algeria to discuss ways to end a
wave of brutal killings in the oil-rich North African state.
</P>
<P>
Led by Britain's Junior Foreign Minister Derek Fatchett, the
mission was sent after nearly 1,100 civilian villagers were
slaughtered in Algeria in three weeks.

The two officials in their discussions pledged to further the
two countries' friendly cooperation, according to Chinese
diplomats close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Maciel spoke highly about the full-fledged growth
of bilateral relations in various fields since the two countries
established diplomatic ties 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange of visits by senior officials have further
propelled the expansion of Sino-Brazilian cooperation, he noted.
</P>

issue at the United Nations human rights commission.

<P>
Chen Junsheng said his visit was aimed to explore, by touring
Brazil's agricultural cooperatives, the possibilities for the two
counties to work together in tapping agricultural resources.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Brazilian officials, the two sides agreed to
send teams of experts to each other's farm technologies, so as to
forge stronger agricultural cooperation in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese official arrived in Brazil on Sunday,

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Make Further Talks with Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Tuesday that President Bill Clinton would have a
further discussion with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
over some U.S. fresh ideas for salvaging the moribund Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The president has presented some ideas. We have been
elaborating on them for the prime minister," Albright told
reporters after a separate, two-hour meeting with the Israeli
leader.
</P>
<P>
She said the two leaders would meet for a second time later on
Tuesday to discuss all these fresh ideas. U.S. and Israeli
officials said the second session will take place at about 9:45
EST (0245 GMT on Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
Albright said the talks between Clinton and Netanyahu was "very
useful" but she admitted there were gaps remaining on various
issues.
</P>
<P>
And White House spokesman Mike McCurry also said a lot of hard
work remained to be addressed after the first 90-minute session
this morning between Clinton and Netanyahu. "We didn't anticipate
the heavens to open today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes the further withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from the West Band is one of the important things
for the Middle East peace process to be pulled back on track.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton offered his view, during his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on
Tuesday, that the United States believed the important thing
"would be a credible withdrawal plan" for redeploying Israeli
troops from the occupied West Bank, a senior U.S. official said
after U.S. and Israeli leaders meeting.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright reiterated the U.S. view that "in order
for us to put all the pieces of the Middle East peace process back
together, one of the important pieces is the further redeployment."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had hoped that Israel could offer a
sizable and credible pullback of the West Bank, that was helpful
in pushing peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to further redeployment, we do believe that it
needs to take place in a way that it is credible, that the size
needs to be significant," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said after his talks with Clinton that there was no
breakthrough for any redeployment of the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking for a joint formula to advance the peace
process ... No agreement has yet been formulated," he told Israel
television in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Rubin did not disclose what size of pullback the United States
believe was needed for pulling together the pieces of peace
process. But according some reports, the United States proposed a
12 percent of the West Bank to be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu was said to have brought a modest offer of 9
percent of the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the Palestinians,
which certainly falls short of U.S. expectation and even far away
from the demand of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, who said
Israel should yield 80 or 90 percent of the territory and half of
jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Netanyahu, Clinton indicated he was not
planning to pressure the Israeli leader on the issue of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we ought to talk about is what both sides can do
now," he said at a photo session with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also confirmed that neither the U.S. president nor
his aides had tried to apply under pressure on him to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth time that Clinton met with Netanyahu.
Clinton, claiming to be the sponsor of the Middle East peace
process, has not been very happy with Netanyahu constantly turning
a deaf ear to U.S. repeated warning over Israel's moves that were
in contradiction with Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
With regard to israel's unilateral action of establishing
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Rubin said the U.S. view was
that this kind of unilateral action could only "make it difficult
to create an environment for the negotiations and make it harder
to create success in those negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians has
almost been collapsed because of Israel's decision to build Jewish
housing units in Arab East Jerusalem and refusal to withdraw from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After failures of U.S. mediations by its envoy Dennis Ross and
Albright, Clinton has to come out to deal directly with Netanyahu
and Arafat, whom Clinton will meet on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns Against Baltic Entry Into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- If the Baltic countries' bid to
join NATO becomes a reality, this would definitely lead to a
review of Russia's relations with NATO, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Tarasov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, signed a partnership charter with the United States in
Washington. Though no timetable has been set, the U.S. voiced in
the charter its support for the Baltic countries' admission into
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia's stance toward the charter, Tarasov stressed at his
Tuesday news briefing, would depend on how its implementation
affected security and stability in the Baltic region and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the document does not refer to Russia's offer to reduce
its number of troops, or its proposal for strengthening security
and stability in the Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin last October revealed Russia's
security plans for the Baltic, but the plans fell on deaf
ears. Tarasov said Russia wished that concrete Baltic security
measures would be based on Moscow's proposals.

inspectors and Iraqi authorities, he said Russia had submitted a

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks for Further Gulf War Compensation </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government recently
asked the United Nation Compensation Commission (UNCC) for another
95 million US dollars in compensation for damage during the Gulf
War, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The request follows the earlier approval by the Geneva-based
UNCC of more than 24 million US dollars in compensation for 6,298
Thai people who had to return to Thailand from Iraq and Kuwait
during the Gulf War, Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Thinnakorn
Kannasutra was quoted Wednesday by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new request concerns damage to 173 Thai agencies, most of
which were private companies, he added. The Department of
Employment, which asked for more than 6 million US dollars, is the
sole government agency involved.
</P>
<P>
"Consideration for the new request may take more time because
the commission has to investigate a lot of evidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Social Welfare Ministry submitted the earlier
request for 24 million US dollars in 1992 through the Thai
Permanent Mission in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers to Discuss Banana Regime, Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
agriculture ministers met Tuesday on new proposals for a banana
regime and continuing ban on the imports of hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting here was the first of the kind since
Britain took over the rotating EU presidency in January.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Farm Minister Jack Cunningham said the banana regime
was particularly important to Britain. "Reaching agreement on this
dossier will be a high priority for my presidency," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new banana proposals involve scrapping the current import
license system, which has been under attach for allegedly favoring
fruit from former British and French colonies.
</P>
<P>
It has also been proposed that the EU grants aid to African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) growers to help them maintain a
competitive edge against larger Latin American producers.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO), which ruled that the old
banana regime broke free trading regulations, has given the EU
until January 1999 to modify its policy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> High Demand for Dollars Sends Indonesian Rupiah Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The high demand for U.S.
dollars from local companies dragged the Indonesian rupiah
(national currency) down further Tuesday to a new low of 10,500
against the greenback in morning trade, dealers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the rupiah break the level of 10,000
per dollar. On January 8, the rupiah fell to 11,000 per dollar,
bringing the loss of the rupiah to 300 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah managed to recover in the afternoon on news that the
German government would help Indonesia settle offshore loans in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The spot rupiah recovered to close at 9,650/9,975 in Jakarta
against an opening of 10,100/10,200.
</P>
<P>
Horst Kohler, a special envoy of Germany's Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, said here Tuesday he would propose to Kohl to ask German
banks to con-tribute constructively to a solution to the foreign
debt problem of the Indonesian private sector.
</P>
<P>
Kohler, who is leading a special German delegation here to
assess Indonesia's economic situation, said finding a rapid
solution to Indonesia's private offshore debt was of crucial
importance in dealing with the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a government estimate, the offshore debt of the
Indonesian private sector was 65 billion U.S. dollars as of
September last year. Most of the loans were short-term debts with
a maturity of between one and two years.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah fell, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
rose 2.05 percent, supported by a late rally on banking stocks on
expectations of more bank mergers and buoyant trading in blue-ship
stocks, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The composite index surged 9.01 points to 448.91 Tuesday from
439.01 the previous day.

<HEADLINE> Thai Frozen Chicken Exports expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
the Betagro Group is one of Thailand's largest agri-business
group.
</P>
<P>
Suthep was quoted Wednesday by local press as saying that there
had been a market increase in overseas orders for Thai chicken
after the Hong Kong's bird flu killed at least four people. The
volume of the Thai frozen chicken exports is expected to jump 25
percent this year over that of the last year to 200,000 tons, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the first quarter of every year is a low season for
orders, but we received large number, particularly from Japan, our
main market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the baht against the dollar makes the price
of Thai frozen chicken as competitive as those from low-cost
producers like China and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of Thai Frozen chicken exports look especially
bright this year," Suthep said.
</P>
<P>
The bird flu scare may help increase Thai frozen chicken
exports to Hong Kong although it is unlikely to jump significantly
given Hong Kong's preference for fresh chicken, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Moves to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is focusing its attention on bringing down commercial
banks' interest rates to around 20 percent, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson has
recommended for approval by the Monetary Board the proposal of the
Bankers Association for the reopening of the 30-day repurchase and
lending window at an interest rate of one percent over the 90-day
Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase window will allow banks to avail of cheap funds
from the Central Bank and earn an interest spread that is higher
than when they borrow from each other overnight, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added, however, that commercial banks availing of the window
will be required to reduce their overbought dollar position by 50
percent, or 5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singson also recommended for approval another
proposal by the Bankers Association for the outright sale of
banks' government securities holdings to the Central Bank at
market rates.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the adoption of the twin measures would enable
banks to reduce their interest rates to around 20 percent, but he
could not say how soon and by how much banks would cut their
rates.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that interest rates are not likely to go down to
their pre-devaluation level of 14 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the depreciation of the Philippine currency of
peso since July last year, the banks' interest rates now stand at
between 25 and 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Further progress in reducing
weapons of mass destruction should be made because of the
opportunities afforded by the end of the Cold War, said United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the 1998 session of the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) which opened here Tuesday, Annan emphasized that
"nuclear disarmament must be pursued more vigorously, particularly
by nuclear-weapon states, with a view to the progressive reduction
and complete elimination of nuclear weapons at the earliest date."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's message was read out by Vladimir Petrovsky,
his personal representative and the CD secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, I expressed serious concern at the spread of
various types of conventional weapons, especially landmines and
small arms which are extensively used in regional and sub-regional
conflicts," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
A consensus has been reached on the re-establishment of the
Department for Disarmament Affairs, Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 session of the CD is to take place in three parts with
the first part from January 20 to March 27, the second from May 11
to June 26 and the third from July 27 to September 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
agreed Tuesday to continue bilateral efforts to curtail the
U.S. military presence in Japan's southernmost island prefecture of
Okinawa, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held at the Japanese Prime Minister's official
residence, Hashimoto and Cohen reaffirmed the importance of an
agreement reached in December 1996 by the bilateral Special Action
Committee on Okinawa (SACO).
</P>
<P>
Under the SACO agreement, the U.S. agreed to return the Marine
Corps Futemma Air Station in Okinawa in five to seven years on
condition that the station's heliport functions are maintained in
some way.
</P>
<P>
In line with the accord, Tokyo selected Nago in northern
Okinawa as the best candidate for the substitute heliport, but the
government's plan has been strongly opposed by local residents.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the difficulties the SACO agreement on the
Futemma Air Station is currently facing in Nago, Hashimoto vowed
to maintain bilateral cooperation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cohen agreed on the importance of continued joint efforts on
the Okinawa issue.
</P>
<P>
Following Hashimoto-Cohen meeting, Japan and the United States
established a comprehensive planning mechanism to put into force
the revised Japan-U.S. guidelines on bilateral defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was initialed at a top defense meeting involving
Cohen, Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and Defense Agency
chief Fumio Kyuma.
</P>
<P>
Cohen flew into Tokyo earlier Tuesday from Beijing on his
seven-nation Asian tour which has already taken him to Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and China. He will leave for South
Korea on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> NZ Inflation Sinks to Six-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's inflation rate
last year sank to the lowest level since 1992, said Statistics NZ
in a media release received Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The office put the consumer price index (CPI), or headline
inflation, in 1997 at 0.8 percent, the lowest since the year
ending March 1992, when it was also 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But underlying inflation, which excludes interest rates, rose
1.6 percent in the year. Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash is
contracted by the Government to keep underlying inflation between
0 and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts predict that in view of the low inflation,
short-term interest rates will fall within a week.
</P>
<P>
At the present, 90-day bank bill rate, the key indicator for
commercial banks to fix their interest rates, stands at around 9
percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine "Comfort Women" Demand Japan's Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Five Filipino women forced into
sexual slavery by Japanese troops during World War II rejected on
Tuesday an apology and an offer of compensation money from
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the former "comfort women" as saying that the
letter of apology, received on January 1, did not fulfill their
demands for an admission of responsibility. The letter was
returned to Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million Yen (9,302 U.S. dollars) compensation package
was "unrealistic" since it was to be paid out over a five-year
period, said the women now aged between 67 and 72.
</P>
<P>
"Only an official apology accompanied by state compensation
will fulfill Japan's legal responsibility and realize justice for
us," they said.
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women throughout Asia
were forced to supply sexual services to Japanese troops during
the war. Most of the former Filipino "comfort women" have died.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Wins in Four Sets at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- No.2 seeded Pat Rafter of
Australia held off hot-tempered American Jeff Tarango to win their
first-round match at the Australian Open tennis in Melbourne
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Tarango was warned for unsportsmanlike conduct in the fourth
set, which Rafter eventually won to take the match 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(7-4), 6-7 (7-4), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Tarango, who had argued several times during the match with
chair umpire Mike Morrissey, was warned after losing serve at 2-3
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
"You owe me twice and you know it," Tarango yelled at the
change of ends, also angrily holding up two fingers to stress his
point.
</P>
<P>
Tarango was referring to two tight calls in the fifth game
which went against him.
</P>
<P>
The American was then warned and he called out tournament
referee Peter Bellenger, who spoke to him before play resumed.
</P>
<P>
Tarango was banned from the 1996 Wimbledon tournament after an
infamous clash with French referee Bruno Rebeuh the year before,
the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Tarango broke back immediately after tonight's warning, but
Rafter played some brilliant shots to break the American's serve
again and take a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
He served out the match with an ace.
</P>
<P>
Rafter started the match shakily, dropping his first two serves
to trail 3-0.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian then broke back twice and held serve to
force a tie break for the first set.
</P>
<P>
Rafter dominated it and then raced to a 4-1 lead in the second
set, but this time it was Tarango's turn to fight back and force
the tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, Last year's American Open champion, again prevailed to
take a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
The third set went to serve, with Tarango taking a 4-0 lead in
the tiebreak and then holding off Rafter's challenge to keep the
match alive.
</P>
<P>
Rafter appeared to be flagging at this point, but lifted in the
fourth and played some brilliant shots in the decisive 11th game.
</P>
<P>
The scrappy American never gave up throughout the match and
frequently upset his better-credentialed opponent with outstanding
court coverage.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's popularity helped set an attendance record today, with
the day/night aggregate of 48,134 an all-time best.
</P>
<P>
It beat the mark of 42,120, set on day five at last year's event.
</P>
<P>
The daytime crowd of 34,789 was also the first time the Australian
Open had attracted more than 30,000 to a session.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 29,398 had been set in yesterday's opening
session.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A. de O Sales resigned here
on Tuesday from the post of the president of the Amateur Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Sales, 78, who has been the leader of the local sports'
governing body for 50 years, announced his resignation during its
monthly Council meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has high standing in the world of sports
because of its good performance and of the fact that the Amateur
Sports Federation and Olympic Committee has been conducting its
affairs in a correct and serious way according to the regulations
of the International Olympic Committee, the Olympic Council of
Asia and other international sports organizations.
</P>
<P>
"So it's time for me to step down because of the change of
circumstances" and for personal reasons "as I must turn my
attention to my own affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new organization will have to just carry on, but must have
working people, hard-working and serious people to develop sports
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok, vice president of the Hong Kong Sports Development
Board, told reporters after the Council meeting that some friends
had suggested that he comes out to be more involved and do more
for Hong Kong's sports. He said he would consider the proposal
and might apply to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's no longer necessary to argue about Hong Kong's
identity as the issue has been clearly settled down. Now the main
efforts should be on how to develop and improve Hong Kong's
sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sales and I and all my colleagues have long contributed to
the development of Hong Kong's sports and as Hong Kong has
returned to the motherland, I think local sports should enjoy more
share of resources for its development programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fok said that Hong Kong should take the advantage of its unique
position of being part of China as well as an international city
to further build up its reputation in international sports arena.
</P>
<P>
The Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee will select
its new president on March 24, with candidates to be nominated at
least 21 days ahead.

<HEADLINE> US: Further Withdrawal Important for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes
the further withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the West Bank is
one of the important things for the Middle East peace process to
be pulled back on track, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton offered his view, during his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House
today, that the United States believed the important thing "would
be a credible withdrawal plan" for redeploying Israeli troops from
the occupied West Bank, a senior U.S. official said after U.S. and
Israeli leaders met.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright reiterated the U.S. view that "in order
for us to put all the pieces of the Middle East peace process back
together, one of the important pieces is the further
redeployment."
</P>
<P>
He said Albright had a breakfast with the Israeli prime
minister, and then Clinton had a meeting with him, that lasted
about 90 minutes, in which the secretary of state also attended.
</P>
<P>
Albright "felt the meetings were businesslike and that
substantive issues were fully explored and fully addressed," Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had hoped that Israel could offer a
sizable and credible pullback of the West Bank, that was helpful
in pushing the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to further redeployment, we do believe that it
needs to take place in a way that it is credible, that the size
needs to be significant," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said after his talks with Clinton that there was no
breakthrough for any redeployment of the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking for a joint formula to advance the peace
process.... No agreement has yet been formulated," he told Israel
television in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Rubin did not disclose what size of pullback the United States
believed was needed for pulling together the pieces of the peace
process. But according to some reports, the United States proposed
a 12 percent of the West Bank to be handed over to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu was said to have brought a modest offer of 9
percent of the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the Palestinians,
which certainly falls short of U.S. expectations and even far away
from the demand of the Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat, who said
Israel should yield 80 or 90 percent of the territory and half of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Netanyahu, Clinton indicated he was not
planning to pressure the Israeli leader on the issue of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we ought to talk about is what both sides can do
now," he said at a photo session with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would have "a detailed, frank, good discussion"
with the Israeli leader. "We are going to work hard to make
progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth time that Clinton met with Netanyahu. Clinton,
claiming to be the sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has
not been very happy with Netanyahu constantly turning a deaf ear
to U.S. repeated warning over Israel's moves that were in
contradiction with Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Israel's unilateral action of establishing
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Rubin said the U.S. view was
that this kind of unilateral action could only "make it difficult
to create an environment for the negotiations and make it harder
to create success in those negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have
suspended for over 10 months because of Israel's decision to build
Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem and its refusal to
withdraw from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After failures of U.S. mediations by its envoy Dennis Ross and
Albright, Clinton has to come out to deal directly with Netanyahu
and Arafat, whom Clinton will meet Thursday.

<HEADLINE> British Farmers Protest at Downing Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- British farmers demonstrated at
Downing Street here Tuesday, demanding compensation for strength
of the pound and beef ban which are crippling their industry.
</P>
<P>
The farmers also delivered to 10 Downing Street a petition of
500,000 signatures, urging the government to recognize "the
special needs of people who live and work in the rural areas".
</P>
<P>
Before going to the Downing Street, thousands of farmers
gathered at the parliament, protesting over the beef ban and the
sale of cheap imported meat.
</P>
<P>
At a rally, National Farmers' Union President Sir David Naish
urged the government to take up the offer of compensation offered
to farmers by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Never since the Second World War has such pressure been put on
the providers of the nation's food," he said.
</P>
<P>
The strong pound makes British food more expensive to sell
abroad and reduces the value of EU subsidies, an important part of
farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are also feeling beleaguered by the EU's ban on British
beef exports, imposed following fears of "mad cow disease".

<HEADLINE> US Defends Its Ambassador to Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
today rejected accusations by a former U.S. diplomat that the
American ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, is an "ardent
apologist" of the Irish Republic Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, Former Ambassador Raymond Seitz blamed
Smith for what he says is an all-time low in Anglo-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
"It became obvious she wanted to promote the reunification of
both parts of Ireland, even if one of the parts happened to lie in
the United Kingdom," an Associated Press report quoted Seitz as
saying in his book.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said that he has not seen the book by Seitz but
defended Smith's performance in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"The charge that Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith is an apologist
for the IRA is ridiculous," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Seitz, who served in London from 1991 to 1994, also charged
that the Clinton administration leaked secret information about
Northern Ireland to IRA sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
"The president's involvement in creating the conditions for a
cease-fire and promoting the peace process has led us to a point
where everyone is sitting down and talking about peace right now,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved far beyond the situation when Ambassador Seitz
was there, and sometimes people on the other side of a policy
battle, you know, wish things weren't true that were true," he
said.

<HEADLINE> European Shares up on Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
opened weaker on worries over Asia Tuesday, but later managed to
end higher, supported by the dollar's strength, bid fever in
pharmaceuticals and steady gains in U.S. shares.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market had been pulled both ways
during the session before ending at 5,278.2, up 4.6 points or
barely 0.1 percent in heavy volume as the market tracked Wall
Street's performance.
</P>
<P>
The market got a strong boost from gains in the drug sector on
confirmation that Britain's SmithKline Beecham was in merger talks
with U.S. group American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said that an early drug sector-led rally
tailed off as investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, worries about sterling's strength and possible
interest rate rises weighed on market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended almost half a percent higher,
thanks to the still firm dollar and market expectations of Wall
Street gains.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that mildly better Asian markets also helped share
prices. The DAX-30 index closed 22.97 points up at 4,307.91.
</P>
<P>
French stocks in Paris ended higher for the sixth session in a
row after a slow start as technical difficulties forced the market
to open two hours late.

The CAC-40 index finished the session above the 3,000-point
level at 3,008.34, a rise of 21.39 points.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 42 million U.S. dollar loan for Argentina's emergency
flood project.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided to help Argentina with emergency response
to El Nino in the provinces bordering the Uruguay and Parana
rivers and in the provinces of the northwestern Andean region of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The loan is part of a 60 million dollar project, which is also
financed with 18 million dollars from 12 participating Argentine
provinces.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has been felt in Argentina for several months producing
flooding that has displaced thousands of people from their homes
in the large Parana River Basin in Argentina, especially along the
high-banked Uruguay River, which rarely floods. The country is now
bracing for the effects of El Nino which is expected to produce
torrential rain and mud-slides in the Andean provinces of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project is the third El Nino related project that the World
Bank has financed in Latin America and the Caribbean. Projects
have also been approved for Ecuador and Peru.

<HEADLINE> US: Pullback Important for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes
the further redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank is one
of the important things for the Middle East peace process to be
pulled back on track, State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters today.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the American view is concerned, I am confident that
Secretary (of State Madeleine) Albright reiterated our view that
in order for us to put all the pieces of the Middle East peace
process back together, one of the important pieces is the further

He said Albright had a breakfast with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington Monday night, and
then President Bill Clinton had a meeting that lasted about 90
minutes, in which the secretary of state also attended.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges US to Apply Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that he would ask Washington
to persuade Israel to keep its peace commitments in order to break
up the Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking for the impossible, but rather for the
implementation of the agreements that we signed under the auspices
of U.S. President (Bill) Clinton at the White House," Arafat told
an Egyptian TV program.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement at the end of his two-day visit to
Egypt during which he held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the latest developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He left here Tuesday morning for Paris to drum up support of
the European leaders before meeting Thursday with Clinton in
Washington in a make-or-break attempt to save the faltering
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. wants Israel to withdraw from more West Bank territory
and freeze Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians to crack down
harder on violence as a prelude to jump-starting talks on a final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed
an interim agreement granting the Palestinians limited autonomy in
1993, paving the way for the following Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements were not only signed by the Palestinians and
the Israelis, but also by President Hosni Mubarak, King Hussein of
Jordan, the U.S., Russia, the European Union and Norway," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mideast peace process has had hard time ever since
the government of Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in June 1996,
the Palestinian leader lamented.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians cannot accept any kind of formula
other than the one that is based on the UN resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Israeli troops have to withdraw from all the
occupied Palestinian territories when it comes to the final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has warned that if the peace process
fails, the Palestinians are open to all options, including a
return to Palestinian uprisings in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat talks on Monday focused on the ideas the
Palestinian leader is expected to present to Clinton in a bid to
push forward peace talks that ground to a halt last March after
Israel started to build a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
and Palestinian militants later responded with suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab leaders also discussed the Israeli plan to keep
control over strategic areas in the West Bank in a final peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has in the past helped mediate between Israelis
and the Palestinians, has repeatedly urged the Clinton
administration to force its Israeli ally to honor signed peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab officials and commentators see the talks in
Washington as a last chance to break the 10-month-old impasse and
demand that Washington induce Israel to modify its hard line on
peace.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Arafat is expected to meet Mubarak in Cairo
again.

CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The National Bank of Kuwait Tuesday declared a
73.5 million Kuwait Dinar (242.55 million U.S. dollars) net
profits in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Board Chairman, Mohammad Abdelrahman Al-Bahr, said
in a press release that all bank activities proved very productive
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that consolidated balance sheet aggregate was up to
4,118 million dinars (13.59 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank, the largest commercial bank in Kuwait, was
established in 1952.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Nearly 2.3 million tourists visited Israel last
year, a drop of 3 percent compared to 1996, according to figures
released Tuesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and
Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decline was actually less than what had
been predicted, despite the three major suicide bombings attacks
in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem last year.
</P>
<P>
"The predictions had been for a catastrophe, but after all the
terror attacks this year, the number was more or less the same as
last year," ministry spokeswoman Orly Doron said.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said there had been a major decline in the number of
incoming tourists during the first half of 1996 following a series
of terror bombings launched early that year by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
But this leveled off during the second half of 1996, and the
number of visitors remained stable through last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The World Bank has granted to Lebanon a loan of 63
million U.S. dollars to help boost the country's technical
training and education, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement was signed recently by the bank's
representative Vasilios Demetriou and Lebanese Minister of
Professional and Technical Education Farouq Al-Barbir.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support technical education,
strengthen administration and vocational programs, renovate
and enlarge existing schools in the country.
