<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Backs Smart Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG declared Monday  
that production of the mini Smart car would continue, dismissing as 
``speculation'' a weekly newsmagazine report that the model could 
be cancelled unless sales improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel in its Monday edition said that DaimlerChrysler  
co-chairman and co-CEO Juergen Schrempp had given the Smart unit 
``six months at the most'' to improve sales or he would cut off 
investment in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler spokesman on Monday said the company had no  
plans to stop production, noting that orders had been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the magazine, Schrempp told managers he would  
``turn off the money tap'' on the cartoonish, two-seater car if 
sales did not increase substantially this year. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has invested $1.1 billion in developing the  
Smart model, which is built in Hambach, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has changed management of the Smart unit,  
lowered prices and launched a sweeping ad campaign to improve 
sales, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Cooke, Casserly Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Howard Milstein filed suit Monday against  
Washington Redskins president John Kent Cooke and general manager 
Charley Casserly, claiming they interfered with his failed attempt 
to buy the team for $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a lawsuit about money. It is a lawsuit about  
principle,'' Milstein's group, Washington Sports Ventures, said in 
a statement released through the law firm Boies &AMP; Schiller. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cooke and Casserly's regrettable conduct in blocking and  
interfering with our bid to acquire the Washington Redskins, and 
their refusal to even discuss an amicable resolution, leaves us 
with no other recourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages. It does not ask for an  
injunction to stop the sale of the team to Daniel Snyder, 
Milstein's former partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder formed his own group and submitted his own $800 million  
bid last month after Milstein, a New York real estate man, 
withdrew. Snyder's bid is expected to be approved by NFL owners 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein withdrew his bid, which would have set a record price  
for a professional sports franchise, at a league meeting April 7 
after it became apparent that he did not have the 24 votes needed 
for approval among the 31 NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that, with the support of Mr. Casserly, Mr. Cooke  
engaged in a systematic effort to undermine the bidding process in 
an attempt to acquire the team for himself,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He effectively used league officials and certain owners  
themselves to unfairly block our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke called the charges ``petulant.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milstein withdrew his bid to buy the Redskins. I did,  
too,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference between us is Mr. Milstein sues. I will go on  
to play in another arena. In the meantime, if I must, I will gladly 
defend myself against these petulant charges which have no merit 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly had no comment. The NFL also declined comment. A  
spokesman for Snyder said only that Snyder has nothing to do with 
the suit. Milstein declined to elaborate on the suit beyond his 
released statement. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of Milstein's withdrawal, he reached an oral agreement  
not to sue the league in return for his $30 million deposit. That 
agreement has never been signed, and Milstein's statement called it 
a ``separate matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's father, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, died in April  
1997 and ordered in his will that the team be sold and the process 
used to establish a charitable foundation for college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein won the resulting bidding war, but was opposed by many  
NFL owners for several reasons. Some felt he was using too much 
borrowed money, others were concerned about his ownership style, 
while several voiced a preference for Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein said he invited Cooke to join his group, and that Cooke  
should have supported Milstein's bid once it was chosen by the 
trustees of the elder Cooke's estate. John Kent Cooke was also a 
trustee, but did not take part in negotiations for a buyer because 
he was also bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his role as an executor of his father's will and trustee of  
the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, Mr. Cooke had an obligation to 
support our purchase of the Redskins, which provided $75 million 
more for disadvantaged youth than Mr. Cooke's own best bid,'' 
Milstein's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein said any damages awarded would be used to fund a  
Washington-based foundation ``dedicated to helping young people.''

<HEADLINE> Crowds Watch Gator Kill, Eat Prey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Up to 150 people watched for hours as a  
12-foot alligator ripped apart a smaller gator and ate it in a lake 
at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The show ended when trappers were called in to kill the  
predator. 
</P>
<P>
	The big alligator, estimated at 600 pounds, started eating the  
small one Saturday morning in Lake Alice. The big gator bit into 
its prey and slung it to break it into pieces that could be 
swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds formed, and those watching gasped and cheered as the  
gruesome show continued through the day at the university, whose 
sports teams are nicknamed the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the tail first, started swallowing it,'' said Dave  
Krukowski, a student. The gator ate the smaller animal all the way 
up to the back legs ``and then started body-slamming it, trying to 
rip it in half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd applauded as trappers who had been sent by the state  
hoisted the big gator into their boat.

<HEADLINE>  Arafat to Israelis: 'Elect Peace' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had a simple  
message today for Israelis heading to the polls: ``Elect peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short in words, the message was long in meaning: a carefully  
couched appeal to vote for Labor's moderate candidate, Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	In public statements, Palestinian leaders have tried to remain  
neutral in Israel's race for the premiership. But behind the 
scenes, most hoped the tenure of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's hard-line government was coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Arafat was being updated throughout the day on the  
voting and expected that he would watch the televised results 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters as he entered his seaside Gaza office today  
what message he had for the Israelis on their big day, Arafat said 
simply, ``To elect peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Israelis stood in long lines at polling stations across the  
country, Palestinians went about their daily lives but were barred 
from entering Israel until midnight, after the voting was over. 
</P>
<P>
	In the divided West Bank town of Hebron, restaurant owner Khalil  
Natshe said he would turn on his TV to watch exit polls later 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in the daily Al Quds newspaper said today's  
elections test Israel's desire to achieve reconciliation with the 
Palestinians and Arab world at large. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today poses a true opportunity for the Israelis to prove to  
what degree they ... want a better future for the next 
generation,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israelis should know now, more than at any time before, the  
connection between progress in the peace process and internal 
Israeli issues such as economics and security,'' Al Quds wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Al Ayyam newspaper, editor-in-chief and Arafat adviser  
Akram Hanyieh wrote that Israelis will be faced with a choice 
between a return to confrontations espoused by Netanyahu or for a 
path which dares to raise the slogan ``money for education not for 
settlements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Netanyahu government's expansion of Jewish settlements as  
the election neared has angered Palestinians. The latest example 
came on the eve of the voting when work resumed at the 
controversial Har Homa housing project in east Jerusalem, where 
Palestinians wish to establish the capital of an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
	Salah Tamari, a Palestinian legislator, said the decision to  
build at the site known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghaneim was ``a 
desperate attempt by Netanyahu to get some last minute votes from 
extremists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ground-breaking at Har Homa in March 1997 touched off riots and  
froze peace negotiations. Building of housing itself only began 
Sunday with the work halted again today by the national election 
holiday. Tamari said he was not hopeful that even a new Barak-led 
government could stop it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians want Israel's next prime minister to bring about  
the swift resumption of the peace process, which would lead to 
further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and negotiations on 
a final peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the Barak promises to revitalize the peace process,  
Hanyieh cautioned Arab and world leaders to wait and see what Barak 
does. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next prime minister has a hard test ahead of him -- to  
prove his ability in peace making, and no one can in full 
confidence bet on his success in that test,'' Hanyieh wrote.

<HEADLINE> Tomko Shines in Reds' Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Brett Tomko and manager Jack McKeon see  
eye-to-eye on one thing: The Cincinnati Reds need their most 
promising young pitcher in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, there's little they agree on.  
</P>
<P>
	Tomko made a triumphant return from the minor leagues on Sunday,  
allowing only four hits in 8 2-3 innings of a 3-0 victory over the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the most encouraging developments of a two-week  
homestand for the Reds, who aren't going to get out of their 
season-long rut until they get some consistency out of their 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	With Denny Neagle still slow to come around from a weak  
shoulder, Steve Avery sidelined by a blister and Jason Bere 
struggling, the Reds have to have Tomko at his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him,'' McKeon said, summing it up in three words.  
</P>
<P>
	Informed of McKeon's comment, Tomko smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's nice to know,'' he said. ``When you get sent down,  
there's a lot of thoughts that go through your mind. You find out 
who's really behind you and who's not. A lot of things happen. A 
lot of people said things that didn't sit too well with me. So 
that's nice to hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between manager and pitcher was strained in  
spring training last year, when Tomko missed a start because of a 
tender shoulder. McKeon thought his young pitcher was being too 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
	They had another go-round this season after Tomko went 0-1 with  
a 7.76 ERA in five starts. McKeon and pitching coach Don Gullett 
urged Tomko to pitch inside more and felt that he resisted. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tomko was sent to Triple-A on April 29, the Reds  
characterized it as a wake-up call. Tomko was brought back when 
Avery came down with a blister and he responded with the best start 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, it was clear that the 26-year-old pitcher and the  
68-year-old manager are still on different wavelengths. McKeon said 
Tomko had done so well because he followed advice and changed how 
he pitched; Tomko insisted he'd done no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was doing the things he did last year,'' McKeon said. ``He  
was pitching inside. That's all (Gullett) talked about all year, 
using the inside half of the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko's take on it?  
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, I didn't try to pitch any different than when I was  
up here before,'' Tomko said. ``It's just that I had command of my 
fastball and could move the ball around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never not trying to throw inside. I think that was a  
good blame, a point to say, 'He's not doing this.' And that was not 
the point at all. The fact that I had trouble throwing the 
fastball, period, was the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether the sometimes strained relationship  
between manager and pitcher will turn into a problem. The Reds 
can't afford to have Tomko drift off again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko developed into the Reds' most promising young pitcher in  
1997, when he went 11-7 with a 3.43 ERA in 22 games as a rookie. He 
followed with a 13-12 record and 4.44 ERA in 34 starts last season, 
his fourth in pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion in April and the Reds' explanation for it shocked  
Tomko, who had started the season opener because of injuries to 
Denny Neagle and Pete Harnisch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first night was pretty rough,'' Tomko said. ``I had a  
whole gamut of emotions going, thoughts like, 'Am I not good 
enough? What are they thinking?''' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it appears the demotion had the intended effect. Asked  
if Tomko needed it in order to get turned around, McKeon said, ``I 
don't know. He'd probably say no. But he hadn't pitched like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only start where he pitched like the Tomko we know.  
He's very fortunate that Avery came up with that blister.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko will agree with McKeon on one other thing: The trip to the  
minors made an impact on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn to appreciate what you have up here,'' he said.  
``It's a jungle down there.''

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for WTO, but Has Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's foreign trade minister said Monday that  
China hopes to join the World Trade Organization by year's end but 
that there are limits to the concessions it can offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The minister, Shi Guangsheng, told visiting Australian Deputy  
Prime Minister Tim Fischer that Beijing remained committed to 
getting into the WTO, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Shi acknowledged the commitment made by trade ministers from the  
United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union last week to 
see China in the Geneva-based WTO this year, but suggested that 
concessions from Beijing are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to tell them that there is an ultimate limitation  
on what China can offer,'' Xinhua quoted Shi as saying. ``We will 
never go beyond that limitation in making our commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shi was the highest ranking Chinese official to speak on the  
subject since NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia 
on May 7. The bombing, which the alliance said was an accident, 
probably strengthened the hand of anti-Western hard-liners in the 
leadership and came at a critical time in China's 13-year effort to 
join world trade's leading rule-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the bombing, senior officials had criticized the  
broad market-opening offer Premier Zhu Rongji made in Washington 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``China will never sacrifice its own fundamental interests to  
join the WTO,'' Shi was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters OK Car Haulers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Teamsters truckers have sent management  
negotiators a message as talks with 17 car haulers continue: 
They're ready to strike, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The truckers voted 5,705 to 251 to give their negotiating  
committee the power to call a strike against any or all of the 
companies, which haul new cars and trucks to dealers nationwide, if 
talks fail. Teamsters president James P. Hoffa said Monday that the 
vote was a strong statement that the truckers were prepared for a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are buying new cars in record numbers,'' he said. ``The  
industry is making big money. It's time the owners shared the 
profits with the people doing the hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide strike against the car haulers could put the brakes  
on the auto industry's record sales pace so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone would have a problem'' if there were a prolonged  
walkout, Ford Motor Co. president Jac Nasser said. Nasser said his 
company was keeping in close contact with the Teamsters and the 
trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract, which expires May 31, covers about  
12,000 drivers, mechanics, yard and office workers nationwide. If a 
strike were called, industry officials expect the Teamsters 
initially would target just one of the major trucking companies 
that contract with automakers to move new cars and trucks to 
dealers from assembly plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	A likely target is Allied Holdings Inc., the largest of the  
trucking companies. Based in Decatur, Ga., Allied operates about 
5,200 car- and truck-hauling rigs from 120 terminals in the United 
States and Canada, and serves all the domestic and foreign 
automakers with North American plants. It handles about two-thirds 
of the U.S. car-hauling market. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Steve Wright declined to say what steps Allied was  
taking to prepare for a possible walkout. The trucking companies 
are negotiating as a group with the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are negotiating in good faith,'' Wright said. ``We have  
every confidence there will be a mutually agreeable, workable 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters are seeking improved pensions, higher wages, a  
reduction in ``excessive work hours'' and improved health care. 
They also say they oppose proposals for a two-tier wage structure 
and a reduction in some trip rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management is demanding that these hardworking men and women  
receive less for doing one of the most difficult jobs in the 
transportation industry,'' Hoffa said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, U.S. sales of new cars and light trucks are up  
9 percent. A prolonged strike in the midst of the strong spring 
selling season could be devastating to automakers and dealers 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Short term, it's not going to affect us a great deal,'' said  
Dan Moore, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler AG. ``Long term, it will 
affect all our plants. We're hoping, of course, for no strike at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and other automakers are preparing contingency  
plans should a walkout be called; they likely would use their own 
drivers and hire independents to help get some vehicles to dealers.

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks in Music, Video Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- RealNetworks Inc. and Snap.com today announced a  
pair of deals that will help Internet users find music and video on 
the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks said it will incorporate a search feature into its  
RealPlayer G2 software using Snap.com technology as the search

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Hall of Fame Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A former probation officer at the Suffolk County  
Courthouse pleaded guilty Monday to stealing two wills signed by 
baseball Hall of Famers and selling them for more than $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Schnabel, 56, of Pembroke, Mass., pleaded guilty to two  
counts of larceny over $250. Boston Municipal Court Judge Sally 
Kelly sentenced him to a year of probation and ordered him to pay a 
$5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel, who resigned before he was charged in the case, also  
must pay restitution to the buyers of the stolen wills and return 
payments to the purchasers of similar documents he admitted 
stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Schnabel, a probation officer for 15 years,  
stole the two Hall of Famer wills from the courthouse where he 
worked in the fall of 1996. The documents were kept in the 
registrar's office at the building. 
</P>
<P>
	One document was signed by George Wright, a player for the  
Cincinnati Red Stockings in the late 1800s. The other was signed by 
Thomas Connolly, an umpire in the 1920s. Both men were elected to 
the Hall of Fame, and both wills have been returned to the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stolen bases are legal in baseball, but stealing documents  
from baseball's greatest stars is a crime,'' said Richard Iannella, 
Suffolk County's register of probate. 
</P>
<P>
	Several stolen papers, however, are still missing from Suffolk  
County, including the wills of ballplayers Sam Curran, ``Gentleman 
George'' Haddock, Jackie Manning, Miah Murray, ``Buck'' O'Brien, 
Jack Slattery, Tom Smith, Denny Sullivan and Hall of Famer Thomas 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the missing documents led authorities in other  
parts of the country to realize they had experienced similar 
thefts.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Investors snapped up dollars today on expectations  
of a widening gap between U.S. and Japanese bond yields, pushing 
the greenback to a two-month high against the yen. Tokyo stocks 
fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.14 yen in late trading, up 0.96 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
122.73 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 389.37 points,  
or 2.32 percent, to close the day's trading at 16,421.02 points. On 
Friday, the average closed down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar began its rise after Japan's  
Finance Ministry reported that the March current account surplus -- 
Japan's broadest measure of trade -- fell 25.5 percent to $8.76 
billion from the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the figures were released, the dollar jumped to 123.36  
yen, its highest level since March 5, when it touched a high of 
123.58 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But market players said the news had little direct impact on  
currency markets. Instead, they attributed the dollar's rise to a 
slew of factors that pointed to further gains ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the list are expectations that interest rate  
differentials between the U.S. and Japan are set to widen further, 
in light of stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also followed remarks by U.S. Treasury  
Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers, who reiterated on Sunday that 
a strong dollar is in his country's national interest, augmenting 
lower inflation and trade income. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged from 122.82 to 123.40 yen in today's trading.  
The euro was traded at 131.27 yen, up from 130.33 yen late Friday 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell sharply after fears of  
higher U.S. interest rates led to a big drop Friday on Wall Street, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow fell 193.87 points to 10,913.32, erasing a  
106.82-point gain Thursday, after data showing a 0.7 percent 
increase in consumer prices caused bond yields to rise and sparked 
fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve might change its monetary 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares prices were lower across the board, with major  
exporters also racking up losses despite the sharp gains of the 
dollar against the yen, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong U.S. dollar usually pushes shares in exporters higher  
on hopes that their products will become cheaper overseas and that 
their repatriated earnings will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market seems to be saying it wants additional measures to  
stimulate the economy,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of 
the stock division at Tokyo Securities, referring to recent 
speculation that the Japanese government may up spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo today, an estimated 578.06 million shares changed hands  
on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 728.03 
million shares Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 1,064 to 
176, while 72 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 25.02 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,322.43. 
The TOPIX closed down 4.52 points, or 0.33 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unchanged from Friday's close of 1.230 percent, priced at 
102.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> Europe Telecom Deal Draws Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France Telecom is seeking several billion dollars  
in damages from Deutsche Telekom, saying the German company's 
planned merger with Telecom Italia violates previous pacts between 
the French and German telecoms operators. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal action announced Monday marks a deepening of the split  
between the German and French companies, which are linked by 
several joint ventures and cooperative agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom chairman Michel Bon has warned since Deutsche  
Telekom and Telecom Italia announced plans to merge that such a 
deal could damage the Deutsche Telekom-France Telecom partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger plan between Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia,  
without the slightest discussion with France Telecom, seriously 
damages the trust between the (French and German) partners,'' 
France Telecom said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact amount of the damages sought will be specified during  
the course of the court proceedings, the French company said. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said it had filed its complaint against Deutsche  
Telekom in the International Court of Arbitration of the 
International Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have reciprocal two percent  
shareholdings, and together with Sprint Corp. of the United States, 
they own the Global One joint venture. They also hold minority 
stakes in the Italian telephone company Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, who declined to be named, said  
the merger wasn't designed to work against the company's partners. 
``We just hope to see the problem resolved in a more sensible and 
professional manner,'' the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> 'Mummy' Hangs On to Top Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A string of low-budget, independent films  
peppered the box office this weekend yet ``The Mummy'' continued to 
grasp the No. 1 spot with $25.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Moviegoers endured the final ``Star Wars''-less weekend of the  
year, what some might call the calm before the storm troopers, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earning a total of $80.8 million in only two weeks of release,  
``The Mummy,'' a swashbuckling story of a group of explorers who 
accidentally resurrect an ancient Egyptian priest, has become the 
season's biggest blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' and two other big-budget spectaculars --  
``Entrapment'' and ``The Matrix'' -- held off a horde of 
bacchanalian fairies in the latest film version of ``William 
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The update of the Bard's lighthearted romp through a mystical  
forest, starring Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci and 
Calista Flockhart, opened this week in fourth place with $4.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes caper ``Entrapment'' starring Sean Connery was  
No. 2 with $8.7 million, while ``The Matrix'' featuring Keanu 
Reeves was third with $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening in fifth place was the Hong Kong martial arts thriller  
``Black Mask,'' starring Jet Li as a mild-mannered librarian who 
becomes a masked crimefighter. The film earned $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The urban comedy ``Trippin','' about a rambunctious teen-aged  
daydreamer, debuted in seventh place with $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In limited release, ``Tea With Mussolini,'' the story of a boy  
raised by eccentric Englishwomen in World War II Italy, landed in 
10th place in only 270 theaters, earning a per-screen average of 
$6,296. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend was considered a virtual wasteland by most studios  
who feared a black hole-effect from the impending opening of ``Star 
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' The hyper-publicized sci-fi 
prequel opens Wednesday and is expected to draw audiences away from 
most other movies. 
</P>
<P>
	That may account for the unusually high number of smaller films  
in the top 10 this weekend, according to Robert Bucksbaum, a Reel 
Source Inc. movie analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually want to open a film five days before the  
most anticipated film of the decade, and perhaps of all time,'' he 
said. ``When you do, you're either hoping to get spillover audience 
from the sold-out 'Star Wars' shows, or you're trying to appeal to 
a totally different audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Films such as ``Tea with Mussolini'' and ``A Midsummer Night's  
Dream,'' are aimed at older audiences who couldn't care less about 
The Force, while ``Trippin,'' and ``Black Mask'' may draw a younger 
crowd who can't get tickets to the prequel, Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 2.2 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Deep Impact'' was No. 1 followed by ``The 
Horse Whisperer'' and ``The Quest For Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Mummy,'' $25.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Entrapment,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Matrix,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $4.4  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Black Mask,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Life,'' $2.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Trippin','' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2.45 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Election,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Tea With Mussolini,'' $1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Web Bookstores Discount Bestsellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A price war among the three biggest online  
booksellers broke out Monday when Amazon.com announced 50 percent 
off all New York Times best sellers, and Barnesandnoble.com and 
Borders.com immediately matched the discount. 
</P>
<P>
	The deep discounts will mean the companies will make little or  
no profit on the books, but the offer could stimulate sales of 
other more lucrative products as customers browse through the Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves will probably cut deeper into the profits of  
traditional bookstores, said Christopher E. Vroom, an industry 
analyst in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will increase the pressure on smaller booksellers  
and result in further consolidation in the industry,'' Vroom said. 
``Booksellers that have carved a particular niche in the 
marketplace will continue to prosper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three companies have traditionally offered best-selling  
books at discounts from 20 percent to 40 percent below list price. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offer will apply to both hardcover and paperback titles  
on The New York Times best-seller lists, which are updated weekly 
with at least 68 titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The price cuts ``are clearly intended to drive traffic to their  
sites,'' said analyst Amy Ryan of Prudential Securities in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon may be in a position to benefit the most. It is rapidly  
diversifying beyond books into sales of music, videos, toys, drugs 
and electronics, and has recently begun an online auction service. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders are the No. 1, 2 and  
3 Internet booksellers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts generally believe that all three are currently losing  
money on their online operations, however the explosive growth of 
the Internet has raised expectations for outsized profits in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Amazon.com incurred a $36.4 million loss in this  
year's first quarter but has more than $1.4 billion in cash on its 
balance sheet following a giant bond offering in January. 
Barnesandnoble.com, based in New York, and Borders, of Ann Arbor, 
Mich., do not disclose earnings figures for their online 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The big chains may be able to accept losses on the best sellers  
because those books represent a relatively small portion of their 
online sales, while some smaller traditional booksellers rely more 
on the big-name books. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com vice president Ben Body said the Times  
bestseller list accounted for less than 3 percent of its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, analyst Vroom said, traditional chain bookstores in  
malls and general-purpose independent book retailers rely on best 
sellers for 30 percent to 35 percent of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com hasn't disclosed how much it pays for books but, but  
typically merchants can get books at about half the list price. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, the Amazon.com spokesman, hinted that the company has  
been able to buy books at cheaper prices lately. The company's 
customer base has grown from 1 million to 8.4 million in less than 
a year, ``so we have tremendously more purchasing power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two independents, Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., and Elliott  
Bay Book Co. in Seattle, said Monday they expected little effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Powell's extensive used, antique and rare book  
collections, ``we don't feel like we're competing directly with 
those (online) stores,'' said Dave Weich, who manages the store's 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even have a New York Times bestseller display in our  
store,'' Elliott Bay manager Tracy Taylor said. ``Our customers 
don't particularly come in looking for those titles ... it's just 
never been that kind of a store.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Lewis Didn't Use Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The doctor who performed an autopsy on Celtics  
captain Reggie Lewis after he died while practicing jump shots 
testified Monday he did not see evidence the player used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Evans, the state medical examiner, said he believed  
a virus caused the cardiac arrhythmia that killed the 27-year-old 
Boston star in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, is suing three doctors who  
treated her husband, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated a 
fatal heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Alleged cocaine use by Lewis is expected to be a central issue  
when Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the player's main cardiologist, presents 
his case. Mudge's attorney has said that two weeks before Lewis' 
death the player said he used the drug, and the late admission made 
an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge told Lewis he suffered from a neurological condition that  
causes fainting spells, while earlier a ``Dream Team'' of 12 
doctors diagnosed him with a life-threatening arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Harris-Lewis' attorney, Evans said scarring  
found on Lewis' heart was likely caused by a virus. Lewis' official 
cause of death was listed as adenovirus 2, which could have led to 
inflammation of the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, 
ultimately, a fatal cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Scarring also can be caused by cocaine use.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no indication this man had been a chronic user of  
this drug,'' Evans said, adding the scarring Lewis had would be 
``atypical'' for a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Mudge's attorney, Richard Dailey Jr.,  
suggested at least five of seven consultants called in by Evans to 
examine Lewis' body did not agree with his findings, and some felt 
the scarring was consistent with cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey suggested the virus could have been present, but that  
there still could have been a number of other problems.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks, Hawks Banged-Up But Ready  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last man standing wins the series.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Ironmen -- uh, make that Hawks -- appear to barely  
have enough players to put on the court against the New York 
Knicks, who look like they stopped off at a heavyweight fight on 
their way to the second round of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing is hurting. So is Chris Crawford. And Chris  
Childs. And Alan Henderson. And Charlie Ward. And Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for both teams, there's no time for any R&AMP;R. The  
best-of-7 Eastern Conference matchup between the Hawks and Knicks 
begins Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be tired,'' Atlanta guard Steve Smith conceded.  
``But we've got all summer to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are trying to shake off the effects of grueling,  
five-game victories in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	New York became only the second No. 8-seeded team to knock off a  
No. 1, shocking the Miami Heat 78-77 when Allan Houston hit a shot 
with 0.8 seconds remaining Sunday. A few hours later, the Hawks 
rebounded from two double-digit losses in Detroit to beat the 
Pistons 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, already bothered by sore knees and an aching Achilles'  
tendon, suffered a muscle strain in his right side during the third 
quarter of the deciding game in Miami. But, wincing and clutching 
his side, he still managed 22 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with as much courage as I've seen,'' Houston said.  
``He was in so much pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing is day to day against the Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a man who went above and beyond in terms of pain  
tolerance,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I don't think he 
can do that on a nightly basis, but I'm hopeful he'll be able to 
play this series effectively. ... Who knows? Whatever he can give 
us, we'll take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing isn't the only New York player who's hurting. Childs  
managed to play 19 minutes in Game 5 despite a bruised right thigh. 
Ward will need surgery for bone chips in his right knee after the 
season. Johnson, looking much older than his 30 years, has bad 
knees and a chronically aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Atlanta's MASH unit features Crawford, who  
missed the final three games of the Detroit series with a separated 
right shoulder. There's also Henderson, who's managed only four 
minutes against the Pistons before his season came to an abrupt end 
because of double-vision in his left eye. And don't forget LaPhonso 
Ellis, already lost for the year since undergoing hernia surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel sorry for yourselves,'' Hawks forward Tyrone  
Corbin said. ``You have to go with what you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford -- who replaced Ellis in the starting lineup for the  
final 30 regular-season games -- was able to practice Monday and 
expects to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to play,'' Crawford said. ``After a few  
days off, it feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks haven't given up on Henderson, either, hoping that one  
morning he removes the patch from his injured eye and finds his 
vision cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know for sure, but we're holding out hope that he can  
come back and help us,'' said Grant Long, who replaced Henderson 
and set a career playoff high with 26 points in the finale against

<HEADLINE>  Knicks, Hawks Banged-Up But Ready  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last man standing wins the series.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Ironmen -- uh, make that Hawks -- appear to barely  
have enough players to put on the court against the New York 
Knicks, who look like they stopped off at a heavyweight fight on 
their way to the second round of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing is hurting. So is Chris Crawford. And Chris  
Childs. And Alan Henderson. And Charlie Ward. And Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for both teams, there's no time for any R&AMP;R. The  
best-of-7 Eastern Conference matchup between the Hawks and Knicks 
begins Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be tired,'' Atlanta guard Steve Smith conceded.  
``But we've got all summer to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are trying to shake off the effects of grueling,  
five-game victories in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	New York became only the second No. 8-seeded team to knock off a  
No. 1, shocking the Miami Heat 78-77 when Allan Houston hit a shot 
with 0.8 seconds remaining Sunday. A few hours later, the Hawks 
rebounded from two double-digit losses in Detroit to beat the 
Pistons 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, already bothered by sore knees and an aching Achilles'  
tendon, suffered a muscle strain in his right side during the third 
quarter of the deciding game in Miami. But, wincing and clutching 
his side, he still managed 22 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with as much courage as I've seen,'' Houston said.  
``He was in so much pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing is day to day against the Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a man who went above and beyond in terms of pain  
tolerance,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I don't think he 
can do that on a nightly basis, but I'm hopeful he'll be able to 
play this series effectively. ... Who knows? Whatever he can give 
us, we'll take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing isn't the only New York player who's hurting. Childs  
managed to play 19 minutes in Game 5 despite a bruised right thigh. 
Ward will need surgery for bone chips in his right knee after the 
season. Johnson, looking much older than his 30 years, has bad 
knees and a chronically aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Atlanta's MASH unit features Crawford, who  
missed the final three games of the Detroit series with a separated 
right shoulder. There's also Henderson, who's managed only four 
minutes against the Pistons before his season came to an abrupt end 
because of double-vision in his left eye. And don't forget LaPhonso 
Ellis, already lost for the year since undergoing hernia surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel sorry for yourselves,'' Hawks forward Tyrone  
Corbin said. ``You have to go with what you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford -- who replaced Ellis in the starting lineup for the  
final 30 regular-season games -- was able to practice Monday and 
expects to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to play,'' Crawford said. ``After a few  
days off, it feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks haven't given up on Henderson, either, hoping that one  
morning he removes the patch from his injured eye and finds his 
vision cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know for sure, but we're holding out hope that he can  
come back and help us,'' said Grant Long, who replaced Henderson 
and set a career playoff high with 26 points in the finale against 
the Pistons. ``We need bodies right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks won two of three games from the Knicks during the  
regular season, including a brutal 76-73 victory in the final week 
of the regular season. Ewing didn't play that night, and 
replacement Chris Dudley managed just two points, three rebounds 
and five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo dominated the middle  
with 18 points and 18 rebounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jen Adams had four goals and one assist to lead  
the top-seeded Maryland Terrapins to a 16-6 win over the Virginia 
Cavaliers Sunday in the NCAA women's lacrosse championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight different Terps (21-0) scored. Kristin Sommar added three  
goals and three assists while Quinn Carney scored two goals and 
five assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Alex Kahoe made 18 saves.  
</P>
<P>
	The win was Maryland's fifth straight title and third straight  
undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland set several NCAA championship records in the game: 11  
goals in a half, 16 total goals and largest margin of victory at 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This win was all about Maryland's conviction and belief that  
this could happen,'' said coach Cindy Timchall. ``We just want to 
relish this victory today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Virginia (15-6), Samm Taylor scored three goals and Liz  
McCarthy made nine save in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are definitely disappointed with our overall performance,''  
said coach Julie Myers. ``They are always at their best in the 
finals. They don't miss a beat.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Allowed To Use UW Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Washington reached an agreement  
Monday with the Seattle Seahawks that will allow the NFL team to 
use Husky Stadium for home games in 2000 and 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's Board of Regents must approve the agreement at  
its May 21 meeting. The Seattle City Council also must approve the 
Seahawks' use of the stadium because of the effect on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks now play in the Kingdome. They need the alternate  
location because the Kingdome is being demolished to make way for a 
new football-soccer stadium at the Kingdome site. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the Seahawks agree to pay the university  
$305,000 per game in rent. The Seahawks expect to play 10 NFL games 
at Husky Stadium each season, eight in the regular season and two 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	To address concerns of stadium neighbors, the Seahawks also have  
agreed not to sell alcohol in the stadium and not to schedule home 
games on weekdays.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar remained higher against the yen at  
midday Tuesday ahead of a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's 
policy-making committee. Japanese stocks advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.42 yen at midday, up 0.28 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 123.49 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 113.47 points,  
or 0.69 percent, ending the morning session at 16,534.49. On 
Monday, the average shed 389.37 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar posted moderate gains against  
the Japanese currency as players waited to see if the Fed on 
Tuesday would signal any bias toward tightening monetary policy in 
its Open Market Committee meeting, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consensus seems to be that the Fed won't take any action  
this time,'' Kazuo Watanabe, said deputy general manager of the 
treasury department at Sumitomo Bank. He said the dollar could face 
selling if markets confirmed that there isn't any significant 
change, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board is also meeting Tuesday, but  
with no expectation or fear of a change in monetary policy, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.94 yen at  
midday, up from 131.27 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the dollar's stability against the yen  
prompted buying from exporters who can benefit their overseas 
earnings. Investors were also taking advantage of the relative 
cheapness of shares in the high-technology sector, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But most investors were retreating to the sidelines as they  
waited for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 9.62 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,332.05. The 
TOPIX closed down 25.02 points, or 1.9 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 59.85  
points to 10,853.47 at Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.235 percent from Monday's finish of 1.230 percent, driving its 
price down to 102.37 yen from 102.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Disapproval of Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans lag well behind Democrats on top  
priority issues such as Social Security and education, and swing 
voters disapprove of the Congress by double-digit margins, 
according to a recent GOP survey. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the survey taken for the Republican National  
Committee reported strong public support for a GOP proposal for a 
``lockbox'' to safeguard surplus funds in the Social Security 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican call to allow workers to invest a portion of their  
payroll taxes individually also has strong backing -- so much so 
that pollster Fred Steeper suggested it might be one way to 
``counter the popularity of increasing the minimum wage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted April 23-25 by Market Strategies, Inc.  
The results were distributed to party leaders and lawmakers in both 
the House and Senate. A total of 800 registered voters was polled, 
with a margin of error of 3.5 percent. A copy was obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was taken at a pivotal time for GOP leaders, with  
Republicans in both houses of Congress struggling to implement an 
agenda and fend off politically popular Democratic initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	One finding struck GOP leaders in particular: a majority of  
those polled said the nation had gotten off on the wrong track. The 
finding came in the wake of the continuing air strikes over Kosovo 
and a few days after the deadly high school shootings in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 55 percent of those polled disapproved of the way the  
Republican Congress is handling its job. Thirty-eight percent 
approved. The breakdown among so-called swing voters was nearly 
identical -- 38 per cent in favor and 53 percent opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked which party's candidate they would vote for, 43 percent of  
those polled said the Democrat, and 39 percent responded the 
Republican. That is half the deficit found in two separate polls 
conducted during last winter's impeachment trial of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues that voters said they care most about, Social  
Security and education, the poll found a decided Democratic 
advantage, as has been the case in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters' current issue agenda favors the Democrats,''  
Steeper wrote in a summary of his findings that some Republicans 
received. Republicans hold the advantage on tax simplification and 
tax cuts, but they ``rank well behind education and Social 
Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were encouraged to confront both issues directly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Making social security and education offensive issues, rather  
than relegating them to defensive issues, may be what the 
Republican Party must ultimately do in order to build on its gains 
achieved in 1994,'' Steeper wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed voters prefer Democrats, 49-28, on Social  
Security, and 48-33 on education. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP enjoyed advantages among voters for upholding  
traditional moral values; controlling government spending and 
holding down taxes, but these counted for less than Social Security 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Steeper also warned Republicans that opposition to a plan for  
prescription drug coverage for Medicare ``could be a political 
disaster. ... Even 42 percent of the Conservative Republican Base 
favors the Democratic position,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what step would do the most good in the wake of killings  
at the Columbine High School in Colorado, 58 percent said they 
preferred mandatory jail time for those who commit a crime with a 
gun. Thirty-three percent chose ``greater restrictions on the sale 
of guns.'' The Senate has been battling over gun control in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	On minimum wage, the poll found that given a choice, 60 percent  
of those surveyed favored individual retirement accounts to help 
working people, and 38 percent favored an increase in the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have signaled a willingness to bring a minimum  
wage bill to the floor this year, although they are consulting with 
business interests to see what provisions they would like included. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, however, a more conventional struggle is possible  
with opponents trying to derail the increase.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 59.85 to 10,853.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today as  
traders cautiously placed some last-minute bets before Tuesday's 
meeting of the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 59.85 at 10,853.47. The index had fallen as much as 167 points 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, which were lower for most of the day,  
closed mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq 
composite index were higher, but declining issues outdistanced 
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the day, traders extended Friday's broad selloff, in  
which the Dow fell 193.87 to 10,913.32, responding to a 
steeper-than-expected increase in the consumer price index that fed 
worries about rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report prompted speculation that the Fed will at least  
consider an interest rate hike when its Open Market Committee meets 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cautious traders appeared willing to wait on the sidelines  
today, as volume was well behind Friday's pace. But others were 
willing to take a chance on some stocks as the market fell and 
prices were more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a strange day and a half in the market,''  
said Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``It's 
hard to convince people to put money to work in front of word from 
the Fed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts attributed today's rebound to growing sentiment  
that the Fed will leave rates untouched, instead announcing a 
``tightening bias,'' which would indicate that the group may raise 
rates at a future meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed tightens rates when central bankers believe the economy  
is growing too fast. Higher interest rates raise corporate 
borrowing rates, which can often hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The lingering concern over interest rates hammered banking and  
financial stocks for a second straight session. Rising rates are a 
particular threat to banks as companies become more reluctant to 
take out loans. Citigroup, a component of the Dow, fell today. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of inflation has rattled the bond market in recent  
sessions, pushing yields to their highest levels in nearly a year. 
Today, prices bounced back slightly, lowering the yield of the 
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.90 percent from 5.92 percent 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the buying came from traders looking ahead to the next  
batch of corporate earnings reports. Dell Computer, which typically 
sets the standard for computer makers, rose in advance of its 
earnings announcement, scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers influenced trading in individual stocks today. After  
former Baby Bell U S West and telecommunications company Global 
Crossing announced they would merge, the stocks of both companies 
fell as investors appeared uncertain of the benefits to be gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman Gordon was the biggest percentage gainer on the Big Board  
after Precision Castparts Corp. agreed to acquire it for about $721 
million. And Gulfstream Aerospace got a big boost from its intended 
merger with defense giant General Dynamics.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Assault on Jockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The man who stood on the track as horses raced  
past him on Preakness day was charged with assaulting the jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ferrell of Bel Air also was charged with trespassing,  
reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and 
alcohol-related offenses, according to a police report released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old man punched jockey Jorge Chavez at Pimlico Race  
Course on Saturday, an assault that has been shown repeatedly on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell was taken to Baltimore's central booking facility, said  
Barbara Cooper, a spokeswoman for the Division of Pretrial 
Detention and Services. He was released Sunday after posting $2,500 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Angelique Cook-Hayes said Ferrell was first  
taken to Sinai Hospital for a psychiatric review, but was released 
Saturday night. Hospital spokeswoman Amy Mickolite refused to 
comment on whether Ferrell had been at the facility, citing 
hospital policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why he did it,'' Cook-Hayes said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre episode occurred several hundred yards from the  
finish line during the seventh race, about 2 1/2 hours before the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell made his way to the track from the infield and crossed a  
fence separating the fans from the turf course. He then staggered 
to the inside rail, which he pounded with his fist before ducking 
under it, and walked onto the main track. 
</P>
<P>
	As the horses approached, he stood with his fists clenched and  
arms upraised. As the horses charged by on both sides, Ferrell 
could be seen in replays trying to punch two horses.

<HEADLINE> Boston Goalie Meeting Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They are two of hockey's best goalies, The  
Dominator and Dafoe. One has been at the top for a while. The other 
is headed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe has been outstanding in the Bruins' playoff  
series with Buffalo in which Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek is the 
marquee netminder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe's strong play helped Boston win Game 5 on Sunday, 5-3, and  
forced a Game 6 in Buffalo on Tuesday night. Hasek, the NHL's 
two-time defending MVP, allowed four goals on 26 shots before being 
benched after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely think Byron has outplayed him this series,'' said  
Rob Tallas, who played just 17 regular-season games and none in the 
playoffs as Dafoe's backup. ``Whatever might happen in this series 
happens, but Byron walks away with his head high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe got a well-deserved day off Monday while his teammates  
practiced. One day earlier, he made one of his most important saves 
of the season with Boston leading 4-3 in Game 5. With 1:46 left, he 
stopped Geoff Sanderson's slap shot that would have tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made unbelievable saves all series,'' Bruins defenseman  
Hal Gill said Monday. ``You don't want to rely on him too much, but 
he's been there every time we needed him. It's real comforting to 
have him back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe, 28, is in his fourth full NHL season and second with the  
Bruins. He led the league with 10 regular-season shutouts, was 
second in save percentage and third with a 1.99 goals against 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, 34, was first in save percentage and second with nine  
shutouts and a 1.87 goals against average. He also is one of three 
MVP candidates and, with Dafoe and Toronto's Curtis Joseph, one of 
three candidates for the Vezina Trophy that goes to the NHL's best 
goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hasek will be there for now and maybe next year,'' Bruins  
coach Pat Burns said, ``but, Byron, give him some time. He's 
proving it day to day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hasek, seven, eight years ago, couldn't be the backup in  
Chicago, so you have to give a guy some time, and I think Byron is 
biding his time and playing well and getting people noticing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played a total of 25 games for Chicago in 1990-91 and  
1991-92 before moving to Buffalo where he became the No. 1 goalie 
in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe played a total of 10 games with Washington over three  
seasons, then was traded to Los Angeles where he played in 47 games 
in 1995-96. Last season, he had a 2.24 goals against average and 
six shutouts with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	After five games of the best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal,  
Buffalo has a 14-12 advantage in goals and leads 3-2 in games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, Hasek has allowed 16 goals in nine games, while  
Dafoe has permitted 23 goals in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``His personal goal is probably to compete with Hasek,'' Bruins  
defenseman Kyle McLaren said, ``and Hasek's been one of the top 
goalies in the league for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any goalie in the league wants to compare themselves to the  
best and Byron's done that. I think he's excelled at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both sides insist that one player doesn't win a game  
-- even if that player is one of the league's top goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	But both goalies can have a major impact on the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's so prepared every night. He's so consistent,'' Tallas  
said of Dafoe. ``I think he's outplayed Hasek every game.''

tough-talking prime minister who slowed the negotiations and froze 
Israel's budding ties with the Arab world. A tearful Netanyahu 
conceded defeat just half an hour after exit polls projected Barak 
winning by a wide margin, and said he also would step down as 
leader of the Likud Party. With 6.46 percent of the vote counted, 
Barak led by 60.1 percent to 39.7 percent for Netanyahu.

	Clinton Calls To Congratulate Barak  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pledged his support today to  
Ehud Barak, Israel's new prime minister-elect. The administration 
also renewed its call for an Israeli pullback on the West Bank and 
rapid talks with the Palestinians on Jerusalem and statehood. 
Clinton spoke by telephone with both Barak and the current prime 
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The administration had maintained an 
outwardly neutral stance during the Israeli campaign. But it is 
likely to find the incoming prime minister more amenable to the 
U.S. land-for-peace formula for the peace process.

	Poll: Support Slipping for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' support for the air war over  
Kosovo, still backed by a majority, is slipping, and more than half 
favor negotiations to settle the conflict, reveals a poll released 
today. A majority, 59 percent, support the air war, and just over 
half, 52 percent, would support ground troops as a way to end the 
conflict, according to an ABC-Washington Post poll. But support for 
the air war has slipped 9 percentage points since early April and 
support for ground troops to end the conflict dropped 5 percentage 
points in that time. 

</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Ground Invasion Unlikely  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO has all but abandoned the idea of  
mounting a ground invasion to expel Serb troops from Kosovo, 
convinced that air power alone can succeed. The allies still are 
discussing the role of ground troops in Kosovo but only as 
peacekeepers, officials said today. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said 
a ``total and irreversible'' Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo 
would have to be under way before an international security force 
with NATO at its core would be sent in.

<P>
	Court Issues Major Welfare Decision  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today banned states from  
paying lower benefits to newcomers than to longtime residents. In 
other decisions today, the court ruled that police do not need a 
warrant to seize someone's car from a public place under laws 
requiring forfeiture of property linked to crime. The court also 
made it harder for federal judges to invalidate election districts 
drawn by state legislatures just because they suspect race was the 
major factor. 

</P>
<P>
	Teamsters OK Car Haulers Strike  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Teamsters union truck drivers voted  
overwhelmingly today to authorize a strike against any or all of 17 
trucking companies that haul new cars and trucks to dealers 
nationwide. Automakers were already preparing for the threat of a 
Teamsters strike once the truckers' contract expires May 31. A 
walkout could dash hopes for what's shaping up to be a record year 
for U.S. sales of cars and light trucks.

	CVS Buys Online Pharmacy Soma.com  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Combining a virtual drug store with its  
real-world counterpart, pharmacy chain CVS Corp. announced today it 
is buying online drug retailer Soma.com for $30 million. The move 
accelerates CVS' fledgling effort to sell drugs over the Internet, 
a concept that experts predict could take off the way Amazon.com 
has transformed the book selling business. CVS has 4,122 stores, 
more than any other pharmacy chain.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed today. The Dow Jones  
industrial average fell 59.85 to close at 10,853.47. On the NYSE,

	Olympic Whistle-Blower Reemerges

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The man who blew the whistle on Olympic  
bribery is back at the scene of the scandal. Marc Hodler, the 
senior member of the International Olympic Committee, returned to 
Salt Lake City for meetings of the coordination commission he heads 
for the 2002 Winter Games, an event the Swiss lawyer helped forever 
link with corruption. Last December, Hodler was the first Olympic 
official to say the million-dollar program of scholarships, travel, 
medical care and cash run by Salt Lake bidders was purely and 
simply a scheme to buy IOC members' votes.

<HEADLINE> Oldest White House Tree Enters Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Evergreen and graceful, the tree has survived  
the branch-whipping blast of countless helicopters, stubborn 
starlings, a suicide airplane and 17 decades of presidential 
history. Andrew Jackson would be proud. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a stately Southern tree, a Magnolia grandiflora with  
glossy dark-green leaves, supported in its old age by a web of 
steel wires and a 30-foot-tall, telescopic iron pole sunk seven 
feet into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the oldest tree on the White House grounds, so rooted in  
the history of the place that it appears on the back of older $20 
bills, rising to the roofline just about where Jackson and his 
gardeners planted it to the left of the long-columned South Portico 
facing the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
	When the magnolia blooms in late June or early July it produces  
creamy and fragrant white blossoms, eight to nine inches across. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lore, passed on through a long line of presidential  
gardeners, cherishes the Jackson magnolia as the rough-hewn, 
battle-winning, whip-tongued president's tribute to his gardening 
wife, Rachel Donelson Jackson, who died before he reached 
Washington in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a touch of irony in that. After a campaign in which she  
and her husband had been accused of adultery, bigamy and other 
offenses, Rachel Jackson was not looking forward to moving to the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than live  
in that palace in Washington,'' she had cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin Williams, who began working at the White House a  
half-century ago and is now chief gardener, says the Jackson 
magnolia ``creates an atmosphere, a structure of something living'' 
as it reaches up to screen the private family quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a reasonable chance the venerable magnolia will live  
well into the next century, even with a hollow center and evident 
signs of decay on its lower limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for another 50 years myself,'' Williams said.  
``These old trees, they look bad on the surface, but on the inside 
they're determined to keep going. Like anything old, it wants to 
stay alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we can to keep it as healthy as  
possible,'' Williams said. ``It's declined some. But not a whole 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a way that's a bit surprising. The Jackson magnolia is north  
of its usual range. Harsh winters are a worry. But the White House 
wall at the tree's back shelters it from the worst winter storms, a 
factor Williams said was critical when it was newly planted. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four presidents have lived at the White House since  
Jackson and his magnolia has been there with all of them. Reporters 
turn their backs against the prop blast when the presidential 
helicopter takes off and lands, and they watch the magnolia shake 
and shiver. 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House interior was rebuilt in the 1950s,  
Jackson's tree was moved carefully to safety, then returned. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 12, 1995, a pilot, apparently bent on suicide, aimed a  
stolen Cessna 150 at the White House. Falling just short, the plane 
cut a groove in the South Lawn and barked against the magnolia's 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a scar on the tree,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Persistent birds are a more common problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tree is a haven in winter for the starlings; flocks of  
hundreds and hundreds of them,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The starlings are noisy, and not very considerate. ``They  
plaster the patio with droppings,'' the gardener said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams placed a rubber owl and rubber snakes in the magnolia's  
high branches to scare them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crows took to sitting on top of the rubber owl and it  
didn't bother the starlings either,'' he said. ``They were not 
scared. They still come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trees and the White House have always been linked. ``Trees  
should be planted at once so as to make it an agreeable place to 
walk in,'' a government official said in 1800. 
</P>
<P>
	An American elm, believed to have been planted in John Adams'  
time, hung on until 1991. First lady Barbara Bush replaced it with 
a young tree propagated from the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 500-plus trees on the 18-acre White House grounds, more  
than 40 are commemoratives, including a scarlet oak planted by 
Benjamin Harrison in 1889 and a Japanese Threadleaf maple planted 
by first lady Frances Folsom Cleveland in 1893. Bill and Hillary 
Clinton have planted eight, including white dogwoods and a 
littleleaf linden. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The White House Garden,'' published in 1996 by the White  
House Historical Association, William Seale calls the presidents' 
trees ``an unsung glory'' that help express ``the continuity of 
this place through time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Generations of trees have been planted, grown and died,''  
Seale writes. ``New generations always replace them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Jackson magnolia is the exception.

<HEADLINE> European Farm Firm Buys US Farm Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- European farm equipment maker New Holland  
N.V. will acquire Case Corp. for about $4.3 billion, creating a 
powerful rival to Deere &AMP; Co. in the slumping big-ticket farm 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Case shareholders will receive $55 per  
share in cash from New Holland, a Dutch company with operations in 
England and Italy, the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
	New Holland's Italian parent company, Fiat, would retain a 71  
percent controlling interest in the new venture. Fiat now owns 69 
percent of New Holland. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company's chairman and chief executive officer will  
be Jean-Pierre Rosso, chairman and CEO of Case. Umberto Quadrino, 
New Holland's CEO, would serve as the board's co-chairman during a 
transition period, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must be approved by Case shareholders and by U.S. and  
European regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are creating a new company with an extraordinary range of  
products and services that will meet the needs of more customers 
around the world than any other equipment company,'' Rosso said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Holland has a strong foothold in Europe, while Case, based  
in Racine, Wis., is more established in the United States, Latin 
America, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Also, Case 
focuses on larger-horsepower tractors and combines for big farms, 
while New Holland is stronger in light equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Case's stock price began rising last week as takeover  
speculation hit the market. Case posted a $48 million loss in its 
first quarter, and is carrying out plans to idle 3,400 workers by 
the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> U S West, Global Crossing To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baby Bell phone company U S West Inc. plans to  
merge with growing telecommunications company Global Crossing Ltd. 
in a stock swap valued at $37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will offer local, long-distance and wireless  
phone service, plus high-speed Internet access around the globe. 
The new company, which will keep the Global Crossing name, will 
have more than $15 billion in sales and a market value of about $65 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at the various companies that would be complementary  
with what U S West has ... (and) Global Crossing came out on top,'' 
said Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, were slow to see the benefits of the deal  
when it was announced this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares fell $4.75 to $57.50 in late morning trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Global Crossing's stock dipped 
$3.18 3/4 to $58.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, U S West will purchase 9.5 percent of Global  
Crossing for roughly $2.4 billion, the companies said this morning. 
The two companies will subsequently merge in a 50-50 stock 
combination, creating a company with $17 billion in annual revenue 
and a stock market value of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have two separate stocks: one to track  
the performance of the high-growth Internet and data assets, the 
other stock for the traditional telephone assets. Investors will be 
able to choose which stock they want to hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Each U S West share will be worth 1.2 shares of either tracking  
stock, and each Global Crossing share will be worth 1 share of 
either tracking stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief executive officer,  
will share the power and the top title of the new company with U S 
West's Trujillo. The board of directors will include 10 members 
from each company, plus two chosen by mutual agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have our own local, national and global network  
positioned and ready to go,'' said Annunziata. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, based in Denver, has local phone customers in 14  
Western and Midwestern states, a wireless phone service, and offers 
high-speed Internet access. It had $12.4 billion in revenue in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, headquartered in Bermuda, offers local and  
long-distance phone service and has a vast undersea fiber optic 
cable network. Though it had only $424 million in revenue in 1998, 
Global Crossing has been on a buying spree recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, it agreed to pay $725 million in cash for the undersea  
cable operations of the British telecommunications company Cable &AMP; 
Wireless. In March, Global Crossing signed a contract to acquire 
Frontier Corp., a phone company based in Rochester, N.Y., for about 
$11 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier has agreed to the deal between Global Crossing and U S  
West and will be part of the combined company.

<HEADLINE> TRW To Sell 4 Automotive Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Inc., fresh from its acquisition of  
LucasVarity PLC, plans to sell four automotive businesses to reduce 
its debt from the deal -- a move that could affect 21,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debt reduction is an immediate priority for TRW,'' chairman  
and CEO Joseph Gorman said in a statement. ``Exiting these 
businesses will contribute significantly to the timely achievement 
of that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TRW, which makes products for the automobile, aerospace and  
information technology industries, wants to sell TRW Engine 
Components, Lucas Diesel Systems operations, TRW Nelson Stud 
Welding and the LucasVarity Wiring companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman said TRW will now concentrate its automotive business on  
steering, suspension and antilock brake systems, along with safety 
restraints such as seat belts, steering wheels and air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he's had unsolicited inquiries about the companies  
and is optimistic they can be sold by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Michael Schmall said he wasn't surprised by the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little cleaning of the house,'' said Schmall, managing  
partner of The Planning Edge, a Troy, Mich., automotive industry 
analysis and consulting firm, 
</P>
<P>
	``TRW's making sure they're focused on what they want to do long  
term and obviously it's nice to get a little cash after spending 
that much money'' on LucasVarity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW's $7 billion acquisition of LucasVarity, the British auto  
parts maker, closed May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, TRW took an $85.3 million charge for buying  
LucasVarity, reducing its first-quarter earnings to a net loss of 
$28.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman said the sale of the companies should raise $1.2 billion  
to $1.5 billion. TRW wants to reduce its debt by approximately $2.5 
billion in the next year and a half, including profits from the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW stock closed down 68 3/4 cents, at $46.43 3/4, on the New York  
Stock Exchange Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW Engine Components produces more than 300 million engine  
valves annually. It has about 6,000 employees and operates in 12 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas Diesel Systems, employing 9,200 people, is one of the  
world's largest manufacturers of diesel fuel injection systems, 
serving the car, van, truck, bus, agricultural, industrial and 
marine industries. It supplies fuel injection systems to more than 
one-third of Europe's diesel car and van market. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW Nelson Stud Welding, which makes stud welding fasteners and  
equipment, employs about 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lucas Wiring businesses are the leading supplier of  
electrical wiring systems in the United Kingdom. The businesses 
employ 5,500 people and have operations in the United Kingdom, 
Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Egypt and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the businesses that TRW is selling, the company has  
about 130,000 employees worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Suspend Minors Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings have suspended operations  
of its top minor league affiliate until the team can be relocated 
from Glens Falls, N.Y., to Rossford, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension will last at least a year until construction of a  
$48 million arena can be completed. The site is about five miles 
south of downtown Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adirondack Red Wings have been in Glens Falls for 21 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Wings' relationship with the Glens Falls community has  
been tremendous,'' assistant general manager Jim Nill said in a 
statement. ``Our coaches, players and staff have long called this 
area home, making this a very difficult and emotional decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move means the Wings will be without an American Hockey  
League affiliate next season. The Red Wings will place their 
prospects on other AHL teams, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings said having a competitive team in Glens Falls  
would require a substantial financial investment beyond what the 
facility and community can support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had gotten to a point where salaries and operating costs  
had risen, and we couldn't justify keeping the team in a small 
market any longer,'' Nill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-level salaries that were once $60,000 have risen past the  
$150,000 mark, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision leaves Glens Falls searching for a United Hockey  
League or other minor-level professional league team to play in the 
Civic Center. Adirondack won four Calder Cup championships and 
enjoyed years of strong fan support until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said declining attendance and the AHL's trend of  
moving to larger markets contributed to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Glens Falls had been one of the longest-surviving host cities in  
the AHL. Only Rochester, N.Y., and Hershey, Pa., have had the same 
AHL franchise longer than Glens Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of one of the last small-town professional  
franchises going,'' he said. ``It's just sad that the time has run 
out.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Teacher DeDe Owens Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- DeDe Owens, a former LPGA player and  
one of the country's most popular golf teachers, died a week after 
a heart attack following a lesson. She was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA said she was stricken at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club  
in Lemont on May 9. She remained in a coma until her death Sunday 
at Palos Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The LPGA, the teaching community and the golf world lost one  
of its finest members,'' LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens was an LPGA member for 29 years. She left the tour after a  
brief career when she developed Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She was honored as LPGA Teacher of the Year twice and Midwest  
Teacher of the Year five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens was born in St. Petersburg, Fla., and lived in Lemont. She  
had been teaching at Cog Hill since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	She held a doctorate in education from the University of  
Virginia and received the school's distinguished alumni award in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her mother, Margaret Owens; a brother; and a  
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is set for June 5 at Cog Hill. Her funeral is  
Wednesday in Bluffton, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Dumars Ends Career on Sour Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It wasn't the way Joe Dumars wanted to end his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars scored only three points in the final game of his 14-year  
career as the Atlanta Hawks beat his Detroit Pistons 87-75 in the 
decisive fifth game of opening round of the playoffs Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a fun year for me. I'm not going to make this a sad  
day at all. I'm disappointed (with the loss). I don't know what 
else to say,'' said Dumars, who got a hug from coach Alvin Gentry 
when he was taken out of the game with 51.9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	And then Atlanta's entire starting five hugged the 36-year-old  
guard before Hawks' coach Lenny Wilkens ran to Detroit's bench and 
added a bear hug of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciated that. Being on the road and having the road team  
show their appreciation like that was great,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, now it's over. I wish I could stand here and tell you I'm  
disappointed, I'm sad, I'm happy. I have all those emotions wrapped 
up in one,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars averaged 16.1 points during his career -- all with the  
Pistons -- after being a No. 1 draft pick in 1985 out of McNeese 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed we lost, but I'm more disappointed that this  
was Joe's last game,'' said teammate Grant Hill, who led the 
Pistons with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meant so much to me as a leader, a teammate and a friend.  
Hopefully, he'll still be there to give me advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, who played 32 minutes and made only one of his six  
shots, said he hoped he'll be remembered for his accomplishments 
and ``that I left with class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he did.  
</P>

	Dumars played in 10 playoffs, helping the Pistons to consecutive

	Jerry Stackhouse, who played primarily as Dumars' backup this

get his chance to start next season.

<HEADLINE> Canada Group Won't Censor Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada's national broadcast regulator said Monday  
it won't try to regulate new media services on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after almost a year of hearings by the  
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message is clear: The CRTC will not regulate the Internet,  
nothing on the Internet,'' said commission chairwoman Francoise 
Bertrand. ``The Canadian new media industry is vibrant, highly 
competitive and successful without regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearings, the commission heard from an array of  
broadcasters and telecommunications companies, free-speech 
advocates and Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of interveners told the commission it should  
avoid regulating the relatively new Internet industry, fearing the 
commission might cramp its growth.

<HEADLINE>  Rhode Island Star Odom May Go Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The University of Rhode Island is not  
counting on having Lamar Odom around next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island spokesman Mike Ballweg said he would ``bet money''  
the 6-foot-10 forward -- a probable lottery pick -- would declare for 
the June 30 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, citing unidentified sources, reported that Odom will do  
just that. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA on Friday will announce its list of players applying for  
early entry to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's aunt told The Providence Journal he would formally  
announce his plans in Rhode Island today. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball coach Jerry DeGregorio was unable to track down Odom  
last weekend to confirm his decision. The deadline for declaring 
for the draft was midnight Sunday, meaning Odom had to notify the 
NBA by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of the draft as late  
as June 23 and return to college ball. Last year, Odom declared for 
the draft, then pulled out June 16 after he was admitted to Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballweg said Odom returned home to New York last weekend,  
although a woman answering Odom's home phone said he was in Rhode 
Island. The spring semester ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Odom might leave Rhode Island has hurt the  
school's ability to recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4)  
last season. The Rams (20-13) lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom has played just one season at Rhode Island, and the school  
took the unusual step of giving him a voice in the hiring of its 
coach after Jim Harrick left for Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom entered UNLV in 1997, but he was accused of cheating on a  
college entrance exam. He was upset by the accusations and chose to 
transfer. A UNLV assistant coach insists Odom did not cheat on the 
test.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Three of the movies vying for the Golden  
Palm award at this year's Cannes Film Festival are based on 
prize-winning books -- but only one seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian director Atom Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,'' a  
suspenseful, macabre tale of a lonely bachelor who befriends 
wayward girls, is based on William Trevor's 1988 Whitbread 
Prize-winning novel by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	This fresh take on the traditional serial killer -- no blood, no  
detective tracking the criminal -- won enthusiastic praise at 
Monday's screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Egoyan said he took liberties with the original text,  
transforming the character of a socialite mother into a glamorous, 
celebrity TV chef who humiliates her fat son on camera, stuffing 
him with raw liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only violence in this film is emotional, and it begets a  
monster,'' Egoyan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' Mexican director Arturo  
Ripstein's adaptation of the novella by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, won 
praise from the Nobel Prize-winner but many viewers Monday found it 
slow-moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour film set in Mexico in the 1950s portrays an elderly  
retired colonel and his wife waiting, in vain, for the colonel's 
long-promised military pension to come in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Their only son has died in murky circumstances, and their only  
joy is a cockfighting bird they hope will save them from 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia Marquez, who attended film school in Rome before becoming  
a novelist, praised Ripstein's effort, saying in a letter read to 
reporters: ``It's a great film ... and does justice to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripstein said he had wanted to adapt the novella since he was 21  
years old. ``Marquez said `I'll give it to you when you learn,' and 
I waited 33 years,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Chilean director Raoul Ruiz's adaptation of  
Marcel Proust's epic ``Le Temps Retrouve'' (Time Regained) had more 
than one critic napping -- despite an all-star cast featuring 
Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Beart and John Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Set around World War I and structured as a series of vaguely  
linked vignettes weaving past to present, it fails to capture the 
rich, analytic texture of Proust's descriptive prose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proust is a director himself, with a vision of things that  
makes you want to adapt it to the screen,'' Ruiz told reporters. 
``The difficulties aren't insurmountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Proust has frustrated generations of filmmakers. Orson  
Welles, Luchino Visconti and Joseph Losey tried but gave up. Volker 
Schlondorff's ``Swann's Way'' was a critical flop.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Wants To End Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich brought his campaign for  
the Republican presidential nomination home today, telling a civil 
rights group that police should never detain people simply because 
of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the  
practice known as ``racial profiling'' should stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is an insidious action that has gone on in too many  
parts of America,'' Kasich said at a news conference before 
delivering a speech at the Columbus Urban League's annual awards 
luncheon. ``Those kinds of actions that divide this country have to 
be ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has been investigating complaints by  
blacks and Hispanics that they are more likely to be targeted by 
police and customs inspectors for traffic stops and searches. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, also a Republican,  
recently acknowledged that state troopers treated blacks and 
Hispanics more aggressively than whites during traffic stops on the 
New Jersey Turnpike. Similar accusations have been made in Florida, 
Maryland, Connecticut and elsewhere along the Interstate 95 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called for an end to the practice during a  
radio speech in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost gets to be a matter of guilty until proven innocent  
and that's just not the way America should be,'' Kasich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio congressman said he is against racial quotas being  
forced on employers, but supports aggressive recruiting of people 
of all backgrounds by the business world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affirmative action should not be an effort to treat us like so  
many beans and should be an effort to unify this country,'' he 
said. ``I don't think people in America see the value in quotas 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has formed an exploratory committee looking into a run  
for the Republican presidential nomination and has been campaigning 
in New Hampshire, Iowa and California. He drew 1 percent support 
among Republicans in a national CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released 
early this month.

<HEADLINE> Country Living Guide for City Folks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- City folk who move to the country for  
fresh air and peace and quiet are getting a pamphlet to enlighten 
them on the way things really are in rural Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The pamphlet, called the ``Code of the West,'' was published in  
response to complaints received by the Spokane County Commission 
about the less than attractive aspects of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you choose to live among the farms and ranches of our rural  
countryside, do not expect county government to intervene in the 
day-to-day operations of your agribusiness neighbors,'' the 
pamphlet counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	The pamphlet cautions that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Farmers often work around the clock during harvest, meaning  
extra noise and dust. 
</P>
<P>
	--Animals can be dangerous, and they sometimes smell.  
</P>
<P>
	--Hunting is allowed in most rural areas.  
</P>
<P>
	--Fences may not always be an accurate indication of a property  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	--Response times by emergency crews can be extremely slow.  
</P>
<P>
	Janet Thorson, president of the Green Bluff Growers Association  
north of Spokane, said many of her neighbors do not farm, so there 
is potential for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know they're not moving into a totally pristine  
area where nothing commercial happens,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Auto Records Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a big-bucks battle over privacy, the  
Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether states can sell 
personal information from driver's license records such as people's 
addresses and Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants the justices to uphold a  
federal law that closes state motor vehicle records to the public. 
A lower court ruled in a South Carolina case that Congress usurped 
states' authority when it enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection 
Act in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect in most states in 1997, bars states  
and their employees from releasing personal information from motor 
vehicle records, including people's names, addresses, telephone and 
Social Security numbers and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	States have routinely sold such information to businesses,  
charities and political candidates, earning millions of dollars in 
revenue each year. When the law was enacted, 34 states made motor 
vehicle records public in some form. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law was enacted in response to the 1989 slaying of  
actress Rebecca Schaeffer, killed at her California home by a 
stalker who used a private investigator to obtain her driver's 
license records. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers told the justices the law was  
prompted by a ``unique concern ... that individuals are effectively 
forced to advertise the key to their personal information on their 
license plate when they drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law contains numerous exceptions, allowing personal  
information to be disclosed to law enforcement officials, courts, 
governmental agencies, private investigators and sometimes to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no exemption for the news media, moving some  
open-record advocates to contend the law violates the First 
Amendment's free-press guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Newspaper Editors supported South  
Carolina's challenge to the federal law. ASNE general counsel 
Richard Schmidt said Monday that motor vehicle records are ``part 
of a public record that should be out there. ... We certainly hope 
that the forces of free flow of information will continue to be 
open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law also allows states to disclose personal information if  
they give people a chance to ``opt out'' from such disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	In challenging the law, South Carolina officials relied on  
recent Supreme Court rulings that have reined in congressional 
power in the name of states' autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the state, saying the  
law ``is simply not a valid exercise of Congress' ... power'' to 
regulate interstate commerce and therefore violates the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court blocked the law's enforcement in South  
Carolina, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. The 
law also has been invalidated by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals and cannot be enforced in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has been upheld by the 7th and 10th U.S. Circuit Courts  
of Appeals, covering nine states: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking Supreme Court review, Justice Department lawyers said  
the federal government can bar states from disclosing personal 
information from motor vehicle records just as it bars disclosures 
of such information by private companies such as credit bureaus and 
video stores. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's lawyers said previous Supreme Court decisions  
have banned ``the coerced use of state officials to carry out 
federal policy choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the justices invalidate the federal law, states still  
could decide they want to continue prohibiting public access to 
such information. 
</P>
<P>
	``States could block access on their own,'' said Jane Kirtley of  
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``Legislatures 
have been riding the wave of public sentiment regarding privacy. 
The public has not taken into account the dangers of governmental 
secrecy.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Tries To Get Past Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- They used to be the very, very VIPs in  
these parts, wined and dined, taken to ski condos and courtside 
seats at NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	Those days are long gone for International Olympic Committee  
members visiting Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	When the oversight task force for the 2002 Winter Games opens  
four days of meetings today, it will be the first time a large 
group of IOC leaders has come to the Utah capital since the Olympic 
bribery scandal broke last November. 
</P>
<P>
	And this time, instead of lavish hospitality, the members will  
be greeted by a packed agenda of important meetings and a single 
night on the town -- a dinner at the home of Mitt Romney, the 
venture capitalist brought in three months ago to run Salt Lake's 
sullied Olympic organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz might have played host to the Sacramento Kings on  
Sunday in a do-or-die playoff game, but if the IOC wanted tickets 
it had to deal with scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
	This fourth meeting of the IOC's coordination commission long  
has been on the books, but its timing could not have been better 
for Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	When they sit down with Romney and his lieutenants, the task  
force members, led by corruption-case whistleblower Marc Hodler of 
Switzerland, will face some dark and dismal facts -- but also be 
shown some definite rays of light breaking through the clouds of 
the six-month-old scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Romney announced three sponsorship and supplier  
contracts with Utah companies worth some $25 million-$30 million, 
the first big deals signed since well before the bribery case 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturday night, Salt Lake turned out for its first  
Olympic celebration in a long time -- the unveiling of a snowshoe 
rabbit, a coyote and a black bear as the game's mascots and 
merchandising keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 people jammed an amphitheater for the ceremony,  
billed as ``Putting a new face on the Games,'' and scooped up 
hundreds of mascot T-shirts and pins, on sale for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd also watched a clock in the shape of an Indian  
arrowhead start to count down the 1,000 days remaining until the 
opening ceremony on Feb. 8, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking back,'' Romney said. ``It sort of starts  
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the news is good.  
</P>
<P>
	Romney still needs $300 million to fill his sponsorship revenue  
and has $84 million in budget cuts on the table that could affect 
athletes, spectators and volunteers -- even the IOC itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But after months of doom and gloom, the SLOC staff seems upbeat.  
The mood was casual and fun-loving at Saturday night's festivities, 
with Romney casually strolling the grounds in chinos and a winter 
vest, produced by one of the new sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The mascots were chosen because of their historic links to the  
original settlers of the Wasatch range. The story goes that each 
played a part in making this region of snowy mountains and salty 
lakes a good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were picked because of their appeal to modern  
consumers. Focus groups told SLOC that these three critters would 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps, too,'' Romney told the  
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC estimates the mascots will account for the core of $40  
million-$50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, the worst in Olympic history, has resulted in a  
purge of 10 IOC members, the creation of panels that could 
drastically redo the committee and at least six investigations, 
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general's office that won't report their findings for weeks or 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The coordination commission will discuss finances,  
transportation, ticket sales, media operations and dozens of other 
areas involved in staging a modern Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It will visit sports venues, most of which are ready for use,  
and get a feel of how Salt Lake has emerged from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience was a bruising one for all of us,'' Utah Gov.  
Mike Leavitt said. ``But we're healing and have come to understand 
that, as uncomfortable as it was, we're still intact physically and 
we will rise to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our redemption lies in a successful games.''

<HEADLINE> State-Approved Gambling on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the roughly three weeks since a federal  
commission broached the idea of a moratorium on gambling expansion, 
several states have taken steps toward new lotteries and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, Kentucky and West Virginia would have casinos for  
the first time, and Tennessee, South Carolina and Alabama would go 
heavily into the lottery business. 
</P>
<P>
	In that same short time span, Rhode Island's state lottery  
commission has stood by its decision to allow additional slot 
machines at a jai alai court and a dog track. Illinois legislators 
discussed a plan to allow a riverboat casino in Cook County, home 
to Chicago and heretofore off-limits to casinos. And in California, 
leaders of more than 60 American Indian tribes opened negotiations 
with the state for compacts to allow gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	State-approved gambling still has momentum after two decades of  
rapid growth. Even if the National Gambling Impact Study Commission 
formally recommends applying the brakes, there is no guarantee that 
expansion will slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	A bare majority of the nine-member commission approved a  
controversial sentence in the panel's draft report: ``Some 
policy-makers at all levels may want to impose an explicit 
moratorium on gambling expansion while awaiting further research 
and assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some commissioners favor the weaker word ``pause'' rather than  
``moratorium.'' The panel was resuming the debate today at a 
meeting in Washington. Its report to Congress, the White House, 
state governors and leaders of native American tribes is due June 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the final wording, there is reason to doubt  
whether any states, local governments or Indian tribes will 
voluntarily heed the commission's warning and stop or delay their 
courting of legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the country, gambling proponents voice the same  
argument: Why should we draw the line while our neighbors rake in 
the revenue? 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee state Sen. Ward Crutchfield, who is pushing to amend  
the state constitution to allow a lottery, said: ``Mississippi got 
one, Georgia got one. We're surrounded by states that are 
prospering from some type of gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home rule also is an issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is an attitude prevalent in West Virginia, probably not  
different than in many places, that we do our own thing. Around 
here we talk about the `pride of the mountaineer spirit,' not a 
commission in Washington,'' said the Rev. Nathan Wilson, executive 
director of the West Virginia Council of Churches. He opposes a 
proposal to create the state's first full-service casino at the 
famed Greenbrier resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The very day the gambling commission debated using the word  
``moratorium'' in its report, Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton floated the 
idea of introducing casinos throughout his state to raise money for 
historic preservation and the horse-racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, lawmakers are weighing a proposal to allow one  
casino in each of three counties. State Sen. James Jajuga, sponsor 
of the proposal, said a recent study showed that Massachusetts 
residents are spending $620 million a year at two Indian casinos in 
neighboring Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajuga said the commission's call for a moratorium ``wouldn't  
really inhibit or hamper my efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some, calling for a gambling ``pause'' now is like shutting  
the barn door after the horses are out. Gambling analyst Jason 
Ader, senior managing director at Bear Stearns brokerage, says most 
of the expansion has already taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, though, a strongly worded report by the  
commission could lend ammunition to gambling opponents in states 
and cities where lotteries or casinos are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Just recently, a Louisiana state legislator who proposed  
shutting down the state lottery cited the gambling commission's 
concerns that 5 percent of lottery players account for 50 percent 
of the money spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Thomas of the Northern Illinois Task Force Against the  
Expansion of Gambling has been invoking the commission's work in 
the battle against a proposed riverboat casino in Rosemont, a 
Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	And spurred by the commission's debate, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Scott  
McCallum called for a statewide moratorium on more Indian casinos. 
It's time to declare ``enough is enough,'' he said last week.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Diplomatic efforts to resolve the  
nearly 2-month-old conflict moved into higher gear today, and NATO 
accused Serb authorities anew of using ethnic Albanians as human 
shields. In what U.N. officials and NATO said was a worrying 
development, Serb forces today barred hundreds of ethnic Albanians 
who arrived at the Macedonian border in a packed train from leaving 
the province. The development came as a U.N. delegation was in 
Belgrade, preparing to make the first trip to Kosovo by 
international authorities since some 790,000 ethnic Albanians were 
driven out of the southern Serb province beginning March 24, when 
NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- For the first time in more than 70 years,  
Makah Indians seeking to re-establish their whale-hunting tradition 
harpooned and apparently killed a gray whale this morning off 
Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The whaling crew in a traditional, 
hand-carved cedar canoe struck the whale and motorized support 
boats moved in with guns and fired at least two shots to try to 
kill it. Gray whales were removed from the endangered species list 
in 1994, and the tribe moved to renew hunts guaranteed under an 
1855 treaty despite protests in anti-whaling circles.

could prove one of the most important steps in biotechnology since 
genetic engineering. The idea is to discover in nature substances 
that perform in a certain way but have drawbacks -- like a 
cancer-fighting protein that can only be used in small doses

<HEADLINE> Western Iowa Hit by Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Iowa (AP) -- Tornadoes roared through west-central Iowa,  
killing two, injuring at least 16 and causing damage in at least 
four counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes hit near Logan in western Iowa on Sunday. The  
storm moved east across the state, dropping golf-ball-size hail and 
up to 8 inches of rain. Already-swollen rivers and streams burst 
their banks, spreading over the saturated ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports from Harrison County said the two tornado  
victims died when some farm equipment hit their car, but Sheriff 
Terry Baxter said today he's not sure what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was unclear if they were killed by storm debris or by  
a traffic accident as a group of people from a high school 
graduation party in Logan fled the tornado in two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought they'd be safer in another residence, but the  
storm was coming too quick,'' Baxter said. He said one car was 
following the other when the first one stopped and was hit from 
behind by the second one. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see the storm coming and drove into a ditch and exited  
the vehicle,'' Baxter said. ``We're trying to determine if the 
accident was an accident from the collision or was caused by debris 
that was storm related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the two victims had not been released early today.  
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said 16 to 20 people were injured in the storm and  
were taken to hospitals. Of those, four were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy farm machines were scattered about like toys and  
galvanized steel corn bins were left crumpled like used tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of this morning, we don't have anyone missing. That's a  
good sign,'' Baxter said. ``I want to see how far this tornado 
went. I think we have 4 to 5 miles of destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado damaged at least 10 farms in Crawford County, but no  
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm system also caused flash flooding overnight in eastern  
Iowa, washing out roads and bridges in Buchanan County and closing 
a highway in Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 homes had to be evacuated and 10,000 customers lost  
power in southern Wisconsin as the storms went through there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Muskogee County, Okla., severe thunderstorms with wind up to  
70 mph wrecked 11 mobile homes and damaged others early today and 
left three people with minor injuries, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A school bus in Wainwright also was destroyed. ``The roof of a  
house went right through it,'' said Tommy Ragland, assistant 
director for Muskogee County Emergency Management.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Vs. Western Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against major Western currencies  
today as U.S. stocks and bonds fell on fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, however, as investors  
expected wider interest rate gaps between U.S. and Japanese bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0665 in late trading in New York, up  
from $1.0654 late Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.5030 Swiss 
francs, down from 1.5059, and 1.4593 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4640. The British pound was unchanged at $1.6184. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose, meanwhile, to 123.49 Japanese yen from 122.73  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were worried that the Federal Reserve's Open Markets  
Committee was considering raising interest rates following a report 
Friday that showed consumer prices jumping in April by the largest 
amount in nearly nine years. Higher rates would make borrowing 
harder and could cause corporate profits to slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC meets for two days starting Tuesday. While analysts  
didn't expect a change during this meeting, investors suspected the 
Fed would move toward raising rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange investors took their cues from stocks and  
bonds, selling off U.S. Treasurys with maturities of 10 years or 
less and plunging the Dow Jones industrial average as low as 167 
points before it recovered to close at 10,853.47, down 59.85. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we're mirroring the stock market,'' said John  
McCarthy, a senior vice president for foreign exchange at ING 
Barings Capital Markets. ``That's helping the euro (and other 
currencies) rise against the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Asian trading, investors ran up the dollar to a two-month  
high against the yen on expectations of widening gaps between U.S. 
and Japanese bond yields following Friday's price report. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on a benchmark Japanese 10-year government bond was  
1.230 Monday, while the yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond was 
hovering at 5.640 percent, underpinning the dollar's vigor against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers added to the  
dollar's strength by reiterating the position of outgoing Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin at a world trade conference Sunday, that a 
strong dollar is in the best interests of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the euro countries are no longer traded separately  
and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8339 German marks, down from 1.8359; 6.1501 French francs, down 
from 6.1576; and 1,814.88 Italian lire, down from 1,818.18.

<HEADLINE> Foxes Killed To Protect Rare Bird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Navy is killing protected foxes on a  
coastal island to save an even rarer species -- the San Clemente 
loggerhead shrike -- a tiny bird that is being eaten into extinction 
in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 13 shrikes are known to exist outside of captivity, and  
those are in danger of being devoured by the San Clemente Island 
foxes, of which there are about 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the foxes that showed a tendency to venture into  
shrike territory were killed this spring by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, which owns San Clemente Island, said it had to act  
because the shrike is on the federal endangered species list, which 
supersedes the state-protected fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of talk about which one do you want to  
protect,'' Navy spokesman Ken Mitchell said. ``What it comes down 
to is the fox is a state-protected species, and that is one step 
below an endangered species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shrike, about the size of a robin with a white underbelly,  
gray top and a black ``burglar's mask'' across its eyes, is 
exclusive to San Clemente Island, the most southerly and fourth 
largest of California's eight Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is responsible for the birds because it owns the  
property, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the Navy spent $2.3 million trying to save the birds,  
electronically guarding wild nests, raising some birds in captivity 
and killing other predators such as rats, wild cats and raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, efforts to stun the foxes with electric shock collars  
when they approached trees where shrikes live failed to dissuade 
enough of the furry predators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy had plans to kill up to 50 foxes a year using a ``two  
strikes'' rule. Foxes that cross the shock collar's electrical 
barrier more than once were to be executed. The program is 
temporarily on hold while scientists decide whether it is necessary 
to eliminate more foxes. 
</P>
<P>
	But more foxes may be killed later this spring when shrike  
fledglings emerge from their nests and are most vulnerable. 
Scientists also may trap foxes found within the shrikes' nesting 
area and release them after the young birds mature. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Navy SEALS occasionally practice storming the beaches and  
warships lob explosive shells and cruise missiles onto the island, 
Mitchell said there is no conflict between its training missions 
and the island's ecological survival. 
</P>
<P>
	San Clemente Island, off the Southern California coast and about  
60 miles northwest of San Diego, is home to 10 federally listed 
rare plants and animals. Another 28 species are being considered 
for listing.

<HEADLINE> Foxes Killed To Protect Rare Bird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Endangered foxes are being killed on San  
Clemente Island because they prey on an even rarer species of bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The federally protected San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike is  
one of the rarest birds in North America, with only 13 of these 
birds known to exist in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	But the small bird with a long tail and white belly is also food  
for a small island fox protected under the California Endangered 
Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Navy, which owns San Clemente Island and uses it for  
weapons research and as a communications center for ships and 
aircraft, is spending $2.3 million this year trying to save the 
shrike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has long controlled the rats, cats and birds that also  
feed on the shrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, experts had experimented with special collars that  
shocked the foxes when they approached trees where shrikes live. 
But that experiment was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, for the first time, scientists killed 15 out of the  
650 to 700 foxes on the island and shipped eight others to zoos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy decided to kill up to 50 foxes a year using a ``two  
strikes'' rule. Foxes that cross the shock collar's electrical 
barrier more than once are to be killed. For now, the program is on 
hold while scientists decide whether more foxes need to be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to have to keep making choices?'' asked David  
Garcelon, a wildlife biologist working with the Navy to protect the 
shrike. ``Do we like the ones that are furry? The ones with the 
pretty feathers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though federal and state officials say they are torn over the  
decision, ``it's the lesser of two evils,'' said Susan Cochrane, 
chief of habitat conservation planning for the state Department of 
Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
	More foxes may be killed later this spring when shrike  
fledglings emerge from their nests and are most vulnerable. Or, 
scientists may trap foxes found within the shrikes' nesting area 
and release them after the young birds mature.

<HEADLINE> The Limited's Earnings, Sales Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Limited Inc. said its first-quarter  
earnings rose nearly 30 percent as results improved at several of 
its clothing store chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest specialty apparel retailer reported Monday  
its net income, which excludes one-time items, was $33.5 million, 
or 14 cents per share, in the quarter ended May 1, up from $25.8 
million, or 9 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time items included the divestiture of the Abercrombie &AMP;  
Fitch chain last year. When one-time items are factored in, 
Limited's earnings fell nearly 58 percent from $79.4 million, or 28 
cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 4.8 percent to $2.1 billion from nearly $2.01  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited, which has been restructuring its struggling businesses  
over the past few years, reported an improved performance at 
several chains including Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, 
Limited Too and Intimate Brands. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeffrey Stein, an analyst with McDonald Investments Inc. of  
Cleveland, said the company is still struggling in the highly 
competitive retail business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a ways to go yet,'' Stein said today. ``They  
still continue to lose money in their women's businesses. It takes 
more than two seasons to convince me that the business is turning 
around, but there is progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein said the flagship Limited chain and Structure, which sells  
men's clothes, are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited announced plans recently to spin off its Limited Too  
girls clothing chain this summer and sell its majority interest in 
its Galyan's Trading Co. sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited operates about 3,600 stores, including the Express,  
Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Limited Stores chains. The company 
also owns about 84 percent of Intimate Brands Inc., which operates 
more than 1,800 stores through Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body 
Works.

<HEADLINE> FBI Reports Drop in Crime Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary FBI figures show that serious  
crime has dropped for the seventh consecutive year, a trend that 
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed to the administration's 
effective anti-crime policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw figures for 1998 indicated a 7 percent decline from 1997 in  
reported violent crimes and property offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Decreases were recorded for both violent crimes -- murder, rape,  
robbery and aggravated assault -- and property offenses -- burglary, 
larceny-theft, motor vehicle thefts and arson, said the report 
issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robberies were down 11 percent and vehicle thefts dropped 10  
percent from 1997 levels, while murders fell 8 percent and rape and 
aggravated assault were both down by 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Motor vehicle theft dropped 10 percent, and burglary and arson  
figures were each 7 percent lower, officials said. The number of 
larceny-thefts was down 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department provided percentage changes but not  
overall totals for the number of each type of crime reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the general decline showed the overall successes of  
the Clinton administration's crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of many factors, including more police  
officers, common-sense laws requiring background checks on gun 
purchasers, community policing, legislation banning assault 
weapons, practical partnerships between law enforcement and the 
communities they serve, more crime prevention programs and a host 
of effective comprehensive crime strategies,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton termed the seven-year trend ``remarkable,''  
saying in a statement: ``More community police on our streets and 
fewer guns in the hands of criminals have helped make our 
communities the safest they have been in a generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans question the effectiveness of the administration's  
cops-on-the-streets program and say there's still too little being 
done to crack down on violent criminals. They are backing a 
juvenile justice bill in Congress that would toughen penalties and 
introduce some new prevention programs for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are using the same bill to push for tougher gun  
control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 city, county and state law enforcement agencies  
voluntarily submit data each year for the FBI's Uniform Crime 
Reporting Program. The totals are published yearly in a report 
called ``Crime in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are not available until this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said overall declines of 8 percent were  
reported by law enforcement agencies in Northeastern and Western 
states. The South reported decreases of 6 percent, and the Midwest 
4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of murders dropped in all regions, led by 11 percent  
declines in the Northeast and West. In addition, the number of 
serious crimes fell in cities of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI figures were announced two days after the Senate, as  
part of the juvenile justice bill, voted 48-47 to place new 
restrictions on sales of firearms at gun shows despite Democratic 
assertions the legislation was filled with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's acrimonious, partisan debate was spurred in part by  
last month's massacre at a Colorado high school that left 15 
people, including two young gunmen, dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing that shooting, Clinton said the government has ``a  
responsibility to support law enforcement officers and pass 
common-sense gun legislation,'' such as ensuring background checks 
are required for purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control is not the only reason crime has been going down,  
said Naomi Paiss of Handgun Control Inc., ``but no one can argue 
that the availability of the guns in this country is a prime factor 
in predicting the decline of the crime rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a gun industry group said crime has declined because of more  
aggressive law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that has much at all to do with gun control.  
What I think it has to do with is law enforcement getting serious 
about enforcing laws that are already on the books,'' said Robert 
Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council. 
``The crime rate is dropping across the board, not just gun crime, 
and I think that's because of enforcement.''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey had some big advice for the  
dreamers among new Morehouse College grads. 
</P>
<P>
	``God can dream a bigger dream for you than you can ever dream  
for yourself,'' the talk show host told the 470 graduates at the 
historically black college Sunday. ``Real success comes when you 
learn to act as if everything depends on you, and pray as if 
everything depends on God.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Trying for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Since Affirmed became the last Triple Crown  
champion in 1978, six thoroughbreds have won the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness to stand on the brink of racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes foiled them all.  
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks, Charismatic will attempt to negotiate the 1 1/2  
miles of the final leg of racing's Triple Crown at Belmont Park. If 
he crosses the finish line first, a $5 million VISA bonus and 
racing immortality await. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does not, he will join a long list of also-rans, the most  
recent of which include Real Quiet (1998), Silver Charm (1997), 
Sunday Silence (1989), Alysheba (1987), Pleasant Colony (1981) and 
Spectacular Bid (1979). 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 25 horses have taken the first two races of the Triple  
Crown. Only 11 have succeeded in sweeping the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday morning, trainer D. Wayne Lukas sounded upbeat as he  
assessed his big chestnut colt's chances of joining the likes of 
Affirmed, Secretariat and Citation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the style and strength to get it,'' Lukas said the day  
after Charismatic's powerful move around the final turn launched 
him to a 1 1/2-length victory over Menifee in the Preakness. ``But you 
can't go out there saying `We're going to beat these horses.' We're 
not talking Secretariat here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, actually, he was. Following the race, Lukas pointed out  
that Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall, was significantly 
influenced by Secretariat in his pedigree. And, in fact, resembled 
his ancestor more than his smaller, darker sire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's time for the gene pool to start kicking in,'' Lukas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third straight year a horse has gone for the  
Triple Crown, and the first time that has happened since Seattle 
Slew and Affirmed won Triple Crowns in 1977 and 1978, and 
Spectacular Bid fell short in his try in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years, horses trained by Bob Baffert have come  
close to capturing racing's elusive prize. Baffert, who trains the 
fillies Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday, will not be making 
the trip to New York this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting off at this bus stop,'' he said after Excellent  
Meeting was pulled up in the Preakness when she experienced trouble 
breathing. The filly was scoped and Baffert reported she was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Baffert won't be there, owners Bob and Beverly Lewis  
will. Two years ago, their Silver Charm was upended by Touch Gold 
in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for the Triple Crown twice in the same lifetime,  
imagine that,'' said Lewis, who celebrated his 75th birthday on 
Wednesday. ``I wouldn't be so rash as to predict we'll win, but 
wouldn't it be wonderful. If he doesn't, well, we've been there, 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the spoiler's role was played by Victory Gallop. The  
horse trained by Elliott Walden finished second in both the Derby 
and Preakness before winning by a nose in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Walden is back in the same position with Menifee, the  
fast-closing colt who lost the Derby by a neck and missed by a bit 
more in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's different this year is I feel good about going on and  
trying Charismatic again in the Belmont, maybe because of the 
experience last year,'' Walden said. ``Wayne's horse is in a zone 
now. I can't feel bad standing here with the second best 3-year-old 
in the country. It's beginning to look like it's between the two 
horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont, on June 5, could draw as many as 11 challengers for  
Charismatic, a former claimer who heads to New York with a 16-race 
resume and three straight wins that began with the Lexington Stakes 
on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Menifee, others set for the Belmont include:  
Badge and Stephen Got Even, the third- and fourth-place Preakness 
finishers; Lemon Drop Kid (ninth in the Derby); Comeonmom, Best of 
Luck, Vision and Verse and Pineaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Cat Thief, who finished third in the Derby and  
seventh in the Preakness, won't make the trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was set to return to Churchill Downs today, while  
his jockey, Chris Antley, was back riding in California. Lukas, 
too, returns to Louisville to oversee Belmont preparations for his 
colt, who could have been purchased for $62,500 after a claiming 
race in February, but there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races, said Charismatic will  
have his final Belmont tuneup on June 1 before shipping east the 
following day, when the draw for post positions takes place and 
excitement will begin to mount for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, excitement is building in Walton, Ky., home of  
Affirmed's jockey Steve Cauthen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's meant to happen, and if the whole thing falls  
together, it would be great,'' Cauthen said. ``Seeing stars being 
made -- and Charismatic would be a genuine thoroughbred star -- 
that's what racing needs.''

<HEADLINE>  Miami Makeover Likely After Flop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat's first-round flop against the New  
York Knicks prompted a twist on the usual fan criticism: Fire the 
players, not the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pat Riley, part owner of the team as well as the coach, may  
do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley thought he built a team ready to fill the championship  
void created by Michael Jordan's retirement. Instead, the Heat were 
eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the third time 
in Riley's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's last-second shot Sunday for the New York Knicks  
drove home the point: Miami needs a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll sit down and talk about what we're going to do  
this offseason,'' Riley said after the Heat became just the second 
top-seeded team to lose in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Riley should share in the blame, because his blueprint  
is a bust. But his four world championship rings with the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the 1980s still carry considerable clout, and 
Riley has been spared in the backlash of criticism triggered by 
Sunday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Heat players will take the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	As is his custom, Riley laid low on the first day of the  
offseason and didn't talk to the media Monday. So speculation began 
without him. The question is not whether he'll shake up the roster, 
but how. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player considered untouchable is center Alonzo  
Mourning, who had an MVP-caliber year and a fine series against the 
Knicks. But his teammates, including point guard Tim Hardaway, can 
only wonder whether they'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to war with this group of guys, and I don't want  
to see change,'' Mourning said. ``But this game is about change, 
and with Riles running the ship, if adjustments have to be made, 
he'll make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks series confirmed adjustments have to be made. The  
Heat became the first No. 1 seed from the Eastern Conference to 
lose against a No. 8 seed. Last year, Miami was the first No. 2 
seed from the East to be eliminated by a No. 7 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Miami lost both times to the despised  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was tough. This is going to be even tougher,'' guard  
Dan Majerle said. ``We play hard, but we just haven't been able to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York underscored the Heat's deficiencies:  
they rely too much on outside shots and badly need a scorer at 
shooting guard or small forward. Miami has no reliable third option 
beyond Mourning and Hardaway, who struggled through a miserable 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway shot 27 percent against the Knicks and averaged 9.0  
points per game, barely half his average. He was shut out in the 
second half of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad stretch I hit, and I didn't come through for  
my team,'' he said. ``That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his productivity curtailed, Miami averaged just 79.0 points  
against New York, the second-lowest figure in a five-game series in 
NBA history. The Heat set the record of 78.6 against the Bulls two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's biggest decision will be whether to keep Hardaway, the  
Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is a lackluster 12-18, 
and with the offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely 
to stand pat.

<HEADLINE> New Jordanian King Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israel voted, choosing what kind of leader  
and approach to take in Mideast negotiations, King Abdullah of 
Jordan began a week of talks here by pledging to ``stand side by 
side'' with peace-minded Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The core issue is the Palestinian-Israeli peace process,''  
Abdullah said, reviving the traditional Arab slogan that if the 
conflict with the Jewish state were resolved other problems in the 
region would be more easily addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met with the king  
over breakfast at the State Department, openly encouraged Abdullah 
to seek additional American economic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Clinton administration was encouraging trade and  
investment in the Arab kingdom and was providing wheat to help 
overcome a drought. Albright also said friendship with the monarchy 
was being affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	What Albright would not talk about was the Israeli election, in  
which Ehud Barak, the candidate of the Labor party and its allies, 
is poised to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is far 
more skeptical about relinquishing territory to the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright said ``we continue to be dedicated to the Wye  
process,'' referring to the land-for-security agreement reached 
last October by Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S.-mediated accords, Netanyahu agreed to give up  
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for promises by 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to root out terrorism in areas 
already under his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu halted the pullback after yielding 2 percent, saying  
Arafat had not done enough to assure Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has been at peace with Israel for five years, and for  
many more years unofficially before the late King Hussein came to 
terms. Abdullah is eager to see the Jewish state make 
accommodations to the Palestinians and Syria, both of which have 
made territorial claims on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's economic condition was at least as much a topic on the  
king's visit as the Arab-Israeli dispute. Peace with Israel has not 
produced the economic miracle to pull the Arab kingdom out of the 
doldrums, and the Clinton administration has its checkbook ready. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is urging Japan, Germany, France and other  
creditor nations to cancel or postpone payment of Jordan's debts to 
help the new king cope with the faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah arrived at the State Department with a screeching  
police motorcycle escort and will be treated with special deference 
by the administration, partly in tribute to his father, partly to 
promote Arab friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	The king is due also to meet with Clinton at the White House  
Tuesday and hold talks with Cabinet officers and members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The king is staying at Blair House, the presidential guest house  
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, as well as at a 
Georgetown hotel. Ceremony and lavish dinners are being arranged 
for his first visit as king. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Abdullah succeeded to the Jordanian throne after Hussein's  
death three months ago, he has shown coolness toward Netanyahu and 
reached out to Syria for better relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old king told reporters two weeks ago in Amman that  
Israel's leaders could have peace with the Arabs in one month if 
they wanted it. ``The ball is in Israel's court,'' Abdullah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already has forgiven Jordan's $700 million debt to the  
United States and is providing $200 million in yearly assistance. 
On top of that, he has asked Congress for an additional $100 
million this year with $200 million to follow over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Indyk, the assistant secretary of state for the Near  
East, told reporters before Abdullah's arrival Friday from Canada 
that Clinton was asking other nations to forgive or defer Jordan's 
debts, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan is a critical ally in the region and a key part of the  
peace process,'' Indyk said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Speedy Trial Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to clarify the  
speedy-trial rights of people who are charged with a crime in one 
state while serving prison time in another state. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will consider New York prosecutors' bid to  
reinstate a man's convictions of second-degree murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's highest court had voided Michael Hill's convictions  
and ordered the charges against him dismissed, saying prosecutors 
failed to bring him to trial within 180 days as required by the 
Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, adopted in 1957, gives defendants a right to a  
speedy trial even if they are imprisoned in another state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was being held at the Lorain Correctional Institution in  
Grafton, Ohio, in 1993 when New York authorities filed notice that 
he was wanted for murder and robbery in the shooting death of 
Michael Weeks in the Rochester suburb of Gates on New Year's Eve 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill invoked the speedy-trial provisions of the interstate  
agreement. Later, pretrial maneuvering by Hill's lawyers put the 
deadline on hold for about seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clock was running in January 1995 when prosecution and  
defense lawyers met to set a trial date. The prosecutor noted a May 
1 trial date had been discussed, and when asked by the judge, 
Hill's lawyer said, ``That will be fine, your honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The following April, Hill's lawyers sought dismissal of the  
charges on grounds that prosecutors had failed to bring him to 
trial within 180 days. A judge refused, and Hill was convicted and 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court upheld the conviction, but the New York Court  
of Appeals ordered the charges dismissed. His lawyer's agreement to 
the trial date did not waive Hill's speedy-trial protection because 
he did not make an ``affirmative request'' for a trial date beyond 
the 180-day deadline, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Monroe County prosecutors said the  
deadline should not turn on ``hypertechnical semantics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is New York vs. Hill, 98-1299.

<HEADLINE> Report: Death Penalty Biased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The system for administering the death penalty  
in the United States is fraught with racial prejudice that leads a 
disproportionate number of minorities to face capital punishment, 
Amnesty International USA said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty used the findings of a study of capital punishment in  
America to urge abolition of the death penalty because it said 
discrimination pervades the system at every level. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, 81 percent of the 500 prisoners  
executed between 1977 and 1998 were convicted of murdering a white 
person, although blacks and whites are victims of homicide in 
almost equal numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 133 federal death penalty prosecutions authorized by the  
attorney general since 1988, 101 of the defendants have been 
members of minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	A black person killing a white person also is 11 times more  
likely to face a death sentence than the killer in the opposite 
scenario, Amnesty reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, whether those charged with crimes in the U.S. live or  
die appears to be largely determined by the color of their skin and 
the race of their victim,'' said William Schulz, Amnesty USA's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has leveled similar charges in the past, faulting the  
nation's law enforcement authorities for ignoring the situation. In 
a letter to Amnesty, the office of Attorney General Janet Reno said 
it supports the death penalty in appropriate cases but added: ``We 
are unalterably opposed to its application in an unfair manner, 
particularly if that unfairness is grounded in racial or other 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report chronicled the levels at which racial bias can  
infiltrate the system, from the local district attorneys who decide 
whether to seek the death penalty to the jurors who hear the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cited a 1998 study by the Death Penalty Information  
Center that found blacks in Philadelphia are almost four times as 
likely to be sentenced to death as others convicted of similar 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	In other situations, prosecutors have sought to keep blacks out  
of the jury box, according to Amnesty. The report cites the case of 
Albert Jefferson, a black man convicted of murdering a white in 
Alabama. The prosecutor in the case removed 26 potential black 
jurors in order to obtain an all-white jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Supreme Court has ruled that removal of potential  
jurors on the basis of race was unconstitutional, Amnesty said the 
problem persists because proving ``purposeful discrimination'' is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Discrimination can even come from court-appointed lawyers who  
represent clients too poor to afford counsel. A California man, 
Melvin Wade, was called racial slurs by his own lawyer. He was 
sentenced to death.

<HEADLINE>  Failed Japan Bank Exec Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An executive of a failed Japanese bank was found  
hanged Monday in his company dormitory room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent suicide was the second in the last two weeks by  
officials from the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., who 
reportedly faced questioning about an alleged cover-up of bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The death follows a series of suicides over the past two years  
by top corporate and government officials linked to scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazunori Fukuda, 51, was found dead in his room by a manager of  
the dormitory in the city of Nishinomiya, a police official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Credit Bank, once one of Japan's top banks, was  
nationalized last year after regulators said it would never be able 
to dig its way out from under a mountain of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the government had taken over a bank since  
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices collapsed in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank executives denied that LTCB was insolvent as the government  
moved to take it over in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Fukuda, most recently the manager of the bank's Osaka branch,  
served until last summer as managing director of the bank's 
real-estate loan division, media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive faced questioning by prosecutors over the alleged  
falsification of financial records to hide the extent of the bank's 
bad-loan problems, national broadcaster NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A former LTCB vice president, Takashi Uehara, 59, was found  
hanged earlier this month in a Tokyo hotel room. Prosecutors had 
been questioning Uehara about the alleged cover-up, media reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, suicide is often seen as a respectable way to avoid  
the disgrace of scandal.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Iowa (AP) -- Two people died in tornadoes that injured at  
least 14 in western Iowa and caused damage in at least four 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the injured Sunday were taken to Community Memorial  
Hospital in Missouri Valley. Names of the two people who died were 
not been released pending notification of relatives, said Jim 
Seymour, a hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to piece all this together,'' said Harrison  
County Sheriff Terry Baxter. ``We're looking at possibly three 
tornadoes between Logan and Beebeetown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes, which developed about 4 p.m., destroyed six  
homes, damaged several others and destroyed a bridge on a rural 
gravel road, the Harrison County sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Welcome Center near Missouri Valley had parts of the  
roof blown off, Baxter said. U.S. Highway 30 and Iowa Highway 127 
were closed due to extensive damage reported in the area, including 
downed trees and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pottawattamie County, authorities reported two tornadoes  
touching down near State Highway 92, one of them reportedly more 
than a mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it tear through some houses and a couple of barns went  
up and then the tornado maxed out,'' said Matt Ver Steeg, a storm 
spotter for Des Moines station KCCI-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Pottawattamie authorities said there were no immediate reports  
of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado destroyed at least one farmhouse in Crawford County,  
but no injuries were reported, a Crawford County sheriff's 
dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, thunderstorms in eastern Iowa dumped more than 3  
inches of rain by late evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rainfall caused flooding in several counties, including  
Hardin County in central Iowa and Black Hawk, Buchanan, Delaware 
and Dubuque counties in northeastern Iowa, the National Weather 
Service said.

<HEADLINE> Robots Edge Toward Operating Rooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The suture moves evenly through a tiny artery the  
size of a strand of spaghetti as the surgeon stitches up the 
patient's heart. 
</P>
<P>
	But wait, those aren't hands doing the work -- they're gray metal  
pincers. A robot is performing heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Where's the human doctor? Not even standing by his patient, but  
over in a corner, moving the robot with joysticks like the ones 
kids use on video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet Zeus, a three-armed robot that Seattle surgeon Dr. Robert  
Lazzara believes one day will help heart patients get better 
treatment, heal faster and at lower cost -- one example in a 
movement to put robots into operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accuracy is incredible,'' Lazzara, associate medical  
director of The Hope Heart Institute, said Monday as he unveiled 
the robot at a meeting of 5,000 biotechnologists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether Zeus is  
safe enough to use in experiments with up to 150 heart patients 
around the country, a big step in moving the robot toward the 
market, said Yulan Wang, founder of California-based Computer 
Motion Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Robots won't replace surgeons, stressed engineer Shankar Sastry,  
who heads the University of California, Berkeley, medical robotics 
program. Instead, the hope is that they'll extend surgical 
capability -- providing more precision for very tricky operations, 
and letting doctors perform more operations minimally invasively 
instead of having to cut patients open. 
</P>
<P>
	And robots don't face one problem every surgeon knows -- a hand  
tremor after hours of painstaking surgery. A robot's hand should 
never shake. 
</P>
<P>
	How do robots perform surgery?  
</P>
<P>
	In a videotaped demonstration, Lazzara sat at a computer  
terminal yards from the operating table. Zeus' three arms were 
positioned inside the patient's chest through pencil-sized holes. 
One of the arms was a voice-activated camera named the AESOP 3000 
that beamed close-up pictures of the patient's heart back to 
Lazzara's computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``AESOP up,'' Lazzara ordered, and the camera inched up to give  
him a better view. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the joysticks and aided by computer-enhanced positioning,  
he directed Zeus' two pincer-style arms in stitching up the tiny 
artery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The precision with which these sutures are placed cannot be  
done in any fashion utilizing the naked eye,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimally invasive heart surgery, in which doctors operate  
through 3- or 4-inch incisions instead of sawing open the 
breastbone, is popular with patients because it promises less pain 
and faster healing. But it's very difficult to operate in that 
confined area with long-handled instruments, and some doctors say 
the surgery's too risky compared with standard open-heart 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Motion predicts Zeus' precision will enable heart  
surgery through even tinier incisions more safely. The robot places 
stitches within one-tenth to one-twentieth of a millimeter 
accuracy, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one skeptical doctor who viewed Monday's demonstration  
noted Lazzara had operated on a bloodless cadaver, and questioned 
whether the robot's pincers would slip on a living patient's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Motion is training surgeons on cadavers and live  
animals so they'll be able to control the robot properly, Wang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkeley's Sastry, however, calls heart surgery too problematic  
an area to introduce robots, and predicts robots instead will allow 
minimally invasive surgery in spots surgeons now have trouble 
reaching. 
</P>
<P>
	His lab created robotic arms with tiny wrists, to let them  
swivel and rotate like a real hand. He has FDA permission to begin 
clinical trials this fall using the robot in minimally invasive 
colon surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also is examining a robot for regular-size surgery, a  
system called RoboDoc that replaces hips. 
</P>
<P>
	In traditional hip replacements, doctors chisel by hand a hole  
for the hip implant. If the chiseling isn't precise, the implant 
can slide around painfully. 
</P>
<P>
	With RoboDoc, three-dimensional computer software measures the  
implant site and then the robot more accurately drills the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Key to all robots: ``It lets not the most gifted surgeon operate  
with the same level of confidence and dexterity'' as specialists 
do, Sastry said. ``We'd like to have as uniform health care as we 
can. ... I think this technology's pretty close.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Auto Records Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, granting a Clinton  
administration appeal, today agreed to judge the validity of a 
federal law that closes state motor vehicle records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices will use a dispute from South Carolina to decide,  
sometime in 2000, whether Congress unlawfully usurped state 
governments' authority when it enacted the Driver's Privacy 
Protection Act of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Four federal appeals courts have considered that question. Two  
have struck down the law, and two have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect in most states in 1997, bars states  
and their employees from releasing most ``personal information'' 
about drivers gathered in the licensing process. Name, address, 
telephone number, Social Security, photograph and other forms of 
identification are to be inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
	States routinely sell such information to businesses, charities  
and political candidates. Such sales account for millions of 
dollars in state revenues each year. When the law was enacted, 34 
states made motor vehicle records public in some form. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law was enacted in response to the 1989 slaying of  
actress Rebecca Schaeffer, killed at her California home by a 
stalker who used a private investigator to obtain her driver's 
license records. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, however, exempts disclosures made to law enforcement  
officials, courts, governmental agencies and private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	No exemption is included for the news media, moving some  
open-record advocates to contend that the law violates the First 
Amendment's free-press guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South Carolina case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals ruled that the law ``is simply not a valid exercise of 
Congress' ... power'' to regulate interstate commerce and therefore 
violates the 10th Amendment. The appeals court's ruling blocked the 
law's enforcement in South Carolina, Maryland, North Carolina, 
Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also has been invalidated by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals, and therefore cannot be enforced in Alabama, Georgia 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has been upheld by the 7th and 10th U.S. Circuit Courts  
of Appeals, which have jurisdiction over a total of nine states: 
Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, 
Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	In challenging the law, South Carolina officials relied heavily  
on a recent series of Supreme Court rulings that have reined in 
congressional power in the name of states' autonomy. A federal 
trial judge and the 4th Circuit court ruled for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress may only subject state governents to generally  
applicable laws,'' the appeals court said. ``Rather than enacting a 
law of general applicability that incidentally applies to the 
states, Congress passed a law that, for all intents and purposes, 
applies only to the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court noted that a 1997 high court ruling struck  
down key portions of the Brady gun-control law after finding that 
Congress lacked the power to ``commandeer'' state law enforcement 
officials to conduct background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking Supreme Court review, Justice Department lawyers said  
the Driver's Privacy Protection Act is different. The law ``affects 
states as owners of databases; it does not affect them in their 
role as governments,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``State officials may, of course, have to take administrative  
steps to bring their agencies into compliance with the DPPA,'' the 
appeal said. ``The necessity for taking such steps to ensure that 
states conform to federal law does not amount to 'commandeering' of 
state governments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal added that South Carolina officials ``offered no  
state interest in favor of unqualified disclosure of personal 
information in motor vehicle records to place in the balance 
against the privacy interest that Congress has indentified as 
warranting protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Reno vs. Condon, 98-1464.

<HEADLINE> Shooter's Parents Say Son Seemed OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Michael Carneal's parents say they saw no  
signs that he was suffering from mental illness before he opened 
fire on a student prayer group, killing three students. 
</P>
<P>
	They said their only explanation for their son's action was that  
he suffered from a mental illness hidden until the rampage, The 
Paducah Sun reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came in a deposition taken this month in a civil  
suit brought by parents of the three girls slain in the December 
1997 shooting at Heath High School. Five other students were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	John and Ann Carneal are among 10 defendants still a part of the  
suit. Judge Will Shadoan has dismissed numerous others as 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, John Carneal said he has read more than 100  
books on mental illness since the shooting, and believes his son 
suffers from a form of schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the diagnosis first made by a psychiatrist who was  
hired as part of the criminal case against Michael. He pleaded 
guilty but mentally ill to murder and was sentenced to life in 
prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the shooting, Carneal said, he viewed his 15-year-old  
son as a passive, happy person who was not aggressive and not a 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a person who enjoyed people but was an observer of life  
rather than a participant,'' Carneal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carneals said they never had any concern that their son had  
potential for violence because he avoided confrontations and was 
compassionate. He even dropped out of karate lessons after he 
accidentally hit a friend too hard and knocked his breath out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never went back because he hurt his friend,'' Carneal said.  
``That is the Michael Carneal that I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy that I see now is not in any way, shape, form or  
fashion the boy who lived in my house,'' Carneal said. ``They are 
entirely different people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carneal said she was shocked at some of the items found in  
her son's room after the shooting. They included copies of 
pornographic material downloaded from the Internet, documents from 
the Internet that gave instructions for violence, and violent 
stories that Michael had written. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she occasionally ``snooped'' in her son's room but had  
not seen those items. She couldn't speculate on how she would have 
reacted if she had seen them before the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at one piece of work might lead to one response ...  
but putting them all together, there is quite a different picture 
emerging,'' she testified. ``It shows someone who is very hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Apologies Made for Minnesota Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins said Monday he is sorry the  
investigation into allegations of academic fraud in the Minnesota 
men's basketball program has shaken the school, then said he hasn't 
done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're running a clean basketball program,'' he said during an  
interview on WCCO. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's probe started when a former manager in the  
academic counseling office said she did coursework for players from 
1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff claims she wrote or helped write more than 400  
papers for former and current men's basketball players. She also 
claims Haskins provided money for her to continue tutoring a player 
after the academic advising office ordered her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Former player Russ Archambault has said Haskins gave him money  
on several occasions, a violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	While Haskins has denied those allegations, he refused to  
directly address the investigation during the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by talk show host Dark Star if he did anything wrong,  
Haskins said: ``Well, you know, the thing is, I don't want to get 
into that at all, Dark. In my mind, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has made statements through his attorney but had not  
previously granted interviews on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who has yet to be interviewed by investigators, said he  
has been hurt personally by the allegations. But he said he does 
not plan to quit and will honor his contract and continue coaching 
for another three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	External investigators have interviewed 50 people and plan to  
talk with another 70, according to university officials. 
Investigators have reviewed thousands of documents, including 
analysis of data from computers in the academic counseling unit and 
the men's basketball office. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said the investigation is expected to be  
wrapped up by the end of September. A report to the NCAA is 
expected by next spring.

<HEADLINE> Farm Equipment Makers To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New Holland, a large Dutch-based maker of farm equipment, will  
buy Wisconsin-based Case Corp. for $4.3 billion, creating a 
formidable new competitor to the industry leader Deere &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Monday, comes as sales in the big-ticket  
farm industry continue to slump because of depressed commodity 
prices for farmers. Analysts said the companies will combine 
complementary product lines and bolster each other's geographic 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good long-term strategic move for the companies, done  
at a time when they are both reeling from a weak farm economy,'' 
said Eli Lustgarten, managing director for Schroder and Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Case shareholders would receive $55 a share  
in cash from New Holland, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Holland's parent company, Fiat, would retain a 71 percent  
controlling interest in the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose name hasn't yet been determined, will be  
based at Case's Racine, Wis. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any way you look at this, this deal makes sense,'' said  
Umberto Quadrino, chief executive officer of New Holland, which has 
big operations in England and Italy. ``We both needed to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Pierre Rosso, the Case chairman, will head the new company.  
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to realize $400 million to $500 million in cost  
savings within the next three to four years,'' he said. ``We think 
that maybe is just the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Shalett, a senior research analyst with Sanford Bernstein  
in New York, praised the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The product lines are complementary,'' she said. ``If you are  
willing to look out two or three years, when they can benefit from 
cost-savings, financially, it is a great deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies had 1998 combined sales of $7.6 billion for  
farm equipment, just slightly more than John Deere, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Case focuses on the larger horsepower tractors and combines for  
big farmers, while New Holland makes smaller tractors and hay and 
forage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	New Holland has a strong foothold in Europe, while Case is well  
established in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The $55 a share price is probably at the low end of fair value  
for Case, Shalett said. ``Fiat is getting a good deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Case earned $64 million, down sharply from $403 million  
a year earlier. Annual revenues were $6.15 billion in 1998, up from 
$5.8 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	New Holland earned $559.2 million last year on $5.7 billion in  
revenues. In 1997, the company earned $477 million on $5.8 billion 
in revenues 
</P>
<P>
	Case employs 17,700 workers and operates through 4,900  
independent dealers and distributors. New Holland has 6,100 dealers 
and employs 21,300 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers for both companies will continue selling one brand of  
machinery, Rosso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Case shares rose $3.68 3/4 to $48.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. New Holland's U.S. shares fell $1.18 3/4 to $16.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Meet Calif. Air Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said its decision to make  
all its pickup trucks meet California's stricter emissions 
standards was not done to win favor with environmental groups that 
have criticized the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an action to appease any fringe environmental  
groups,'' Ford president Jac Nasser said Monday. ``This is an 
action we truly believe has goodness in it in terms of impact on 
clean air. That's what drives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its popular F-series pickups will begin meeting the  
California standards in the 2000 model year, which begins in 
October. Its compact Ranger pickups will meet the standards in the 
2001 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford did not reveal how much the move would cost, but Nasser  
said the technology was affordable and would not result in higher 
sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows Ford's decision last year to make all its sport  
utility vehicles and Windstar minivans meet the so-called Low 
Emission Vehicle, or LEV, standards starting with the '99 models. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been aggressively promoting its environmental  
consciousness, especially since Nasser and new Chairman William 
Clay Ford Jr. took over leadership of the No. 2 automaker in 
January. At the same time, the company has been criticized by some 
environmental groups for its heavy promotion of pickups and SUVs, 
which generally pollute more than cars and use more fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said Ford also was working to make its fleet more  
fuel-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its trucks that meet the LEV standards will emit from  
15 percent to more than 50 percent fewer smog-forming emissions 
than conventional trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the conversion is completed, a maximum of about 2 million  
Ford trucks a year will meet the lower standards. Ford said the 
result would be equivalent to eliminating all smog-producing 
emissions from 350,000 full-size pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been able to meet the LEV standards cost-effectively  
because its new family of engines permit newer catalytic convertor 
technology to be used, said Kelly Brown, director of vehicle 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also said the move was not in response to the federal  
government's recent decision to require more stringent emission 
levels to be phased in starting in 2004. But Ford said some of its 
2000 trucks will exceed the government's proposed initial 
requirements for 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, none of Ford's cars sold outside California meet the LEV  
standard. Nasser indicated that LEV cars will be added to Ford's 
lineup as model changeovers occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. began selling its four-cylinder Accord sedan  
that meets the LEV standard nationwide last year. 
</P>
<P>
	California is in the process of phasing in the tougher  
standards, which differ for cars and trucks and vary based on the 
vehicle's weight. Automakers also are working with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to meet voluntary national LEV 
standards starting in 2001, but there are no such national 
standards set for pickups.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Urges Stable Sino-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Steady U.S.-China ties are crucial to global  
stability, and the United States should be sensitive to Chinese 
history and culture to maintain the relationship, Hong Kong Chief 
Executive Tung Chee-hwa said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a keynote address to an international business conference,  
Tung said, ``Stable and constructive Sino-U.S. relations are 
crucial, not only to China and the United States, not only to the 
Asia-Pacific region, but to the world as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries have held talks on China's entry into the  
World Trade Organization, the global trade liberalization watchdog, 
but their relationship was strained after NATO bombed the Chinese 
embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi, chief negotiator in  
the WTO talks, said the bombing was a ``serious incident,'' but 
didn't comment on whether it could derail WTO talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing, which NATO said was an accident, killed three  
journalists, set off waves of anti-U.S. protests in China, and 
prompted Beijing to cut discussions on military relations and other 
issues with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu said she hopes the international investment community isn't  
expecting too much from China in terms of economic liberalization 
and reform as it negotiates to join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	She said China is committed to market-opening measures, but they  
will have to be conducted in a stable and steady manner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has to recognize that different countries, with  
different history, culture and most likely in different stages of 
socioeconomic development have different needs,'' Tung said. ``Each 
nation has to find its own way forward as she develops.''

<HEADLINE> Search Renewed for Missing Couple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Donna Morrow disappeared a week before  
Christmas 1991, leaving behind four young children and their 
unwrapped gifts still hidden in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Joe, was accused of her murder. First he attempted  
suicide. Then, when his wife's family sued him, Joe Morrow 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	That was six years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Now Menlo Park police investigators are renewing their search  
for the Morrows -- Donna, who is believed buried somewhere around 
the Silicon Valley, and Joe, who police think is hiding in 
California, Colorado or somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week investigators unsealed a $10 million warrant for Joe  
Morrow, 45 when he disappeared, admitting that their long-term, 
low-profile manhunt had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years we thought we could catch him more easily if he  
didn't know we were looking for him, but that didn't really work 
out,'' said Menlo Park police commander Dominick Peloso. ``Now 
we're enlisting the public's help. If anyone sees Joe Morrow, they 
should call 911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna's mother, Shirley Rubio, said she's glad the search is  
picking up again. ``I don't live with rage,'' she said. ``I'm just 
very unhappy, wondering every day if I will have closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rubio, who lives in West Plains, Mo., last spoke with her  
daughter Dec. 12, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donna called on my birthday and she was crying, saying she  
wanted to leave Joe. She said she wanted to send me something, but 
I told her to save her money so she could support the kids,'' Mrs. 
Rubio said. ``I know she's dead, because if she was alive, she 
would have called me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Morrow was last seen alive Dec. 19 by a neighborhood  
friend. Joe Morrow, a successful businessman, reported her missing 
four days later. He told police they had argued and that Donna had 
walked out late one night with her purse and keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family said Donna Morrow, 37 when she disappeared,  
was a devoted mother whose marriage was falling apart. They said 
she talked about Joe's temper, their fights and how he didn't want 
her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspected her husband, but failed to gather enough  
evidence to charge him until after he disappeared. ``It's 
frustrating. We had him, but we didn't nail him,'' Peloso said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1992, investigators interviewed Morrow. The next  
day, his mother reported him missing. He was found in a motel room, 
suffering from what appeared to be an attempted overdose of 
Halcion, a sleeping pill. He left 24 suicide notes, none of which 
was written to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Court reports show that a blood stain found in the Morrow house  
doesn't match the DNA of Joe or the couple's children. Donna Morrow 
could not be excluded as a possible source, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	After her daughter disappeared, Mrs. Rubio sued Joe Morrow on  
behalf of the four children -- Joseph Jr., Elizabeth, Carrie and 
Alma -- who were ages 12 to 5 when they last saw their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the case Joe Morrow vanished. His attorney said  
he stopped calling and failed to make a court appearance on an 
unrelated grand theft charge in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the disappearance caught them off guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to keep in regular contact with him,'' Peloso  
said. ``All of a sudden he wasn't available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, with Joe Morrow missing, his attorneys settled the  
wrongful death case, agreeing to set up a conservatorship that 
would solely benefit the Morrow children. They will receive their 
portion of the estate, worth about $2 million, when each turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The children have been raised by Joe Morrow's brother and  
sister-in-law, David and Ruth Morrow of Roseville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the children, nor their uncle and aunt, have spoken at  
length with reporters. Police said that the Morrow family has 
refused to help with their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Ruth Morrow told lawyers during a  
deposition that the children were haunted by the loss of their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hard for us because we want to give them answers and  
we just can't,'' she said in a deposition in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menlo Park, an affluent Silicon Valley community with wide  
streets, thick oaks and lawns that spill across neighborhood yards, 
has four police detectives. One of them is always assigned to the 
Morrow case. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the years of frustration, Peloso won't give up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm sure she's dead. Yes, I'm sure Joe did it,'' he said.  
He tapped a photo of Donna Morrow, smiling up from his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``And yes,'' he said, ``I'm sure we're going to catch him.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Dole May Make Pledge to McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole says he's not sure his wife  
will seek the Republican presidential nomination. He's even 
considering contributing to the campaign of one of her competitors, 
Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain's my friend. And he's not raising the money that (Texas  
Gov.) George Bush is. I think we need to keep good people in the 
race,'' Dole said in an interview in today's New York Times. ``So 
I've thought about ways to help McCain in particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But before writing out the check, the former senator added, ``I  
think I'd check with Elizabeth first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizonan, is an announced candidate for the GOP  
nomination in 2000. Bush and Mrs. Dole are exploring whether to 
formally enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sort of leaning that she'll do it,'' said Dole, who ran  
three times for the presidency. ``If there's no response out there, 
or if it looks impossible, this is not her whole life. If she can't 
raise the money, obviously it's pretty hard to be a candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Redistricting Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it harder today for  
federal judges to invalidate election districts drawn by state 
legislatures on grounds that race was the major factor in setting 
the boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's unanimous ruling in a North Carolina case could have  
great influence on redistricting disputes nationwide after the 2000 
census -- causing judges to be more certain of the role race played 
before deciding to strike down any reapportionment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling did not, however, indicate a major change in the  
Supreme Court's hostility to making race the prime factor in 
drawing election district boundaries. The court has been intent 
since 1993 on minimizing the use of race. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions, the court has said that drawing  
districts primarily to maintain or enhance minority voting power 
unlawfully discriminates against white voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices did vote to overturn a three-judge federal  
court's conclusion that North Carolina's 12th Congressional 
District was unlawfully drawn in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is represented by Democrat Mel Watt, one of two  
blacks elected to Congress in 1992 from a state that had not sent a 
black to Washington since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said a  
three-judge federal court wrongly chose not to conduct a full trial 
before ruling last year that the 1997 election map devised by the 
North Carolina Legislature was too race-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge court made that ruling in what lawyers call a  
``summary judgment,'' after considering the 12th District's shape 
and its racial makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence tends to support an inference that the state drew its  
district lines to support an impermissible racial motive -- even 
though ... (challengers) presented no direct evidence of intent,'' 
Thomas said. ``Summary judgment, however, is appropriate only where 
there is no genuine issue of material fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions since 1993, the Supreme Court has  
scuttled attempts by state and local lawmakers to draw districts to 
preserve or enhance minority candidates' chances to win if race was 
a ``predominant factor.'' Most of those rulings were reached by 5-4 
votes that traced the court's ideological divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra  
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy united in those 
cases to control the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting in those previous cases were Justices John Paul  
Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. 
Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, those four justices joined in the final result but not in  
Thomas' opinion. Stevens wrote separately for the four. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record supports the conclusion that most loyal Democrats  
living near the borders of District 12 happen to be black 
Democrats, and I have no doubt that the Legislature was conscious 
of that fact when it enacted the apportionment plan,'' Stevens 
said. ``But everyone agrees that that fact is not sufficient to 
invalidate the district.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina dispute now will return to the three-judge  
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Redrawing 12 congressional districts after the 1990 census,  
North Carolina lawmakers created two majority-black districts in 
1992 -- the 1st and 12th. That 1992 redistricting sparked two 
Supreme Court decisions, one in 1996 that struck down the 12th 
District as unlawfully drawn. As drawn in 1992, the district had a 
57 percent majority of blacks among registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The district, which connected several concentrated areas of  
black voters, was 160 miles long and sometimes was no wider than 
Interstate 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature redrew the district in 1997, creating one 71  
miles long in which blacks comprised 47 percent of registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' previous redistricting rulings have offered  
precious little guidance for lower courts on just how much evidence 
is needed to conclude that race played too large a role in the 
drawing of an election district. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Watt's district has been before the justices three  
times in six years, New York lawyer Richard Buery Jr. wrote 
recently, ``This lack of doctrinal guidance has left states subject 
to the inconsistent whims of district judges, forcing the Supreme 
Court into micromanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision put district courts on notice that more than  
circumstantial evidence that race was the primary consideration is 
required before the Legislature's redistricting work can be 
invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Hunt vs. Cromartie, 98-85.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries for Education Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents who send children to private schools  
or who teach at home would get new education tax breaks under 
Republican legislation unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, similar to a bill vetoed last year by President  
Clinton, is strongly opposed by Democratic-aligned teacher unions 
even though the GOP added sweeteners this time such as tax 
incentives to help finance school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, called the bill ``a first but important step'' in making 
education more affordable for all students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal is a down payment on education assistance for  
our nation's students and their families,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee is scheduled to vote on the bill  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would cost $7.6 billion over 10 years, according to  
a preliminary congressional analysis. It would be paid for by $7.9 
billion in revenue offsets that chiefly affect business. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the measure would raise the annual  
contribution limit on education IRAs, now used only for higher 
education, from $500 to $2,000. For the first time, the money could 
be withdrawn tax-free to pay expenses for kindergarten through 12th 
grade students attending public, private or parochial school or who 
are taught at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualified expenses would include tuition, fees, books, supplies,  
computer software and required uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Like current law, the contribution limit would be phased out for  
individuals earning more than $95,000 in adjusted gross income and 
$150,000 for joint income tax filers. 
</P>
<P>
	When he vetoed a similar measure last year, Clinton said the  
money could be better used for public school construction and 
contended the GOP bill would primarily benefit the wealthy. The 
National Education Association, which led last year's opposition, 
said little has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad tax policy and it's bad education policy,'' said Mary  
Elizabeth Teasley, NEA legislative affairs director. ``It's a 
disguise for a private school voucher for the wealthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House did not immediately comment on the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are optimistic, however, that they can gain  
significant Democratic support for the measure. Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., is the main co-sponsor of the education IRA 
bill and several other items supported by Democrats were included. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are the public school construction components  
introduced by Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. The components 
would relax certain revenue bond rules and add schools to the list 
of projects that can be paid for with tax-exempt private activity 
bonds, which have an annual limit of $10 per resident or at least 
$5 million per state. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow tax-free distributions from state-sponsored  
and private prepaid college tuition plans, costing $925 million 
over 10 years. It would also extend the tax-free treatment of 
college-level educational assistance provided by an employer, a 
break now scheduled to expire in 2000.

	Barak Elected Israeli Premier  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ehud Barak, a former general who promised to  
resume Mideast peace talks, today unseated Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu. A tearful Netanyahu later said he also would 
step down as leader of the Likud Party. President Clinton called 
Barak to congratulate him, and the two pledged to restore 
U.S.-Israeli ties that had suffered under Netanyahu, said a Barak 
aide. Barak, unlike Netanyahu, has not ruled out the creation of an 
independent Palestinian state and he was expected to quickly carry 
out the West Bank troop withdrawals Netanyahu held up. Barak has 
also pledged to pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon within a year.

describe the outcome as a strictly Israeli affair. Asked if he 
thought the left-leaning Barak would move the peace process 
forward, he answered: ``We hope so.'' Other Palestinian officials, 
however, wasted no time in calling on Barak to get negotiations 
back on track. ``The message the Israeli people sent out ... was 
that they want to make peace with the Palestinians and that they 
want change,'' chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.

<HEADLINE> Execs' Pay Irks US Airways Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flight attendants at US Airways, who have been  
without a contract for 18 months, are complaining that the 
airline's top two executives made a combined $70 million last year, 
and stand to benefit even more from a cash incentive program 
proposed by the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The $34.2 million paid to Stephen Wolf, chairman of US Airways  
Group, and the $36 million paid to Rakesh Gangwal, chief executive 
officer, came despite a 17 percent drop in the value of the 
company's stock during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The total compensation, which includes salary, bonus, stock  
grants, stock options and add-ons such as free financial planning, 
dwarfs the pay received by the leaders of the country's top three 
airlines. US Airways is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald received  
compensation totaling $4.3 million, according to the UAL Corp. 
proxy statement. Donald Carty, the new chairman of American 
Airlines, received $9.6 million, while Leo Mullin, president of 
Delta Airlines, received compensation totaling $19.5 million, 
according to their companies' proxies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the US Airways annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C., on  
Wednesday, the board of directors is asking stockholders to approve 
a long-term incentive plan for the airline's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the plan, the top 30 executives at US Airways will  
be eligible for cash payments of up to 500 percent of their average 
salaries if they meet performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the LTIP is to encourage behaviors that create  
superior financial performance and to strengthen the commonality of 
interests between LTIP participants and owners in creating superior 
stockholder value,'' the airline's proxy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current terms, both Wolf and Gangwal would be eligible  
for annual bonuses equal to 220 percent of their average salaries. 
That would make them eligible for cash payments of around $1 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's flight attendants complain that the $70 million  
already received by Wolf and Gangwal would cover the annual pay of 
2,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's asking us to lower costs within the airline at the same  
time he's raising them significantly through his own pay and 
compensation package. We're also criticizing the numbers he pulls 
in: Does he really need that?'' said Jeff Zack, spokesman for the 
Association of Flight Attendants, which represents US Airways' 
9,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's last contract expired in December 1997, but since  
then negotiations have bogged down over improvements in pay and 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways refused to comment on the flight attendants'  
complaints or the incentive plan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to discuss the labor negotiations,'' said  
airline spokesman David Castelveter. ``Those are best left behind 
closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is a longtime airline executive who is known for his red  
suspenders, penchant for fine wines and hobby of collecting Jaguar 
automobiles. His career has taken him from American Airlines to Pan 
Am, Continental, Republic, Tiger International and United Airlines 
before he joined USAir in January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In his more recent jobs, he has favored taking a lower salary in  
exchange for company stock. When he started at US Airways, for 
example, his salary was $452,000 but he received 1.3 million stock 
options -- 500,000 of which could be exercised at $12.19 the day he 
started. That was less than the stock's $12.65 closing price that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangwal worked with Wolf at United and has steadily assumed more  
duties at US Airways, formerly called USAir. He also has a 
compensation package loaded with stock and option grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a business plan that has included a new pilots contract,  
the purchase of a fleet of Airbus airplanes and a new marketing 
plan, US Airways stock rose to $62.50 per share at the end of 1997. 
Last year, however, it fell to $52 per share, a drop of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the overall increase in the stock's price left Wolf  
with a pool of unexercised stock options worth $56 million at the 
end of 1998, according to the US Airways proxy. Gangwal's options 
were worth $36 million.

<HEADLINE> Collectors Snap Up Olympic Pins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The new Olympic mascots already are  
winners at the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee raked in nearly $75,000 from  
the sales of merchandise during Saturday night's mascot launch and 
celebration marking 1,000 days to the 2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the revenue came from sales of collector pins,  
snapped up by devotees of Olympic pins and the money to be made 
trading them. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC sold out of its allotment of 200 limited edition jumbo  
pins, one reading ``We're Here'' and showing the three new mascots 
-- a snowshoe hare, coyote and black bear -- and another showing the 
mascots along with the words ``1,000 Days Until the Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have anywhere near enough of those,'' said Ray  
Carter, retail operation coordinator for the SLOC, which is 
organizing the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 2,002 of those pins were produced for sale in stores that  
carry Olympic merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pins also sold well, including mascot and 1,000-day pins  
in five color combinations, on sale only at the festivities in 
downtown Salt Lake Saturday night. Besides introducing the mascots 
-- to be named in a national contest this summer -- the SLOC unveiled 
an arrowhead-shaped bronze sculpture bearing the countdown clock 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC estimated sales were between $50,000 and $75,000,  
including totals for T-shirts, caps and other merchandise carrying 
the Salt Lake Games' logo. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pins were clearly the hit, partly because there was a  
pin-collector convention here over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC limited each customer to two pins of each kind, in part  
to discourage collectors from stripping the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the collectors were peeved and made a scene when they  
were not allowed to buy mascot and countdown merchandise before the 
mascots and clock were unveiled. ``They just wanted to know why 
they weren't told ahead of time. We had some signage that didn't 
come through,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the booth doors opened, there were more than 300  
customers in line. 
</P>
<P>
	The green Jell-O Olympic pin that poked fun at Utah's reputation  
for high consumption of Jell-O, sold for $7 when it was introduced 
last year. The Jell-O pins now command $40 to $50.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kosovo Refugees Forced Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Serb forces ordered a train packed with  
hundreds of ethnic Albanians to return to Kosovo today after 
refusing to allow them to cross into Macedonia, international aid 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A train with four or five cars, each crammed with 200 to 300  
people, arrived early today at Djeneral Jankovic, the last station 
on the Yugoslav side of the border with Macedonia, said Ron 
Redmond, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is quite a worrisome development,'' Redmond said.  
</P>
<P>
	The train was full when it departed Kosovo Polje, near the  
provincial capital of Pristina. When it reached the town of 
Urosevac, 30 miles from the border, hundreds more crammed aboard, 
Redmond said, based on information from ten elderly men were 
allowed to cross into Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not sure why the Serbs are not allowing people off,''  
Redmond said. ``They can turn this off and on like a tap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, a series of explosions were heard on the Kosovo side  
of the border, but no information was available on the source of 
the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	One person who managed to cross the border today was Besa  
Pajaziti, 23, a Pristina university student. She said her parents, 
who earlier had fled the city, arranged for a private car to drive 
her to Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Pristina don't have enough to eat and the city was  
full of Serb police, who had taken over the library and civilian 
homes, she said. ``I can just say it's hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's air war against Yugoslavia began March 24. About 790,000  
ethnic Albanians have since been expelled by Serb forces or fled 
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE>  Charismatic Takes Triple Crown Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic, one race away from  
completing the Triple Crown, returned to Churchill Downs Monday to 
train for his bid at racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness could become  
racing's 12th Triple Crown winner by winning the 1 1/2-mile Belmont 
Stakes June 5. He would become the first to earn a $5 million bonus 
that goes to a horse that sweeps the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was accompanied by  
stablemate Cat Thief on the 1 1/2-hour flight from Baltimore to 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shipped very well,'' Lukas said. ``It's an easy trip.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall owned by Robert and Beverly  
Lewis, was bathed and then walked in the shedrow before being taken 
out to graze in a grassy area alongside Churchill's barns. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic has won his last three races, starting with the  
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland two weeks before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just continues to amaze me,'' Lukas said. ``He was out on  
the lawn yesterday, grazing at Pimlico, and he didn't look any 
different than he did Friday when we had him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Charismatic's tentative training schedule before the  
Belmont Stakes probably will include two workouts at Churchill 
Downs before being shipped to Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Overbrook Farm's Cat Thief, third in the Derby, is  
off the Triple Crown trail after engaging in a withering speed duel 
in the Preakness and will skip the Belmont Stakes.

<HEADLINE> 3 WSU Football Players Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Washington State starting running back  
Kevin Brown and two teammates were released from jail Monday after 
their arrests for investigation of burglary and theft at a 
student's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were released on their own recognizance after an  
appearance in Whitman County Superior Court, deputy prosecutor Ron 
Shirley said. Formal charges of residential burglary and 
first-degree theft are pending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have until 5 p.m. Wednesday to file charges, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 20, Ramin White and Jason White were arrested about 2:15  
a.m. Sunday at an apartment complex across the street from a 
student apartment where electronics were stolen, Pullman Police 
Sgt. Dan Dornes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramin White, 19, is a running back and Jason White, 20, is a  
wide receiver. They are not related. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested after witnesses said they saw them enter  
an apartment through an unlocked back door and leave with a laptop 
computer and other electronics gear, Dornes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said $1,900 worth of electronics equipment was recovered.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Price was out of town on a recruiting trip. Sports  
information director Rod Commons said he talked with Price by 
telephone and Price declined to comment until he could talk to the 
players and authorities.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Address Gun Control Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun control is not the only factor to be  
considered in protecting the nation's youth from violence, but 
everybody with a gun should be capable of using it properly and 
willing to use it lawfully, Attorney General Janet Reno says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on prevention, on intervention programs, on  
enforcement programs that go far beyond the gun issue,'' Reno said 
Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she ``couldn't agree more'' with Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that gun 
control is not the only answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's compromise gun legislation in a bill on juvenile crime  
raised a furor in the Senate last week as normally pro-gun control 
Democrats angrily declared it politicized the question. Hatch and 
other Republicans alleged the Democrats were doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., worked over the weekend to  
try to reach a new compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Hatch's measure ``still permits the sale of (some)  
guns at gun shows without a background check. It leaves open a big 
category of flea markets, where a large number of guns can be sold 
without the background check. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it reduces the time for doing the check from three days --  
three working days -- to 24 hours, where most gun shows are held on 
weekends. You're not going to have the chance to check it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the sale could go through unless a negative  
background report comes back on the purchaser within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether politics can be removed from so sensitive an  
issue, the attorney general said: ``Just say no one should possess 
a weapon unless they have demonstrated that they know how to safely 
and lawfully use it and are capable of safely and lawfully using 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In appearances on ``Fox News Sunday'' and ABC's ``This Week,''  
Hatch conceded his bill is imperfect, but he said the Republicans 
remain open to more compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made a particular issue over a provision that would  
remove the requirement for pawn shops to check the backgrounds of 
people reclaiming pawned weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch accused the Democrats, particularly New York Sen. Charles  
Schumer, of playing politics. As evidence, he produced a 1994 
letter in which then-Rep. Schumer, during House debate on a major 
crime bill that session, said he could accept a pawn shop waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Schumer said the 1994 measure was  
the Omnibus Crime Bill. He said he actually opposed the pawn shop 
amendment, which was proposed by former Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, 
a member of the National Rifle Association board. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hatch and Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., showed for TV cameras  
copies of Schumer's letter on the pawn shop issue to then-Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. They also displayed charts showing numbers 
of federal prosecutions under existing gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Allard, appearing with Schumer on CBS, said federal prosecution  
of crimes committed with a firearm had dropped 40 percent during 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply need to step up enforcement,'' Allard said. ``How  
can you justify passing more laws and particularly with using 
political arguments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the figures are misleading because state and local  
prosecutions have increased. ``These cases involve juvenile justice 
cases, better handled at the local level,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Browns, Steelers Do Lunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Doug Dieken remembers breaking from the Browns'  
huddle, lining up at offensive tackle against Pittsburgh's ``Steel 
Curtain'' defense and being awed by the names on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	L.C. Greenwood. ``Mean'' Joe Greene. Ernie Holmes. Dwight White.  
And a certain linebacker, who played like a monster and looked like 
one, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd see Jack Lambert smiling and you'd realize, they've got  
some darn good football players,'' Dieken said. ``But we've got a 
better dental plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dieken's shot at Lambert was one of many taken Monday as former  
members of the Browns and Steelers joined current players from the 
teams for the second ``Grudge Luncheon,'' a charity event designed 
to rekindle one of the NFL's fiercest rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are returning to the league in 1999 following a  
three-year hiatus. Fittingly, they'll open the season and a new 
stadium against the Steelers on Sept. 12 in a nationally televised 
night game. 
</P>
<P>
	At lunch on Monday, stories of old Browns-Steelers games were  
told and an NFL films video titled ``The Rivalry Returns'' was 
shown. The film drew cheers from Browns fans when Bernie Kosar 
threw a TD pass, and prompting a sizable contingent of Steelers 
fans to wave their Terrible Towels when Lambert planted a Browns 
running back into the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	If any player in the Browns-Steelers games had reasons to hold a  
grudge, Dieken said he had at least 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played in Pittsburgh 14 times,'' he said. ``I lost 14  
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dieken's turn at the microphone came after long-time Steelers  
radio analyst Myron Cope finished insulting Browns coach Chris 
Palmer, owner Al Lerner and telling off-color stories about 
covering games in the old Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am in Cleveland again after an enjoyable absence of  
three years,'' Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns moved to Baltimore after the 1995 season and return  
as an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieken's first target was Steelers coach Bill Cowher, a backup  
linebacker with the Browns who made a brief cameo in the video. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice of NFL films to show Bill Cowher's tackle,''  
Dieken said. ``Actually, he had two others. One was a guy going out 
of bounds and the other was a goalpost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dieken also compared the differences in Cleveland and  
Pittsburgh, cities just 90 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cleveland, Lerner is the name of the man who owns our  
franchise,'' he said. ``In Pittsburgh, Lerner is the answer you get 
when you ask the people there why they send their daughters to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cleveland, football is a passion. Football is a religion.  
In Pittsburgh, football is the word that knocked Bill Cowher out of 
his high school spelling bee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The luncheons were the idea of Browns president Carmen Policy,  
who along with Lerner and Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney, were in New 
York for the funeral of Jets owner Leon Hess and missed last week's 
luncheon in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	But all three quickly warmed to the occasion, taking turns at  
telling stories and delivering cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
	When Pittsburgh used to visit the old Cleveland Stadium, with  
its tiny, outdated locker rooms, many Steelers would bring nails 
they could pound into the walls to hang their clothes. Palmer 
presented Cowher with a symbolic nail as a gift.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones, Reuters Combine Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones and Reuters announced a deal Monday to  
combine their business news archives into a company that will 
provide financial information to paid subscribers over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies plan to introduce the new product, to be called  
Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive, in about a year. Before 
that time, the two companies will share archived news for their 
database services. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture will combine the resources of Dow Jones  
Interactive, which was formerly known as Dow Jones News/Retrieval, 
with a similar offering from the London-based financial news 
publisher called Reuters Business Briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined service will be aimed mainly at business users,  
offering archived stories from thousands of news sources, including 
newspapers, magazines and wire services. The service will be 
offered in 11 different languages. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal does not include the consumer Internet services of  
either company, such as the successful online version of Dow Jones' 
flagship newspaper, Wall Street Journal Interactive. Also excluded 
are the competing real-time financial news wires run by the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones and Reuters will have equal ownership stakes in the  
new company, and management will also be shared. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the current boom among investors for Internet-related  
companies, officials said there were no plans to float shares in 
the joint venture, which would have had 1998 revenues of $225 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones Interactive is currently available to more than  
650,000 users, and its largest market is in North America. The 
Reuters Business Briefing is sold to more than 6,000 companies and 
financial institutions, and most of its business comes from Europe 
and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Tries To Get Past Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- They used to be the very, very VIPs in  
these parts, wined and dined, taken to ski condos and courtside 
seats at NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	Those days are long gone for International Olympic Committee  
members visiting Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	When the oversight task force for the 2002 Winter Games opens  
four days of meetings today, it will be the first time a large 
group of IOC leaders has come to the Utah capital since the Olympic 
bribery scandal broke last November. 
</P>
<P>
	And this time, instead of lavish hospitality, the members will  
be greeted by a packed agenda of important meetings and a single 
night on the town -- a dinner at the home of Mitt Romney, the 
venture capitalist brought in three months ago to run Salt Lake's 
sullied Olympic organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz might have played host to the Sacramento Kings on  
Sunday in a do-or-die playoff game, but if the IOC wanted tickets 
it had to deal with scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
	This fourth meeting of the IOC's coordination commission long  
has been on the books, but its timing could not have been better 
for Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	When they sit down with Romney and his lieutenants, the task  
force members, led by corruption-case whistleblower Marc Hodler of 
Switzerland, will face some dark and dismal facts -- but also be 
shown some definite rays of light breaking through the clouds of 
the six-month-old scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Romney announced three sponsorship and supplier  
contracts with Utah companies worth some $25 million-$30 million, 
the first big deals signed since well before the bribery case 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturday night, Salt Lake turned out for its first  
Olympic celebration in a long time -- the unveiling of a snowshoe 
rabbit, a coyote and a black bear as the game's mascots and 
merchandising keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 people jammed an amphitheater for the ceremony,  
billed as ``Putting a new face on the Games,'' and scooped up 
hundreds of mascot T-shirts and pins, on sale for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd also watched a clock in the shape of an Indian  
arrowhead start to count down the 1,000 days remaining until the 
opening ceremony on Feb. 8, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking back,'' Romney said. ``It sort of starts  
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the news is good.  
</P>
<P>
	Romney still needs $300 million to fill his sponsorship revenue  
and has $84 million in budget cuts on the table that could affect 
athletes, spectators and volunteers -- even the IOC itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But after months of doom and gloom, the SLOC staff seems upbeat.  
The mood was casual and fun-loving at Saturday night's festivities, 
with Romney casually strolling the grounds in chinos and a winter 
vest, produced by one of the new sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The mascots were chosen because of their historic links to the  
original settlers of the Wasatch range. The story goes that each 
played a part in making this region of snowy mountains and salty 
lakes a good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were picked because of their appeal to modern  
consumers. Focus groups told SLOC that these three critters would 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps, too,'' Romney told the  
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC estimates the mascots will account for the core of $40  
million-$50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, the worst in Olympic history, has resulted in a  
purge of 10 IOC members, the creation of panels that could 
drastically redo the committee and at least six investigations, 
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general's office that won't report their findings for weeks or 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The coordination commission will discuss finances,  
transportation, ticket sales, media operations and dozens of other 
areas involved in staging a modern Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It will visit sports venues, most of which are ready for use,  
and get a feel of how Salt Lake has emerged from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience was a bruising one for all of us,'' Utah Gov.  
Mike Leavitt said. ``But we're healing and have come to understand 
that, as uncomfortable as it was, we're still intact physically and 
we will rise to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our redemption lies in a successful games.''

<HEADLINE> Court Keeps Marathon Oil Suit Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today kept alive, but  
perhaps just barely, a Texas lawsuit in which Marathon Oil Co. 
accused a German company, Ruhrgas A.G., of illegally trying to 
monopolize the market on natural gas from the Norwegian North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled unanimously that a federal trial judge may  
have acted within his authority when he threw out the 1995 lawsuit 
in a way that barred it from being taken up by any Texas state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had overturned the judge's action.  
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling had nothing to do with Marathon's allegations  
against Ruhrgas, but focused instead on the judicial equivalent of 
an age-old question: What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding whether a lawsuit originally filed in a state court  
properly can be transferred to a federal court in the same state, 
federal trial judges must make two determinations about their 
authority, or what the courts call jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in such a case must decide whether he or she has  
jurisdiction over the lawsuit's subject matter. If federal 
``subject-matter jurisdiction'' does not exist, the case must be 
returned to the state court where it can run its course. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge also must decide whether he or she has  
``personal jurisdiction'' -- authority over all parties involved in 
the case. For a judge to have such authority, all the parties must 
have some minimal connection to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	If no federal court personal jurisdiction is found, there can be  
no personal jurisdiction in a state court within that same state. 
That means a federal judge's dismissal, for lack of personal 
jurisdiction, of a lawsuit transferred from a state court 
effectively kills the lawsuit. It cannot be heard in the state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts have not agreed which type of jurisdiction should  
be determined first. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court today, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said  
there is no hard and fast rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most instances, subject-matter jurisdiction will involve no  
arduous inquiry ... In such cases, both expedition and sensitivity 
to state courts' coequal stature should impel the federal courts to 
dispose of that issue first,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the personal-jurisdiction issue can be the first  
resolved, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where, as here, ... a district court has before it a  
straightforward personal jurisdiction issue presenting no complex 
question of state law, and the alleged defect in subject-matter 
jurisdiction raises a difficult and novel question, the court does 
not abuse its discretion by turning directly to personal 
jurisdiction,'' Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas case now heads back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals for more study. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon's lawsuit against Ruhrgas originally was filed in a  
state court in Houston, but Ruhrgas sought to transfer the case to 
a federal court in that city. The federal trial judge dismissed the 
case after citing a lack of personal jurisdiction. Subject-matter 
jurisdiction was never considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th Circuit court ruled by a 9-7 vote last year that the  
trial judge made a mistake. In cases seeking transfer from state 
courts, the appeals court ruled, federal trial judges first must 
consider whether they have subject-matter jurisdiction. Only when 
they find such authority exists can they move on to determining 
whether their court has personal jurisdiction as well. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling reinstated Marathon's lawsuit and sent it back to  
the federal trial judge. Marathon's lawyers had reason to hope the 
judge would find he lacked subject-matter jurisdiction so the case 
could return to the Texas state court where the lawsuit began. 
</P>
<P>
	That outcome could change after the 5th Circuit court takes a  
new look at the case, in light of today's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Ruhrgas A.G. vs. Marathon Oil Co., 98-470.

<HEADLINE> New Program Helps With Downloads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Not all, or even very many, of the truly nifty bits of software  
come from the giant companies that drive herds of programmers 
through their cubicled stockyards daily. Often, it's a small 
company that identifies an opportunity and provides a neat, 
cost-effective solution. 
</P>
<P>
	A good example is Forty Software of Great Neck, N.Y., and their  
$29.77 product called Download Wonder 1.5. Download Wonder 
recognizes that just about everyone who surfs the Internet 
downloads stuff -- often lots of it. Internet browsers can handle 
the downloading part, but they just dump it into the folder you 
used last time, leaving any organization up to you. For most of us, 
that's like leaving henhouse security to the foxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides which, when you're downloading one file, you can't  
continue browsing for others until the transfer is complete. That's 
a real pain if you're downloading a multimegabyte Windows update. 
</P>
<P>
	Download Wonder intercepts the files before your browser gets  
its teeth in them and lets you do several very convenient things. 
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--You can continue browsing while downloading and have multiple  
downloads going at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	--You can complete downloading files even after the browser has  
been closed. 
</P>
<P>
	--A ``keep-alive'' feature prevents your service provider from  
knocking you offline, a problem often cited by AOL users. 
</P>
<P>
	--You can resume interrupted download at the point of  
interruption (at least if the sending server supports that 
function). 
</P>
<P>
	Once downloaded, you can select a folder for the file and  
classify it by the original Web site, the download URL, category, 
description, notes, up to three keywords, download date, time and 
size, and file modification date. 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds like overkill, suppose you hunt foodtv.com or  
other Web cooking sites for recipes. Wouldn't it be nice to have an 
easy way to categorize those recipes by hors d'oeuvre or main 
course and so on, cross-referenced by kind of meat? The software 
will do it. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also come in very handy for any sort of extensive  
online research. 
</P>
<P>
	Download Wonder 1.5 installs easily and has good online help. It  
includes an uninstall program, a sign that the authors are 
responsible people. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements are modest: eight megabytes of RAM and  
Windows 95, 98 or NT 4.0 and above. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the registered version for $29.77, you can  
download an advertiser-sponsored freeware version at www.forty.com. 
A human being will accept an order Monday to Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 
6:30 p.m., at (877) 386-8833, and you can also order the registered 
version online. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most software pricing ends in ``95,'' and this one ends in  
``77,'' Forty Software chief operating officer Michael S. Klein was 
asked why the oddball price. He explained that research showed 
folks were more likely to buy a product with a price ending in a 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Now why didn't Microsoft think of that?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> A Home Is a Work in Progress / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A homeowner's work is never done. You can obtain  
evidence from any homeowner, or you may refer to statistics that 
demonstrate the point. 
</P>
<P>
	Or you can just ask the folks at The Home Depot or Lowe's or at  
any number of regional home improvement outlets that have benefited 
from helping homeowners spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Around $86 billion is likely to be spent this year maintaining,  
repairing and improving homes, or an average of about $1,300 for 
each single-family house, of which there were 66.3 million in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	And the spending is growing. Remodeling is one of the economy's  
most consistent, reliable growth industries, tending to resist (but 
not totally) recessions, and growing 5 percent year after year. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of that growth blends, among other things, elements of  
myth, human nature, pride and sound financial reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The myth, to which homeowners can attest, is that you can buy  
the home of your dreams on Sunny Street and live there content for 
the rest of your life. Seldom does it work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams beget dreams and soon the homeowner is restless. People  
like to keep up with the times, and in these times, houses are 
bigger and bigger. The typical new home of 1985 measured 1,785 
square feet, but new homebuyers today seek more than 2,300 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping up with the Joneses, therefore, means a bigger house,  
but you've grown accustomed to the one you've been living in. You 
add a half bath and a home office, and you modernize the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	It is easy to rationalize the expenditure. The market value of  
your house has risen 30 percent in a dozen years, you've paid down 
the mortgage and an equity loan may be tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the contractor has assured you it really isn't costing  
at all because you've increased the property's value. What 
ambitious contractor wouldn't use that argument? What homeowner 
eager to get on with the job wouldn't buy it? 
</P>
<P>
	To an extent, they're correct. The National Association of Home  
Builders says the new kitchen might more than pay for itself, the 
bath nearly so, and the home office by perhaps 70 percent of cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are perhaps even bigger numbers involved in this  
decision. Matched against today's houses, your 1985 house was 
bought at a bargain. It just couldn't be matched at the price 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest single price increases over that time span  
was not in the house itself but in the land. The average price of a 
10,000 square foot lot in 1985 was $25,817, but $48,689 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's for a roughly finished lot, hardly a fair comparison  
with the existing home's lawn and shrubs, the result of a decade or 
so of hard work every hot summer weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The though is sufficient to turn the dream to a nightmare.  
Enough to disabuse one of any lingering notions about a home of 
your own being a place of rest and repose. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough to concede, finally, that a home is a work in progress.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Welfare Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its most important welfare ruling of the  
decade, the Supreme Court banned states from paying lower benefits 
to newcomers than to longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-2 decision today dashed the plans of California and 14  
other states, and was a defeat as well for Congress and the Clinton 
administration. Advocates for the poor were elated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrific decision,'' said Mark Rosenbaum of the  
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. ``California 
and other states now can take down their 'Poor People Keep Out' 
signs. ``The decision will be especially welcomed by mothers and 
children fleeing domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court said California's desired treatment of new residents  
would violate their constitutional right to travel. The word 
``travel'' is not in the Constitution, yet the freedom to move from 
one state to another has long been considered a bedrock right. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state's legitimate interest in saving money provides no  
justification for its decision to discriminate among equally 
eligible citizens,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the  
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,'' 
he said. ``The states, however, do not have any right to select 
their citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's policy, enacted as a law in 1992 but never enforced  
because of lower court rulings, would have given people who lived 
in the state for less than a year only the amount of welfare they 
would have received in their previous home state. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a mother and one child is eligible for $456 a month  
in California but only $275 in neighboring Arizona. The policy 
would have limited the California monthly benefits to $275 for such 
a family's first year in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	California's annual welfare budget is a whopping $2.9 billion.  
In any given month, some 2.6 million Californians receive some 
welfare benefits. The 1992 policy was aimed at saving about $11 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said states are free to save money by reducing welfare  
benefits across the board, but they cannot discriminate between 
longtime residents and new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor did the prudent thing and budgeted the money in  
the event that the court might do what it did,'' said Michael 
Bustamante, a spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 law had been supported by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a  
Republican, and later by Davis, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was challenged by three California women who had moved to the  
state to escape abusive family situations in Louisiana, Oklahoma 
and Colorado, respectively. Their lawsuit said the limits on their 
benefits, coupled with California's high cost of living, could 
deprive them of the basic necessities of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in 1969 invoked the right to travel as it  
struck down state laws that flatly barred welfare payments to 
anyone who had not lived in the state for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal welfare overhaul enacted in 1996 specifically had  
allowed states to temporarily provide lower benefits for new 
residents, but Monday's decision said Congress lacks the power to 
let states violate their citizens' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The California policy had been supported, too, by Justice  
Department lawyers in arguments before the highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	The court had decided only a handful of welfare disputes in the  
1990s, the most important of which probably was a 1990 ruling that 
allowed the federal government to limit how much aid some needy 
families received under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens' opinion Monday included a rare high court discussion of  
what it means to be a ``citizen'' of a state, and what ``privileges 
and immunities'' accompany that citizenship -- rights the 14th 
Amendment provided after the Supreme Court ruled in 1866 that 
former slaves could not claim state citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th Amendment says all people born in the United States are  
U.S. citizens and also are citizens of the state where they reside. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin  
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas  
dissented. ``A person is no longer 'traveling' in any sense of the 
word when he finishes his journey to a state which he plans to make

<HEADLINE> 'The Mummy' Leads Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As Hollywood braced for the ``Star Wars''  
invasion, ``The Mummy'' and two other holdovers led the North 
American box office, while newcomers ``Black Mask'' and ``A 
Midsummer Night's Dream'' did respectable business, final numbers 
showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' collected $24.9 million to boost its total to  
$80.6 million, exceeding industry expectations for the adventure 
tale starring Brendan Fraser. It beat ``Entrapment,'' which had 
$9.1 million for second, and ``The Matrix,'' with $4.5 million for 
third.

for Wednesday's opening of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace.''

	But two new films in moderately wide release did moderately  
well. The martial arts movie ``Black Mask'' had $4.4 million for 
fourth and ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream''

<HEADLINE> 'Mummy' Hangs On to Top Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A string of low-budget, independent films  
peppered the box office this weekend yet ``The Mummy'' continued to 
grasp the No. 1 spot with $25.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Moviegoers endured the final ``Star Wars''-less weekend of the  
year, what some might call the calm before the storm troopers, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earning a total of $80.8 million in only two weeks of release,  
``The Mummy,'' a swashbuckling story of a group of explorers who 
accidentally resurrect an ancient Egyptian priest, has become the 
season's biggest blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' and two other big-budget spectaculars --  
``Entrapment'' and ``The Matrix'' -- held off a horde of 
bacchanalian fairies in the latest film version of ``William 
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The update of the Bard's lighthearted romp through a mystical  
forest, starring Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci and 
Calista Flockhart, opened this week in fourth place with $4.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes caper ``Entrapment'' starring Sean Connery was  
No. 2 with $8.7 million, while ``The Matrix'' featuring Keanu 
Reeves was third with $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening in fifth place was the Hong Kong martial arts thriller  
``Black Mask,'' starring Jet Li as a mild-mannered librarian who 
becomes a masked crimefighter. The film earned $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The urban comedy ``Trippin','' about a rambunctious teen-aged  
daydreamer, debuted in seventh place with $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In limited release, ``Tea With Mussolini,'' the story of a boy  
raised by eccentric Englishwomen in World War II Italy, landed in 
10th place in only 270 theaters, earning a per-screen average of 
$6,296. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend was considered a virtual wasteland by most studios  
who feared a black hole-effect from the impending opening of ``Star 
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' The hyper-publicized sci-fi 
prequel opens Wednesday and is expected to draw audiences away from 
most other movies. 
</P>
<P>
	That may account for the unusually high number of smaller films  
in the top 10 this weekend, according to Robert Bucksbaum, a Reel 
Source Inc. movie analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually want to open a film five days before the  
most anticipated film of the decade, and perhaps of all time,'' he 
said. ``When you do, you're either hoping to get spillover audience 
from the sold-out 'Star Wars' shows, or you're trying to appeal to 
a totally different audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Films such as ``Tea with Mussolini'' and ``A Midsummer Night's  
Dream,'' are aimed at older audiences who couldn't care less about 
The Force, while ``Trippin,'' and ``Black Mask'' may draw a younger 
crowd who can't get tickets to the prequel, Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 2.2 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Deep Impact'' was No. 1 followed by ``The 
Horse Whisperer'' and ``The Quest For Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Mummy,'' $25.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Entrapment,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Matrix,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $4.4  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Black Mask,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Life,'' $2.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Trippin','' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2.45 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Election,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Tea With Mussolini,'' $1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 152.06 on Fed Worries / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, sending the Dow Jones  
industrial average falling more than 150 points, as investors 
traded cautiously in advance of Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 152.06 at 10,761.26. Broader stock indicators were also lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's losses extended Friday's broad selloff, when the Dow  
fell 193.87 to 10,913.32. Investors sold stocks and bonds alike 
after a steeper-than-expected increase in the consumer price index 
fed worries that the booming economy might finally fall prey to 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report prompted speculation that the Fed will at least  
consider an interest rate hike when its Open Market Committee meets 
Tuesday. In the meantime, many traders appeared willing to wait on 
the sidelines, as volume was well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is paying respects to the FOMC today,'' said Alfred  
E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed tightens rates when central bankers believe the economy  
is growing too fast. Higher interest rates raise corporate 
borrowing rates, which can often hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers influenced trading in individual stocks today. As  
former Baby Bell U S West and telecommunications company Global 
Crossing announced they would merge, the stocks of both companies 
fell. Global Crossing was down 2 7/8 at 58 1/2 on Nasdaq, while U S West 
slipped 4 1/2 to 57 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman Gordon was the biggest percentage gainer on the Big Board,  
rising 5 7/16 to 18 11/16, after Precision Castparts Corp. agreed 
to acquire it for about $721 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 16.15 at 1,321.65, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was off 32.28 at 2,495.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-4 margin on  
the NYSE, where volume came to 288.8 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 7.53 at 630.92, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 9.69 at 779.12.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A gang held 50 people hostage in a  
downtown bank, broke into 200 safety deposit boxes and escaped with 
an undetermined amount of cash and jewelry, police and security 
agents said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's security chief, Alexander Campos, said the robbers  
picked him up as he left home Sunday. They ordered him to open the 
bank, and three stayed at his house with his wife and 11-month-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos' wife, Delayne, told reporters the robbers prepared the  
infant's formula and changed his diapers while they waited. ``They 
said they wouldn't hurt us, that they just wanted the money,'' she 
said in a televised interview. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bank, the gang locked up 50 security and maintenance  
personnel and went through safety deposit boxes. Police said they 
suspected a former bank employee had taken part.

Otuzco, 305 miles northwest of Lima, said Dr. Gilberto Gutierrez, 
director of Otuzco's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus swerved off the edge of the 660-foot cliff and split in  
two during the fall, survivors said.

	Another bus plummeted off the same cliff in March, killing all  
36 occupants.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Futures Tumble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled more than 5 percent Monday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York amid heavy producer selling of what 
is expected to be a bumper world crop. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybeans advanced, while pork  
futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures sank amid expectations that a recent increase in  
producer selling will continue for months to come, at a time when 
world demand remains weak. Exporters are taking advantage of price 
gains that came as increased buying lifted prices from 14-year lows 
to dump as much of their supplies on the market as they can. 
</P>
<P>
	That comes as most of the world's major producers are combining  
for another year of record production. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report from the American attache to Brazil predicted  
that the country will complete harvesting of a crop of 19 million 
metric tons, up from last year's record 18.3 metric million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cuban production has reached an unexpectedly large 3.8  
million metric tons, according to local industry sources. 
Thailand's milled production also is coming in more than 18 percent 
higher than last year's weather-reduced output. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for July delivery fell .27 cent to 4.63 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures moved modestly higher on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as wet weather continued to delay spring plantings. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said wheat and corn in particular were  
poised to move sharply higher if wet weather persists in Midwest 
growing regions. Farmers typically have a limited window for 
planting those crops, and that June deadline is rapidly 
approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the government in its weekly updates has reported that  
dry periods between recent storms have given farmers ample time to 
continue planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 77 percent of corn acreage already has been planted, the  
U.S. Agriculture Department reported after trading had ended, up 1 
percent over last year and 9 percent over the five-year average. 
Wheat and soybean planting also were proceeding normally, the 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading had ended, the National Weather Service also  
predicted normal to below-normal precipitation over the next 10 
days in major Midwestern growing areas, which could speed the rest 
of planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans moved higher in step with corn, although some market  
participants worried that any planting delays for corn and wheat 
would lead to increased soybean acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.62 3/4 a bushel; July corn rose 2  
cents to $2.23 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 1/2 cents to $4.70 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid ideas retailers already have secured ample supplies going into 
the Memorial Day holiday, leaving little room to sell recent 
increased slaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.84 million hogs were slaughtered last week, up 3 percent  
from 1.79 million hogs a week earlier, according to the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the losses, some analysts predict pork prices will rise  
this summer as a decision early this year by producers to reduce 
herds begins to have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
	June lean hogs fell .90 cent to 57.97 cents a pound; July pork  
bellies fell 1.55 cents to 54.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Buys Jet Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Defense giant General Dynamics will buy  
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., a maker of business jets, for $5.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal allows General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Va., to  
expand beyond its core defense contracting business. The company 
was blocked last month in a bid to acquire Newport News 
Shipbuilding Inc. after the Pentagon cited concerns about its 
dominance in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	In its new deal, General Dynamics will pay $71.44 per share of  
Gulfstream. Savannah-based Gulfstream controls about 60 percent of 
the world market for business jets, popular among corporate 
executives and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had mixed reactions to the offer. In morning trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of General Dynamics fell $5 
to $66.43 3/4, while shares of Gulfstream rose $7.75 to $63.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics was blocked last month in a bid to acquire  
Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. after the Pentagon cited concerns 
about its dominance in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics' chairman and chief  
executive officer, said in a conference call with analysts today 
that the Gulfstream acquisition was unrelated to the failed ship 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were moving simultaneously,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream will have an immediate and positive impact on General  
Dynamics' profits, Chabraja said. ``Its lean management structure 
and focus on operating excellence and customer satisfaction make it 
a strong cultural fit with General Dynamics.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream was founded in 1978 by Allen E. Paulson from  
properties that were previously owned by Grumman Corp. He sold it 
to Chrysler Corp. in 1985, but teamed with the New York-based 
investment firm, Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., to buy it back in 1990 for 
$825 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Forstmann Little took the company public in 1996 but still owns  
23 percent of its stock. Paulson is a director. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed acquisition is subject to shareholder and  
regulatory approval. It is expected to be completed in the third 
quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream had 1998 revenues of $2.4 billion and earnings of  
$225.3 million. It employs 3,200 people at its plant at Savannah 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics has 29,000 employees and had 1998 sales of $5  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Lewis Didn't Use Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The doctor who performed an autopsy on Celtics  
captain Reggie Lewis after he died while practicing jump shots 
testified Monday he did not see evidence the player used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Evans, the state medical examiner, said he believed  
a virus caused the cardiac arrhythmia that killed the 27-year-old 
Boston star in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, is suing three doctors who  
treated her husband, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated a 
fatal heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Alleged cocaine use by Lewis is expected to be a central issue  
when Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the player's main cardiologist, presents 
his case. Mudge's attorney has said that two weeks before Lewis' 
death the player said he used the drug, and the late admission made 
an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge told Lewis he suffered from a neurological condition that  
causes fainting spells, while earlier a ``Dream Team'' of 12 
doctors diagnosed him with a life-threatening arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Harris-Lewis' attorney, Evans said scarring  
found on Lewis' heart was likely caused by a virus. Lewis' official 
cause of death was listed as adenovirus 2, which could have led to 
inflammation of the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, 
ultimately, a fatal cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Scarring also can be caused by cocaine use.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no indication this man had been a chronic user of  
this drug,'' Evans said, adding the scarring Lewis had would be 
``atypical'' for a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Mudge's attorney, Richard Dailey Jr.,  
suggested at least five of seven consultants called in by Evans to 
examine Lewis' body did not agree with his findings, and some felt 
the scarring was consistent with cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey suggested the virus could have been present, but that  
there still could have been a number of other problems.

	U.N. Mission To Go to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bad weather forced the cancellation  
of most NATO flights over Kosovo today as diplomatic efforts to 
solve the nearly 2-month-old conflict moved into higher gear. A 
U.N. delegation was in Belgrade, preparing to make the first trip 
to Kosovo by international authorities since some 790,000 ethnic 
Albanians were driven out of the southern Serb province beginning 
March 24, when NATO launched punitive airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made an 
unexpected trip to Finland today, increasing speculation that 
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is preparing to take a central 
role in seeking a solution to the Kosovo crisis.

a peace process moderate, was heavily favored today to unseat Prime

	Independent Counsel Change Proposed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An alternative law must be crafted to replace  
the Independent Counsel Act, former Senate majority leaders Bob 
Dole and George Mitchell said in a New York Times opinion piece 
today. The underlying purpose of the law remains a vital one: to 
make sure allegations of criminal wrongdoing by high-ranking 
government officials are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted, 
Dole and Mitchell wrote. ``The key is to find a system that 
accomplishes that aim while retaining both the independence and the 
accountability of investigators,'' they wrote in the article 
published on the Times' op-ed page.

	Sen. Dole May Make Pledge to McCain  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole says he's not sure his wife  
will seek the Republican presidential nomination. He's even 
considering contributing to the campaign of one of her competitors, 
Sen. John McCain. ``McCain's my friend. And he's not raising the 
money that (Texas Gov.) George Bush is. I think we need to keep 
good people in the race,'' Dole said in an interview in today's New 
York Times. But he added that he would probably check with Mrs. 
Dole first.

	Yeltsin's PM Choice May Be Approved

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- There are indications that Boris Yeltsin's choice  
for prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, will be approved by the lower 
chamber of the Russian Parliament, the State Duma, in a scheduled 
vote Wednesday. Stepashin held talks today with centrist deputies 
and regional leaders to ask for their support. Gennady Seleznyov, 
the Communist speaker of the Duma, said he thought that Stepashin 
would be approved on the first vote. The parliament failed to 
impeach President Yeltsin yesterday.

	Infant Gets Cow Neck Valve in Heart  
</P>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A 13-month-old boy has become the first  
person in the United States to have a bovine neck valve 
transplanted in his heart, officials said. Ryan Dotys has been 
breathing on his own since Thursday night and the prognosis looks 
good, said Dr. Robert Brown, the cardiothorasic surgeon who 
performed the transplant May 4. The procedure, performed at Riley 
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, has not been approved in the 
United States, but the Food and Drug Administration permitted the 
surgery as a ``compassionate case'' because of Ryan's critical 
condition. Ryan was born with only one heart valve instead of two.

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids' Livers Go to Adults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two-thirds of children's livers donated for  
transplant in the United States went to adults during an eight-year 
span examined by researchers, while about 75 children a year died 
waiting for a new liver. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh  
add to the debate over how to change the nation's organ allocation 
system to make it fairer. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has virtually eliminated deaths of children waiting for  
livers by giving them priority over adults for pediatric organs, 
said Dr. Jorge Reyes, a co-author of the study and the chief of 
transplantation at Children's Hospital and the Starzl Transplant 
Institute in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we have to do is just change some computer arrangements.  
We just need to want to do that and put politics aside,'' Reyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were presented Monday in Chicago at the annual  
meeting of the American Society for Transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current U.S. system, donated organs are first offered  
to potential recipients in the locality where the organs originate, 
even if a patient -- adult or child -- is in greater need elsewhere. 
Only if the organ is not placed locally is it offered regionally 
and then nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Adults on the waiting list far outnumber children, and the  
adults end up receiving most of the organs, unless the livers are 
are too small to work in adults, which is only true of organs from 
very young donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are increasingly using various techniques to ease the  
organ shortage for children, such as transplanting a liver segment 
from a living donor, usually a parent, or splitting a cadaver liver 
to give a child one segment and an adult another. About one-third 
of children who receive transplants undergo such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	But children's survival is poorer with adult liver segments --  
67.9 percent -- than with children's livers -- 75.7 percent. Adult 
survival is virtually the same whether the donor was a child or an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Reyes and his colleagues reviewed the United  
Network for Organ Sharing registry of transplants performed from 
1991 through 1998 and found that 4,288 of 6,028 pediatric livers 
were used in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes wants two things: First, that pediatric livers first be  
offered to children nationally. Second, that livers from 
``blue-ribbon'' adult donors, those in the best condition, be split 
so that both an adult and a child can benefit when no child liver 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't particularly say that an adult life is less  
valuable,'' Reyes said. ``I just think it makes good sense and good 
judgment and is humane to try to save our children as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Spieldenner, a spokesman for the UNOS, which sets allocation  
policy, said his organization agrees and is working to revise its 
system. It has already done so for heart transplants, for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency is taking care not to worsen the plight of  
adults, more than 1,000 of whom die each year waiting for livers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sue McDiarmid, head of UNOS' pediatric committee, said:  
``The last thing I want to do is to develop any kind of policies 
that would have a significant impact on adult mortality. That 
wouldn't be right. We've got to be very careful in how we think 
about it so that we get the maximum good for the minimum harm.''

<HEADLINE> American Air, Attendants Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines and its flight attendants' union  
have reached a tentative agreement after nearly nine months of 
contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no public disputes in these negotiations, unlike the  
last round in 1993 when the flight attendants struck the airline 
for five days and virtually shut down American's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, and the Association of  
Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 20,000 members, 
did not disclose details of the plan, reached Sunday and announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact does provide pay increases, improvements in retirement  
and increased scheduling flexibility, according to the APFA and 
AMR. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Hedges, union president, said the contract will lead the  
industry and set a new standard for flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the accords were reached with informal help from the  
National Mediation Board during two weeks of around-the-clock 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Oliver, vice president of employee relations and chief  
negotiator for the company, said the two sides worked together to 
reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement now will be subject to the APFA's  
ratification process. First, the union officers will review and 
vote on the pact. If they approve, the agreement will be sent to 
all members by mail. A simple majority of returned ballots is 
necessary for the deal to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second agreement between APFA and AMR this year.  
Last month, the flight attendants union and American reached an 
understanding on how to integrate flight attendants from Reno Air, 
which AMR purchased last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The dealings between the flight attendants and the company this  
year have been in sharp contrast to strained relations between 
American and its pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association and American are still at odds  
over the acquisition of Reno. Their disagreement led to a massive 
sickout in February that caused the cancellation of nearly 6,700 
flights and contempt damages of $45 million to be paid to AMR by 
APA and its two top officers. The airline said the job action has 
cost it $140 million.

<HEADLINE> Rojas Rejoins Expos in Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos signed their former closer  
Mel Rojas, who has struggled since leaving the team, to a minor 
league contract on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas is joining Montreal's Class A team in Jupiter, Fla. He is  
expected to join the major league team after a few outings in 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't sign him to keep him in the minors,'' said manager  
Felipe Alou, who wanted Rojas back. ``We want him here. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he pitches well, he can help us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rojas started the season in Los Angeles, where he allowed seven  
runs in five innings before being traded to Detroit. With the 
Tigers, Rojas was even worse, giving up 16 runs in 6 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Montreal to sign a free agent contract with the  
Chicago Cubs following the 1996 season, Rojas is 5-7 with 17 saves 
and a 6.17 ERA for the Cubs, Dodgers, Mets and Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1990 to 1996 in Montreal, he was 29-23 with 109 saves and a  
3.04 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Court: President Can Fire Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, ruling in the case of an  
HIV-positive Air Force major imprisoned for having unprotected sex, 
today bolstered the president's power as the nation's military 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The court unanimously overturned an order by the military's  
highest court that had barred the president from dropping from the 
armed forces any commissioned officer jailed for more than six 
months under a court-martial conviction that has become final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces had ruled that such  
presidential action violates the constitutional protection against 
being punished twice for the same crime, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's decision said the military court lacked the  
authority to make that ruling and to block the president's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling spares President Clinton and his successors from the  
awkward position of being unable to fire senior military personnel 
for the same offenses that got them court-martialed and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. James Goldsmith is infected with the virus that causes  
AIDS. After he was diagnosed, Goldsmith was ordered by a superior 
officer to inform his sexual partners of his health status and to 
use methods, including condoms, to prevent their infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldsmith was convicted in 1994 of having unprotected sex with  
two women, willfully disobeying the ``safe-sex'' order while 
stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentenced to six years in prison, he retained his rank and  
military status even after being imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth, 
Kan. His ensuing appeal was rejected by an Air Force appellate 
court and his conviction became final. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldsmith was notified in late 1996 that the Air Force was  
seeking, under a federal law enacted earlier that year, to have the 
president drop him from its rolls. Such action, among other things, 
would strip him of health-care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldsmith's shortened prison term expired in 1997, and he  
returned to duty status. He appealed the Air Force's attempt to 
drop him, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces 
blocked such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	The military court ruled that the contemplated action carried  
``an associated stigma very akin to that involved in punishment,'' 
and therefore should be deemed punitive. Two punishments for the 
same offense violates the Fifth Amendment's protection against 
double jeopardy, the military court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court said the military court was wrong in  
ever ruling in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Executive action to drop ... (Goldsmith) from the rolls falls  
outside the ... (military court's) statutory jurisdiction,'' 
Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Clinton vs. Goldsmith, 98-347.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plays Host to CEO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- More than 100 titans of U.S. industry -- among  
them investment guru Warren Buffet, Disney Chief Executive Officer 
Michael Eisner and homemaking entrepreneur Martha Stewart -- will 
converge on Seattle this week for the Microsoft CEO Summit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third year the software giant has hosted the gathering,  
which attendees say provides them with a rare opportunity to talk 
casually and catch up on the rapidly changing world of computers, 
software and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see us as leading or participating in many of the  
technology trends ... sort of a technology `crystal ball,''' said 
Microsoft group vice president Jeff Raikes, who helps organize the 
event and run the company's $14 billion sales operations. ``We are 
a magnet for the business thinkers who want to engage in the 
dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the three-day summit will take place on the Microsoft  
campus, though it kicks off in downtown Seattle Tuesday night with 
a reception at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. Wednesday night, 
there's a dinner party at Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' $60 
million mansion on the shores of Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of gatherings share the prestige of the Microsoft  
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Every July, someish and talk shop. Their host is New York  
investment banker Herb Allen -- a key power broker in the 
entertainment industry. Gates, Eisner, Buffet and media moguls 
Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller are regulars there. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the same set jets to Aspen, Colo., every September at  
the invitation of financier Teddy Forstmann. Sun Microsystems CEO 
Scott McNealy and America Online boss Steve Case have been among 
those who have hiked in the Rockies or been treated to a live 
performance from James Taylor there. 
</P>
<P>
	And every February, techno-showman Richard Wurman convenes  
``technology, entertainment and design'' gatherings -- for a fee -- 
in Monterey, Calif., aimed at introducing attendees to new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Raikes would not give details of this year's event, which also  
includes Dell Computer founder Michael Dell, Ford Motor CEO Jacques 
Nassau, and Coca Cola Enterprises' boss Henry Schimburg on the 
guest list. Local businessmen invited include Jeff Bezos, chairman 
of Amazon.com, Howard Schultz, the head of Starbucks, and cellular 
phone pioneer Craig McCaw.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart, Mexico Co. Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has settled with a  
Mexican grocery store chain for an amount less than the $624 
million already awarded by jurors, after losing a lawsuit filed by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors had been scheduled to begin considering punitive damages  
today against Wal-Mart and its McLane Co. Inc. subsidiary. Wal-Mart 
said today the settlement would result in a charge to non-operating 
earnings in its second quarter of about three cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not specify the exact amount of the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	Valores Corp. of Monterrey, Mexico, had claimed McLane wouldn't  
honor a 25-year partnership agreement because Wal-Mart didn't want 
it to. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury on Friday found that Wal-Mart and McLane acted with  
malice in ignoring the 1991 pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Valores said it and McLane were to be 50-50 partners in a  
grocery distribution setup. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane is the nation's largest grocery distributor to  
convenience stores, with annual sales of $8 billion. Valores is 
Mexico's second-largest wholesale grocery distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Valores said Wal-Mart ended the deal after hearing from Cifra,  
Mexico's largest retailer, which was planning its own deal with 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	After the trial in San Antonio -- McLane is based at Tyler, Texas  
-- the jury said Wal-Mart knowingly participated in McLane's not 
living up to its deal with Valores.

<HEADLINE> Old Injury Haunts Hasek / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A groin injury hampered Buffalo's Dominik  
Hasek in the Game 5 playoff loss to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hasek says he'll be in net Tuesday when Buffalo tries to  
eliminate the Bruins from the Eastern Conference semifinal. The 
Sabres lead the series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's two-time MVP gave up four goals before coach Lindy  
Ruff pulled him after the second period in Boston's 5-3 win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind I favored my groin a little, but it won't happen  
anymore,'' Hasek said. ``I feel bad about it, because I have to 
play 100 percent all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek led the NHL in save percentage for the sixth consecutive  
year and shut out Boston for five consecutive periods before he was 
beaten by Don Sweeney midway through the first on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is 7-2 in the playoffs with a 1.75 goals-against average.  
</P>
<P>
	Sidelined for 12 games by a strained groin sustained in  
February, Hasek claimed he's been playing hurt for the last 2 1/2 
months. When the playoffs began, Hasek said the injury had healed. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused Monday to explain the apparent contradiction or offer  
excuses for his poor play in Game 5. ``I gave up four goals,'' he 
said. ``I didn't play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates said they were unaware of the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the extent of his injury or how bad he's  
hurting,'' Brian Holzinger said. ``But this is the time when 
everybody plays through bumps and bruises. I'm sure he's going to 
find a way to play through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek skated and stretched with a couple of teammates for about  
20 minutes before the team's practice Monday morning. ``I had a 
good practice,'' Hasek said. ``I felt good, my head is clear and I 
feel ready for the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nagging groin injury apparently was more distracting than  
disabling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got to where he notices it again,'' said Ruff, adding  
that Hasek has been undergoing 40 minutes of massage therapy a day. 
</P>
<P>
	A goal by Sergei Samsonov giving Boston a 2-1 lead early in the  
second tipped off Ruff that something was wrong. ``That was a play 
that he would have raced out skating,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he did not ask to be taken out of Sunday's game.  
``But it was a good decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres blamed the loss on defensive breakdowns. Noting a  
two-man break gave the Bruins their fourth goal, Sabres forward 
Dixon Ward said, ``Even if you had three goalies, you wouldn't stop 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a team that thinks it can beat Boston with or without  
Dom,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs you need your best player to play well,''  
Holzinger said. ``But you can't totally fault Dominik Hasek for 
that loss. You can't expect much from Dom if the effort's not there 
in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston defenseman Hal Gill said all goalies are vulnerable.  
``Once you get traffic, if they can't see the puck they can't stop 
it,'' Gill said. ``Eventually, if you pester enough and get in his 
face enough and get enough shots, something's got to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins displayed plenty of jump. ``We expected to see that  
for Game 4,'' Ruff said. ``We saw a hell of a lot more in Game 5. 
It's a playoff series now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins have never overcome a 3-1 deficit in 18 tries and  
they have had limited success against the Sabres in Marine Midland 
Arena.

<HEADLINE> Miami Makeover Likely After Flop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat's first-round flop against the New  
York Knicks prompted a twist on the usual fan criticism: Fire the 
players, not the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pat Riley, part owner of the team as well as the coach, may  
do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley thought he built a team ready to fill the championship  
void created by Michael Jordan's retirement. Instead, the Heat were 
eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the third time 
in Riley's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's last-second shot Sunday for the New York Knicks  
drove home the point: Miami needs a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll sit down and talk about what we're going to do  
this offseason,'' Riley said after the Heat became just the second 
top-seeded team to lose in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Riley should share in the blame, because his blueprint  
is a bust. But his four world championship rings with the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the 1980s still carry considerable clout, and 
Riley has been spared in the backlash of criticism triggered by 
Sunday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Heat players will take the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	As is his custom, Riley laid low on the first day of the  
offseason and didn't talk to the media Monday. So speculation began 
without him. The question is not whether he'll shake up the roster, 
but how. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player considered untouchable is center Alonzo  
Mourning, who had an MVP-caliber year and a fine series against the 
Knicks. But his teammates, including point guard Tim Hardaway, can 
only wonder whether they'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to war with this group of guys, and I don't want  
to see change,'' Mourning said. ``But this game is about change, 
and with Riles running the ship, if adjustments have to be made, 
he'll make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks series confirmed adjustments have to be made. The  
Heat became the first No. 1 seed from the Eastern Conference to 
lose against a No. 8 seed. Last year, Miami was the first No. 2 
seed from the East to be eliminated by a No. 7 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Miami lost both times to the despised  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was tough. This is going to be even tougher,'' guard  
Dan Majerle said. ``We play hard, but we just haven't been able to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York underscored the Heat's deficiencies:  
they rely too much on outside shots and badly need a scorer at 
shooting guard or small forward. Miami has no reliable third option 
beyond Mourning and Hardaway, who struggled through a miserable 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway shot 27 percent against the Knicks and averaged 9.0  
points per game, barely half his average. He was shut out in the 
second half of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad stretch I hit, and I didn't come through for  
my team,'' he said. ``That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his productivity curtailed, Miami averaged just 79.0 points  
against New York, the second-lowest figure in a five-game series in 
NBA history. The Heat set the record of 78.6 against the Bulls two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's biggest decision will be whether to keep Hardaway, the  
Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is a lackluster 12-18, 
and with the offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely 
to stand pat.

<HEADLINE> Former Ark. Gov. Must Pay for Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, whose shady  
financial deals got caught up in the Whitewater investigation, was 
ordered Monday to pay $1 million for setting up a sham bankruptcy 
to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was also ordered placed on four years' probation for  
hiding the value of a cable TV business he sold in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that if the company's real value was known,  
Tucker and business partner William Marks would have been liable 
for an additional $2.9 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said he would appeal the sentence and order of  
restitution, which is to be paid to the federal government. Marks 
was also ordered to pay $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no tax loss to the government that I benefited  
from,'' Tucker said after sentencing, arguing that the government 
owed him federal income tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's business dealings came under scrutiny as part of the  
federal investigation into his role in the Whitewater land deal, a 
failed development in which President Clinton and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton were investors. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 18 months of home detention after being convicted of  
fraud and conspiracy with James and Susan McDougal, President 
Clinton's former business partners. Tucker had lied to arrange 
nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fighting to have that conviction overturned, saying a  
juror was biased against him. As part of his plea bargain in the 
cable case, prosecutors will not retry him if his initial 
conviction is thrown out.

	``Four Reissues'' (Epic-Legacy) -- Stevie Ray Vaughan &AMP; Double  
Trouble 

</P>
<P>
	So you never purchased CDs of the Double Trouble band's four  
studio albums -- ``Texas Flood,'' ``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' 
``Soul to Soul'' and ``In Step.'' Perhaps you love the old vinyl 
too much or you hoped for cleaner recordings or you have been 
chronically broke. Now your wait must end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, you could hold out longer until Epic releases the SRV  
boxed set promised this year, but who knows what they are going to 
leave out? It is always better to have the album arrangements the 
performers sequenced for themselves, especially for someone like 
Stevie Ray, who never recorded a lame track. 
</P>
<P>
	To make these CD reissues irresistible, Epic added 14 new  
tracks, half of them live, totaling 77 minutes across the four 
discs. It's like creating a fifth album. 
</P>
<P>
	The added studio tracks were recorded in the same sessions with  
the original albums but never included. As for the bonus tracks 
that were recorded live, similar versions appear on SRV's live 
releases, but these bonus versions are fresh enough to be worth 
having. 
</P>
<P>
	And what bonuses! From the seductive ``Tin Pan Alley'' on the  
``Texas Flood'' reissue to the long-overdue appearance of a Hound 
Dog Taylor cover, ``Give Me Back My Wig,'' on ``Weather,'' they are 
all terrific. 
</P>
<P>
	Each disc contains brief interviews with Stevie that are  
distracting but at least demarcate where the bonus tracks begin. 
</P>
<P>
	No more excuses not to own all four discs because these were,  
and are, the best blues releases of the past two decades.

	``Under the Spell'' (Alligator) -- Dave Hole  

</P>
<P>
	Australian fretmaster Dave Hole has unleashed his fifth and  
perhaps best compact disc for Alligator Records. On ``Under the 
Spell'' Hole tones down the guitar pyrotechnics a tad and unveils 
his most sophisticated songwriting. Don't worry. There's plenty of 
flying fingerwork from the slide man. But he also sings with more 
confidence. Where the hallmark of earlier Hole efforts was 
explosive slide-playing, ``Under the Spell'' combines writing, 
singing and playing into a more balanced package. The result 
actually makes you appreciate his spectacular playing even more.

	``Across the Winterline'' (Wind River) -- Jack Williams  

</P>
<P>
	Southern troubadour Jack Williams has been making music  
professionally for 40 years, covering a wide waterfront from jazz 
to rock to chamber music to country to completely original, which 
is what you'll find on his release for Wind River records. 
Williams' long career as a side and session guitarist attest to his 
six-string strengths. He also possesses a beautifully smooth voice 
and a pen dipped in the reality of everyday life. ``Moma Lou,'' 
Williams' ode to his mother and her cooking, is so tempting it 
could make a Yankee hungry. His examination of coming to terms with 
yourself, ``The Man in Me,'' is a song of unusually strong 
character. Williams calls it a ``stream of consciousness 
scrapbook.'' It's a true-running stream.

	``Lowdown and Up'' (Antone's Records) -- Toni Price  

</P>
<P>
	Texan singer Toni Price hasn't made her reputation as a crooner  
but she turns to what she calls ``smooth and silky'' for her fourth 
record for Antone's. ``Foolin' Around'' as done by Price is a great 
shuffle swing number. Her mid-range vocals slide around all the 
corners with nary a bump. Price even takes on ``Comes Love,'' done 
originally by Billie Holiday, and does the original justice with a 
style that again emphasizes swing. The fiddle of Johnny Gimble is 
no small part of that feat. Price fronts some fine playing 
throughout the recording, which holds true to her description.

<HEADLINE> Denny's To Revamp Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Denny's restaurant chain plans to take  
its Grand Slam breakfast back to the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantica Restaurant Group Inc., Denny's parent company, said  
Monday it will spend more than $30 million this year to remodel 150 
restaurants in 50s-style diners with stainless steel exteriors, 
neon lights, rotating pie cases and jukeboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to stay relevant with today's changing society you  
really do have to refresh your image on some consistent basis or 
you become really irrelevant,'' said John Romandetti, Denny's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Romandetti said the company eventually wants to convert all  
1,700 Denny's restaurants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad in colorful bowling-style shirts, employees will serve  
similar items on the menu, with a few classic American additions 
such as chili, meatloaf, pot roast and open-face sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to change the image of a family-style restaurant  
that's open 24 hours a day because that really is our heritage,'' 
Romandetti said. ``Our restaurants right now are really fairly 
sedate and when you put a jukebox in there and you put some very 
bright colors in there you change the energy level of the interior 
very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Denny's Diner opened in North Myrtle Beach last  
summer. Other test markets have been in Florida and along the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's has been repairing its image after several lawsuits  
filed in recent years alleged racial discrimination. In 1994, the 
chain paid $45.7 million to settle a discrimination lawsuit by 
black customers. Other suits are pending. Denny's employees now are 
required to undergo sensitivity training. 
</P>
<P>
	Romandetti said that the remodeling was overdue for many  
restaurants and that the timing has more to do with the company's 
improved financial situation than it's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to remodel, if you will, or re-image the  
restaurant has been made simply because we have many markets where 
we haven't done remodels in 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartanburg-based company, which owns Denny's and other  
restaurant chains, emerged from bankruptcy protection last year 
with better financial structuring and the ability to remodel the 
restaurants, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denny's probably needed some type of revamping because I don't  
think that it was attaining its potential,'' said Jerry Hirschberg, 
a S&AMP;P Ratings Services analyst. ``If this '50s diner works it will 
be very nice for them. I think the only problem that could surface 
in the future is that this could turn out to be more of a fad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the Denny's restaurants are company-owned. The  
franchise owners will be expected to follow suit with the company's 
changes, Romandetti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantica officials blamed an increase in operating costs at  
Denny's and another chain for a $61.7 million first-quarter loss. 
But analysts said the company has enough money in the bank to 
invest in the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantica also owns the Carros, Coco's and El Pollo Loco  
restaurant brands, but the Denny's chain accounts for about 70 
percent of the company's consolidated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantica stock closed up 3 1/8 cents, at $4.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island Star Odom May Go Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The University of Rhode Island is not  
counting on having Lamar Odom around next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island spokesman Mike Ballweg said he would ``bet money''  
the 6-foot-10 forward -- a probable lottery pick -- would declare for 
the June 30 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, citing unidentified sources, reported that Odom will do  
just that. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA on Friday will announce its list of players applying for  
early entry to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's aunt told The Providence Journal he would formally  
announce his plans in Rhode Island today. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball coach Jerry DeGregorio was unable to track down Odom  
last weekend to confirm his decision. The deadline for declaring 
for the draft was midnight Sunday, meaning Odom had to notify the 
NBA by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of the draft as late  
as June 23 and return to college ball. Last year, Odom declared for 
the draft, then pulled out June 16 after he was admitted to Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballweg said Odom returned home to New York last weekend,  
although a woman answering Odom's home phone said he was in Rhode 
Island. The spring semester ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Odom might leave Rhode Island has hurt the  
school's ability to recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4)  
last season. The Rams (20-13) lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom has played just one season at Rhode Island, and the school  
took the unusual step of giving him a voice in the hiring of its 
coach after Jim Harrick left for Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom entered UNLV in 1997, but he was accused of cheating on a  
college entrance exam. He was upset by the accusations and chose to 
transfer. A UNLV assistant coach insists Odom did not cheat on the 
test.

<HEADLINE>  Sonia Gandhi Quits Party Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi, a main contender to be  
India's prime minister, stepped down as president of the Congress 
party Monday after several party leaders complained her Italian 
birth was a political liability. 
</P>
<P>
	But her resignation was immediately rejected by the party's  
highest decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee, and 
party leaders went to Mrs. Gandhi's house to beg her to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a youth wing of the Congress party began a hunger  
strike outside Mrs. Gandhi's sprawling New Delhi home, demanding 
she withdraw her resignation and that three critics of her 
candidacy be removed from the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came a day after three senior Congress party  
leaders -- Sharad Pawar, Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar -- said India 
should have a native-born leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi was born in Italy but became a citizen after she  
married into India's foremost political dynasty. She joined active 
politics only last year, seven years after her husband, former 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated during the 1991 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``My colleagues expressed views to the effect that my having  
been born elsewhere is a liability to the Congress Party,'' Mrs. 
Gandhi said in her resignation letter. ``I am pained by their lack 
of confidence in my ability to act in the best interests of the 
party and the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, minor scuffles broke out in Bombay between  
factions for and against Mrs. Gandhi. Posters were torn at the 
party's regional office and a sign torn down. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi was expected to be the Congress party candidate in  
elections later this year. She joined active politics last year, 
seven years after her husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, 
was assassinated during the 1991 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter published Sunday, the three dissenting Congress  
party leaders said a candidate for prime minister should have a 
``track record in public life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not possible that a country of 980 million people, with  
a wealth of education, competence and ability, can have anyone 
other than an Indian, born of Indian soil, to head its 
government,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages and statements of support came in from regional  
leaders. Discussions reportedly were under way about the possible 
expulsion of the three rebels from the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in the party comes less than a month after Mrs.  
Gandhi failed to win the support of enough lawmakers to put 
together a coalition to succeed Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee's government after it lost a confidence vote in 
parliament.

<HEADLINE> One Basket, Handful of 2nd Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Almost 18 months after choking his last coach, Latrell Sprewell  
helped resuscitate the career of his latest one. Everybody's life 
should be as full of second chances as Sprewell's and the rest of 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Patrick Ewing who did most of the hardest work and Allan  
Houston who made the shot Sunday that lifted the Knicks to a 78-77 
win over Miami in the fifth and final game of their first-round 
playoff series. But it was Sprewell who kept New York from getting 
blown out early by scoring five points in his first seven minutes 
off the bench. And it was Sprewell who kept New York from getting 
run over late, too, by poking the ball loose from the Heat's Tim 
Hardaway with 20 seconds left to set up the last-gasp heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	And, yes, that was Sprewell, too, who was so intent on  
remembering how good it felt to win that he started celebrating too 
soon, forgetting there was 0.8 seconds left to play after Houston's 
14-foot jumper hit iron, then glass and, finally, the bottom of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in a situation like this, so when I saw that  
go in, we were all just running around and jumping and hollering,'' 
Sprewell said. ``I actually thought the game was over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, though, it was. But the question lingers: Who  
redeems the team next? 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy has a job for as long as New York's run  
through the postseason extends. But in a nice twist of fate, the 
length of that run may depend on how well the guys foisted on Van 
Gundy by the front office -- Sprewell, Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas 
-- play for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a lot of people who watched Michael Jordan exit stage left,  
the Knicks figured they were as close to the head of the 
championship line as anybody else. But unlike the Jazz and Indiana 
Pacers, the Knicks were willing to cut up a veteran team, reshuffle 
the deck and play the cards as they fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell figured to be a bad fit, coming to town with a  
reputation for selfishness and off a long suspension following his 
attack on coach P.J. Carlesimo at Golden State. But the deal that 
caused most of the trouble was the one that shipped longtime local 
hero Charles Oakley to Toronto for Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy relied on Oakley and John Starks the same way he  
relied on Ewing since succeeding Miami's Pat Riley as head coach in 
New York. Then Knicks president and general manager Ernie Grunfeld 
stepped in, sent Oakley and Starks packing, and replaced them with 
players Van Gundy hadn't asked for. There were new cliques, but 
familiar arguments about playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Things came to a head with the season winding down and the  
Raptors in town. With the game on the line, Oakley boxed out Camby 
and grabbed the decisive rebound in a win that pushed New York two 
places out of the eighth and last playoff spot in the Eastern 
Conference. It became such a convenient snapshot of a season that 
was fast slipping away that Dave Checketts, the Madison Square 
Garden president, took Grunfeld to dinner and then told him he was 
no longer running the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks went on a late run, grabbed the last playoff spot and  
all the incentive they could have hoped for in Miami as a 
first-round opponent. It was the third season in a row the two were 
paired and it ended for once, without a single brawl. But that's 
not to say emotions didn't run high. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley has been the Garden's favorite villain since his escape  
from New York, but this time the deciding game was less about the 
coaches than the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing has looked old most of the season and played ever older  
amid whispers that he spent too much time fronting for the players 
union during the labor dispute. And though he slows down the New 
York attack more than ever, limiting the effectiveness of quick, 
slashing players like Houston, Sprewell and Camby, Van Gundy still 
insists on running the offense through Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, though everyone knew what was coming, it worked one  
more time. Ewing was never better, though battered and bruised time 
and again. He delivered 22 points and 11 rebounds and played the 
big moments as well as he ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more remarkable, Sprewell and Camby finally absorbed the  
lesson Van Gundy had been pushing, crafted their own games to 
complement Ewing's. And then Houston, brought to New York three 
years ago to help ease the burden on Ewing, did just that with his 
runner down the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't think about Jeff's job or where we're going to  
be,'' he said. We're thinking about advancing in the next round 
right now.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Whistle-Blower Reemerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The man who blew the whistle on Olympic  
bribery is back at the scene of the scandal, and happy to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the senior member of the International Olympic  
Committee, returned to Salt Lake City for meetings of the 
coordination commission he heads for the 2002 Winter Games, an 
event the Swiss lawyer helped forever link with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Hodler was the first Olympic official to say the  
million-dollar program of scholarships, travel, medical care and 
cash run by Salt Lake bidders was purely and simply a scheme to buy 
IOC members' votes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the corruption culture went far beyond the Utah  
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the worst of the trouble seemingly past and reform in  
the works, Hodler hopes his return -- the first visit by the IOC 
since the scandal broke -- helps heal the wounds and push along 
preparations for the games, which start in 998 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to give confidence to the people of Utah that  
these games will be perfect, and also to the sponsors,'' Hodler 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, Hodler said, was ready to discuss ways to help the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee meet a $300 million budget gap aggravated 
by the scandal. He said money problems would be a focus of the 
four-day session that concludes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully support Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``And we fully  
support the initiatives it has taken for the Winter Games of 
2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, the worst in Olympic history, led to the purge of  
10 IOC members, plans for drastic change in the Olympic community 
and at least six investigations, including still-open inquiries by 
the Justice Department and the Utah attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was pleased with progress the IOC has made in  
dealing with the scandal and repeated that Salt Lake had been a 
victim of unscrupulous committee members and agents promising 
blocks of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed previous reports that Dave Johnson, then the  
No. 2 official of SLOC and a bid leader, telephoned him last Nov. 
19 or 20 to tell him ``some important documents'' regarding a 
scholarship program had been stolen from the committee and turned 
over to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, KTVX-TV broke the news that Johnson sent a letter to  
the daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, 
ending a $10,000-a-year scholarship. That was the first documented 
proof of abuse of power within the IOC and the first element in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had heard rumors for a long time, but we never really had  
facts,'' said Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who helped write the IOC's old 
ethics code. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Johnson, a longtime friend, told Hodler  
IOC members were involved. Hodler said he was told there were no 
direct cash payments. He said he advised Johnson to ``come 
completely clean'' and was ``disappointed'' when it was later 
revealed Johnson lied to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left for Max Wheeler, Johnson's lawyer, were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bombshells that struck almost daily last winter have  
subsided, Hodler's commission still saw firsthand evidence of the 
scandal's impact on Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Jean-Claude Killy, the Olympic ski champion and now IOC  
member from France, the panel's financial task force was briefed by 
SLOC officials on their problems raising money from jittery 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy met with three experts who are reviewing SLOC's books: IOC  
financial director Thierry Sprunger; Bjorn Brenna, head of finance 
for the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer; and Pat Glisson, 
Atlanta's financial chief for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with three new deals worth $30 million signed last Friday,  
SLOC still has budget cuts of $84 million under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those are aimed at the edge of the games, such as no  
free food for Olympic volunteers. Others could affect the athletes, 
keeping Olympic venues closed to training until just before the 
flame is lighted. 
</P>
<P>
	And the IOC could feel the knife, too. SLOC president Mitt  
Romney has suggested deferring the international committee's share 
of income so SLOC does not have to dip into credit lines. Romney 
has asked to negotiate independent sponsorships with 
information-technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members could be asked to give up some perks, such as  
chauffeured cars, and stage the games with less pageantry. Already, 
it appears, the Olympic leaders are toning down their presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The coordination commission, including sports and national  
Olympic committee officials, as well as the IOC delegation, is 
staying at a comfortable but nondescript hotel, hard by a 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also down the street from the IOC's usual hotel, the Little  
America, which is run by Earl Holding, owner of Sinclair oil and 
the Snowbasin ski area where the Olympic downhill is scheduled. 
Holding resigned last winter from the SLOC board amid concern over 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why the change in hotels was made.

<HEADLINE> Hernandez Case Goes to Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Arbitrator Richard Bloch heard testimony from  
four witnesses Monday in the grievance case for Xavier Hernandez, 
whose $2.7 million, two-year contract with Baltimore was voided 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, which was brought by the players association, will  
continue with additional testimony Tuesday. After that, the two 
sides will set a date to file briefs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles voided Hernandez's contract after saying the  
33-year-old right-hander flunked a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 ERA last year, is  
seeking $2.45 million, the difference between his deal with the 
Orioles and one he signed later with the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier was eventually released by Houston in March and signed a  
minor league contract with the New York Mets last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez agreed to his deal with Baltimore on Dec. 17, getting  
a contract that called for $1.2 million this year and $1.25 million 
in 2000. The Orioles had a $1.5 million option for 2001 with a 
$250,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch is hearing the case as an interim arbitrator. Players and  
owners are searching for a new arbitrator to replace Cornell 
professor Dana Eischen, who was hired in December 1997 but quit 
after ruling in May against J.D. Drew's grievance seeking free 
agency.

<HEADLINE> Cells May Give Tip Off on Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It's not exactly the male Pap test, but checking  
for something called PIN may give men who fear prostate cancer the 
same early warning that women receive for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a presentation Sunday, doctors said that checking the  
prostate gland for abnormal growths called PIN -- short for 
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia -- can often catch cancer in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pap test, developed in the 1940s, offers a way of spotting  
the earliest stage of cancer while it is still easily curable with 
surgery. There is no male equivalent for diagnosing prostate 
cancer, the leading male cancer. But doctors say looking for PIN 
appears to offer some of the same advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of checking for PIN is to find nasty but pre-maligant  
cells in the prostate gland that are on the verge of becoming 
cancerous. Doctors have suspected since the 1980s that PIN might be 
cancer's earliest stage, but a new study shows that it truly is an 
ominous sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston doctors treating military veterans found that those with  
the most abnormal, or high-grade, stage of PIN have double the 
usual risk of developing outright prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery confirms the growing belief that doctors should  
take PIN seriously. But they are still unsure what, if anything, 
they should do differently when they discover it. There is no good 
evidence that taking out these men's prostate glands will ward off 
death from cancer, although this is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-grade PIN definitely predicts for a high risk of prostate  
cancer. We have to watch them very closely,'' said Dr. Christopher 
Nauman of Boston University School of Medicine. He presented the 
findings at a meeting in Atlanta of the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their similarities, checking for PIN is far more  
difficult than cervical cancer. The Pap test involves a quick and 
simple swab of the surface of the cervix to sample cells. Looking 
for PIN in the prostate involves a much more difficult and costly 
biopsy of the prostate using a needle to draw out cells for 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, Nauman reviewed the outcome of men who underwent  
prostate biopsies between 1989 and 1993 because blood tests hinted 
at possible cancer or doctors felt lumps in their prostates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-one had high-grade PIN, while 47 did not. After seven  
years of follow up, prostate cancer was found in 49 percent with 
high-grade PIN, compared with 21 percent of the other men. 
</P>
<P>
	There were too few cancer deaths in either group to show whether  
knowing men's PIN status improved their chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the men were relatively old -- their average age was 69 --  
doctors did nothing beyond watch them closely. Doctors are often 
reluctant to operate on older prostate patients, because they may 
die of something else before slow-growing prostate tumors cause 
serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, prostate cancer is the leading malignancy of men,  
and it trails only lung cancer as a cancer killer. This year, 
doctors will diagnose about 180,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of routine PSA testing, doctors are increasingly finding  
prostate cancer in men in their 50s. At that age, more aggressive 
treatment may be worthwhile to catch the cancer before it escapes 
the prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is important, because if you find PIN in a young  
man, you have to be very suspicious that he will soon have 
cancer,'' said Dr. Deborah Kuban of Eastern Virginia Medical School 
in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, doctors recommend that men with high-grade PIN  
undergo repeat biopsies every three to six months.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Reveal Beck Has Bone Spur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Rod Beck has a bone spur in  
his pitching elbow, but manager Jim Riggleman said Monday it's an 
old injury and he isn't sure whether it's the reason for Beck's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known about it from the day we signed him,'' Riggleman  
said on his radio show before the Cubs played the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, the ailment didn't keep Beck from saving 51 games in 58  
chances last season as the Cubs earned the NL wild-card playoff 
berth. But things have been far different this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Beck (2-4) is tied for fifth in the NL with seven saves,  
he's blown four chances, has a 10.54 ERA and opposing hitters are 
batting .438 against him. That has cost him the closer's job, 
though Riggleman hasn't designated a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck was booed off the mound in his last outing after retiring  
just one of four Atlanta batters Sunday. He gave up two runs, two 
hits and a walk, turning a 6-5 Cubs deficit into an 8-5 hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how to pitch, and there's no pain there,'' Beck said  
after the Cubs beat Florida 8-1. ``There's still no pain. But my 
arm isn't allowing me to do the things I'm capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander also acknowledged the elbow created problems  
against the Braves saying, the spur ``sometimes got in the wrong 
place and locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery probably is inevitable, but Beck still hopes to postpone  
it until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do it now, I might get back around the middle of  
August,'' he said. ``But being as stubborn as I am, I want to 
contribute to this ballclub. Right now I want to explore all the 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Cubs have no plans to place Beck on the disabled  
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll treat it day-to-day and see how it feels,'' general  
manager Ed Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Riggleman said he's stumped about what has caused the  
eight-year veteran to lose his touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure he's telling us exactly how he feels,''  
Riggleman said. ``His sinker and forkball just aren't working.''

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Redistricting Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it harder Monday for  
federal judges to invalidate election districts drawn by state 
legislatures just because they suspect race was the major factor in 
setting the boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling in a North Carolina case could have great  
influence on redistricting disputes nationwide after the 2000 
census by forcing judges to be more certain of the role race played 
before striking down a reapportionment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision did not mark any change, however, in the Supreme  
Court's consistent hostility to making race the prime factor for 
drawing election district boundaries. The court has been intent 
since 1993 on minimizing such use of race. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions, the court has said that drawing  
districts primarily to maintain or enhance minority voting power 
unlawfully discriminates against white voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices voted Monday to overturn a three-judge federal  
court's conclusion that North Carolina's 12th Congressional 
District was unlawfully drawn by the state Legislature in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is represented by Democrat Mel Watt, one of two  
blacks elected to Congress in 1992 from a state that had not sent a 
black to Washington since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the lower  
court wrongly chose not to conduct a full trial before ruling last 
year that the 1997 election map was too race-conscious. The 
three-judge court made that ruling in what lawyers call a ``summary 
judgment'' after considering the 12th District's shape and its 
racial makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence tends to support an inference that the state drew its  
district lines to support an impermissible racial motive -- even 
though ... (the challengers) presented no direct evidence of 
intent,'' Thomas said. ``Summary judgment, however, is appropriate 
only where there is no genuine issue of material fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the North Carolina case, Thomas said, ``The Legislature's  
motivation is itself a factual question'' and should have required 
more evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions since 1993, the Supreme Court has  
scuttled attempts by state and local lawmakers to draw districts to 
help minority political clout if race was the ``predominant 
factor.'' Most of those rulings were reached by 5-4 votes that 
traced the court's ideological divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra  
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy united in those 
cases to control the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting in those previous cases were Justices John Paul  
Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. 
Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those four justices joined in the final result Monday but not in  
Thomas' opinion. Stevens wrote separately for the four. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record supports the conclusion that most loyal Democrats  
living near the borders of District 12 happen to be black 
Democrats, and I have no doubt that the Legislature was conscious 
of that fact when it enacted the apportionment plan,'' Stevens 
said. ``But everyone agrees that that fact is not sufficient to 
invalidate the district.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina dispute now will return to the three-judge  
federal court, with the justices having offered precious little in 
the way of new guidance on just how much evidence is needed to 
conclude that race played too large a role in the drawing of an 
election district.

<HEADLINE> Transit Execs Seek Better Bus Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Following a bus crash that killed 22 people  
and raised questions about the driver's health and drug history, 
experts say a national database could help keep dangerous drivers 
off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Enforcement officials also have to do a better job inspecting  
bus and trucking companies to weed out bad drivers, said Stephen 
Sprague, chief operating officer of the United Motor Coach 
Association, which represents 800 bus companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain small core of drivers who are not very  
responsible and can move easily to another employer and find their 
way to the road,'' Sprague said. ``Once the information is more 
accessible, we believe some of those who should not be driving 
commercial vehicles will leave the profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Bedell, 46, was driving the Custom Charters bus that went  
off Interstate 610 in New Orleans on May 9 during a gambling trip 
to a Mississippi casino, killing 22 of the 43 mostly elderly 
passengers. Bedell was seriously injured in the crash and remained 
hospitalized today. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the crash, authorities uncovered evidence showing  
Bedell had congestive heart disease, had lost two bus-driving jobs 
because he used marijuana, had failed a test for cocaine and was 
undergoing dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 12 hours before the crash, Bedell received treatment in a  
hospital emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood 
pressure. In addition, tests found traces of marijuana in Bedell's 
blood after the crash, National Transportation Safety Board 
investigator Ken Suydam said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NTSB officials say Bedell should not have been driving,  
they say it is not clear whether his health problems or drug use 
contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The case shows that information about Bedell's history never  
made it to authorities who could have prevented him from driving. 
In his personnel file was a report by a doctor showing he had 
congestive heart disease -- a condition that should have kept him 
from driving commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal authorities who handle commercial vehicle  
enforcement apparently never checked the company's driver records 
over the last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, most commercial vehicle enforcement focuses on the  
safety of the buses and trucks -- not the drivers. Almost all of the 
money supplied to states by the federal government for enforcement 
is used for roadside inspections of buses and trucks, said Victor 
Parra, the motor coach association's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But 95 percent of all commercial vehicle accidents are caused by  
human error, Parra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the statistics and the New Orleans accident -- in which  
investigators have uncovered no evidence to indicate mechanical 
failure -- show that more investigative attention should be focused 
on companies and their drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing so could get unqualified drivers off the road and prevent  
accidents, Parra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This accident is a perfect example,'' he said. ``They have  
found nothing wrong here with the equipment. Clearly the issue here 
appears to be the driver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB officials said Bedell was fired as a bus driver in New  
Orleans and in suburban Jefferson Parish because he had marijuana 
in his system and failed drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell also tested positive for cocaine when he applied for a  
job with Greyhound in April 1997 and was not hired, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Bedell gave the results of his Greyhound  
physical to Custom and passed another drug test at that time. He 
also passed successive random drug tests required by Custom in 
April 1998 and October 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell took another physical examination in August 1998 while  
employed at Custom, Suydam said. In a form he was required to fill 
out, Bedell checked ``no'' alongside every listed illness, 
including diabetes, with which he was diagnosed in 1995, and 
cardiovascular disease, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked by the attending physician if he was taking any  
medications, Bedell ticked off a list of medicines that led the 
doctor to conclude he had congestive heart failure, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor approved Bedell's fitness for driving, Suydam said,  
despite a federal law that bars people with congestive heart 
failure from holding commercial drivers' licenses. However, the 
doctor also wrote ``congestive heart failure'' atop the form that 
was returned to Custom, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain whether Custom officials saw the notation or  
what, if anything, they might have been required to do, Suydam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Custom president Donna Begovich said in a statement Thursday  
that she was shocked to learn Bedell tested positive for marijuana 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, Custom had no way of knowing Frank's drug usage at  
any time,'' Begovich said. ``Frank Bedell passed his pre-employment 
drug test, the city's drug test, a police background check and 
three subsequent random drug tests within an 18-month period. What 
else could we have done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Custom officials also have said that the bus companies Bedell  
worked for previously never informed them he had failed drug tests.

<HEADLINE> CVS Buys Online Pharmacy Soma.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Could any of the handful of tiny online  
pharmacies do to drug sales the way Amazon.com did to bookselling? 
</P>
<P>
	CVS Corp., the nation's second largest pharmacy chain, isn't  
taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	CVS is buying online drug retailer Soma.com for $30 million.  
That's a drop in the bucket for CVS, which last year made nearly 
$400 million profit on $15.2 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low selling price raised doubts the future of  
independent online pharmacies, which also includes Drugstore.com 
and PlanetRX Inc. and RX.com, an analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either CVS negotiated the most amazing deal ... or stand alone  
online pharmacies don't have the value some first thought,'' said 
Mark Husson, a Merrill Lynch analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Monday, accelerates CVS' fledgling effort to  
sell drugs over the Internet, a concept that some experts predict 
could take off the way Amazon.com has transformed the bookselling 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Soma.com gives CVS a major presence on the Internet, a warehouse  
distribution system, and the ability to sell drugs even in areas of 
the country where CVS has no stores. CVS has 4,122 stores, more 
than any other pharmacy chain. Most of its stores are east of the 
Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Woonsocket R.I.-based CVS provides Soma.com with instant name  
recognition and contracts to sell to members of many major health 
insurers. CVS officials say they have not decided whether to retain 
the Soma.com web site, its CVS.com or use another name. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Soma.com in January became the first Internet  
company to launch an online pharmacy. But analysts say the company 
was hampered by few health insurance contracts, which greatly 
limited the number of potential customers that could shop on its 
Web site. Additionally, because Soma.com could only fill orders for 
overnight delivery, it was of little use for patients who wanted 
their medications immediately after leaving the hospital or 
doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending federal antitrust approval, the deal should be completed  
in June, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``CVS plus Soma.com is a powerful combination,'' Husson said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he said the low price shows that online pharmacies have some  
inherent problems. He added the CVS-Soma.com deal could spur 
similar mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The .coms were supposed to be a major threat to bricks and  
mortar pharmacies, but today we've seen one decide to sell itself 
for a surprisingly small amount of money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither CVS nor privately-held Soma.com would disclose how many  
customers Soma.com has. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, CVS announced plans to enhance its Internet site. The  
company quickly figured buying Soma.com would give it a head start 
over its traditional rivals, said Tom Ryan, CVS chairman and chief 
executive officer. Walgreen, the nation's largest pharmacy chain by 
revenue, and No. 3 Rite Aid are also improving their Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	CVS has no plans to actively persuade its customers to buy drug  
online, but will make sure consumer are aware they have the option, 
Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Hosts Literary Adaptations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Three of the movies vying for the Golden  
Palm award at this year's Cannes Film Festival are based on 
prize-winning books -- but only one seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian director Atom Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,'' a  
suspenseful, macabre tale of a lonely bachelor who befriends 
wayward girls, is based on William Trevor's 1988 Whitbread 
Prize-winning novel by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	This fresh take on the traditional serial killer -- no blood, no  
detective tracking the criminal -- won enthusiastic praise at 
Monday's screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Egoyan said he took liberties with the original text,  
transforming the character of a socialite mother into a glamorous, 
celebrity TV chef who humiliates her fat son on camera, stuffing 
him with raw liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only violence in this film is emotional, and it begets a  
monster,'' Egoyan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' Mexican director Arturo  
Ripstein's adaptation of the novella by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, won 
praise from the Nobel Prize-winner but many viewers Monday found it 
slow-moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour film set in Mexico in the 1950s portrays an elderly  
retired colonel and his wife waiting, in vain, for the colonel's 
long-promised military pension to come in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Their only son has died in murky circumstances, and their only  
joy is a cockfighting bird they hope will save them from 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia Marquez, who attended film school in Rome before becoming  
a novelist, praised Ripstein's effort, saying in a letter read to 
reporters: ``It's a great film ... and does justice to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripstein said he had wanted to adapt the novella since he was 21  
years old. ``Marquez said `I'll give it to you when you learn,' and 
I waited 33 years,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Chilean director Raoul Ruiz's adaptation of  
Marcel Proust's epic ``Le Temps Retrouve'' (Time Regained) had more 
than one critic napping -- despite an all-star cast featuring 
Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Beart and John Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Set around World War I and structured as a series of vaguely  
linked vignettes weaving past to present, it fails to capture the 
rich, analytic texture of Proust's descriptive prose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proust is a director himself, with a vision of things that  
makes you want to adapt it to the screen,'' Ruiz told reporters. 
``The difficulties aren't insurmountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Proust has frustrated generations of filmmakers. Orson  
Welles, Luchino Visconti and Joseph Losey tried but gave up. Volker 
Schlondorff's ``Swann's Way'' was a critical flop.

<HEADLINE> Cicadas Return to Four-State Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Few people are salivating to meet the  
periodical cicada like Craig Vance: He plans to fry the 
black-bodied, red-eyed insects and offer them to guests as a dinner 
appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an exoskeleton, it would be like eating a crab,'' said  
the 49-year-old post office employee from Peninsula, near Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	Before you say no thanks, remember this: the flying insect about  
the size of a thumb appears only once every 17 years. In fact, 
Vance has never eaten one before -- though insect specialist David 
Shetlar has. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are actually sweet. I kind of thought they had a nutty  
flavor,'' said Shetlar, a professor at Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming weeks, cicadas in eastern Ohio, most of West  
Virginia and parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia will end a long 
routine of chewing sap from underground roots. 
</P>
<P>
	They will emerge from the ground, wriggle out of their shells  
and fly about in noisy swarms. They'll mate, lay eggs in slits they 
cut into twigs and then die, all within a matter of weeks. When the 
young hatch, they fall to the ground and burrow into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like an eclipse or a Halley's Comet. It's an  
event,'' said Debbie Wadden, 41, a stay-at-home mother who 
volunteers to teach classes about insects. The cicadas will be the 
stars of her presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturalist Mike Greene said some people will be turned off by  
the huge numbers of cicadas and the abandoned shells that litter 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the noise by males doing their mating routine.  
``It gets quite overwhelming,'' even disrupting some people's 
sleep, said Wendy Weirich, a naturalist with the Cleveland 
Metroparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Females are silent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The females are flying around and the males are making big  
noise looking for a date,'' Weirich said. ``I know it doesn't sound 
comforting, but they are not going to sting you. They are not going 
to bite you. They don't care about you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are five mating sounds, most like ``whirr ... whirr ...  
faroo,'' said John Baniecki, an entomology professor at West 
Virginia University. ``They mean something to the female.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debra Shankland remembers the huge numbers of cicadas in 1982,  
when she saw the insects on trips home from school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd stop at a rest stop and it was so thick with them you  
would be stepping all over them,'' said Shankland, now a Cleveland 
Metroparks naturalist in suburban Garfield Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicadas don't harm people but can damage newly planted trees  
when they lay eggs. Mature trees usually aren't affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodical cicadas are divided into about 20 groups known as  
broods and emerge on different 17-year schedules in different 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	A brood is due in 2000 in Georgia, with more broods in 2001 in  
Louisiana, Mississippi and New York, and different Ohio broods in 
2002 and 2004. There are also the less concentrated and less noisy 
non-periodical cicadas seen each year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 59.85 to 10,853.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed Monday as investors  
debated whether a new hint of inflation will prompt the nation's 
economic policymakers to raise interest rates when they meet on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.85 to close at  
10,853.47. The blue chips had fallen as much as 167 points earlier 
in the session before regaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, which were lower for most of the day,  
posted scattered gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 1.69 
to close at 1,339.49 and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 33.98 
to 2,561.84, but declining issues outdistanced advancers on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the day, traders extended Friday's broad selloff, in  
which the Dow fell 193.87 points. That decline followed a 
steeper-than-expected increase in the consumer price index that fed 
worries about rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump in the CPI also raised expectations that the Federal  
Reserve will consider boosting interest rates when its Open Market 
Committee meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is paying respects to the FOMC today,'' said Alfred  
E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cautious traders appeared willing to wait on the sidelines  
all day, as volume was well behind Friday's pace. But as the market 
fell and prices looked more attractive, some began looking for 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a strange day and a half in the market,''  
said Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``It's 
hard to convince people to put money to work in front of word from 
the Fed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, White and other analysts said they expect the Fed to  
ultimately leave rates untouched Tuesday, instead announcing a 
``tightening bias,'' which would indicate that the group may raise 
rates at a future meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed tightens rates when central bankers believe the economy  
is growing too fast. Higher interest rates raise corporate 
borrowing rates, which can often hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The lingering concern over interest rates hammered banking and  
financial stocks for a second straight session. Rising rates are a 
particular threat to banks as companies become more reluctant to 
take out loans. Citigroup, a component of the Dow, dropped 1 to 70, 
and J.P. Morgan tumbled 4 to 136 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of inflation has rattled the bond market in recent  
sessions, pushing yields to their highest levels in nearly a year. 
On Monday, prices bounced back slightly, lowering the yield of the 
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.89 percent from 5.92 percent 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Fed watchers settled down and bond yields returned to lower  
levels, some traders turned their attention to a new batch of 
corporate earnings reports. Hewlett-Packard rose 4 9/16 to 88 3/4 and 
then rewarded investors with an after-hours earnings report that 
surpassed analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which typically sets the standard for computer  
makers, rose 2 1/16 to 43 1/4 in advance of its earnings announcement, 
scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw some indications that there's no big slowdown in the  
technology companies,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers influenced trading in individual stocks. After  
former Baby Bell U S West and telecommunications company Global 
Crossing announced they would merge, the stocks of both companies 
fell as investors appeared uncertain of the benefits to be gained. 
U S West fell 4 to 58 1/4 on the NYSE, while Global Crossing slipped 
1 1/8 to close at 60 1/4 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman Gordon was the biggest percentage gainer on the Big Board  
after Precision Castparts Corp. agreed to acquire it for about $721 
million, gaining 5 11/16 to close at 18 15/16. And Gulfstream 
Aerospace got a big boost from its intended merger with defense 
giant General Dynamics, rising 6 1/16 to 61 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.53 to 636.92, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite fell 3.87 to 784.94. The Russell 2000 
index, reflecting the performance of small-company stocks, fell 
1.78 to 441.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets were lower Monday, taking cues from Friday's  
losses on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell nearly 2 
percent. Germany's DAX index closed 1.6 percent lower, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed down 1.7 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Kings Now an Entertaining Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- When the Sacramento Kings gathered at  
the end of the NBA lockout, new coach Rick Adelman must have been 
wondering what he had inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had no center, an unhappy power forward and a rookie  
point guard who'd gotten thrown off his college team. On top of 
that, the Kings had endured an NBA-record 15 straight losing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But, within hours, everything had changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Vlade Divac was signed as a free agent and took over at center.  
Chris Webber, a day late in reporting, showed up and became the 
team's leading scorer and rebounder. And one glimpse at Jason 
Williams' court wizardry showed the Kings were about to develop a 
new personality. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings coalesced into a winner, and one of the most  
entertaining teams in the NBA. Sacramento led the league in 
scoring, being the only team to average more than 100 points per 
game, and was worst in the league in defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of the Kings were amazed at their quick turnaround.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are aware that something is happening here,'' guard  
Tariq Abdul-Wahad said late in the season. ``Everybody was looking 
toward next year, but things worked out and the time is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the season's first five weeks, they seemed like the  
Sacramento Kings of old. 
</P>
<P>
	They became the first team to lose to the hapless Los Angeles  
Clippers this season on March 11, and a loss at home to Minnesota 
the following night -- during which Webber became so furious at the 
team's lackluster play that he loudly berated his teammates on the 
bench during a timeout -- left them at 9-12. 
</P>
<P>
	They responded by beating the streaking Los Angeles Lakers, and  
started showing promise. They were still only 17-22 April 15, 
though, following a last-second overtime loss to the Seattle 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Kings turned their season around. They won 10 of  
their final 11 games to clinch only their second playoff spot in 13 
seasons, and barely missed ousting Utah in the first round of the 
playoffs -- a five-game series that included two overtime games and 
another contest decided in the final second of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, the Kings played the type of physical, intense  
defense they had ignored throughout the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we put away the title of the Showtime Team,''  
Webber said. ``I hope that we showed substance to this team besides 
just Jason's flash or an occasional growl from me. I just hope 
people see that comes from the hard work that we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings got valuable contributions from reserves Vernon  
Maxwell, Jon Barry and Predrag Stojakovic, all three of whom hit 
key 3-pointers in various games, but the key to Sacramento's 
success was the play of Divac, Williams and Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, despite getting little sleep the final month of the  
season while worrying about his parents and brother in Yugoslavia, 
became the team's emotional leader and averaged a double-double for 
the season with 14 points and 10 rebounds per game. His previous 
playoff experience also was important on an inexperienced team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We showed the world that a champion is coming,'' he said.  
``This team is young, and it can go far. Before the season, we were 
thinking about making the playoffs, and now we are thinking to go 
farther. In some ways I am disappointed, but it was a hell of a 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was spectacular at times with his no-look passes, Pete  
Maravich-like dribbling tricks and long 3-pointers, but terribly 
inconsistent. He was at his best against top point guards like 
Jason Kidd and John Stockton, but often disappeared against teams 
like Vancouver and the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Webber, with 20 points and 13 rebounds per game during the  
regular season, became the first non-center with such gaudy 
statistics since Charles Barkley in 1986-87. He also won the NBA's 
rebounding title. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps even more importantly, Webber found some peace in  
Sacramento after five tumultuous years at Golden State and 
Washington. Though he is not yet ready to make a long-term 
commitment to the Kings, he is far from the unhappy player of three 
months ago who considered his trade from Washington to Sacramento 
as a punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy I was here to play with this group of guys,'' he  
said. ``It's been a joy to play with them, from the players to the 
coaches. I don't have any regrets about being here this year.''

<HEADLINE> Cells May Give Tip Off on Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It's not exactly the male Pap test, but checking  
for something called PIN may give men who fear prostate cancer the 
same early warning that women receive for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a presentation Sunday, doctors said that checking the  
prostate gland for abnormal growths called PIN -- short for 
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia -- can often catch cancer in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pap test, developed in the 1940s, offers a way of spotting  
the earliest stage of cancer while it is still easily curable with 
surgery. There is no male equivalent for diagnosing prostate 
cancer, the leading male cancer. But doctors say looking for PIN 
appears to offer some of the same advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of checking for PIN is to find nasty but pre-maligant  
cells in the prostate gland that are on the verge of becoming 
cancerous. Doctors have suspected since the 1980s that PIN might be 
cancer's earliest stage, but a new study shows that it truly is an 
ominous sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston doctors treating military veterans found that those with  
the most abnormal, or high-grade, stage of PIN have double the 
usual risk of developing outright prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery confirms the growing belief that doctors should  
take PIN seriously. But they are still unsure what, if anything, 
they should do differently when they discover it. There is no good 
evidence that taking out these men's prostate glands will ward off 
death from cancer, although this is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-grade PIN definitely predicts for a high risk of prostate  
cancer. We have to watch them very closely,'' said Dr. Christopher 
Nauman of Boston University School of Medicine. He presented the 
findings at a meeting in Atlanta of the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their similarities, checking for PIN is far more  
difficult than cervical cancer. The Pap test involves a quick and 
simple swab of the surface of the cervix to sample cells. Looking 
for PIN in the prostate involves a much more difficult and costly 
biopsy of the prostate using a needle to draw out cells for 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, Nauman reviewed the outcome of men who underwent  
prostate biopsies between 1989 and 1993 because blood tests hinted 
at possible cancer or doctors felt lumps in their prostates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-one had high-grade PIN, while 47 did not. After seven  
years of follow up, prostate cancer was found in 49 percent with 
high-grade PIN, compared with 21 percent of the other men. 
</P>
<P>
	There were too few cancer deaths in either group to show whether  
knowing men's PIN status improved their chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the men were relatively old -- their average age was 69 --  
doctors did nothing beyond watch them closely. Doctors are often 
reluctant to operate on older prostate patients, because they may 
die of something else before slow-growing prostate tumors cause 
serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, prostate cancer is the leading malignancy of men,  
and it trails only lung cancer as a cancer killer. This year, 
doctors will diagnose about 180,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of routine PSA testing, doctors are increasingly finding  
prostate cancer in men in their 50s. At that age, more aggressive 
treatment may be worthwhile to catch the cancer before it escapes 
the prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is important, because if you find PIN in a young  
man, you have to be very suspicious that he will soon have 
cancer,'' said Dr. Deborah Kuban of Eastern Virginia Medical School 
in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, doctors recommend that men with high-grade PIN  
undergo repeat biopsies every three to six months.

<P>
	A fuel transfer between a Chevron-owned tanker and an onshore  
facility led to a spill Thursday of an estimated 110,000 gallons of 
oil, fouling the beaches of Mexico's Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
	A slick had been moving south Saturday, but the Coast Guard  
didn't see any traces of oil along the shoreline or in the water on 
Sunday. Two assessment teams surveyed the shoreline and reported no 
major environmental impact, Coast Guard Lt. Jean Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tar balls washed ashore in San Diego County, Calif., and two  
oil-soaked birds were discovered Saturday on a beach on Coronado 
Island, Calif. SeaWorld in San Diego took in the birds, along with 
two others found elsewhere, but was unable to save them, Donaldson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the damage south of the U.S.-Mexico border was not  
immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint team of experts was continuing to monitor California  
shoreline in the San Diego area.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Investors snapped up dollars today on expectations  
of a widening gap between U.S. and Japanese bond yields, pushing 
the greenback to a two-month high against the yen. Tokyo stocks 
fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.14 yen in late trading, up 0.96 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
122.73 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 389.37 points,  
or 2.32 percent, to close the day's trading at 16,421.02 points. On 
Friday, the average closed down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar began its rise after Japan's  
Finance Ministry reported that the March current account surplus -- 
Japan's broadest measure of trade -- fell 25.5 percent to $8.76 
billion from the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the figures were released, the dollar jumped to 123.36  
yen, its highest level since March 5, when it touched a high of 
123.58 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But market players said the news had little direct impact on  
currency markets. Instead, they attributed the dollar's rise to a 
slew of factors that pointed to further gains ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the list are expectations that interest rate  
differentials between the U.S. and Japan are set to widen further, 
in light of stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also followed remarks by U.S. Treasury  
Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers, who reiterated on Sunday that 
a strong dollar is in his country's national interest, augmenting 
lower inflation and trade income. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged from 122.82 to 123.40 yen in today's trading.  
The euro was traded at 131.27 yen, up from 130.33 yen late Friday 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell sharply after fears of  
higher U.S. interest rates led to a big drop Friday on Wall Street, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow fell 193.87 points to 10,913.32, erasing a  
106.82-point gain Thursday, after data showing a 0.7 percent 
increase in consumer prices caused bond yields to rise and sparked 
fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve might change its monetary 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares prices were lower across the board, with major  
exporters also racking up losses despite the sharp gains of the 
dollar against the yen, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong U.S. dollar usually pushes shares in exporters higher  
on hopes that their products will become cheaper overseas and that 
their repatriated earnings will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market seems to be saying it wants additional measures to  
stimulate the economy,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of 
the stock division at Tokyo Securities, referring to recent 
speculation that the Japanese government may up spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo today, an estimated 578.06 million shares changed hands  
on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 728.03 
million shares Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 1,064 to 
176, while 72 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 25.02 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,322.43. 
The TOPIX closed down 4.52 points, or 0.33 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unchanged from Friday's close of 1.230 percent, priced at 
102.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> American Air, Attendants Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines has reached a tentative  
agreement with its flight attendants' union, which is touting the 
deal as a new standard for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Hedges, president of the Association of Professional  
Flight Attendants, said the contract provides pay increases, 
improvements in retirement and increased scheduling flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, and the APFA, which  
represents 20,000 members, did not further disclose details of the 
plan, reached Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does indeed set a new standard, that would be welcome news  
for flight attendants working to amend contracts at Aloha and 
Northwest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	For American, there were no public disputes during negotiations,  
unlike the last round in 1993 when the flight attendants struck the 
airline for five days and virtually shut down American's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The contentious strike six years ago was part of the reason why  
negotiations went so well this time around, according to Sue 
Oliver, vice president of employee relations and chief negotiator 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties recognized this was not what we wanted to see in  
the future,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the company and union asked for informal help from the  
National Mediation Board before tempers flared. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants' contract became amendable last November.  
Now, the six-year tentative agreement will be subject to the APFA's 
ratification process. First, the union officers will review and 
vote on the pact. If they approve, the agreement will be sent to 
all members by mail. A simple majority of returned ballots is 
necessary for the deal to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second agreement between APFA and AMR this year.  
Last month, the flight attendants union and American reached an 
understanding on how to integrate flight attendants from Reno Air, 
which AMR purchased last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The smooth negotiations with flight attendants have been good  
news for AMR, which has been hit this year with a couple of public 
relations disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a dispute between the Allied Pilots Association and  
American reached a boiling point over the Reno. That disagreement 
led to a massive sickout that caused the cancellation of nearly 
6,700 flights and contempt damages of $45 million to be paid to AMR 
by APA and its two top officers. The airline said the job action 
has cost it $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Justice Department sued American for allegedly  
trying to quash competition at its Dallas-Forth Worth hub, the 
first predatory pricing case since the government deregulated the 
industry in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Faces Flood, Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, Iowa (AP) -- As western Iowa recovered from  
tornadoes, northeastern Iowans fled their homes Monday as creeks 
topped their banks and a dam was being eaten away on the Maquoketa 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes skipped across western Iowa on Sunday, killing two  
people, and were followed by flooding in eastern Iowa as 
thunderstorms rolled across northern Iowa Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Another storm hit Sunday night and continued to drench the area  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dunkerton, people were evacuating with little more than  
clothes stuffed in plastic bags to escape the overflowing Crane 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``The post office, city hall and police department, a church and  
all the businesses are in 3 to 4 feet of water,'' Sheriff's Sgt. 
John Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people were evacuated from Manchester after rising  
water began to eat away the earthen sides of the Quaker Mills dam 
on the Maquoketa River. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkey River in eastern Iowa received up to 7 inches of rain  
Sunday, and the city of Elkport -- located at the confluence of the 
Turkey and Volga rivers -- had its water supply contaminated by the 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was sending bottled water to the area, said Gov. Tom  
Vilsack, who declared five eastern counties as disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunkerton resident Katie Mostek waded through water Monday  
morning to help save books at the city's library, where flood 
waters began soaking the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mostek walked through downtown, she saw a man wading in the  
water pulling a boat with children inside behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people all over trying to get out of the water,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubuque received the most rain for the 24-hour period ending at  
7 a.m. Monday, with 2.5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in western Iowa were clearing up from the debris  
caused by Sunday's tornadoes. Nine counties reported damage from 
the storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross and Salvation Army had response teams in hard-hit  
Logan early Monday to provide relief and support for the victims. A 
busload of high-school students also planned to join the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people who fled a graduation party near Logan were killed in  
the tornadoes. They were Julie Pali, 15, of Bellevue, Neb., and 
Kathline Fugate, 38, of Logan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, severe thunderstorms moved across Michigan with heavy  
rain, hail and high winds that downed powerlines and trees. Storms 
hit most regions of the state but struck hardest in southwestern 
and central Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest wind reported was 115 mph about six miles south of  
Battle Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 150,000 customers were without power in Grand Rapids,  
Battle Creek, Jackson and Lansing. In the hardest hit areas, power 
was not expected to be restored until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms also brought heavy rain, with 1.18 inches falling in  
the western city of Muskegon, 1.02 inches falling in Iron Mountain 
in the Upper Peninsula and 0.92 inches in Saginaw, in eastern 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A construction worker was killed outside Grand Rapids when a  
house collapsed, WOOD-TV reported.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Meet Calif. Air Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. pickup trucks sold  
throughout the United States and Canada will begin meeting 
California's tougher emission standards in the 2000 model year, the 
No. 2 automaker announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows Ford's decision last year to make all its sport  
utility vehicles and Windstar minivans meet the so-called Low 
Emission Vehicle, or LEV, standards starting with the '99 models. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials said the move was not in response to the federal  
government's recent decision to require more stringent emission 
levels to be phased in starting in 2004. But Ford said some of its 
2000 trucks will exceed the government's proposed initial 
requirements for 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jac Nasser would not say how much the move would cost,  
but said the technology was affordable and would not result in 
higher sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
	All F-series pickups will begin meeting the LEV standard with  
2000 models, which go on sale in the fall. The compact Ranger line 
will meet the standards in the 2001 model year. The F-series is the 
best-selling vehicle in the United States, with more than 800,000 
sold annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its trucks that meet the LEV standards will emit from  
15 percent to more than 50 percent fewer smog-forming emissions 
than conventional trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the conversion is completed, a maximum of about 2 million  
Ford trucks a year will meet the lower standards. Ford said the 
result would be equivalent to eliminating all smog-producing 
emissions from 350,000 full-size pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been able to meet the LEV standards cost-effectively  
because its new family of engines permit newer catalytic convertor 
technology to be used, said Kelly Brown, director of vehicle 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been aggressively promoting its environmental  
consciousness since Nasser and new Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. 
took over leadership of the automaker in January. At the same time, 
the company has been criticized by some environmental groups for 
its heavy focus on pickups and SUVs, which generally pollute more 
than cars and use more fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an action to appease any fringe environmental  
groups,'' Nasser said after Monday's announcement. ``This is an 
action we truly believe has goodness in it in terms of impact on 
clean air. That's what drives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, none of Ford's cars sold outside California meet the LEV  
standard. Nasser indicated that LEV cars will be added to Ford's 
lineup as model changeovers occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. began selling its four-cylinder Accord sedan  
that meets the LEV standard nationwide last year. 
</P>
<P>
	California is in the process of phasing in the tougher  
standards, which differ for cars and trucks and vary based on the 
vehicle's weight. Automakers also are working with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to meet voluntary national LEV 
standards starting in 2001, but there are no such national 
standards set for pickups.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Speed Up 'Evolution' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Biotechnology companies are causing a revolution  
in evolution: conducting high-speed evolution inside test tubes to 
improve micro-organisms in ways Mother Nature never would, and thus 
create a range of super-products. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``directed evolution,'' proponents say the process could  
prove one of the most important steps in biotechnology since 
genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to discover in nature substances that perform in a  
certain way but have drawbacks, like a cancer-fighting protein that 
can only be used in small doses because of side effects, and force 
them to rapidly evolve to be better -- everything from super laundry 
detergents to novel drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's optimizing the best nature can provide,'' explained Jay  
Short, president of Diversa Inc., which is trying to improve blood 
transfusions with the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial product derived from directed evolution is  
an enzyme that fights tough laundry stains better than a previous 
detergent ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a meeting of 5,000 biotechnologists this week, companies  
outlined numerous others under study -- from anticancer drugs and 
better vaccines to a fade-resistant laundry enzyme that promises to 
let people wash a red shirt together with underwear and socks 
without the socks turning pink. 
</P>
<P>
	In biotechnology, ``the process until now has been: Here are  
genes from nature, and what can I do to squash these into a 
workable commercial product?'' said Russell Howard, president of 
Maxygen Inc., a leader in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But redesigning genes or the proteins they produce to fit a  
specific need is very difficult and expensive, because scientists 
simply don't understand enough about how these complex substances 
work, said directed evolution pioneer Frances Arnold of the 
California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nature pressures species to adapt, forcing diversification and  
survival of the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
	With directed evolution, biotechnologists use various laboratory  
methods to pressure genes to mutate in thousands of ways, doing in 
days or weeks what can take nature years. It took decades for 
certain bacteria to evolve to resist antibiotics, for instance, but 
companies can in days create new super-germs to test new 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes they cause mutations nature never would -- creating  
enzymes that can withstand mixing with strong chemicals or boiling 
temperatures, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a high-tech twist on how farmers breed better animals  
and plants, scientists can pick the most promising newly evolved 
genes and combine them into even better ``daughter genes'' that 
produce new drugs or biochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're breeding at the molecular level,'' explained Arnold.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't use this technology, then you're at the whim of  
trying to find an enzyme in nature that does what you want,'' added 
Glenn Nedwin, president of Novo Nordisk Biotech, maker of that 
evolved detergent ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pipeline:  
</P>
<P>
	--Diversa is evolving enzymes to strip certain molecules from  
blood, thus converting Type A and Type B blood donations into the 
Type O blood that almost everyone can use. 
</P>
<P>
	--A recent Maxygen experiment suggests it could improve by a  
stunning 200,000-fold the potency of alpha interferon, an important 
cancer and anti-viral drug that has dose-limiting toxicity. Now it 
is searching for drug companies to work with in improving such 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maxygen recently received $20 million in government funding for  
directed evolution, mostly to create better vaccines for the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	--Moving faster are biochemicals. Novo Nordisk has evolved an  
enzyme found in mushrooms to deactivate dyes released in water, 
meaning it could prevent a red shirt from staining white laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arnold evolved an enzyme to help synthesize antibiotics more  
cheaply and with less pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	--Diversa is finalizing an enzyme to make chicken feed  
manufacturing cheaper and less polluting, because makers would no 
longer have to add phosphate. 
</P>
<P>
	--University of Illinois scientists just reported a way to evolve  
certain immune system cells to better fight autoimmune diseases, 
even AIDS. Also under study are anti-cancer drugs and enzymes to 
strengthen chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE>  Golfing Great Sarazen Remembered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARCO ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen was remembered Monday as  
the last of golf's early ambassadors, one whose love for the game 
was as apparent in his final shot as his most famous one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little man with a big smile,'' 1964 U.S. Open  
champion Ken Venturi told mourners at Sarazen's funeral. ``A boy 
wonder who emerged from the hickory-stick era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and LPGA founding member Patty  
Berg were among some 800 friends and family who gathered at San 
Marco Church to remember ``The Squire'' -- a nickname Sarazen earned 
for his elegant style and fashionable knickers. He died Thursday at 
97 from complications of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the church altar contained an arrangement of at  
least five dozen red roses standing about three feet high. On a 
pedestal behind it was a white golf hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five weeks ago, Sarazen hit the ceremonial first drive at  
Augusta National for the Masters. Venturi said those who were there 
were lucky to see his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave strength in times of weakness, he gave courage in  
times of fear and above all, he gave love in times of doubt,'' said 
Venturi, now a television analyst. ``Each day I think of Gene, I 
will always smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another shot in 1935 for which he is best known -- the one  
that helped put the Masters on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	Then called the Augusta National Invitation Tournament, Sarazen  
trailed Craig Wood by three shots when his drive at the par-5 15th 
hole left him 235 yards from the pin. His caddie wanted him to hit 
a 3-wood over the pond, but Sarazen insisted on a 4-wood. 
</P>
<P>
	He swung and the ball hit the pin and dropped for a double-eagle  
2, the rarest shot in golf. Sarazen tied Wood in regulation and 
beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf ball and the 4-wood Sarazen used are in a trophy case  
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as golf fans will remember for the ``shot heard  
'round the world,'' Father William McConville said Sarazen will be 
remembered for his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is a legend and we gather and celebrate him as a  
legend,'' said McConville, former president of Siena College in 
Albany, N.Y. ``But let's be honest: As important as golf is, it is 
only a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen received an honorary doctorate from Siena in 1978. Three  
years later, he started an annual tournament that has provided 68 
scholarships through The Gene &AMP; Mary Sarazen Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quality of our heart that will be judged and not the  
quality of our short game,'' McConville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, who began caddying when he was 8, burst onto the scene  
in 1922 to win the U.S. Open. He won his second major later that 
year in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked two years ago what he thought about Tiger Woods winning  
the Masters at age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I 
was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won seven major championships in all -- the PGA three times,  
the U.S. Open twice and the Masters and British Open once. Only Ben 
Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus have managed to win the career 
Grand Slam -- the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen also invented the sand wedge, which can be found in  
almost every golf bag.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It sits balanced perfectly atop his head, as it

<P>
	``The Lollipop Kids?'' Sliwa inquires with a self-deprecating

he could serve as the official spokesman for Brooklynese. 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa has gone through 10 berets in the 20 years since he  
created the Bronx-born crime-fighting group. The group has since 
relocated; these days, their seedy headquarters sits on Manhattan's 
West Side: The Angels in Hell's Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa, in a red satin jacket to match his beret, is reflecting  
on his life as ``Angel One,'' sitting at a small table one block 
west of Times Square. Want proof that times have changed? One of 
his Angels is discussing a child-care problem with Sliwa. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a little less hair beneath Sliwa's beret. That's  
understandable: He has had a strange run since self-promoting his 
way to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two failed marriages, an attempt on his life, a  
British soccer hooligan using his face as a dartboard. There was an 
unlikely radio career (complete with one firing), an admission that 
he staged several crimes (including his own kidnapping) for 
publicity, talk of a possible political career (Councilman Sliwa, 
anyone?). 
</P>
<P>
	The only constant is the Angels, conceived during the Carter  
Administration, back when Mayor Edward I. Koch was barely a month 
into office and The Knack's ``My Sharona'' was the year's 
best-selling single. 
</P>
<P>
	``People thought we would be a fad, a trend,'' Sliwa says.  
``They thought we would go the way of trendy things from the '70s'' 
-- disco, Whip Inflation Now buttons, Huckapoo shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	They were wrong. Sliwa and Co. endured and expanded; they now  
claim chapters in 20 U.S. cities and five other countries, with an 
estimated 4,000 members. There are the Urban Angels, Junior Angels 
for preteens, the Cyber Angels patrolling the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics called them vigilantes, popping up five years after  
``Death Wish'' and five years before Bernie Goetz, a Sliwa pal in 
the days after his infamous 1984 subway shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Goetz and Charles Bronson's vengeful character, Sliwa  
has never carried a gun. ``I don't like weapons,'' he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics? Sliwa has outlasted most of them. At the Angels'  
20th anniversary dinner, the dignitaries included Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani and TV's Judge Judy Sheindlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, if I had tried to walk into City Hall, they  
would have had me arrested,'' Sliwa says. 
</P>
<P>
	Radical lawyer Ron Kuby, who won a $43 million judgment against  
Goetz for a black teen paralyzed in the shooting, believes the 
Angels have evolved -- from Neanderthals to more enlightened beings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We despised the Guardian Angels when they first came,'' Kuby  
recalls. ``We grew to loathe them when they supported Bernie Goetz 
and other right-wing nut jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in recent years, I grew to like them as I watched the  
real, unpublicized work that Curtis Sliwa does with young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unpublicized -- that's a new trick for Sliwa, who pleads guilty  
to the criticism that he's a little too media-crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	After he staged his own abduction in 1980, an official noted  
drily that Angel One knew by heart the phone numbers of every 
newspaper, radio and television station, reporter and editor in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right, Sliwa says. ``It gets to be an addiction. And then  
you begin to abuse it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa now treats his publicity jones with a nightly local radio  
show, working with unlikely sidekick Kuby. Sliwa, a self-described 
``populist and Catholic who values family life and law and order,'' 
plays right-wing foil to Kuby's leftist lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Given his accent and admitted inclination to ``botulize the  
English language,'' the radio gig was surprising. But the nightly 
``Curtis and Kuby'' show was New York's No. 1-rated AM show in its 
time this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	With his ever-present cellular phone nearby, Sliwa still spends  
plenty of time in the Angels' headquarters. Its walls are filled 
with awards and press clippings; an American flag hangs in the 
front window. 
</P>
<P>
	The downstairs door, with a smashed lower window pane behind a  
steel gate, has this simple message: ``Join Us Today.'' The 
shattered Plexiglas abuts the entrance of one of the neighborhood's 
last surviving porn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a place where Sliwa, son of a merchant seaman, feels  
comfortable. He is a child of the outer boroughs, born in the Bronx 
and raised in Brooklyn, far from the glitz and glamor of Manhattan. 
His dad was Italian, his mother of Polish descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa never finished high school and wound up managing a  
McDonald's in the Bronx, a frightening franchise where customers 
often enjoyed heroin or a hooker with their Happy Meals. 
</P>
<P>
	His destiny changed when he decided to personally take on subway  
crime. He bought 13 red berets at an Army-Navy store, and he and a 
dozen McDonald's workers became the ``Magnificent 13 Subway Safety 
Patrol,'' and later ``The Guardian Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the Angels rode the No. 4 train through the Bronx,  
and the cops rode the Angels -- hard. Police viewed them as 
interlopers, often arresting them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sliwa's campaign took off when subway crime did the same. In  
the summer of 1980, subway crime was up 70 percent from a year 
prior -- front-page news in New York. That year, Sliwa sent between 
200 and 350 of his soldiers into the city's subway system each day. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost the group's profile, and of course his own, Sliwa  
pulled the kidnapping hoax and filed five other phony police 
reports. Only a dozen years later did he admit the police reports 
were publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	His admission followed the very real crime that nearly killed  
him. In June 1992, Sliwa was shot three times in an ambush on the 
Lower East Side. and underwent five hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists the shooting was the work of Gambino family  
associates upset by his nasty cracks about mob boss John Gotti, but 
no arrests were ever made. He says the experience changed his view 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, I was flying high and thought I was invincible,''  
Sliwa recalls. ``After, you realize you are no longer the same 
person. You realize, `Gee, I'm a lucky son of a gun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The luck didn't last. Second wife Lisa divorced him in 1994, and  
the estranged couple's morning radio show was canceled after a 
three-year run. Sliwa spent a brief, uncomfortable period on a 
city-owned radio station. He was slipping off New York's radar 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to WABC-AM radio, on the 2 to 5 a.m. shift.  
Slowly, he worked his way back into prime time. In October, Sliwa 
will take his third ride on the marriage-go-round. ``I'm hoping to 
do better in that area,'' he says, knocking wood on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Without his beret and Angels T-shirt, Sliwa says, ``nobody knows  
who I am.'' And while he has a sense of humor about the omnipresent 
hat, he's proud of the look: ``I think we created a very strong 
symbol. It's almost like when you wear the Red Cross symbol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa says he intends to wear the beret for many years to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``You think Guardian Angels,'' he says, ``you still think Curtis  
Sliwa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last man standing wins the series.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Ironmen -- uh, make that Hawks -- appear to barely  
have enough players to put on the court against the New York 
Knicks, who look like they stopped off at a heavyweight fight on 
their way to the second round of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing is hurting. So is Chris Crawford. And Chris  
Childs. And Alan Henderson. And Charlie Ward. And Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for both teams, there's no time for any R&AMP;R. The  
best-of-7 Eastern Conference matchup between the Hawks and Knicks 
begins Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be tired,'' Atlanta guard Steve Smith conceded.  
``But we've got all summer to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are trying to shake off the effects of grueling,  
five-game victories in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	New York became only the second No. 8-seeded team to knock off a  
No. 1, shocking the Miami Heat 78-77 when Allan Houston hit a shot 
with 0.8 seconds remaining Sunday. A few hours later, the Hawks 
rebounded from two double-digit losses in Detroit to beat the 
Pistons 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, already bothered by sore knees and an aching Achilles'  
tendon, suffered a muscle strain in his right side during the third 
quarter of the deciding game in Miami. But, wincing and clutching 
his side, he still managed 22 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with as much courage as I've seen,'' Houston said.  
``He was in so much pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing is day to day against the Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a man who went above and beyond in terms of pain  
tolerance,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I don't think he 
can do that on a nightly basis, but I'm hopeful he'll be able to 
play this series effectively. ... Who knows? Whatever he can give 
us, we'll take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing isn't the only New York player who's hurting. Childs  
managed to play 19 minutes in Game 5 despite a bruised right thigh. 
Ward will need surgery for bone chips in his right knee after the 
season. Johnson, looking much older than his 30 years, has bad 
knees and a chronically aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Atlanta's MASH unit features Crawford, who  
missed the final three games of the Detroit series with a separated 
right shoulder. There's also Henderson, who's managed only four 
minutes against the Pistons before his season came to an abrupt end 
because of double-vision in his left eye. And don't forget LaPhonso 
Ellis, already lost for the year since undergoing hernia surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel sorry for yourselves,'' Hawks forward Tyrone  
Corbin said. ``You have to go with what you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford -- who replaced Ellis in the starting lineup for the  
final 30 regular-season games -- was able to practice Monday and 
expects to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to play,'' Crawford said. ``After a few  
days off, it feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks haven't given up on Henderson, either, hoping that one  
morning he removes the patch from his injured eye and finds his 
vision cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know for sure, but we're holding out hope that he can  
come back and help us,'' said Grant Long, who replaced Henderson 
and set a career playoff high with 26 points in the finale against 
the Pistons. ``We need bodies right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks won two of three games from the Knicks during the  
regular season, including a brutal 76-73 victory in the final week 
of the regular season. Ewing didn't play that night, and 
replacement Chris Dudley managed just two points, three rebounds 
and five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo dominated the middle  
with 18 points and 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris had a little problem guarding him,'' Van Gundy said.  
``But the biggest problem is offensive. You've got to have someone 
for Mutombo to guard. When he comes out to block a shot, you've got 
to make him pay.''

<HEADLINE> Siemens Profits Increase 17 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- German industrial giant Siemens on Monday  
reported a 17 percent increase in both net profits and sales for 
the first half of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales grew to 61.2 billion marks ($34 billion) and profits after  
taxes grew to 1.39 billion marks ($772 million), following 
stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had predicting that growth would ebb toward the end of  
the half of the fiscal year, but Siemens' earnings increased even 
more in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers cautioned that heavy invoicing exaggerated the  
improvements. Siemens said it expects the effects of the billing of 
major contracts in the first half to normalize in the course of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half new orders grew 10 percent to 65.3 billion marks ($36  
billion) 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Heinrich von Pierer said he expects growth to stabilize  
at that level in the course of the year. ``Overall, we're on the 
right track,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Air Faces New Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The Philippine government has imposed a Sunday  
deadline for the troubled owner of Philippine Airlines to put up 
$200 million in capital and bring in new management, a senior 
government minister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lucio Tan, who has a 70 percent stake in the flagship  
carrier, misses the deadline, the government will look at other 
options, including allowing outside investors to set up a new 
airline, said Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Pardo. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are talking with three investors interested in taking  
over PAL, Pardo told Dow Jones Newswires on the sidelines of an 
international business conference in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	They include a group from the Middle East, a fund group with a  
regional headquarters in Singapore which already has investments in 
airlines and a group based in Asia, Pardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the new deadline comes as Tan faces pressure to give up  
management control of PAL, Asia's oldest carrier. The airline's 
largest U.S. creditor, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, has lobbied to 
oust Tan from management and is moving to repossess four planes PAL 
uses for long-haul flights. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has been unable to pay $2.2 billion in debts incurred  
largely in an ambitious but ill-timed fleet modernization program.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Stottlemyre Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre left the  
game with tightness in his right shoulder after throwing four 
innings against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks described the move as precautionary and said  
Stottlemyre had no previous problem in his pitching shoulder. He'll 
be evaluated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona was leading 6-1 when Stottlemyre was lifted. He allowed  
one run and three hits in the abbreviated outing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre came out to start the fifth and left the game  
reluctantly after a discussion with manager Buck Showalter and team 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing annoyed, Stottlemyre walked off the field, jawing with  
a fan before retiring to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Stottlemyre's first appearance against the Giants since  
he and San Francisco infielder Charlie Hayes were at the center of 
a brawl April 16 in Phoenix. Hayes and Stottlemyre exchanged heated 
words and Hayes charged the pitcher from second base, triggering a 
melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes, who served a four-game suspension for instigating the  
brawl, walked in both plate appearances against Stottlemyre.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Await Stadium Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals, the only franchise in  
the four major pro sports to play on a college campus, could soon 
have a home of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have been homeless for 11 years, since the Bidwill  
family moved the franchise to Arizona from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	If voters in Mesa and two smaller communities give the go-ahead  
Tuesday -- and the latest poll shows the race a virtual dead heat -- 
the Cardinals won't just have a home, they'll have a palace, the 
centerpiece of the $1.8 billion Rio Salado Crossing. It's a project 
ambitious even by the ``build anything, anywhere'' standards of 
booming Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Now would seem the time for the Cardinals to win at the ballot  
box. The team had its first winning record in 14 years and won a 
playoff game for only the second time. Their star is Arizona State 
hero Jake Plummer, who already has engineered some hair-raising 
comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer appeared in a 30-second commercial spot for the project,  
one of the few mentions of the Cardinals in a campaign that has 
emphasized the supposed benefits of an undertaking that would 
include hotels, shops, restaurants, golf courses, a park and large 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people like us, they're going to be more apt to get a  
stadium done,'' Plummer said. ``If they don't like us, then we've 
got no chance of getting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the NFL team will be handed, virtually free, one of  
the most opulent stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proper role of government is not to subsidize professional  
sports,'' Mesa city councilman Keno Hawker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals aren't the only Arizona pro sports team looking  
for a new home. In Scottsdale and Avondale, voters will cast 
ballots on a $624 million renovation project that includes a 
20,000-seat arena for the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have pledged $75 million for their stadium. The  
remainder of the $507 million cost of the public share of the 
project -- to pay for the stadium, convention center and adjacent 
parks -- will come from Mesa taxpayers. The remaining $1.3 billion 
is to come from private investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa, a fast-growing city of 380,000, is being asked for a new  
quarter-cent sales tax and extension of another existing 
quarter-cent tax. The smaller cities of Gilbert and Queen Creek 
only must approve the project under Arizona law. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has promised a Super Bowl there in 2004 or 2005. The  
Fiesta Bowl also has indicated it would move there. 
</P>
<P>
	Although proponents, who have outspent opponents 70-to-1, say  
$500 million in private investment is assured, critics doubt the 
entire private portion will be built. They also are skeptical of a 
provision requiring the contractor to cover cost overruns and say 
Mesa could be stuck for huge operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $75 million they've pledged for construction,  
the Cardinals have promised to invest $75 million in the private 
portion and pay $2 million a year in rent for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, in turn, get to sell the stadium's name to a  
sponsor, which should bring in $50 million or more. The team also 
gets all the parking revenue on game days, all revenue from sale of 
advertising signs and up to half the revenue for parking at other 
events held at Rio Salado. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals' vice president and general  
counsel and son of longtime owner Bill Bidwill, says the deal is 
fair, and the Cardinals could have demanded more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many other NFL stadium deals and other sports arena  
deals around the country that have guarantees in terms of season 
tickets, suites and things like that,'' he said. ``There are no 
guarantees here, and the Cardinals are taking on risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the measure passes, Rio Salado faces hurdles. A working  
agreement must be reached with the Mesa City Council, and failure 
to sign a major hotel would kill the project. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Raises Food Aid to North Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
announced today a 400,000-ton emergency donation of food to North 
Korea, raising the total U.S. commitment for the year to 600,000 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright made the announcement as North Korea prepared to  
receive a team of U.S. technical experts to inspect an underground 
construction site believed by some U.S. officials to be part of a 
nuclear weapons development project. The inspection will begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright made the announcement at a news conference at which she  
was accompanied by South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young. 
Similar to previous U.S. food aid commitments to North Korea, the 
400,000-ton donation was offered in response to an appeal by the 
U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has responded positively to a number of such  
appeals for food for North Korea over the past several years. 
Drought, flooding and an inefficient production system have 
produced widespread famine in North Korea. Hundreds of thousands 
are believed to have died. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hong said his government may be forced by public  
opinion to drop its policy of accommodation with North Korea unless 
authorities in Pyongyang offer a positive response soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy will not be politically sustainable unless it  
achieves ``tangible results,'' Hong told a gathering at Georgetown 
University. ``That is why we are encouraging North Korea to seize 
this initiative,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong has been here since Thursday, meeting with Defense  
Secretary William Cohen and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that the policy of one-sided concessions by  
South Korea cannot last forever. ``There is no such thing as 
permanent giving in international relations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a policy of food assistance and economic initiatives,  
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has extended the olive branch 
to North Korea in hopes of easing tensions on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong said he is cautiously optimistic that North Korea will  
respond positively to Seoul's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are expecting to have the concessions,'' he said. ``We do  
expect to have some response eventually.'' The more North Korea 
values the benefits it is deriving from South Korea's humanitarian 
assistance and other initiatives, he said, the more that country 
will be interested in pursuing a dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one unprecedented initiative that began six months ago,  
thousands of South Korean tourists have been visiting a scenic 
mountain on the North's east coast. The $942 million contract is 
the largest joint venture since the two Koreas were divided more 
than 50 years ago, 
</P>
<P>
	Many American analysts are skeptical about the South Korean  
policy of accommodation, citing evidence that North Korea is 
developing a missile capability as well as weapons of mass 
destruction. They see this as proof of North Korea's unwillingness 
to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hong said South Korea, with help from the United States, is  
pursuing its detente policies from a position of military strength. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event of war, he said, North Korea would perish while  
South Korea would undergo enormous suffering. This, he added, is 
not the outcome Seoul is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea wants the North to be ``a real partner in peace and  
economic cooperation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Hope Experience Beats Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- About 14 hours after their remarkable  
escape from playoff elimination, the Utah Jazz went back to work, 
trying to figure out how to pull the same trick twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah faces Portland in the Western Conference semifinals, with  
the first game set for Tuesday night at the Delta Center. The 
Blazers are talented, rested, confident and in top form after 
sweeping Phoenix in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz? They somehow just keep winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't go to the playoffs all those years for nothing,''  
John Stockton said before Utah's Monday practice. ``Experience can 
be your best weapon if you know how to use it properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah finally subdued Sacramento with a 99-92 overtime win in  
Game 5 Sunday, ending a series in which the Kings twice were within 
one shot of completing one of the biggest playoff upsets in NBA 
history. At times during the series, the Jazz seemed to have 
nothing going for them but experience and karma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team's been through a lot together,'' Karl Malone said.  
``If you look at the statistics, Portland is going to be a tough 
matchup for us, maybe too tough. But you can't ever count us out, 
and if you do, you'll be sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six hundred miles to the northwest, the Blazers have been  
resting and practicing for nearly a week after routing the Suns. 
Like the Kings, Portland is a young, hungry team lacking in 
postseason experience but anxious to knock off the back-to-back 
conference champs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers have perhaps the league's deepest lineup, with an  
enviable collection of role players who quickly jelled into a 
formidable team during the shortened season. After practice Monday, 
Portland was mindful of Utah's uncanny ability to snatch wins from 
unsuspecting opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have got that ability to dig down, and they know they can  
come up with a way,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``When you 
play young teams, they're going to make the mental mistakes, 
they're going to give you that chance if you're ready to seize the 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz won two of three games in their season series with the  
Blazers, capped by a 96-85 win in the Delta Center that featured a 
shouting match between Portland guard Greg Anthony and Utah owner 
Larry Miller, who was later fined $10,000 by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's 37-13 record was two games better than Portland's, but  
the Blazers had the second seed in the West because they won the 
Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
	When Portland beat Utah 102-100 in double overtime on March 2,  
the Blazers screamed, hugged each other and danced around the Rose 
Garden to the roar of fans who sounded like they had just won the 
title. This time around, the Blazers won't be so impressed by a 
winning performance against the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether they've had one day or two days rest,  
they're a veteran club, and they're going to be ready for us,'' 
Portland guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``We've got to fight through 
their crowd and fight through the runs that they'll make at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though most of them wouldn't admit it, the Blazers must have  
been hoping the Kings would knock off Utah. Portland won all four 
games of its season series against Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know about the guys, but I'm confident going in  
against Utah,'' Stoudamire said. ``This is where my mind was from 
the jump, when the series first started, so nothing's changed in my 
mind. The worst-case scenario is here, so we've got to deal with it 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are still concerned about the health of Isaiah  
Rider, who sprained his right knee during the Phoenix series. Rider 
practiced gingerly on Monday and said the knee was at ``80 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to watch what I do,'' Rider said. ``I'm not 100  
percent, but I'm good enough to run up and down. We've just got to 
play it by ear with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are most concerned about getting their big men --  
specifically center Greg Ostertag -- out of the slump they endured 
against Sacramento. After a standout performance in Game 1, 
Ostertag disappeared for the rest of the series, culminating with a 
six-minute, four-turnover performance in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things just didn't go right for me in the last four games,''  
said Ostertag, who refused to discuss a reported rift between 
himself and Malone. ``I thought I was ready to play, but I wasn't. 
... I've got to step up, just like all our big guys do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His poor play was the main reason Vlade Divac ran wild on the  
Jazz, and it doesn't get any easier for Ostertag on Tuesday. The 
Blazers are exceptionally deep in the frontcourt, with starting 
center Arvydas Sabonis giving way to Kelvin Cato, Rasheed Wallace 
and even Brian Grant in the pivot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sabonis probably causes me more trouble than any big guy in  
the league -- except Vlade,'' Ostertag said with a grimace. ``If I'm 
not prepared, he kills me.''

<HEADLINE> Golfing Great Sarazen Remembered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARCO ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen was remembered Monday as  
the last of golf's early ambassadors, one whose love for the game 
was as apparent in his final shot as his most famous one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little man with a big smile,'' 1964 U.S. Open  
champion Ken Venturi told mourners at Sarazen's funeral. ``A boy 
wonder who emerged from the hickory-stick era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and LPGA founding member Patty  
Berg were among some 800 friends and family who gathered at San 
Marco Church to remember ``The Squire'' -- a nickname Sarazen earned 
for his elegant style and fashionable knickers. He died Thursday at 
97 from complications of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the church altar contained an arrangement of at  
least five dozen red roses standing about three feet high. On a 
pedestal behind it was a white golf hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five weeks ago, Sarazen hit the ceremonial first drive at  
Augusta National for the Masters. Venturi said those who were there 
were lucky to see his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave strength in times of weakness, he gave courage in  
times of fear and above all, he gave love in times of doubt,'' said 
Venturi, now a television analyst. ``Each day I think of Gene, I 
will always smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another shot in 1935 for which he is best known -- the one  
that helped put the Masters on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	Then called the Augusta National Invitation Tournament, Sarazen  
trailed Craig Wood by three shots when his drive at the par-5 15th 
hole left him 235 yards from the pin. His caddie wanted him to hit 
a 3-wood over the pond, but Sarazen insisted on a 4-wood. 
</P>
<P>
	He swung and the ball hit the pin and dropped for a double-eagle  
2, the rarest shot in golf. Sarazen tied Wood in regulation and 
beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf ball and the 4-wood Sarazen used are in a trophy case  
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as golf fans will remember for the ``shot heard  
'round the world,'' Father William McConville said Sarazen will be 
remembered for his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is a legend and we gather and celebrate him as a  
legend,'' said McConville, former president of Siena College in 
Albany, N.Y. ``But let's be honest: As important as golf is, it is 
only a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen received an honorary doctorate from Siena in 1978. Three  
years later, he started an annual tournament that has provided 68 
scholarships through The Gene &AMP; Mary Sarazen Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quality of our heart that will be judged and not the  
quality of our short game,'' McConville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, who began caddying when he was 8, burst onto the scene  
in 1922 to win the U.S. Open. He won his second major later that 
year in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked two years ago what he thought about Tiger Woods winning  
the Masters at age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I 
was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won seven major championships in all -- the PGA three times,  
the U.S. Open twice and the Masters and British Open once. Only Ben 
Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus have managed to win the career 
Grand Slam -- the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen also invented the sand wedge, which can be found in  
almost every golf bag.

<HEADLINE>  US Women's Soccer Team Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They're talented, they're tested and they're on a  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and Tiffeny Milbrett, all  
determined to win back the title they lost four years ago, lead the 
U.S. roster for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins June 19 at Giants Stadium, with the  
Americans playing Denmark, and concludes July 10 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make a statement to the world,'' coach Tony  
DiCicco said Monday after announcing the 20-player roster. ``The 
World Cup, in soccer, is the epitome. They want to be Olympic 
champions and World Cup champions at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is huge. But we are capable of accomplishing  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roster includes 13 of the 16 players from the team that won  
the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics. Hamm, Akers, Foudy, Carla 
Overbeck, Kristine Lilly and Joy Fawcett all will be playing in 
their third World Cup; six others will be playing in their second. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the first World Cup in 1991 and was  
eliminated in the semifinals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight players have been in 115 or more international games,  
including Lilly, whose 177 appearances is a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been there, for sure, is a huge plus,'' DiCicco said.  
``They know what to expect; they know what it's going to take. They 
know there are going to be some ups and downs in the tournament. 
They know physically the demand, because you can't duplicate the 
intensity of these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most noticeable absence from the roster is forward Debbie  
Keller, who claims she's being excluded because of a sexual 
harassment lawsuit she filed. Keller, whose 14 goals tied her for 
second on the U.S. team last year, is suing Anson Dorrance, the 
North Carolina and former U.S. coach, alleging he made uninvited 
sexual advances and harassed her during and after her college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time national player of the year wasn't an original  
invitee to the team's 26-player residency camp, but she later spent 
time with the team. Keller lost an arbitration hearing against U.S. 
Soccer last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invested a lot in Debbie last year, and she did very  
well,'' DiCicco said. ``But Cindy Parlow wasn't in the mix a lot 
last year, and Danielle Fotopoulos was still coming back from her 
knee injury. It just became a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debbie's still in the pool,'' DiCicco added. ``The landscape  
of this team is going to change, because in the next year or two 
there's going to be a lot of retirements. So she needs to keep 
herself in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long been the dominant team in women's  
soccer. It has 156-33-13 record, and 10-1-1 in the World Cup, 
giving up just five goals in six matches in '91. 
</P>
<P>
	This team is better than the 1991 squad, said Brandi Chastain, a  
member of both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very athletic in 1991. We relied on our athleticism to  
beat teams,'' Chastain said. ``Now, with the same core people, 
we're a much more polished soccer team. We're better tactically; 
we're better technically. We understand each other a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things don't happen just because of instinct like they used  
to. They happen for reasons and purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost to Norway, the eventual winner, in the  
1995 World Cup. That loss still bothers the Americans, despite 
winning the Olympics the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So DiCicco and his players have been preparing for this World  
Cup since the day after the Olympics ended. DiCicco has looked at 
hundreds of players in the last three years, both veterans and 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of his roster was set a long time ago, there were  
some decisions he made in the last few days. Among those DiCicco 
left off were goalie Siri Mullinix, midfielder Aly Wagner, defender 
Michelle French and forward Susan Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a more difficult decision than the Olympic decision,  
even though there were only 16 players in the Olympics, because 
there was more of a clear-cut division in '96,'' DiCicco said. ``I 
think it's the best team the U.S. has ever put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett, the leading scorer this year, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of disparity between the last person on the  
bench and those on the field,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also will play Nigeria and South Korea in the  
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win this thing and hold the trophy up,'' Chastain  
said. ``It's a beautiful trophy, and I hope I get to touch it.''

<HEADLINE> Cauthen Roots for Charismatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Steve Cauthen's respect for Charismatic  
grows with each victory. Just don't put him in the same league as 
Affirmed, the one-time teen riding sensation says. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, can catch  
Affirmed as a Triple Crown winner by taking the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cauthen insists that Affirmed remains in a class by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't compare any horses to Affirmed because I think  
Affirmed was the best,'' said Cauthen, who as an 18-year-old rode 
the chestnut horse to thrilling Triple Crown victories over 
archrival Alydar in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	No horse has won the Triple Crown since, but Cauthen says he'll  
root for Charismatic when the colt takes the track at Belmont on 
June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's meant to happen, and if the whole thing falls  
together, it would be great,'' Cauthen said Sunday in a telephone 
interview from his home in Walton. ``Seeing stars being made -- and 
Charismatic would be a genuine thoroughbred star -- that's what 
racing needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen admits that Charismatic sneaked up on him with his  
longshot victory in the Derby. But Cauthen, who now has his own 
breeding operation, has gained a growing respect for the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's dug in and worked hard to win his races, and looks like  
he may even have a little more left in the tank,'' Cauthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed's Triple Crown sweep over Alydar was culminated by a  
head victory as the two great rivals charged down the stretch in 
the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one got closer and more exciting, and the Belmont being  
the epitome of the way you'd love to win the race that was for 
everything, which it was,'' Cauthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's difficult to predict how a 3-year-old thoroughbred  
will respond to the 1 1/2-mile distance of the Belmont. The Kentucky 
Derby is contested at 1 1/4 miles, the Preakness at 1 3-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``A mile and a half is a different distance than they have ever  
run before, and probably ever will run again,'' he said. ``You 
never know until you get there. I didn't know with Affirmed until 
the day of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen praised jockey Chris Antley for his handling of  
Charismatic in the Derby and Preakness. He said all the attention 
before the Belmont and a possible Triple Crown can also be a 
jarring ride for a jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he'll give him a good ride in the Belmont,'' Cauthen  
said. ``I just know that the next three weeks are going to be awful 
tense for him. It's a long three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure once he gets on the horse on Belmont day, he'll be  
glad that he's ready to fire it and take his chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is the seventh horse to complete the Derby-Preakness  
double since Affirmed. The other six colts came up short in the 
Belmont -- including Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough thing to pull off,'' Cauthen said. ``A horse has  
to be at 100 percent each time and you just can't afford anything 
to go wrong in between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now retired from riding, Cauthen has moved on to other roles in  
the sport. He has a horse-breeding operation in northern Kentucky 
and is an executive at nearby Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also part owner of a filly sired by Affirmed. She was born  
just this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about her,'' Cauthen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen reunited briefly with Affirmed for a ceremony at Jonabel  
Farm, marking the 20th anniversary of the horse's Triple Crown 
glory. Cauthen said Affirmed was ``looking like a teen-ager.''

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Bring Tales of Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians in southern Kosovo are  
enduring a terrifying existence of constant food shortages, 
sporadic killings and the ever-present fear of a knock at the door 
by Serb soldiers, according to new refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800 fearful refugees arrived Sunday from the Urosevac  
area, 30 miles inside Kosovo from the Macedonian border, and 
brought fresh stories of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our village, they separated the men from the women and some  
40 people were gunned down, said Ajim Gasi, one of the Kosovo 
Albanians who crossed the border. ``We need immediate help from the 
West in Kosovo, both in terms of humanitarian aid and military aid 
to save the people still inside. It's a very harsh situation -- a 
catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials expect thousands more to follow as word spreads  
that the border has reopened after being closed this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees described a climate of terror in southern Kosovo,  
as Serb police seek out men suspected of working with the ethnic 
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence 
from Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they knocked holes through high stone walls which  
separate family compounds so they could talk to neighbors without 
venturing into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said families are swapping houses to confuse the police.  
Serb troops have been knocking on -- or kicking down -- doors and 
demanding to know if men were hiding, refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got riskier and riskier all the time,'' said Xhevahire  
Osmani, one of the recent arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	She sent her six children into a Macedonian camp seven weeks ago  
with her brother-in-law because she feared for their safety, but 
decided to remain behind to protect the family home. 
</P>
<P>
	Osmani said she and her neighbors almost never left their homes  
after the NATO bombing campaign started March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning I woke up having dreamt about my children, and I  
decided I had to leave,'' Osmani added. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched its bombing campaign to force President Slobodan  
Milosevic to accept a Western peace plan for Kosovo, a Serb 
province that has a majority Albanian population. 
</P>
<P>
	Afrim Ibrahimi, 29, had never wanted to leave Kosovo. But he  
said as someone who ran errands for the KLA, life became more 
dangerous by the day. He slept at a different house each night, 
survived a beating by Serb troops, and a threat to cut off one of 
his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, the Serbs came again to our street and beat up four  
people and gave them an ultimatum,'' Ibrahimi said. ``They said the 
border is open. Go to Macedonia. If you don't leave, I'll kill 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8.00 a.m. Saturday, Ibrahimi collected his wife, their three  
young children and what possessions he could carry to the train 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafe Sfaqla, 52, has also been constantly on the move for the  
past month, never staying put for more than three days at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left at 5 a.m. this morning, because the police were coming  
to our home,'' Sfaqla said. ``They were looking for men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said families survived off stockpiled food, sharing with  
others and bartering. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly women regularly risked forays into the streets to find  
fresh food. Children aged between seven and 10 were allowed out 
too, until police followed some of them home trying to find adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi said Serbs had looted the warehouses in Urosevac of the  
local Mother Teresa humanitarian organization and were selling the 
goods in government shops -- but not to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The new refugees confirmed earlier reports that Serb shopkeepers  
were often refusing to sell ethnic Albanians food, even when their 
risked their lives to venture out of their homes.

<HEADLINE>  Rhode Island's Odom Heads to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Lamar Odom, Rhode Island's star  
forward, has declared for the NBA draft after one outstanding 
collegiate season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 sophomore filed the necessary papers with the NBA  
Sunday, the university said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has always been a dream of mine to play in the NBA and I am  
excited about the possibility of playing on the next level,'' Odom, 
19, said in a statement released by the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to explore the opportunities that are available to me.  
I want to investigate and research my options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of the draft as late  
as June 23 and return to college. Last year, Odom declared for the 
draft, then pulled out June 16 after he was admitted to Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	If he goes to the NBA, he will be giving up two years of college  
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom is considered a probable lottery pick.  
</P>
<P>
	He led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4) last  
season. The Rams (20-13) lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in the 
first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom has played only one season at Rhode Island, and the school  
took the unusual step of giving him a voice in the hiring of its 
coach after Jim Harrick left for Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom entered UNLV in 1997, but he was accused of cheating on a  
college entrance exam. He was upset by the accusations and chose to 
transfer. A UNLV assistant coach insists Odom did not cheat on the 
test.

<HEADLINE> Another Diet Drug Trial Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began Monday in the trial of  
a Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for 
damaging her heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Stone Lovett of Grand Saline is suing American Home  
Products Inc. and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Also named 
are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the 
prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is claiming she suffered moderate to severe heart  
valve damage after taking fen-phen for eight months starting in 
October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline, Texas, and Wal-Mart  
Stores, where the prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff said he will prove that American  
Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed 
to put warnings on drug labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and  
detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said. ``By 
the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart 
disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to  
comment on the lawsuit. The Madison, N.J.-based company is the 
nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Several are class-action suits 
asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future 
treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court  
over heart-valve damage. Sandra Moore settled for a reported 
$500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed  
but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental  
anguish and seeking unspecified damages. Petroff said the 
36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was 
hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she  
took the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market  
in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. A Mayo 
Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.

	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG declared Monday  
that production of the mini Smart car would continue, dismissing as 
``speculation'' a weekly newsmagazine report that the model could 
be cancelled unless sales improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel in its Monday edition said that DaimlerChrysler  
co-chairman and co-CEO Juergen Schrempp had given the Smart unit 
``six months at the most'' to improve sales or he would cut off 
investment in the project.

	A DaimlerChrysler spokesman on Monday said the company had no  
plans to stop production, noting that orders had been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the magazine, Schrempp told managers he would  
``turn off the money tap'' on the cartoonish, two-seater car if 
sales did not increase substantially this year. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has invested $1.1 billion in developing the  
Smart model, which is built in Hambach, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has changed management of the Smart unit,  
lowered prices and launched a sweeping ad campaign to improve 
sales, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Suffers Veto Override </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura was unable to twist the arm  
of the Legislature on Monday, becoming the first governor in 17 
years to have a veto overridden. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota lawmakers overrode Gov. Ventura's veto Monday when the  
House passed a bill 109-19 that allows accident victims to sue over 
defective seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate overrode Ventura's veto of the bill two weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was not allowed to have my day in court. Now I finally  
will,'' said Jodi-Michaelle Carlson, a quadriplegic who had waited 
in her wheelchair outside the House chamber, urging action. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative overrides of vetoes are rare. Only five have  
occurred since 1939, including Monday's. Ventura's predecessor, 
Gov. Arne Carlson, set a record for vetoes, but none were 
overridden. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a Reform Party member and former pro wrestler who  
promised during his campaign to muscle opponents into submission, 
said the bill unfairly aided one side. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he accepted defeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the right of the Legislature to override,''  
Ventura's spokesman John Wodele said.

<HEADLINE> Justices To Rule On Nude Dancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide how  
far governments can go in banning nude dancing in barrooms, a case 
that may clarify the line between protected expression and unlawful 
lewd behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear Erie, Pa., officials' effort to  
reinstate an ordinance that bans appearing in ``a state of nudity'' 
in public places. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials say a Pennsylvania court that invalidated the  
ordinance disregarded a 1991 Supreme Court decision that upheld a 
similar public-decency law in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In that ruling, the justices allowed states and local  
governments to ban erotic entertainers from appearing totally nude 
in barrooms and other adults-only establishments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Erie ordinance, enacted in 1994, in effect required erotic  
dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string. It was challenged 
in court by Pap's A.M., owner of a nude dancing establishment 
called Kandyland. 
</P>
<P>
	An Erie County court ruled the measure unconstitutional, but an  
appeals court reversed and reinstated the ordinance. But the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court again threw out the ordinance last 
October, saying it unconstitutionally burdened free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the Supreme Court's 1991 decision in the Indiana  
case was a ``hodgepodge of opinions'' and established no clear 
precedent. Therefore, the Pennsylvania made its own analysis based 
largely on the dissent in the 1991 Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several ways to combat these social ills'' such as  
rape and prostitution ``without banning the expressive activity of 
nude dancing,'' the state court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Erie's lawyers accused the state  
court of ``knowingly disregarding the precedent'' in the Supreme 
Court's 1991 ruling that upheld the Indiana ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers for Pap's A.M. said the Pennsylvania court did not  
ignore the 1991 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Erie vs. Pap's A.M., 98-1161.

<HEADLINE> German Telecom Boss Hopeful on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom chairman Ron Sommer  
expressed continued optimism Monday that his company's planned $80 
billion merger with Telecom Italia would go through despite the 
Italian government's reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials from the prime minister on down have expressed  
hope that Telecom Italia, a former state-owned monopoly, will 
remain in Italian hands, and have pressed the German government to 
cut the 72 percent stake it still holds in Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer told reporters Monday that he considered those concerns  
to be surmountable, adding he was ``very certain that (the merger) 
would not fail due to politics.'' He said he also did not expect a 
hostile bid by Olivetti SpA for Telecom Italia to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, that several months would be needed to resolve  
many questions before the plan could be presented to shareholders 
of both companies for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $65 billion for Telecom Italia in a tender  
offer that ends Friday. If successful, it would be the largest 
hostile corporate takeover in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the International Herald Tribune reported Monday  
that Olivetti's hostile takeover bid for Telecom Italia is secretly 
supported by some members of the Italian government, quoting 
Olivetti's honorary chairman and former leading shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo De Benedetti makes the claim in an autobiographical book,  
excerpts of which were published Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	De Benedetti cited Pierluigi Bersani, Italy's industry minister,  
as one government member backing the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bersani insisted that the Italian government will remain  
neutral in any takeover battle for Telecom Italia and called the 
report ``false and a little ridiculous,'' his press office said 
Monday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talk about marital loyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bob Dole says he is considering giving money to Sen.  
John McCain's presidential campaign, never mind that his wife, 
Elizabeth Dole, also is seeking the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain's my friend. And he's not raising the money that (Texas  
Gov.) George Bush is. I think we need to keep good people in the 
race,'' Dole said in an interview published Monday in The New York 
Times. ``So I've thought about ways to help McCain in particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But before writing a check, the three-time presidential  
candidate said, ``I think I'd check with Elizabeth first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Bob Dole for comment was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, joked, ``We just made our  
first down payment at the lumberyard for the woodshed we are 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a senator from Arizona, is an announced candidate for  
the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. Bush and Mrs. Dole are 
exploring whether to formally enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sort of leaning that she'll do it,'' said Dole. ``If  
there's no response out there, or if it looks impossible, this is 
not her whole life. If she can't raise the money, obviously it's 
pretty hard to be a candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Charter One Buys St. Paul Bancorp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Charter One Financial Inc. will buy St. Paul  
Bancorp, Inc. in a stock swap valued at $1.2 billion, the two bank 
holding companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Paul shareholders will receive .945 share of Charter One  
stock for each share of St. Paul stock they own. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to save money by eliminating duplicative  
operations. There will be job cuts, the companies said, but 
provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 1999 and  
result in one-time, after-tax charges of between $55 million and 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Paul Bancorp, which operates 60 St. Paul Federal Bank  
branches in the Chicago area, has assets of about $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland-based Charter One Bank has $24.6 billion in total  
assets and 340 branch locations in Ohio, Michigan, New York, 
Massachusetts and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Charter One Mortgage Corp., a mortgage banking  
subsidiary, operates 40 loan production offices across 12 states, 
and Charter One Auto Finance, an auto finance subsidiary, generates 
loans in nine states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago is clearly the cornerstone of the Midwest, and  
combining it with our anchors in Cleveland and Detroit gives us a 
solid footprint in the region,'' said Charles John Koch, Charter 
One's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Charter One closed Monday at $30.81 1/4, up 53 1/8 cents, on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. St. Paul closed at $24.68 3/4, up 3 1/8 cents, 
also on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Scully, St. Paul chairman and chief executive, said that  
upon completion of the merger, all retail banking branches will 
remain open and that they will retain the St. Paul name. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of  
both companies and is subject to shareholder and regulatory 
approval.

<HEADLINE> 'TV Land' Offers Vintage Reruns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On this, the week that big broadcast networks  
announce their new fall schedules, TV Land trumpets its ``new'' 
shows: ``Maude,'' ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' and ``The 
Honeymooners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the folks at TV Land are living in some sort of  
parallel universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three years old, TV Land is one of the fastest growing  
cable networks, its very existence a confirmation that everything 
old will someday be new again. 
</P>
<P>
	It presents a steady diet of vintage reruns, even classic  
commercials, with an irreverent love for television history. TV 
Land is a refuge for people who want to revisit the past, either 
out of nostalgia or boredom with their other television choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old executive who runs TV Land willingly immerses  
himself in that other universe. Larry Jones looks across his desk 
at a wall of framed, autographed pictures of smiling TV icons: 
Jackie Gleason, Paul Lynde, Fred MacMurray, Col. Sanders and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sonny &AMP; Cher Christmas tree ball decorates his desk, along  
with a Morey Amsterdam ashtray. Even Jones' cufflinks are a picture 
of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the target audience,'' he said. ``I'm part of the  
hard-core boomer generation, what we refer to as the TV generation, 
who grew up watching these shows. I lucked out. My personal passion 
merged with my career. I watched a lot of TV and I'm proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, corporate sister Nickelodeon reran  
``Lassie'' episodes in its afternoon programming for children. Its 
executives were surprised at how many adults tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon remembered this when it began airing shows in  
prime-time. It turned to vintage reruns, some old enough to be in 
black-and-white, as something that would attract parents after they 
put their kids to bed. But Nick has kept on expanding its lineup of 
children's shows, shrinking the time available for reruns. TV Land 
was spun off as a separate network in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, it is available in half the nation's 80 million homes  
with cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Many TV Land viewers are disgruntled with the state of  
television today, and complain that schedules change so much that 
they can't get to know the characters, Jones said. Some viewers are 
suspicious of the networks, not knowing when something will come on 
that they're uncomfortable watching with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's modern television, you just don't know how far  
they're going to take it,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's odd, then, that TV Land airs a cop show like ``Mannix''  
that in its time was rated among the most violent shows. And while 
some of today's prime-time fare would have been considered 
shockingly blue 30 years ago, TV Land's most popular show, ``All in 
the Family,'' treads ground that many modern producers avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Lear's 1970s sitcom about the bigoted Archie Bunker and  
his family was determinedly topical, plunging headlong into 
divisive social issues in a way most shows avoid today. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's TV Land's top-rated show, airing in prime time, twice  
in the morning, and once overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are watching it for different reasons,'' Jones said.  
``I don't think anybody watches anything for solely nostalgic 
reasons. I think it's about quality. It still holds up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, television executives tried to capitalize  
on ``All in the Family'' by spinning off a character for her own 
show, ``Maude.'' Now TV Land is repeating history; ``Maude'' begins 
airing in August and is the network's highest-profile acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Also coming to prime time soon are ``The A-Team,'' ``The Andy  
Griffith Show,'' and ``Gomer Pyle, USMC.'' So are ``The 
Honeymooners'' and ``Beverly Hillbillies,'' series that have aired 
relentlessly in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones believes the shows won't suffer for that familiarity  
because it has been years since they aired. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Land programming stretches now to the 1980s, with ``Hill  
Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' The network doesn't ignore 
television of today: it recently named ABC's ``Sports Night'' as 
its best bet to become a classic. And the network went blank last 
May during the ``Seinfeld'' finale, urging its viewers to watch 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no similar strategy for ``The Nanny'' this month,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of TV Land's most enjoyable moments are the retro  
commercials, such as one where a pre-''Taxi'' Judd Hirsch sells 
soap. Those commercials, some of them for products that don't even 
exist anymore, are mixed in with the real ones throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be the savviest programming strategy of all. It keeps  
nostalgic viewers from clicking away during the real ads. 
</P>
<P>

	Rain and thunderstorms hit from Minnesota to Texas today, while  
the Northeast had partly cloudy skies and Northwest was rainy. 
</P>
<P>
	With low pressure over Wisconsin, rain and thunderstorms were  
seen from southern Minnesota and Iowa east into Wisconsin and 
Illinois. The most intense thunderstorms were pushing through 
northeastern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms were not severe, but were likely to produce winds up  
to 50 mph and small hail in the Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Other showers and thunderstorms were found along and ahead of  
the cold front in north-central Texas. The strongest storms were 
seen from Missouri south and west through eastern Oklahoma into 
northern Texas, where two counties had quarter-size hail. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure over the mid-Atlantic provided fair, dry and  
tranquil weather to most areas along the East Coast. Sky conditions 
ranged from clear to partly cloudy over the Northeast and 
Appalachians, to partly to mostly cloudy over eastern parts of the 
Carolinas and Florida. Thunderstorms were developing off of the

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plays Host to CEO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- More than 100 titans of U.S. industry -- among  
them investment guru Warren Buffet, Disney Chief Executive Officer 
Michael Eisner and homemaking entrepreneur Martha Stewart -- will 
converge on Seattle this week for the Microsoft CEO Summit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third year the software giant has hosted the gathering,  
which attendees say provides them with a rare opportunity to talk 
casually and catch up on the rapidly changing world of computers, 
software and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see us as leading or participating in many of the  
technology trends ... sort of a technology `crystal ball,''' said 
Microsoft group vice president Jeff Raikes, who helps organize the 
event and run the company's $14 billion sales operations. ``We are 
a magnet for the business thinkers who want to engage in the 
dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the three-day summit will take place on the Microsoft  
campus, though it kicks off in downtown Seattle Tuesday night with 
a reception at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. Wednesday night, 
there's a dinner party at Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' $60 
million mansion on the shores of Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of gatherings share the prestige of the Microsoft  
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Every July, someish and talk shop. Their host is New York  
investment banker Herb Allen -- a key power broker in the 
entertainment industry. Gates, Eisner, Buffet and media moguls 
Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller are regulars there. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the same set jets to Aspen, Colo., every September at  
the invitation of financier Teddy Forstmann. Sun Microsystems CEO 
Scott McNealy and America Online boss Steve Case have been among 
those who have hiked in the Rockies or been treated to a live 
performance from James Taylor there. 
</P>
<P>
	And every February, techno-showman Richard Wurman convenes  
``technology, entertainment and design'' gatherings -- for a fee -- 
in Monterey, Calif., aimed at introducing attendees to new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Raikes would not give details of this year's event, which also  
includes Dell Computer founder Michael Dell, Ford Motor CEO Jacques 
Nassau, and Coca Cola Enterprises' boss Henry Schimburg on the 
guest list. Local businessmen invited include Jeff Bezos, chairman 
of Amazon.com, Howard Schultz, the head of Starbucks, and cellular 
phone pioneer Craig McCaw.

<HEADLINE> Knicks, Hawks Banged-Up But Ready  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Last man standing wins the series.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Ironmen -- uh, make that Hawks -- appear to barely  
have enough players to put on the court against the New York 
Knicks, who look like they stopped off at a heavyweight fight on 
their way to the second round of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing is hurting. So is Chris Crawford. And Chris  
Childs. And Alan Henderson. And Charlie Ward. And Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for both teams, there's no time for any R&AMP;R. The  
best-of-7 Eastern Conference matchup between the Hawks and Knicks 
begins Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be tired,'' Atlanta guard Steve Smith conceded.  
``But we've got all summer to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are trying to shake off the effects of grueling,  
five-game victories in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	New York became only the second No. 8-seeded team to knock off a  
No. 1, shocking the Miami Heat 78-77 when Allan Houston hit a shot 
with 0.8 seconds remaining Sunday. A few hours later, the Hawks 
rebounded from two double-digit losses in Detroit to beat the 
Pistons 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, already bothered by sore knees and an aching Achilles'  
tendon, suffered a muscle strain in his right side during the third 
quarter of the deciding game in Miami. But, wincing and clutching 
his side, he still managed 22 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with as much courage as I've seen,'' Houston said.  
``He was in so much pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing is day to day against the Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a man who went above and beyond in terms of pain  
tolerance,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I don't think he 
can do that on a nightly basis, but I'm hopeful he'll be able to 
play this series effectively. ... Who knows? Whatever he can give 
us, we'll take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing isn't the only New York player who's hurting. Childs  
managed to play 19 minutes in Game 5 despite a bruised right thigh. 
Ward will need surgery for bone chips in his right knee after the 
season. Johnson, looking much older than his 30 years, has bad 
knees and a chronically aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Atlanta's MASH unit features Crawford, who  
missed the final three games of the Detroit series with a separated 
right shoulder. There's also Henderson, who's managed only four 
minutes against the Pistons before his season came to an abrupt end 
because of double-vision in his left eye. And don't forget LaPhonso 
Ellis, already lost for the year since undergoing hernia surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel sorry for yourselves,'' Hawks forward Tyrone  
Corbin said. ``You have to go with what you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford -- who replaced Ellis in the starting lineup for the  
final 30 regular-season games -- was able to practice Monday and 
expects to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to play,'' Crawford said. ``After a few  
days off, it feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks haven't given up on Henderson, either, hoping that one  
morning he removes the patch from his injured eye and finds his 
vision cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know for sure, but we're holding out hope that he can  
come back and help us,'' said Grant Long, who replaced Henderson 
and set a career playoff high with 26 points in the finale against 
the Pistons. ``We need bodies right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks won two of three games from the Knicks during the  
regular season, including a brutal 76-73 victory in the final week 
of the regular season. Ewing didn't play that night, and 
replacement Chris Dudley managed just two points, three rebounds 
and five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo dominated the middle  
with 18 points and 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris had a little problem guarding him,'' Van Gundy said.  
``But the biggest problem is offensive. You've got to have someone 
for Mutombo to guard. When he comes out to block a shot, you've got 
to make him pay.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide, sometime in 2000, whether states can sell  
personal information from driver's license records such as people's 
addresses and Social Security numbers. The Clinton administration 
wants the court to uphold a federal law, the Driver's Privacy 
Protection Act of 1994, that closes such records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	--Made it harder for federal judges to invalidate election  
districts drawn by state legislatures just because they suspect 
race was the major factor in setting the boundaries. The unanimous 
ruling in a North Carolina case could affect redistricting disputes 
after the 2000 census by leading judges to be more certain of the 
role race played before striking down a reapportionment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled, 7-2, in a Florida case that police do not need a warrant  
to seize someone's car from a public place under laws requiring 
forfeiture of property linked to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide in a Pennsylvania case how far state and local  
governments can go in banning nude dancing in bars, a case that may 
clarify the line between protected expression and unlawful lewd 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bolstered the president's power as commander in chief by saying  
the military's highest court lacked the power to bar him from 
dropping a court-martialed officer from the armed forces. The 
unanimous ruling came in the case of an HIV-positive Air Force 
major imprisoned for having unprotected sex while stationed in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact a million-dollar libel award against the tabloid  
newspaper Globe for repeating a book's claim that a California man, 
not Sirhan Sirhan, killed Robert F. Kennedy. The justices let stand 
a California Supreme Court ruling that the news media can be liable 
for repeating someone else's libelous statement about a private 
figure.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Feels Unappreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Penny Hardaway feels unappreciated in  
Orlando and reiterated his intention Monday to exercise an option 
in his contract that allows him to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic would be able to offer the four-time All-Star more --  
up to $85 million -- in a new long-term contract. Hardaway has more 
than money on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought it would come down to this in Orlando,'' he  
said following the final team meeting of the season. ``I wanted to 
finish my career here, but it seems like it's just too rocky right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said he plans to spend some time with family and  
friends in his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., and weigh his options. 
One thing he knows for sure is he's fed up with what he considers 
undeserved criticism of his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Orlando. I really do. But it has to be mutual,'' he  
said. ``Right now, I feel like I'm in a very tough situation. 
There's a lot of added pressure on me that shouldn't be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, scheduled to earn $8 million before the lockout wiped  
out part of this season, averaged a team-leading 15.8 points, 5.7 
rebounds and 5.3 assists during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in every game after missing most of the past two  
seasons because of knee injuries. But he complained at times about 
not being able to get enough shots at point guard, then bickered 
with Nick Anderson in the final month of the season about who 
should play at off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway grumbled again after taking just 12 shots in Game 3 of  
Orlando's first-round playoff series against Philadelphia, saying 
if the team was going to beat the 76ers he needed to be more 
involved in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia won the best-of-5 series in four games. Hardaway  
missed his first nine shots on the way to a 3-for-17 performance in 
the final game, but did average 19 points during the series. 
</P>
<P>
	He said fans and the media should have been more respectful of  
what he accomplished after missing so much time because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm a so-called superstar, I had an option of playing point  
guard or two-guard,'' Hardaway said. ``Then people go: `Well, you 
shouldn't play two-guard, you should play the point,' like I 
shouldn't be able to play wherever I want to play. ... I think it's 
really childish the things I have to go through here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he still intends to exercise the option to test his  
worth as a free agent, Hardaway said: ``Oh yeah, no doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I've lost a lot of value here. I get so sick and  
tired of people wondering what's happened to my game and not 
looking at the whole thing overall,'' he added. ``I think I still 
have a lot of basketball left in me. I think I'm still an all-star 
player, and I think I can still be a first-team all-NBA player if 
I'm able to be Penny Hardaway and not be the way people want me to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel said the team wants Hardaway  
back next season, adding he understands the frustration over an 
early playoff exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wishes we were still playing right now,'' Gabriel  
said. ``But there's a big part of us that is still grateful we had 
a healthy Penny Hardaway all year. He played every game, which was 
step No. 1, and he did a pretty good job.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Urges Private Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes called Monday for a speedy switch to a private retirement 
system largely replacing Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the transition could be made within seven years, and  
that a key to selling the package is to make it clear that those 
currently in the system, or about to retire, would have the option 
of stick with traditional Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you make it feasible is you make it clear you're not  
going to tamper with the system for those who are on it or about to 
go on it,'' Forbes said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes conceded a host of details need to be worked out, such as  
devising a method of giving credit for Social Security taxes 
already paid. There's also likely a need to put in place age 
cutoffs, but those are technical details, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to rapidly phase in for younger people a new system  
where eventually the bulk of their Social Security tax goes to 
their own individual retirement accounts,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the chance to opt out of Social Security, up to 80 percent  
would do so and younger people almost unanimously would choose 
private retirement, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts it in your own hands and you don't have to trust  
Washington,'' said Forbes. ``The younger you are, the more I think 
people will go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes planned to outline his proposal in a speech Tuesday  
before the Small Business Survival Summit in Washington. He said 
diverting money from Social Security likely would free up a huge 
amount of money converted to capital for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pieces of his proposal including ending a ``penalty'' for  
those who continue working between the ages of 65 and 69. People 
who work beyond regular retirement age lose some benefits if they 
have work-related earnings above a ceiling that this year is set at 
$15,500. 
</P>
<P>
	He said surpluses in Social Security funds could be used to help  
phase in the new system. ``You give people a choice who are 
working, a choice of going on the new system or staying on the old 
one,'' said Forbes. ``No one would be forced to do it against their 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privatizing the system is ultimately the only way to avoid raids  
on the fund by politicians, Forbes argued. ``They are like bears 
with a pot of honey -- as long as it's available, they'll continue 
to gorge themselves,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Reports Lower Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc.'s reported Monday its  
first-quarter earnings fell 10.5 percent, but the retailer's 
executives said they expect demand for ``Star Wars'' merchandise to 
make 1999 a good year. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us earned $17 million, down from $19 million during the  
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-share earnings were unchanged at 7 cents, and beat Wall  
Street expectations of 4 cents. Toys R Us had fewer shares 
outstanding in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2.16 billion, up 5 percent from $2.04 billion during  
last year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R U has struggled in recent years and was surpassed earlier  
this year as the nation's largest toy retailer by the Wal-Mart 
discount chain. The company blamed the costs of opening five new 
stores in the first quarter and the remodeling of several old ones 
for the drop in profits in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	CEO Robert Nakasone said U.S. store sales were up 1 percent for  
the quarter, and said the chain expected strong profits from the 
sales of ``Star Wars'' merchandise timed to the release of the new 
movie and sales of action figures, computer software and video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us also plans to remodel 200 stores in 1999 and broaden  
its merchandise to include more clothing, electronics and bargain 
items. The decision to reformat stores came last year after the 
Paramus-based chain cut 3,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	International toy sales were unchanged, Nakasone said, and store  
sales at the company's Kids R Us chain fell. But the company's 
Babies R Us division reported a double-digit gain in sales, and the 
company plans to open 20 new stores in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to expand its sales of toys on the  
Internet, creating a subsidiary called toyrus.com. It has also 
hired a new advertising agency.

<HEADLINE> Infant Gets Cow Neck Valve in Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A 13-month-old boy has become the first  
person in the United States to have a valve taken from a cow's neck 
transplanted in his heart, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Doty has been breathing on his own since Thursday night and  
the prognosis looks good, said Dr. John Brown, the cardiothorasic 
surgeon who performed the transplant May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, performed at Riley Hospital for Children in  
Indianapolis, has not been approved in the United States, but the 
Food and Drug Administration permitted the surgery as a 
``compassionate case'' because of Ryan's critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was extremely ill and really wasn't expected to live. This  
was the only thing that could save his life,'' Brown, the director 
of heart transplantation surgery at the Indiana University medical 
centers, told The Evansville Courier &AMP; Press in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was in fair condition this morning in Riley's intensive  
care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born with only one heart valve instead of two. When he  
was 3 months old, he received a heart-valve transplant from an 
infant who had died. But that valve weakened and developed leaks, 
said Brown, who performed the initial transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said there is always a critically short supply of donor  
infant valves, and they tend to fail in transplant procedures. In 
addition, pig valves used for transplant in adult hearts are too 
large for infants. 
</P>
<P>
	A valve from a cow's neck ``is perfect'' for transplanting into  
an infant's heart, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has all the qualities and properties that heart surgeons  
have been looking for a long time,'' he told the newspaper. ``It's 
strong, it's the right size, it has all the surrounding tissue you 
need to make the hookup to the heart, and it's less likely to have 
complications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The valve is treated with chemicals so that the human body won't  
reject it. When transplanted, ``it's not really living cow tissue 
inside the patient,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of cow neck valves in infants was approved in Europe a  
year ago, Brown said. So far 13 of the transplants have been 
performed in Switzerland and Italy, with successful results. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, infant patients will outgrow the small valve,  
because it won't grow with them. Brown said that when recipients 
become teen-agers, they'll require another surgery to receive a 
pig's valve transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he expects the FDA will approve bovine neck valve use  
in America by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Dole May Make Pledge to McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole says he's not sure his wife  
will seek the Republican presidential nomination. He's even 
considering contributing to the campaign of one of her competitors, 
Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain's my friend. And he's not raising the money that (Texas  
Gov.) George Bush is. I think we need to keep good people in the 
race,'' Dole said in an interview in today's New York Times. ``So 
I've thought about ways to help McCain in particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But before writing out the check, the former senator added, ``I  
think I'd check with Elizabeth first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today, ``We just made  
our first down payment at the lumberyard for the woodshed we are 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizonan, is an announced candidate for the GOP  
nomination in 2000. Bush and Mrs. Dole are exploring whether to 
formally enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sort of leaning that she'll do it,'' said Dole, who ran  
three times for the presidency. ``If there's no response out there, 
or if it looks impossible, this is not her whole life. If she can't 
raise the money, obviously it's pretty hard to be a candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Ruling Allows Cops To Seize Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police do not need a warrant to seize  
someone's car from a public place under laws requiring forfeiture 
of property linked to crime, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-2 ruling reinstated a Florida man's drug conviction based  
on the crack cocaine police found in his car after seizing it 
without a warrant. Police said the man's car was subject to 
forfeiture because it had been used to deliver drugs several months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves seizures made under a Florida law that allows  
forfeiture of property used in committing drug crimes. A similar 
federal law provides for forfeiture of vehicles used in 
transporting illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that said  
the cocaine should not have been used as evidence against Tyvessel 
Tyvorus White because police did not get a warrant before seizing 
his car. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court based its ruling on the Constitution's Fourth  
Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court today that the  
seizure of the car did not violate the Fourth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although ... the police lacked probable cause to believe that  
... (White's) car contained contraband ... they certainly had 
probable cause to believe that the vehicle itself was contraband 
under Florida law,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's lawyer, Carolyn Snurkowski, said, ``We're very happy''  
with the ruling. She said it may aid other governments with seizure 
laws, depending on the details of those laws. For example, a new 
policy in New York City allows police to seize the cars of people 
arrested for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	White was arrested at work in Bay County, Fla., in 1993 on  
unrelated charges. After he was taken into custody, police obtained 
the keys to his car and took it from his workplace parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure was based on the officers' belief that White's car  
had been used several months earlier to deliver illegal drugs. 
Police searched White's car and found two pieces of crack cocaine 
in the ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
	White was charged with possessing an illegal drug, and a state  
judge allowed the cocaine to be used as evidence. White was 
convicted and a state appeals court upheld the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Florida Supreme Court threw out White's conviction,  
saying the cocaine should not have been used as evidence because 
police did not get a warrant before seizing the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a warrant would have created no ``undue burden'' for the  
police once White was arrested and his car remained at his 
workplace, the Florida court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers supported the state's appeal to the  
Supreme Court, saying different standards apply to seizures of 
property as opposed to searches conducted without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure of White's car without a warrant was valid so long  
as police had reason to believe it was used in a drug crime, 
government lawyers said. Once a car is seized, it can be searched 
without a warrant, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled for the state.  
</P>
<P>
	Because the police seized the car from a public place -- the  
parking lot of White's employer -- the seizure did not invade 
White's privacy, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, 
David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.  
Writing for the two, Stevens noted that the alleged use of the car 
to deliver drugs occurred more than two months before police seized 
the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said it appeared the officers simply wanted to avoid the  
``hassle'' of getting a warrant. He added, ``I would not permit 
bare convenience to overcome our established preference for the 
warrant process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Florida vs. White, 98-223.

<HEADLINE> Postmaster Accused of Mail Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARRON, Wis. (AP) -- The postmaster in Barron is accused of going  
through the mail and stealing a blood sample taken after he was 
arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhon A. Boese, 41, was charged with drunken driving and theft  
and could get nearly two years in jail and $12,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boese was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving on March 6. A  
blood sample was drawn at the hospital, and a sheriff's deputy 
dropped it in the mail, but the state laboratory reported that it 
never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A postal worker told authorities Boese had come into the post  
office the morning after his arrest and asked a fellow employee to 
``see what he could do.'' The employee didn't want to get involved, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the missing sample and the possibility he stole  
it, Boese told investigators: ``I would never risk my job and throw 
away everything I have worked so hard for. That would be stupid.''

<HEADLINE> Flynts Gear Up To Sell Hustler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler magazine may soon be readily available  
on Cincinnati newsstands for the first time since Larry Flynt went 
to jail for selling his X-rated publication here in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be actively soliciting retail outlets in Hamilton County  
to let them know that all Larry Flynt Publications magazines will 
be available,'' said Flynt's brother, Jimmy, who manages Hustler 
Books Magazine &AMP; Gifts in downtown Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are probably still going to be apprehensive,'' he said.  
``If I don't pick up a lot of retailers, at least people will know 
that they can buy all our publications here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsstands around Cincinnati have largely shunned Hustler,  
afraid of a costly legal fight since Larry Flynt was convicted of 
pandering obscenity in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	But 20 years after that conviction was overturned, Flynt  
believes prosecutors will leave the magazine alone now that he has 
agreed to stop selling sexually explicit videos in the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county does not want the videos sold; we just used them to  
force the issue of the magazines anyway,'' Jimmy Flynt said. ``If 
they just leave the magazine alone, we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Flynt, 56, and Jimmy, 50, were indicted in April 1998 on  
charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material harmful to a 
juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	A plea bargain announced Wednesday, in the third day of jury  
selection, allowed the Flynts to substitute the store's corporate 
entity, Hustler News &AMP; Gifts Inc., on two of the counts of 
pandering, and the other 13 counts were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	A guilty plea was entered for the company, which was fined  
$5,000 on each count. The store stayed open, but the videos were 
sent back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our magazines are going to be on sale,'' Jimmy Flynt  
said. ``We publish 30 different explicit magazines and they're 
going to be on sale. Our lingerie is going to be on sale, our toys 
and novelties will be on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still will be a warm and inviting atmosphere.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Hustler store, opened two years ago, is one of the only  
places in town to get the explicit magazine. It sells about 1,100 
copies of Hustler a month, compared with 50 to 100 sold at most 
outlets, Jimmy Flynt said. Nationwide, circulation is about 
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati was the nation's biggest city in which Hustler was  
not readily available, Larry Flynt said. He claimed victory for 
getting what amounted to an admission that selling Hustler magazine 
was not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County Prosecutor Mike Allen said although officials  
were most concerned with the X-rated videos, the settlement does 
not promise that Hustler will never be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subject of this indictment was the 16 sexually explicit  
videos; there's nothing anywhere that says we cannot revisit the 
issue with respect to Hustler magazine,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something is presented to me or my office that we consider  
violative of the law, we can and will present that matter to the 
grand jury,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hustler Books Magazines &AMP; Gifts may have to move later this  
year, but not because of legal problems. A half block of downtown 
Cincinnati is to be razed to make room for construction of the 
Contemporary Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been unsuccessful in its attempts to close Flynt  
with zoning and licensing legislation. It may even have to pay part 
of the store's relocation costs -- up to $20,000 -- when it acquires 
the land for the museum.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared in Fen-Phen Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A Texas woman who blames the maker of diet  
drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves will try again to have 
her day in court. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Monday declared a mistrial after attorneys determined  
they couldn't seat an impartial jury to hear Debbie Stone Lovett's 
case against American Home Products Inc. and subsidiary, 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many people had their mind made up that fen-phen was  
dangerous,'' said Kip Petroff, an attorney representing Ms. Lovett. 
He said lawyers were in the midst of questioning 62 prospective 
jurors when they decided they couldn't find an impartial panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prospective jurors in Van Zandt County said they had  
relatives who took fen-phen and would feel uncomfortable hearing 
the case, The Dallas Morning News reported. Others, the newspaper 
said, said Ms. Lovett was responsible for her injuries because she 
continues to smoke a half-pack of cigarettes a day despite the 
known health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said District Judge Tommy Wallace had set July 12 as a  
date for a retrial, where a larger pool of prospective jurors would 
be called. A hearing was scheduled for this morning to consider 
consolidating the case with another similar lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lovett's case goes forward, Petroff said, he will prove  
that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve 
damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and  
detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said. ``By 
the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart 
disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to  
comment on the lawsuit. The Madison, N.J.-based company is the 
nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named in Lovett's suit are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and  
Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Several are class-action suits 
asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future 
treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court  
over heart-valve damage. Sandra Moore settled for a reported 
$500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed  
but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental  
anguish and seeking unspecified damages. Petroff said the 
36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was 
hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she  
took the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market  
in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. A Mayo 
Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Keeps Entertainers' Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He may be publicly annoyed by violence in  
movies and on television, but President Clinton apparently isn't 
angry enough to return some choice gifts his show-biz friends gave 
him last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's financial disclosure report for 1998 reveals he and  
his family kept $18,575 worth of personal gifts, many of them from 
celebrities. The items included a film cel from director Steven 
Spielberg's ``Animaniacs'' and a collection of the top 100 movies 
selected by the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released Monday just after Clinton returned from  
a Democratic fund-raiser in Los Angeles, during which he gently 
prodded a dinner audience of top Hollywood figures, including 
Spielberg, to try to clean up the gory scenes depicted in films and 
television programs, and sign onto his national campaign against 
youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife, Hillary, also counted as a gift the  
$2.6 million in legal fees paid by The Clinton Legal Expense Trust. 
That money went toward legal debts that, at their highest point in 
1998, ranged between $2 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the Clintons held assets worth between $1.2 million  
and $5.5 million, the majority of which was in a blind trust owned 
by Mrs. Clinton. A White House official familiar with the first 
family's finances said the actual amount in the trust was closer to 
the lower end of a range between $1 million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported assets for  
1998 worth between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, including 
properties the vice president owns in Arlington, Va. and Carthage, 
Tenn., his salary and various family bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Clintons reported assets of up to $5.8 million, and  
in 1996, they reported assets ranging from $760,000 to $1.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the first family reported keeping $14,988 worth of  
personal gifts received in 1997. They included a cashmere shawl 
from designer Vera Wang and a set of leather-bound books from Oprah 
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons kept cashmere this year, too: a sweater coat from  
Mongolia valued at $395. And the president has no excuse for 
playing bad saxophone -- he received music books and two of the 
instruments (value: $3,000) from Thomas Ernst of Germany, as well 
as a collection of compact discs and a photograph ($700) from jazz 
saxophonist Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Three golf drivers from Rudy Durand and actor Jack Nicholson,  
$1,377. 
</P>
<P>
	--A signed bat and Chicago Cubs jersey from slugger Sammy Sosa,  
$300. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed Doonesbury cartoon inscribed by Garry Trudeau, from  
political consultant Robert Squier, $1,500.

<HEADLINE> TRW To Sell 4 Automotive Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Corp. plans to sell four automotive  
operations to help reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which makes automobile airbags and defense and  
aerospace equipment, said today it will sell TRW Engine Components, 
Lucas Diesel Systems operations, TRW Nelson Stud Welding and the 
LucasVarity Wiring companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debt reduction is an immediate priority for TRW,'' said Joseph  
Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer. ``Exiting these 
businesses will contribute significantly to the timely achievement 
of that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Net proceeds from the sale, estimated to be $1.2 billion to $1.5  
billion, will be applied to the debt from TRW's purchase of British 
auto parts maker LucasVarity PLC for $7 billion. TRW took a $85.3 
million charge for buying LucasVarity. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW Engine Components produces more than 300 million engine  
valves annually. It has about 6,000 employees and operates in 12 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas Diesel Systems, employing 9,200 people, is one of the  
world's largest manufacturers of diesel fuel injection systems, 
serving the car, van, truck, bus, agricultural, industrial and 
marine industries. It supplies fuel injection systems to more than 
one-third of Europe's diesel car and van market. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW Nelson Stud Welding, which makes stud welding fasteners and  
equipment, employs 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lucas Wiring businesses, previously announced for sale March  
29, are the leading supplier of electrical wiring systems in the 
United Kingdom. The businesses employ 5,500 people and have 
operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Egypt 
and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Speed Up 'Evolution' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It's a revolution in evolution that Charles  
Darwin never dreamed of: Biotechnology companies are conducting 
high-speed evolution in test tubes to create everything from super 
laundry detergents to novel drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Called directed evolution, the process could prove one of the  
most important steps in biotechnology since genetic engineering. 
It's getting a lot of attention at a meeting of 5,000 
biotechnologists this week in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to discover in nature substances that perform in a  
certain way but have drawbacks -- like a cancer-fighting protein 
that can only be used in small doses because of side effects -- and 
force them to rapidly evolve to be better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's optimizing the best nature can provide,'' explained Jay  
Short, president of Diversa Inc., which is trying to improve blood 
transfusions with the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial product derived from directed evolution is  
an enzyme that fights tough laundry stains better than a previous 
detergent ingredient. But companies are studying dozens of others -- 
from anticancer drugs and better vaccines to a fade-resistant 
laundry enzyme that promises to let people wash a red shirt 
together with underwear without their socks turning pink. 
</P>
<P>
	In biotechnology, the process until now has been: ``Here are  
genes from nature, and what can I do to squash these into a 
workable commercial product?'' said Russell Howard, president of 
Maxygen Inc., a leader in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But redesigning genes or the proteins they produce to fit a  
specific need is very difficult and expensive because scientists 
simply don't understand enough about how these complex substances 
work, said Frances Arnold, a directed evolution pioneer at the 
California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nature pressures species to adapt, forcing diversification and  
survival of the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
	With directed evolution, biotechnologists use various laboratory  
methods to pressure genes to mutate in thousands of ways, doing in 
days or weeks what can take nature years. It took decades for 
certain bacteria to evolve to resist antibiotics, for instance, but 
companies in days can create new super-germs to test new 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes they cause mutations that nature never would, creating  
enzymes that can withstand mixing with strong chemicals or boiling 
temperatures, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a high-tech twist on how farmers breed better animals  
and plants, scientists can pick the most promising newly evolved 
genes and combine them into even better ``daughter genes'' that 
produce new drugs or biochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're breeding at the molecular level,'' explained Arnold, who  
says the industry is investing heavily in directed evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't use this technology, then you're at the whim of  
trying to find an enzyme in nature that does what you want,'' added 
Glenn Nedwin, president of Novo Nordisk Biotech, maker of that 
evolved detergent ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pipeline:  
</P>
<P>
	--Diversa is evolving enzymes to strip certain molecules from  
blood, thus converting Type A and Type B blood donations into the 
Type O blood that almost everyone can use. 
</P>
<P>
	--A recent Maxygen experiment suggests it could improve by a  
stunning 200,000-fold the potency of alpha interferon, an important 
cancer and antiviral drug that forces doctors to limit doses 
because of toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maxygen recently received $20 million in government funding for  
directed evolution, mostly to create better vaccines for the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	--Moving faster are biochemicals. Novo Nordisk has evolved an  
enzyme found in mushrooms to inactivate dyes released in water -- 
something that could prevent a red shirt from staining white 
laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arnold evolved an enzyme to help synthesize antibiotics more  
inexpensively and with less pollution. And Diversa is finalizing an 
enzyme to make chicken feed manufacturing cheaper and less 
polluting, because makers would no longer have to add phosphate. 
</P>
<P>
	--University of Illinois scientists just reported a way to evolve  
certain immune system cells to better fight autoimmune diseases in 
which the body attacks itself -- even AIDS. Also under study are 
anti-cancer drugs and enzymes to strengthen chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> Post-Partum Depression Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- That period of depression that bothers many  
new mothers could have a long-term effect on the babies, a study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Emory University found that both depressed  
mothers and their babies have increased amounts of the hormone 
cortisol in their blood -- an indication of stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortisol levels in the babies systems remained high months  
later, even after the mothers received treatment and their own 
hormone levels returned to normal, Dr. Yolanda P. Graham reported 
Monday at the annual convention of the American Psychiatric 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said having high cortisol levels can make people  
vulnerable to overreacting to stress later in life. She is 
continuing to follow the infants to see if their hormone levels 
remain high or eventually drop to more normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called postpartum depression affects 10 percent to 20 percent  
of new mothers. Several studies have shown changes in the behavior 
of children, including infants, as a result of contact with the 
depressed mother, the Emory researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham explained that depressed mothers tend to react in one of  
two ways, either by ignoring their new baby or by overcompensating 
-- smothering it with attention. Either behavior can cause stress 
for the baby, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently her study involves 14 mothers who suffered postpartum  
depression. Graham wants to increase that to 20. She is looking at 
a similar number of mothers who did not suffer depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The cortisol levels of the babies were measured before age 7  
months and again two to three months later, with two further 
measurements planned. 
</P>
<P>
	While cortisol levels vary somewhat in infants, they normally  
stabilize by the time of the second visit, she said, and that 
occurred in the children of mothers who were not depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the children of depressed mothers, levels remained above  
normal, even though the mothers hormone levels had been returned to 
normal through treatment. The next two measurements will help 
determine if the effect continues.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Average Wage Fell in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Average monthly wages for Japanese workers fell  
last year for the first time since the government started keeping 
track of the numbers in 1970, the Labor Ministry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average monthly wage for workers at companies with at least  
30 employees fell 1.6 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 
compared to a year earlier, to 409,234 yen ($3,327), the ministry 
said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suspected Gambino Broker Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has  
joined a growing list of state and federal authorities who, along 
with a reputed organized crime family, wants justice against a 
fugitive stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC brought civil charges Monday against Mohammed Ali Khan,  
34, who last week was charged criminally with fraud by state and 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his trouble with the law, Khan also has been accused of  
stealing more than $2 million from reputed mobster Thomas Gambino 
and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Khan of Jersey City, N.J., broke securities laws  
shortly after the 1996 opening of Klein Maus &AMP; Shire, a now-defunct 
brokerage firm at 110 Wall St. 
</P>
<P>
	As president of the firm, Khan allegedly directed a private sale  
of preferred stock in which he told prospective investors that the 
firm was a full-scale investment bank with assets of $27 million 
when it was staffed by only a few professionals, had few business 
activities and assets totally less than $1 million, the SEC said in 
court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Khan was charged by the state attorney general's  
office with grand larceny for allegedly stealing more than $1.26 
million from five clients, including Gambino. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambino and several members of his family have sued Klein Maus &AMP;  
Shire and one of its brokers, Maurice Gross, alleging the family 
was cheated out of at least $2 million and maybe as much as $4 
million by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Khan has fled, probably with the help of others,  
and is now a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal criminal complaint last week charged Kahn with  
securities fraud for allegedly selling $2.7 million worth of his 
firm's preferred stock to 55 investors by making false claims. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on criminal charges, Kahn could face up to 10 years  
in prison on federal charges and up to 15 years in prison on the 
most serious state charges.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Maps Cuts in Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bills covering education, environment and  
other traditional Democratic priorities face billions of dollars in 
cuts next year under emerging Republican plans. The proposals 
signal bitter clashes ahead within Congress and between lawmakers 
and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring tight spending limits agreed to in the 1997  
budget-balancing deal, the House Appropriations Committee plans to 
decide this week how it would divide $538 billion among 13 bills 
covering all government agencies. That represents almost a third of 
the entire federal budget, including everything but automatic 
payments like Medicare benefits and interest to bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's blueprint, obtained by The Associated Press,  
shows that the appropriations committee plans to use $78.1 billion 
for the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services departments 
-- $10.7 billion less than this year. That measure is home to 
schools, job training and other programs that produce annual 
battles between Democrats and Republicans, and the proposed cut 
assures a nasty partisan fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other three, large domestic spending bills, the committee  
would spend $30.5 billion for the Commerce, Justice and State 
departments, which is $2.8 billion less than this year; $11.3 
billion for the Interior Department, or $2.7 billion less; and 
$66.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban 
Development departments, the Environmental Protection Agency and 
other agencies, which is $5.8 billion below this year's level. 
</P>
<P>
	These committee figures do not include additional billions in  
so-called emergency spending enacted this year -- money that does 
not count against spending limits. Even with that extra money, 
however, the fiscal 2000 bills come up short compared to this year, 
and even shorter compared to the amounts Clinton would like to 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts appear so deep that it is unclear whether bills at such  
low levels can even pass the GOP-controlled Congress, let alone get 
signed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early reports about the Republican plan suggest their 2000  
budget is simply not tenable,'' said Sylvia Mathews, the White 
House deputy budget director. ``The level of cuts it would require 
would do enormous harm to critical areas that Americans care deeply 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed spending billions more than Republicans on  
domestic programs, and would pay for them, in part, by raising 
taxes on tobacco and other items -- increases that Congress is 
likely to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether his bill would pass the House, Rep. Ralph  
Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the committee's interior subcommittee, 
said: ``I think it will be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the strategy for passing the appropriations  
bills, Regula said: ``I haven't heard of one yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other, smaller domestic spending bills have just  
minor differences between GOP plans for 2000 and actual totals from 
the c/urrent year. Several of them could become law with relatively 
little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one indicator of the pressure on Republicans to exceed  
spending limits, a bill approved Friday by the appropriations 
panel's Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee totaled $13.7 billion 
-- more than $140 million above the amount leaders plan for that 
subcommittee to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the budget-balancing deal, an escalating, annual series of  
savings were planned in an effort to eliminate what looked like a 
parade of unending federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of this year, many Democrats and some  
Republicans have said this year's spending limit will have to be 
breached because the required savings are too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders have continued to insist publicly that  
the so-called spending caps must be obeyed. The Senate's spending 
plans are similar to the House's, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should stay within the caps,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief interview. ``We knew the 
caps would pinch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To spend beyond those limits means using the federal surplus,  
and that would mean spending Social Security surpluses Republicans 
have promised to not spend or leaving less money available to pay 
for the tax cut. Cutting taxes and protecting Social Security are 
both major GOP priorities, and jeopardizing either would outrage 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how Republicans plan to move all 13 annual  
spending bills through Congress, and do so without prompting a veto 
fight with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides said their strategy calls for spending weeks this  
summer focusing on the message that Republicans are honoring 
spending limits to protect Social Security and tax cuts. The goal 
is to identify the GOP with those goals, and to ensure that in the 
likelihood that the spending caps are broken, that Clinton and 
congressional Democrats are to blame.

<HEADLINE> Pollsters Face Threat From Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pollsters face a triple challenge to  
their profession now that they've wrapped up one of their most 
influential years. 
</P>
<P>
	The high profile of polls in the last year has led to increased  
scrutiny by critics. The public's response to poll interviewers has 
been declining. And Internet surveys are being offered as a 
tempting -- and cheaper -- alternative to proven scientific methods. 
</P>
<P>
	These were major concerns of pollsters who gathered over the  
weekend for the annual meeting of the American Association for 
Public Opinion Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The role played by public opinion in President Clinton's sex  
scandal and impeachment trial was a frequent theme at the weekend 
sessions. While public support for Clinton did not prevent his 
trial, many analysts believe it contributed to his political 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last year solidified the importance of public opinion,''  
said New York City pollster Warren Mitofsky. ``The public made it 
abundantly clear over and over again -- they were supporting Bill 
Clinton as president, but condemning his behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the impeachment trial raised the political stakes for  
polling, and the poll results that backed Clinton became part of 
the debate. The polls became ``political footballs to be kicked 
around,'' said Kathleen Frankovic, director of polling for CBS 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The unwillingness of some people to participate in polls, a  
problem pollsters call ``non-response,'' also was discussed at the 
conference, and participants pledged more research on its effects. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
showed no difference in the findings of low and high response 
polls, but pollsters say they do not fully understand the effects 
of low response. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-response problem has grown as people have more high-tech  
phone screening devices, less use for inquiries from strangers and 
the perception that they have less time, pollsters said. 
</P>
<P>
	A more controversial issue at this meeting was Internet polls,  
which have sprung up on many Web sites and threaten to drown out 
scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional pollsters said they are considering a rating system  
to distinguish between scientifically designed polls, which pick a 
random geographic and weighted sample of the entire population, and 
those that do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Edelman, editorial director of Voter News Service and  
incoming vice president of the pollsters association, said Internet 
polling will never supplant the highest quality scientific polls. 
But he acknowledged the Internet efforts are likely to ``reshape 
polling'' at some levels because of their convenience and relative 
low cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The polling firm Harris Black International made a pitch to the  
group that the Internet can be used effectively for election 
polling by drawing a large pool of Web users and then finding a 
representative poll sample from that group. 
</P>
<P>
	But most in the polling field argue the company cannot draw a  
representative sample of the nation's population off the Internet, 
which is used by about 40 percent of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Voter News Service is a partnership of The Associated Press and  
the ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and Fox television networks that conducts 
state and national exit polls on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their concerns, pollsters said the last year offered a  
unique environment to practice their craft and reinforce the 
accuracy of polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Association president Michael Traugott said the intense focus of  
pollsters on the Clinton scandal provided quick public judgments 
that proved stable for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we'll see soon another instance in which there  
was such highly focused polling activity on such a limited set of 
topics,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Assault on Jockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A man who ran in front of horses charging down  
the stretch at Pimlico Race Course told police he was trying to 
commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to kill myself,'' Lee Ferrell said, according to  
a report filed by arresting officer Timothy Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell, of Bel Air, is charged with first-degree assault,  
trespassing, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, resisting 
arrest and alcohol-related offenses, for his actions Saturday 
during a race preceding the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ferrell also stated this isn't the first time he tried to  
commit suicide, and is currently on medication, Paxol and 
Depakote,'' the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are antidepressants.  
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell used a closed fist to strike jockey Jorge Chavez,  
hitting him on his back, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell was released from Baltimore's central booking facility  
after posting a $2,500 bond. Court officials said Ferrell was not 
released on his own recognizance because he told them he was on 
probation for driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge onto the track occurred several hundred yards from  
the finish line during the seventh race Saturday, about 2 1/2 hours 
before Charismatic added a Preakness victory to his win in the 
Kentucky Derby. He goes for the Triple Crown on June 5 in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell made his way to the track from the infield, went over a  
fence separating the fans from the turf course, staggered to the 
inside rail, which he pounded with his fist before ducking under 
it, and walked onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
	As the horses approached, he stood with his fists clenched and  
arms upraised. As the horses charged by on both sides, Ferrell 
could be seen in videotape replays apparently punching at two 
horses.

<HEADLINE> Clintons May Visit Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary and Chelsea Clinton may visit Israel  
and Jordan soon, making up for a trip that was postponed because of 
Israel's elections and mourning after the death of King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady are expected to visit both countries in  
the next few days to look at places she might visit, press 
secretary Marsha Berry said. Reports in Israel said the trip was 
planned for the second half of June. 
</P>

	The visit would be a followup to a 12-day journey through Egypt,  
Morocco and Tunisia in March. That trip was to have included stops 
in Israel and Jordan, partly to balance Arab interests with 
attention to the special U.S.-Israeli relationship. But Mrs. 
Clinton said then that diplomatic sensitivities to the Israeli 
elections and mourning over Hussein forced postponement of both 
visits.

<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Miguel Cairo, sidelined  
since April 23 with a strained right hamstring, was activated from 
the 15-day disabled list on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The second baseman was hitting .295 and had appeared in a  
franchise-best 53 consecutive games being injured in the fourth 
inning of a game against the Seattle Mariners. He played three 
games for Double-A Orlando in a rehab assignment before returning 
to the Devil Rays for Monday night's game at Texas.

<P>
	To make room for Cairo, infielder Bobby Smith was optioned to  
Triple-A Durham. He was batting .151 with two homers and four RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Makah Tribal Hunters Take Whale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- As fellow members of the tribe watched on  
live TV, Makah Indians in a hand-carved canoe harpooned a gray 
whale Monday for the first time in 70 years, renewing an ancient 
tradition that defines their culture. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger fishing boat joined the hunters and began slowly towing  
the carcass to Neah Bay, where the 2,000-member tribe declared a 
holiday and planned to cut the whale up and share its meat and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Makah Maiden restaurant in Neah Bay, the breakfast crowd,  
nearly all tribal members, stared transfixed as the hunt was 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike went in and everybody roared in applause, rejoicing  
of their voices all in unity,'' said Joddie Johnson, owner of the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists decried the killing, which was accomplished  
through a combination of the traditional -- the cedar canoe and its 
hand-carved paddles -- and the modern, including .50-caliber rifles 
and motorized boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very upset that the Makah went ahead with  
killing an innocent, sentient creature in such a bloody and 
untraditional way,'' said Jake Conroy of the anti-whaling group Sea 
Defense Alliance. ``We find it very hurtful and despicable that 
they did destroy that whale's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries, the Makahs hunted the huge gray whales that  
migrate along the Pacific Coast between Alaska and the Gulf of 
Mexico. The tribe stopped hunting in the 1920s, after the grays 
were decimated by commercial whaling. 
</P>
<P>
	Whaling still looms large in Makah culture, with images of the  
animal emblazoned on the high school and the backdrop used for 
traditional dances. 
</P>
<P>
	So after gray whales were taken off the Endangered Species List  
in 1994, the tribe sought to resume whale hunts to preserve their 
culture on their remote reservation. They won international 
permission to kill 20 whales through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until last fall, however, no living Makahs had ever even been  
on a whale hunt. Few had ever tasted whale meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's hunt climaxed months of training by the canoe's crew  
and tense confrontations with anti-whaling protesters. On Saturday, 
a small flotilla of protest boats disrupted a hunt, but 
demonstrators did not arrive on the scene Monday until about an 
hour after the whalers struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Paddling rapidly, the seven-man Makah crew stalked the whale  
under gray and misty skies about an eighth of a mile off shore, 
steering the canoe's long, narrow bow directly above the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour after dawn, blood stained the choppy waters of the  
Pacific as the hunters repeatedly harpooned the huge mammal. The 
whale, which appeared to be at least as long as the 32-foot canoe, 
thrashed once and dived, dragging the boat in a wide circle. 
</P>
<P>
	The whale resurfaced minutes later. Support crews in motorized  
boats moved in with rifles and shot the whale point-blank at least 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Whalers aboard the canoe and a support boat struck it twice more  
with harpoons, all within 10 minutes of the initial hit. 
</P>
<P>
	When pictures shot from TV news helicopters showed the hunting  
crew's success, Makahs gathered at the community center in the 
village of Neah Bay, eight miles north of the hunting grounds, to 
sing and celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no words that can express what's inside,'' Ms. Johnson  
said. ``Very full of pride, honor, respect of the whale for the 
warriors and the warriors' respect for the greatness of the 
whale.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Agent Admits Firing at Raft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A Border Patrol agent admitted firing a pellet  
gun at a rubber raft carrying three illegal immigrants across a 
canal, dumping them into the water, according to an internal agency 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two were seen back on shore early Friday. The third person  
could have returned to Mexico or sneaked into the United States, 
but may also have drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``significant incident report'' obtained by The Associated  
Press contained a brief outline of the incident near Calexico, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent, who was not identified, fired three times and then  
threw the gun into the New River in an attempt to ``conceal this 
act,'' the report said. The agent has been placed on administrative 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came from a woman who was caught Friday trying to  
cross into the United States. She told authorities she saw an agent 
fire a pellet gun at the raft, which flipped when the three 
passengers shifted. She said two made it to the concrete bank of 
the irrigation canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Vargas, Mexico's consul for the region, said the Border  
Patrol sector chief, Tom Wacker, told her that the agent admitted 
firing the pellet gun at the raft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board Patrol referred all inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's  
office, which declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people have drowned so far this year trying to cross the  
canal, a heavily used route for illegal immigrants. U.S. officials 
have installed bright, stadium-style lights and motion detectors at 
several sections of the waterway to discourage crossings.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Rises 17.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 17.6  
percent in fiscal year 1998 to a record high total, the Finance 
Ministry announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus -- Japan's broadest measure of trade  
-- climbed to a non-seasonally adjusted $124 billion for the 12 
months to March 31, the ministry said. The previous record was $123 
billion set in fiscal 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the surplus fell 25.5 percent to $8.76 billion from  
the same month last year, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure for the last month of the fiscal year was  
considerably lower than the $12.7 billion estimate from Tokyo-based 
economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports dropped 4.5 percent to $389 billion last year despite  
the stronger dollar. A fall in exports to Asia offset rises in 
shipments to the United States and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports tumbled 12.9 percent to $258 billion as imports from all  
three regions declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry official repeated the government's usual stance  
that Japan's current account surplus was unlikely to grow at a high 
pace in coming months -- comments analysts echoed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drop in imports tells something about the weak domestic  
demand, particularly private demand,'' said Matthew Poggi, 
economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	But with recent government measures helping to boost  
construction activity and housing demand, the current account 
surplus will likely shrink slightly this fiscal year, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the economy in slightly better shape this year than  
last year,'' Poggi said. Partly as a result of improved domestic 
demand, the current account surplus is likely to shrink to around 
$118 billion in the current fiscal year ending March 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account, which measures trade in merchandise,  
services, tourism and investment, is calculated by determining the 
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against 
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Japan announced that its current account  
surplus for calendar 1998 surged 38.7 percent to an unprecedented 
$133.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Overturning NAFTA Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The Clinton administration asked a  
federal judge Monday to throw out a union-backed lawsuit 
challenging the North American Free Trade Agreement as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A government lawyer said no court has ever required a president  
to withdraw from a pact like NAFTA, which critics blame for the 
loss of 400,000 American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under international law we are not allowed to say, 'Sorry,  
Mexico. Sorry, Canada, we didn't do this right,'' Justice 
Department attorney Martha Rubio argued during a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeremiah Collins, representing the United Steelworkers of  
America, said the trade deal was approved by too small a majority 
in Congress five years ago and has since become a ``gigantic 
millstone'' for U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got thousands of people who are hurt by NAFTA,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Propst issued no immediate decision  
on the lawsuit, filed in Birmingham because hundreds of Alabama 
steelworkers blame job losses on NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers approved NAFTA at the urging of President Clinton in  
1993, reducing tariffs and lowering regulatory hurdles with the 
goal of increasing trade between the United States, Mexico and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends the deal has been a success, citing  
increased U.S. exports and improved relations between the United 
States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents say NAFTA has drained jobs from the United States  
by encouraging companies to relocate to Mexico, hire low-paid 
workers and import goods back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The crux of the lawsuit centers on whether NAFTA is a trade  
agreement -- as the administration contends -- or a treaty, as the 
United Steelworkers of America argues. 
</P>
<P>
	Both houses of Congress approved NAFTA on simple majority votes  
in 1993, indicating it was a trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawsuit contends NAFTA is really a treaty and should  
have been subject to a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, as 
required by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed last year by the Washington-based Made in the  
USA Foundation and Local 12 of the United Steelworkers of America 
in Gadsden, where some 1,300 members will be idled by the closing 
of a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. plant this year.

	Dow Falls 59.85 to 10,853.47  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today as  
traders cautiously placed some last-minute bets before Tuesday's 
meeting of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones industrial average 
was down 59.85 at 10,853.47. The index had fallen as much as 167 
points earlier in the session as traders extended Friday's broad 
selloff, responding to a steeper-than-expected increase in the 
consumer price index that fed worries about rising inflation. The 
report prompted speculation that the Fed will at least consider an 
interest rate hike when its Open Market Committee meets Tuesday. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE 1,997-1,067. The 
Nasdaq composite index rose 17.58 to 2,545.44.

	Fed Might Raise Interest Rates Soon  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (P) -- Americans, who have grown accustomed to nothing  
but good news on inflation, got a jolt last week when consumer 
prices jumped by the largest amount in nearly nine years, led by a 
sharp increase in gasoline prices. That development will be on the 
table when Federal Reserve policy-makers meet Tuesday, but private 
economists believe it will take more than one bad number to prompt

88 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30. It earned 
$685 million, or 65 cents a share in the same period of last year.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com both plan to

sales and market share rather than immediate profits. ``This is not 
a sale, this is not a promotion -- this is everyday low pricing,'' 
said Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The 
move will have little impact on Barnesandnoble's bottom line, chief 
executive Jonathan Bulkeley said. Boyd said the Times bestseller 
list accounted for ``less than 3 percent of overall revenues'' at

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blocked last year by President Clinton,  
Republicans are trying again to give tax breaks to parents who send 
their children to private schools or teach at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a similar bill in 1998 amid strong opposition by  
Democrat-aligned teacher unions. This year, Republicans added 
sweeteners such as tax incentives to finance school construction 
that appeal to Democrats and could help the GOP override a 
potential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, called the bill ``a first but important step'' in making 
education more affordable for all students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal is a down payment on education assistance for  
our nation's students and their families,'' Roth said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, scheduled for a vote Wednesday in the Finance  
Committee, would cost $7.6 billion over 10 years, according to a 
preliminary congressional analysis. It would be paid for by $7.9 
billion in new revenues, mainly from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the measure would raise the annual  
contribution limit on education IRAs, now used only for higher 
education, from $500 to $2,000. For the first time, the money could 
be withdrawn tax-free to pay expenses for kindergarten through 12th 
grade pupils who attend public, private or parochial schools or who 
are taught at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualified expenses would include tuition, fees, books, supplies,  
computer software and required uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Like under current law, the contribution limit would be phased  
out for individuals earning more than $95,000 in adjusted gross 
income and $150,000 for joint income tax filers. 
</P>
<P>
	When he vetoed a similar measure last year, Clinton said the  
money could be used better for public school construction and 
contended the GOP bill would primarily benefit the wealthy. The 
National Education Association, which led last year's opposition, 
said little has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad tax policy and it's bad education policy,'' said Mary  
Elizabeth Teasley, NEA legislative affairs director. ``It's a 
disguise for a private school voucher for the wealthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had no comment on the bill Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are optimistic, however, that they can gain  
significant Democratic support. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is 
the main co-sponsor of the education IRA bill, and several other 
items supported by Democrats were included. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are public school construction components introduced  
by Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. The components would 
relax certain revenue bond rules and add schools to the list of 
projects that can be paid for with tax-exempt private activity 
bonds, which have an annual limit of $10 per resident or at least 
$5 million per state. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow tax-free distributions from state-sponsored  
and private prepaid college tuition plans, costing $925 million 
over 10 years. It would also extend the tax-free treatment of 
college-level educational assistance provided by an employer, a 
break now scheduled to expire in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Web Bookstores Discount Bestsellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Buying best sellers over the Internet just got a  
good deal cheaper. For some bookstores, the squeeze has tightened. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not immediately clear what the effect on the retail book  
business will be from a 50 percent discount offered by the nation's 
three leading online book sellers on books listed on The New York 
Times best seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the online sellers, it clearly was the start of a price  
war intended to lure more consumers in hopes of enticing them to 
buy other more lucrative products as they browse through the Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com of Seattle, the Internet book selling pioneer and  
largest Web-based book business, led the way and was quickly 
matched by No. 2 Barnesandnoble.com of New York and No. 3 
Borders.com of Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The discounts, previously as much as 40 percent, apply to  
paperback as well as hardcover books on the weekly list of at least 
68 titles. The deep discounts will mean the companies will make 
little or no profit on the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Ryan of Prudential Securities in New York said the bigger  
price cuts ``are clearly intended to drive traffic to their (Web) 
sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher E. Vroom, an electronic commerce analyst at Thomas  
Weisel Partners in San Francisco, agreed that the move seemed 
largely a marketing tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they make any margin whatsoever, it's going to be a very  
tiny one,'' Vroom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble vice president Ben Boyd said the Times best  
seller list accounted for ``less than 3 percent of 
(Barnesandnoble.com's) overall revenues.'' For Borders, the figure 
is about 5 percent, spokesman Rich Fahle said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, chain bookstores in malls and general-purpose  
independent book retailers rely on best sellers for 30 percent to 
35 percent of their business, Vroom said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will increase the pressure on smaller book  
sellers and result in further consolidation in the industry,'' 
Vroom said. ``Book sellers that have carved a particular niche in 
the marketplace will continue to prosper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said the discounts would put further pressure on ``less  
efficient book sellers'' but added that it was too early to 
determine the impact on the retail book business overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will have little impact on Barnesandnoble's bottom  
line, chief executive Jonathan Bulkeley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At our existing sales volume, the additional discount on best  
sellers will have a minor effect on our operating margin,'' 
Bulkeley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two large independents, Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., and  
Elliott Bay Book Co. in Seattle, said they expected little effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Powell's extensive used, antique and rare book  
collections, ``we don't feel like we're competing directly with 
those (online) stores,'' said Dave Weich, who manages the store's 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online, we're not really a destination for somebody who wants  
to buy a big new best seller,'' Weich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even have a New York Times best seller display in our  
store,'' Elliott Bay manager Tracy Taylor said. ``Our customers 
don't particularly come in looking for those titles ... it's just 
never been that kind of a store.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Maps Cuts in Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bills covering education, environment and  
other traditional Democratic priorities face billions of dollars in 
cuts next year under emerging Republican plans. The proposals 
signal bitter clashes ahead within Congress and between lawmakers 
and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring tight spending limits agreed to in the 1997  
budget-balancing deal, the House Appropriations Committee plans to 
decide this week how it would divide $538 billion among 13 bills 
covering all government agencies. That represents almost a third of 
the entire federal budget, including everything but automatic 
payments like Medicare benefits and interest to bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's blueprint, obtained by The Associated Press,  
shows that the appropriations committee plans to use $78.1 billion 
for the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services departments 
-- $10.7 billion less than this year. That measure is home to 
schools, job training and other programs that produce annual 
battles between Democrats and Republicans, and the proposed cut 
assures a nasty partisan fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other three, large domestic spending bills, the committee  
would spend $30.5 billion for the Commerce, Justice and State 
departments, which is $2.8 billion less than this year; $11.3 
billion for the Interior Department, or $2.7 billion less; and 
$66.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban 
Development departments, the Environmental Protection Agency and 
other agencies, which is $5.8 billion below this year's level. 
</P>
<P>
	These committee figures do not include additional billions in  
so-called emergency spending enacted this year -- money that does 
not count against spending limits. Even with that extra money, 
however, the fiscal 2000 bills come up short compared to this year, 
and even shorter compared to the amounts Clinton would like to 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts appear so deep that it is unclear whether bills at such  
low levels can even pass the GOP-controlled Congress, let alone get 
signed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early reports about the Republican plan suggest their 2000  
budget is simply not tenable,'' said Sylvia Mathews, the White 
House deputy budget director. ``The level of cuts it would require 
would do enormous harm to critical areas that Americans care deeply 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed spending billions more than Republicans on  
domestic programs, and would pay for them, in part, by raising 
taxes on tobacco and other items -- increases that Congress is 
likely to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether his bill would pass the House, Rep. Ralph  
Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the committee's interior subcommittee, 
said: ``I think it will be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the strategy for passing the appropriations  
bills, Regula said: ``I haven't heard of one yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other, smaller domestic spending bills have just  
minor differences between GOP plans for 2000 and actual totals from 
the c/urrent year. Several of them could become law with relatively 
little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one indicator of the pressure on Republicans to exceed  
spending limits, a bill approved Friday by the appropriations 
panel's Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee totaled $13.7 billion 
-- more than $140 million above the amount leaders plan for that 
subcommittee to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the budget-balancing deal, an escalating, annual series of  
savings were planned in an effort to eliminate what looked like a 
parade of unending federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of this year, many Democrats and some  
Republicans have said this year's spending limit will have to be 
breached because the required savings are too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders have continued to insist publicly that  
the so-called spending caps must be obeyed. The Senate's spending 
plans are similar to the House's, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should stay within the caps,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief interview. ``We knew the 
caps would pinch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To spend beyond those limits means using the federal surplus,  
and that would mean spending Social Security surpluses Republicans 
have promised to not spend or leaving less money available to pay 
for the tax cut. Cutting taxes and protecting Social Security are 
both major GOP priorities, and jeopardizing either would outrage 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how Republicans plan to move all 13 annual  
spending bills through Congress, and do so without prompting a veto 
fight with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides said their strategy calls for spending weeks this  
summer focusing on the message that Republicans are honoring 
spending limits to protect Social Security and tax cuts. The goal 
is to identify the GOP with those goals, and to ensure that in the 
likelihood that the spending caps are broken, that Clinton and 
congressional Democrats are to blame.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures moved modestly higher  
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as wet weather continued to 
delay spring plantings. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said wheat and corn in particular were  
poised to move sharply higher if wet weather persists in Midwest 
growing regions. Farmers typically have a limited window for 
planting those crops, and time is rapidly running out. Still, the 
government in its weekly updates has reported that dry periods 
between recent storms have given farmers ample time to continue 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading had ended, the National Weather Service also  
predicted normal to below-normal precipitation over the next 10 
days in major Midwestern growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans moved higher in step with corn, although some market  
participants worried that any planting delays for corn and wheat 
would lead to increased soybean acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.62 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 2 cents to $2.23 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.22 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 1/2 cents to $4.70 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures fell sharply amid weak cash market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .25 cent to 62.15 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .25 cents to 73.92 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .90 cent to 57.97 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.55 
cents to 54.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson's Slave Kin Shunned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The meeting marked the first time  
descendants of Thomas Jefferson's alleged mistress were invited to 
a Jefferson family reunion. And typical of a gathering that unites 
long-lost cousins, pent up emotions rose to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every family has an in-group and an out-group, and a  
reconciliation that has to take place,'' said Mary Jefferson, a 
descendant of Sally Hemings, one of President Jefferson's slaves 
and his reputed lover. 
</P>
<P>
	The in-group at the weekend reunion were descendants of Thomas  
and Martha Jefferson, and they declined during a family business 
meeting Sunday to let relatives of Hemings officially join the 
family's 86-year-old Monticello Association. 
</P>
<P>
	They also blocked a vote to offer Hemings' descendants -- some  
three dozen of whom attended the event at Monticello, Jefferson's 
plantation home -- honorary membership while a paternity claim is 
researched. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, however, did appoint a committee to conduct  
more research into the paternity issue and allowed Hemings' 
descendants inside the hotel ballroom for the membership debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, the nation's third president, was accused publicly  
while in office of being the father of several of Hemings' children 
after his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Hemings' family have passed down the paternity claim  
through the generations. In November, a DNA study concluded that 
Jefferson was likely the father of Eston Hemings, the slave's 
youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
	Descendants from both families said the reunion was mostly  
productive, although combative at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is looking to this family for leadership in healing  
some of the wounds of slavery and segregation, and I thought today 
we took a good first step toward doing that,'' said Monticello 
Association member Marla Randolph Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	But before dessert was finished on Sunday, a Monticello  
Association member made a motion to ask the Hemings guests to leave 
the room during a discussion of ``family business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It got a little tense,'' Hemings descendant Bill Dalton of  
Chillicothe, Ohio, said afterward. The media was not allowed to 
attend any of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Treena Woodson, a Hemings descendant from Philadelphia, said the  
acrimonious tone of the arguments hurt her feelings. ``It was kind 
of painful to hear that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemings descendant John Taylor King said ``there were little  
angry knots of people'' in the crowd. But he said the 30-23 vote to 
let the Hemings group stay restored his faith in the ``good 
intentions'' of the Jefferson descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said the crowd of about 250 erupted into applause when  
the vote was announced. ``That's when I felt warm and welcomed,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucian Truscott of Los Angeles, the Jefferson descendant who  
first invited the Hemingses, told reporters after the meeting that 
there was ``an element of racism'' in the arguments to deny 
immediate membership. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jefferson descendant Theresa Shackelford of Nashville,  
Tenn., who wants the paternity claim to be researched further, 
disputed that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for any lineal descendant to be able to be buried at  
Monticello, black, white or purple,'' Ms. Shackelford said. ``We're 
not racists. We're snobs.''

<HEADLINE> MiningCo.com Grows to About.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Internet guide MiningCo.com Inc. plans to  
switch its name to About.com in an attempt to change its image from 
an entry point onto the Internet to a destination 
</P>
<P>
	About.com uses a staff of Internet searchers to compile guides  
on 650 topics. With the name change, the topics will be given names 
such as About Europe, About Dermatology, etc. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers use portals -- entry points for users to venture onto  
the Internet -- to help them to find a wealth of online services 
such as free e-mail, news, chat and personalized functions like 
stock quotes, local weather and sports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, About.com seeks to become a destination point for  
Internet users rather than just a portal, officials said. As such, 
the company has launched a membership program through which users 
can create their own ``AboutMe'' page that describes their 
interests and allows them to connect with others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the About.com name is a simpler way to highlight to  
our expanding audience, the personal and relevant Internet 
experience our members have enjoyed so much,'' said Scott Kurnit, 
chairman and CEO. About. com will aid consumers who ``demand 
topic-specific destinations that combine search, community and 
original content,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Three of the movies vying for the Golden  
Palm award at this year's Cannes Film Festival are based on 
prize-winning books -- but only one seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian director Atom Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,'' a  
suspenseful, macabre tale of a lonely bachelor who befriends 
wayward girls, is based on William Trevor's 1988 Whitbread 
Prize-winning novel by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	This fresh take on the traditional serial killer -- no blood, no  
detective tracking the criminal -- won enthusiastic praise at 
Monday's screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Egoyan said he took liberties with the original text,  
transforming the character of a socialite mother into a glamorous, 
celebrity TV chef who humiliates her fat son on camera, stuffing 
him with raw liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only violence in this film is emotional, and it begets a  
monster,'' Egoyan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' Mexican director Arturo  
Ripstein's adaptation of the novella by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, won 
praise from the Nobel Prize-winner but many viewers Monday found it 
slow-moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour film set in Mexico in the 1950s portrays an elderly  
retired colonel and his wife waiting, in vain, for the colonel's 
long-promised military pension to come in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Their only son has died in murky circumstances, and their only  
joy is a cockfighting bird they hope will save them from 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia Marquez, who attended film school in Rome before becoming  
a novelist, praised Ripstein's effort, saying in a letter read to 
reporters: ``It's a great film ... and does justice to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripstein said he had wanted to adapt the novella since he was 21  
years old. ``Marquez said `I'll give it to you when you learn,' and 
I waited 33 years,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Chilean director Raoul Ruiz's adaptation of  
Marcel Proust's epic ``Le Temps Retrouve'' (Time Regained) had more 
than one critic napping -- despite an all-star cast featuring 
Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Beart and John Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Set around World War I and structured as a series of vaguely  
linked vignettes weaving past to present, it fails to capture the 
rich, analytic texture of Proust's descriptive prose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proust is a director himself, with a vision of things that  
makes you want to adapt it to the screen,'' Ruiz told reporters. 
``The difficulties aren't insurmountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Proust has frustrated generations of filmmakers. Orson  
Welles, Luchino Visconti and Joseph Losey tried but gave up. Volker 
Schlondorff's ``Swann's Way'' was a critical flop.

<HEADLINE> CVS Buys Online Pharmacy Soma.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Combining a virtual drug store with its  
real-world counterpart, pharmacy chain CVS Corp. announced Monday 
it is buying online drug retailer Soma.com for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The move accelerates CVS' fledgling effort to sell drugs over  
the Internet, a concept that experts predict could take off the way 
Amazon.com has transformed the book selling business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the relatively low selling price raised doubts about the  
long-term survival prospects of the handful of remaining online 
pharmacies. It also raised the specter of similar mergers, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soma.com gives CVS a major presence on the Internet, a warehouse  
distribution system, and the ability to sell drugs even in areas of 
the country where CVS has no stores. CVS has 4,122 stores, more 
than any other pharmacy chain. Most of its stores are east of the 
Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Woonsocket R.I.-based CVS provides Soma.com with instant name  
recognition and contracts to sell to members of many major health 
insurers. CVS officials say they have not decided whether to retain 
the Soma.com web site, its CVS.com or use another name. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Soma.com in January became the first Internet  
company to launch an online pharmacy. But analysts say the company 
was hampered by few health insurance contracts, which greatly 
limited the number of potential customers that could shop on its 
Web site. Additionally, because Soma.com could only fill orders for 
overnight delivery, it was of little use for patients who wanted 
their medications immediately after leaving the hospital or 
doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending federal antitrust approval, the deal should be completed  
in June, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``CVS plus Soma.com is a powerful combination,'' said Mark  
Husson, a Merrill Lynch analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the low price shows that online pharmacies have some  
inherent problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either CVS negotiated the most amazing deal ... or stand alone  
on-line pharmacies don't have the value some first thought,'' 
Husson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The .coms were supposed to be a major threat to bricks and  
mortar pharmacies, but today we've seen one decide to sell itself 
for a surprisingly small amount of money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soma.com has been competing with other privately-held online  
pharmacies Drugstore.com and PlanetRX Inc. and RX.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither CVS nor privately-held Soma.com would disclose how many  
customers Soma.com has. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, CVS announced plans to enhance its Internet site. The  
company quickly figured buying Soma.com would give it a head start 
over its traditional rivals, said Tom Ryan, CVS chairman and chief 
executive officer. Walgreen, the nation's largest pharmacy chain by 
revenue, and No. 3 Rite Aid are also improving their Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	CVS has no plans to actively persuade its customers to buy drug  
online, but will make sure consumer are aware they have the option, 
Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, shares of CVS rose 62 1/2 cents to $46.12 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Arrest Made in Picasso Slashing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch police questioned a mental  
patient today after he escaped from a psychiatric clinic, hopped a 
train to Amsterdam and severely slashed a famous Picasso painting 
in one of the capital's most prestigious art museums. 
</P>
<P>
	The virtual destruction of ``Woman Nude Before Garden,'' a 1956  
oil on canvas by the abstract master, stunned the art world and the 
Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, where another mentally disturbed 
man slashed a work by American abstract impressionist Barnett 
Newman in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is very shocked. I find it horrible what happened,  
and I can't believe it has happened again,'' said Saskia Bruines, 
Amsterdam's city councilor for culture. ``We must step up security. 
We must ask ourselves what we could be doing that we haven't 
already done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Picasso, valued at between $5 million and $7.5 million, was  
slashed Sunday afternoon by a mental patient identified by Dutch 
police only as Paul G. The museum, which is insured for the damage, 
said restoration experts would try their best to repair the 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Amsterdam police spokesman Cees Rameau said the 41-year-old man  
had escaped earlier in the day from a psychiatric clinic in 
Utrecht, 45 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Officials said he was a 
top suspect in an incident at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum 10 years ago, 
in which someone threw paint at another unidentified masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The man has been under the supervision of the clinic since 1978,  
when he tried to hijack a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet from 
Amsterdam to Madrid using a toy gun. Passengers and crew members 
overpowered him and he was arrested and convicted on assault 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rameau said the man headed straight for the Stedelijk Museum,  
which has a world-class collection of modern art including five 
other Picassos, bought a ticket, went to the Picasso and used a 
small razor knife to carve a large circle out of the middle of the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	He then went to the headquarters of Dutch daily newspaper De  
Telegraaf, where he boasted of his crime to a reporter. The 
newspaper called police, and the man was arrested in the lobby, 
where he allegedly threatened to kill the journalist in question, 
De Telegraaf reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stedelijk Museum bought ``Woman Nude Before Garden'' in 1981  
for $950,000. The 51-inch by 64-inch painting, done in cool hues of 
blue and green, depicts a naked woman reclining in a chair in front 
of an open window with a lush garden in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	The model for the painting, which was done in Cannes, France,  
was Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's newlywed wife at the time.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Change Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An alternative law must be crafted to replace  
the Independent Counsel Act, former Senate majority leaders Bob 
Dole and George Mitchell said in a New York Times opinion piece 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying purpose of the law remains a vital one: to make  
sure allegations of criminal wrongdoing by high-ranking government 
officials are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted, Dole and 
Mitchell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to find a system that accomplishes that aim while  
retaining both the independence and the accountability of 
investigators,'' they wrote in the article published on the Times' 
op-ed page. 
</P>
<P>
	The law expires next month, and Dole and Mitchell said it is  
obvious Congress will not renew it. The law has come under 
criticism because of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's lengthy and 
divisive investigation into President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, a Republican who opposed the last reauthorization of the  
law, and Mitchell, a Democrat who supported it, said they convened 
a bipartisan group to study the act. 
</P>
<P>
	The group considered the 20 investigations since the law was  
created in 1978 after the Watergate scandal, and also looked at the 
way accusations of governmental wrongdoing were handled before the 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	Their four main recommendations, which are to be detailed in a  
report to be issued Tuesday, are: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Let the Justice Department do its job. The agency's regular  
offices could have handled some matters assigned to independent 
counsels, Dole and Mitchell wrote, without specifying which 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Return the full authority to appoint special counsels to U.S.  
attorneys general. ``If an attorney general refuses to appoint a 
special counsel when the circumstances justify one, the ultimate 
remedy is the political process ...,'' the two wrote. ``There is no 
substitute for an informed public whose electoral judgment is the 
most effective check on the abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Make attorneys general establish rules for special counsels,  
guaranteeing their independence, making clear the scope of 
investigations and restricting the ability of attorneys general or 
presidents to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Make regulations that strike a balance between special  
prosecutors' independence from political pressures and their 
accountability. They suggested giving special prosecutors periodic 
deadlines -- perhaps after the first two years of a probe and then 
once a year after that -- when an attorney general will decide 
whether to continue an investigation or bring it to an end. Starr's 
inquiry has stretched over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the decision is to end an investigation, the reasons should  
be reported to Congress, so that the attorney general is publicly 
accountable for that critical decision,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Welfare Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today ruled states cannot  
pay lower welfare benefits to new residents than to longtime 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' 7-2 decision said California's limit on benefits  
for new residents violates the constitutional right to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the  
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,'' 
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. ``The states, 
however, do not have any right to select their citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said, ``The state's legitimate interest in saving money  
provides no justification for its decision to discriminate among 
equally eligible citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to judge the validity of a federal law that closes state  
motor vehicle records to the public. The justices will use a 
dispute from South Carolina to decide, sometime in 2000, whether 
Congress unlawfully usurped state governments' authority when it 
enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Made it harder for federal judges to strike down election  
districts as products of unlawful racial gerrymandering. The 
unanimous ruling in a North Carolina case could have great 
influence on redistricting disputes nationwide after the 2000 
census. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact a million-dollar libel award against the tabloid  
newspaper Globe for repeating a book's claim that a California man, 
not Sirhan Sirhan, killed Robert F. Kennedy. The justices, without 
comment, let stand a ruling by California's highest court that the 
news media can be liable for repeating someone else's libelous 
statement about a private figure. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said police do not need a warrant to seize someone's car from a  
public place under laws requiring forfeiture of property linked to 
crime. The 7-2 ruling reinstated a Florida man's drug conviction 
based on the crack cocaine police found in his car after seizing it 
without a warrant. Police said the man's car was subject to 
forfeiture because it had been used to deliver drugs several months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	California's welfare policy would have given people who lived in  
the state for less than a year only the amount of welfare they 
would have received in their previous home state. Fourteen other 
states have similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal welfare overhaul enacted by Congress in 1996  
specifically allowed states to temporarily provide lower benefits 
for new residents. But the justices said today Congress cannot 
authorize states to enact policies that violate the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	California lawmakers enacted the lower benefit to save money and  
eliminate an incentive people might have to move in-state to get a 
higher welfare check. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a family of four in California ordinarily would get  
$673 a month, while a family who moved into the state from 
Mississippi within the past year would get only $144. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare recipients challenged the law, saying the limit on  
benefits -- coupled with California's high cost of living -- could 
deprive them of the basic necessities of life. Lower courts put the 
law on hold, saying the state could not treat new and longtime 
residents differently. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, the Supreme Court invoked the constitutional right to  
travel as it struck down state laws that required one year of 
residency in that state to receive any welfare benefits at all. 
</P>
<P>
	During arguments last January, California's lawyers told the  
justices that reducing benefits for a year would not violate new 
residents' right to travel. New residents would not be much worse 
off because they still would be eligible for other welfare programs 
such as job training and child care, the state's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who challenged the California law said they moved into the  
state to pursue employment, not welfare benefits. One woman who 
moved from Oklahoma said she would not be able to afford housing if 
her benefits were be limited to Oklahoma's level of $307 for a 
family of three, instead of $565 for longer-term California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge put the welfare limit on hold. The 9th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, deciding California could not 
justify limiting new residents' welfare benefits by saying they 
would have received the same amount in their previous state. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 federal welfare law allows the states to enact  
dramatically different public-assistance policies. Congress decided 
to let states pay lower benefits to new residents for fear the new 
system otherwise might lead states with higher benefits to become 
magnets for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also worried that other states might ``race to the  
bottom'' by cutting benefits to push people away. So far there is 
little evidence that states with higher benefits have attracted 
large numbers of welfare migrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens wrote that while it may be reasonable to assume some  
people might move to a state to receive higher welfare benefits, 
``the empirical evidence ... indicates that the number of such 
persons is quite small -- surely not large enough to justify a 
burden on those who had no such motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,  
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice  
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the two, Rehnquist called the California law a  
``reasonable measure falling under the head of a 'good-faith 
residency requirement.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with different welfare benefits for newcomers  
include Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Several of those laws 
have been challenged in court and have been barred from taking 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Saenz vs. Roe, 98-97.

<HEADLINE> High School Star Heads for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PICAYUNE, Miss. (AP) -- Picayune High center Jonathan Bender, who  
broke Michael Jordan's record with 31 points in the McDonald's 
All-America game, has declared for the June 30 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	By beating a midnight Sunday deadline to make his intention  
known to the league, the 6-foot-11 Bender backed out of a national 
letter of intent that he signed with Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 players have declared for early entry in the draft,  
with Bender the only high school player among the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been my dream to play in the NBA ever since I started  
playing ball,'' Bender said. ``I thought if I can get there faster 
this way, I'm going to take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and six blocked shots per  
game as a senior at Picayune. But it was his performance in the 
March 25 McDonald's game, where he broke Jordan's record, that 
enhanced his draft stature. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bender is a lottery selection as projected, and taken among  
the top 13 picks in the draft, he could make about $9 million his 
first three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaddeus Fouchier, Bender's summer-league team coach, said the  
youngster's draft position was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told that Jonathan is the only high school player who  
would go among the top eight to 10 picks in the draft,'' Fouchier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The underclassmen who have declared for the draft include Ron  
Artest of St. John's; William Avery, Elton Brand and Corey Maggette 
of Duke; Carl Boyd of California; Baron Davis of UCLA; Steve 
Francis of Maryland; Dion Glover of Georgia Tech; Richard Hamilton 
of Connecticut; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; Lamont Long of New 
Mexico; Jamaal Magliore of Kentucky; Shawn Marion of UNLV, and

<HEADLINE> Former Ark. Gov. Must Pay for Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, whose shady  
financial deals got caught up in the Whitewater investigation, was 
ordered today to pay $1 million for setting up a sham bankruptcy to 
avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, who pleaded guilty in February 1998, was also ordered  
placed on four years' probation for hiding the value of a cable TV 
business he sold in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that if the company's real value was known,  
Tucker and business partner William Marks would have been liable 
for an additional $2.9 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said he would appeal the sentence and order of  
restitution, which is to be paid to the federal government. Marks 
was also ordered to pay $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no tax loss to the government that I benefited  
from,'' Tucker said after sentencing, arguing that the government 
owed him federal income tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's business dealings came under scrutiny as part of the  
federal investigation into the Whitewater land deal, a failed 
development in which President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
were investors. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 18 months of home detention after being convicted of  
fraud and conspiracy with James and Susan McDougal, President 
Clinton's former business partners. Tucker had lied to arrange 
nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fighting to have that conviction overturned, saying a  
juror was biased against him. As part of his plea bargain in the 
cable case, prosecutors will not retry him if his initial 
conviction is thrown out.

<HEADLINE> Workers Strike at Navy Shipbuilder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) -- Hundreds of craftsmen refused Monday to  
cross machinists union pickets at Ingalls Shipbuilding in a dispute 
over the frequency of pay raises and bonuses at Mississippi's 
largest private employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls had no immediate comment on the strike's impact on  
production. Company spokesman Den Knecht said, however, that the 
11,500-employee shipyard would continue to operate regular shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists at Ingalls set up  
pickets Sunday morning when a 39-month contract with the shipyard 
expired. The pickets were up when the first shift reported Monday 
morning and most workers turned their cars around at the gates and 
headed home. 
</P>
<P>
	All but two of the 13 unions representing 8,000 Ingalls  
employees rejected the shipyard's latest contract proposal over the 
weekend, but only Local 1133 of the Machinists union voted to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metal Trades Council, which represents nine of the 11 unions  
that rejected the proposal, had offered to continue working on a 
day-to-day basis until a contract is worked out. But council 
leaders admitted that most workers were not expected to cross the 
picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls, a builder of Navy destroyers, is a division of Litton  
Industries, which controls a number of aerospace, defense and 
electronics businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Campbell, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York,  
said the strike was not likely to have a big impact on Litton 
earnings in the short-term ``just because you're talking about a 
part of a part of a company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we would have to revisit this if the striking union  
stays out a long time and if large portions of the non-striking 
unions'' continue to honor picket lines, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Litton dropped 12 1/2 cents to $62.75 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinist Clyde Stevens, who picketed outside Ingalls until  
midnight Sunday, said, ``It's going pretty good. I haven't seen 
anybody in crafts cross the line yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Burnett, who also walked the picket line, said machinists  
union members were prepared to maintain their protest around the 
clock until the strike issues are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the machinists local, also rejecting the proposal  
were Pascagoula Metal Trades Council AFL-CIO, which represents nine 
unions and about 6,500 workers, and International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers Local 733, representing 1,200 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While those unions have agreed to continue working under the  
present contract on a day-by-day basis, union members were told to 
honor a sanctioned strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so far behind in pay and cost of living,'' Stevens said,  
``we have to get the company's attention.''

nutrition said his agency is not endorsing the product or its 
claims. Instead, he said the FDA merely reviewed the testing done 
by McNeil and then sent a letter stating that the agency had no 
more questions about the safety of the product. The letter also 
said that the FDA ``is not aware of any scientific evidence that 
plant stanol esters would be harmful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency letter also said that the company would not violate  
FDA labeling rules if its claims the margarine contains an 
ingredient that ``helps promote healthy cholesterol levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rulis cautioned, however, that the FDA ``believes it would be  
both prudent and responsible for McNeil to continue to monitor, 
through scientific studies ... consumers' dietary exposure to plant 
stanol esters ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by McNeil claimed that its margarine product ``is a  
very desirable cholesterol-management tool for the U.S. 
population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The margarine containing the plant stanol ester was developed in  
Finland and has been sold there since 1995. McNeil bought the 
international marketing rights from the Finnish developer, The 
Raisio Group. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeil announced that the margarine will be sold in the United  
States under the brand name Benecol and should be stocked in 
grocery dairy cases by May 26. Two types of spreads will be 
offered: A regular with 45 calories and a light with 30 calories. A 
package containing 21 8-gram servings will retail for about $4.99, 
the firm's announcement said.

<HEADLINE> Makah Indians Kill Gray Whale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- For the first time in more than 70 years,  
Makah Indians seeking to re-establish their whale-hunting tradition 
harpooned and apparently killed a gray whale off the Pacific coast 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The whaling crew, in a traditional, hand-carved cedar canoe,  
struck the whale at 6:55 a.m. under gray and misty skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Support crews in motorized boats moved in with guns and fired at  
least two shots to try to make the kill as the wounded whale towed 
the canoe through choppy seas about one-eighth of a mile offshore 
near Point of the Arches. 
</P>
<P>
	The water turned red as the whalers then stuck the giant mammal  
with two more harpoons. 
</P>
<P>
	After the later strikes, the canoe was no longer being dragged,  
but the whale was not visible on the surface. A kill could not 
immediately be confirmed, but television pictures shot from 
helicopters showed crew members hauling on the harpoon lines and 
moving slowly toward shore. Large amounts of blood could be seen 
around the 32-foot canoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal members said they planned to beach the whale and cut it  
up, sharing the meat and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hunt climaxed months of training by the canoe's crew and  
tense confrontations with antiwhaling protesters. For centuries, 
the tribe at the tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula had hunted 
the huge grays that migrate along the Pacific Coast between Alaska 
and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very upset that the Makah went ahead with  
killing an innocent, sentient creature in such a bloody and 
untraditional way,'' said Jake Conroy of Sea Defense Alliance. ``We 
find if very hurtful and despicable that they did destroy that 
whale's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crew rested Sunday, a day after spending 10 1/2 hours paddling  
around the Pacific. They threw a harpoon twice Saturday, but the 
whales escaped apparently unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard seized three boats from whaling protesters  
Saturday. Protesters had vowed to maintain their presence, but no 
protesters interfered during this morning's hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the tradeoff -- boats for a whale -- is pretty fair,''  
Paul Watson, skipper of the Sirenian and head of the Sea Shepherd 
Conservation Society, had said earlier. ``I'm pretty sure they 
would have taken a whale if it wasn't for those small boats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Makah reservation at Neah Bay, about 8 miles north of the  
hunting grounds, the taking of the whale was greeted by many with a 
mix of reverence and jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just overwhelming,'' said Joddie Johnson, owner of the  
Makah Maiden restaurant in Neah Bay, where the morning breakfast 
crowd, nearly all tribal members, applauded as the hunt was 
broadcast live on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been telling people, there's no words that can express  
what's inside,'' she said. ``Very full of pride, honor ... respect 
of the whale for the warriors and the warriors' respect for the 
greatness of the whale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When grays were taken off the Endangered Species List in 1994,  
the tribe moved to resume whale hunts guaranteed under their 1855 
treaty. The usually placid marine mammal can grow up to 45 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe had stopped hunting in the 1920s, after gray-whale  
populations were decimated by commercial whaling. Tribal leaders 
decided to resume as a way to preserve their culture on their 
remote reservation here, at the northwest tip of the Lower 48 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government supported their bid before the International  
Whaling Commission. Under the plan, the tribe is not allowed to 
sell edible whale parts and can kill only five whales per year 
through 2004.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Classes Resume After Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Students streamed off school buses and  
parents dropped off their children at school today, but tensions 
were high after an alleged mass-murder plot and a bomb found near a 
middle school closed district schools Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Kenney brought her son, Jason, to Holland Woods Middle  
School, but said she would take him back home if he didn't feel 
safe. ``He's real scared. He was up worrying last night,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason said he was afraid he ``was going to get shot.''  
</P>
<P>
	All 21 schools reopened today with extra security in this city  
about 60 miles northeast of Detroit. Extra guards posted outside 
Holland Woods today searched students' backpacks before allowing 
them into the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed after the bomb was found Thursday by a  
custodian near Holland Woods Middle School. Police say it is 
unrelated to the arrests of four students on Wednesday and Thursday 
who were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Fontenot, 12, a sixth-grader at Holland Woods and her  
10-year-old sister, Heather, cried at Sunday's news conference. ``I 
feel uncomfortable going to that school,'' Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they should just end the school year and have  
that extra three weeks to figure out what they're going to do to 
safeguard our kids for next year,'' said Heidy Martindale, the 
mother of a 12-year-old girl at Holland Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Superintendent Tom Miller said social workers will  
meet with students. ``Our goal is to try to attempt to provide them 
with anything that they need so that we can get them back into a 
normal day and a normal conclusion of our school year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, both 14, were  
arrested, charged as adults with conspiracy to commit murder, and 
each was ordered held on $100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Two suspects age 12 and 13 were charged as adults in juvenile  
court with the same crime, St. Clair County Prosecutor Edmund Brown 
said today. Because they are under 14, they must go through the 
juvenile system. If convicted, they could be sentenced as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	A conviction could mean a life sentence in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	The two younger suspects are to appear Tuesday for a hearing in  
juvenile court, police Capt. Brian Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moeller would provide no details except to say the boys were not  
armed when arrested at their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the teens planned to top the April 20 death  
toll at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where teenage 
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In the Dallas suburb of Allen, Texas, school officials who  
last week said they were suspending the final two weeks of classes 
after repeated bomb threats said students would return later this 
week for staggered classes. Officials said Sunday that they only 
wanted to confuse those calling in the threats and weren't 
canceling the rest of the year outright. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of miscommunication,'' complained a  
parent, Scott Gleason. ``If they weren't really closing down, why 
the heck did they let this get publicized for two solid days?'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- In West Palm Beach, Fla., Saturday's prom at Palm Beach Lakes  
High School ended early when a nail-studded pipe bomb was found 
hidden inside an indoor tree planter by the hotel's ballroom 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police with bomb-sniffing dogs found nothing after a search of  
the high school today and classes began on schedule.

<HEADLINE> US Women's Soccer Team Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They're talented, they're tested and they're on a  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and Tiffeny Milbrett, all  
determined to win back the title they lost four years ago, lead the 
U.S. roster for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins June 19 at Giants Stadium, with the  
Americans playing Denmark, and concludes July 10 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make a statement to the world,'' coach Tony  
DiCicco said Monday after announcing the 20-player roster. ``The 
World Cup, in soccer, is the epitome. They want to be Olympic 
champions and World Cup champions at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is huge. But we are capable of accomplishing  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roster includes 13 of the 16 players from the team that won  
the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics. Hamm, Akers, Foudy, Carla 
Overbeck, Kristine Lilly and Joy Fawcett all will be playing in 
their third World Cup; six others will be playing in their second. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the first World Cup in 1991 and was  
eliminated in the semifinals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight players have been in 115 or more international games,  
including Lilly, whose 177 appearances is a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been there, for sure, is a huge plus,'' DiCicco said.  
``They know what to expect; they know what it's going to take. They 
know there are going to be some ups and downs in the tournament. 
They know physically the demand, because you can't duplicate the 
intensity of these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most noticeable absence from the roster is forward Debbie  
Keller, who claims she's being excluded because of a sexual 
harassment lawsuit she filed. Keller, whose 14 goals tied her for 
second on the U.S. team last year, is suing Anson Dorrance, the 
North Carolina and former U.S. coach, alleging he made uninvited 
sexual advances and harassed her during and after her college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time national player of the year wasn't an original  
invitee to the team's 26-player residency camp, but she later spent 
time with the team. Keller lost an arbitration hearing against U.S. 
Soccer last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invested a lot in Debbie last year, and she did very  
well,'' DiCicco said. ``But Cindy Parlow wasn't in the mix a lot 
last year, and Danielle Fotopoulos was still coming back from her 
knee injury. It just became a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debbie's still in the pool,'' DiCicco added. ``The landscape  
of this team is going to change, because in the next year or two 
there's going to be a lot of retirements. So she needs to keep 
herself in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long been the dominant team in women's  
soccer. It has 156-33-13 record, and 10-1-1 in the World Cup, 
giving up just five goals in six matches in '91. 
</P>
<P>
	This team is better than the 1991 squad, said Brandi Chastain, a  
member of both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very athletic in 1991. We relied on our athleticism to  
beat teams,'' Chastain said. ``Now, with the same core people, 
we're a much more polished soccer team. We're better tactically; 
we're better technically. We understand each other a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things don't happen just because of instinct like they used  
to. They happen for reasons and purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost to Norway, the eventual winner, in the  
1995 World Cup. That loss still bothers the Americans, despite 
winning the Olympics the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So DiCicco and his players have been preparing for this World  
Cup since the day after the Olympics ended. DiCicco has looked at 
hundreds of players in the last three years, both veterans and 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of his roster was set a long time ago, there were  
some decisions he made in the last few days. Among those DiCicco 
left off were goalie Siri Mullinix, midfielder Aly Wagner, defender 
Michelle French and forward Susan Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a more difficult decision than the Olympic decision,  
even though there were only 16 players in the Olympics, because 
there was more of a clear-cut division in '96,'' DiCicco said. ``I 
think it's the best team the U.S. has ever put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett, the leading scorer this year, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of disparity between the last person on the  
bench and those on the field,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also will play Nigeria and South Korea in the  
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win this thing and hold the trophy up,'' Chastain  
said. ``It's a beautiful trophy, and I hope I get to touch it.''

<HEADLINE> Aussie Accused of Selling Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Australian intelligence official was  
paid $120,000 for nearly 1,000 secret U.S. defense documents by 
undercover FBI agents who posed as foreign spies, lured him to 
Virginia and arrested him, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, 28, was charged with attempted  
espionage and ordered held without bond during an initial 
appearance Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan in 
suburban Alexandria, Va. FBI agents arrested him last Saturday at 
Dulles International Airport outside Washington when he arrived 
from London for what he believed was another meeting with foreign 
spies. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian citizen born in Montreal, Wispelaere worked for  
Australian intelligence from July 13, 1998, until his abrupt 
resignation Jan. 12, 1999, government court papers said. Australian 
Attorney General Daryl Williams confirmed this and announced an 
Australian inquiry into the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As an Australian intelligence officer, Wispelaere was cleared to  
work with U.S. top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, 
which has limited distribution, the government said. Such 
classified material was shared with Australia under U.S.-Australian 
defense treaties and could cause ``exceptionally grave damage'' to 
U.S. national security if disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The globe-girdling case began last January in Bangkok, Thailand.  
Since then, Wispelaere allegedly sold 713 classified U.S. defense 
documents to an undercover FBI man in Bangkok for $70,000 and 
mailed more than 200 others to a post office box the FBI set up in 
Virginia for an additional $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the documents involved a foreign country, the government  
said. Some of the documents were photographs, according to an FBI 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Unmarried, Wispelaere got a master's degree in strategic defense  
studies in 1998 from the Australian National University. The FBI 
said he holds Australian, Canadian and French passports and 
complained to undercover agents of ``very dire, dire financial 
need'' for a knee operation and ``a (sigh) couple of other 
concerns, involving females, unfortunately, (laugh) as is always 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his last known address was in Australia, he flew to the  
Bangkok meeting from Seoul, Korea. Wispelaere gave several aliases 
and one Canadian address that the FBI said were false. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, he also claimed to be working for the Canadian  
government in Seoul and receiving training in Cheltenham, England, 
the location of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, a 
top-secret electronic intelligence-gathering agency similar to the 
U.S. National Security Agency. U.S. officials said he was lying 
about working for Canada and in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, just six days after his unexpected resignation in  
Australia, Wispelaere walked into the embassy of a foreign country, 
which U.S. officials would not name, in Bangkok and offered to sell 
classified U.S. documents to that country for $500,000 in U.S. 
dollars, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	That country involved alerted U.S. officials to the offer and  
turned over a Nov. 24, 1998, secret U.S. document about a foreign 
country that Wispelaere provided as a sample of what he was 
offering, according to U.S. officials, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit, FBI agent John S. Adams laid out the following  
allegations against Wispelaere: 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had an undercover counterintelligence agent pose as a  
spy for the foreign country and contact Wispelaere through an 
e-mail address at Hotmail.com that he had left with the embassy in 
Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	By e-mail, Wispelaere offered information like the sample and  
variations ``used only under specific environmental circumstances'' 
and requiring ``specialized technical training to be exploited.'' 
He also offered ``hard copy reports based on the other three 
types,'' which may have been photographs because he worried about 
carrying around photos stamped ``secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 3, while carrying a magazine as instructed, Wispelaere  
met the man he believed to be a spy in Bangkok's Le Meridien 
President Hotel. As FBI videocameras secretly recorded the scene 
over two days, Wispelaere turned over 713 classified U.S. documents 
in exchange for $70,000. The secret and top-secret U.S. defense 
documents were dated 1991 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 8, Wispelaere mailed to the undercover FBI agent at a  
post office box in Ashburn, Va., more than 200 secret and 
top-secret U.S. documents in exchange for $50,000 wired to a bank 
account in France. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Wispelaere requested a lawyer be appointed to  
represent him at a detention hearing set for Thursday. He could 
face life in prison, or the death penalty if his case meets certain 
legal requirements.

<HEADLINE> Teen Falls to Death on Prom Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVALON, Calif. (AP) -- A high school student celebrating prom  
night fell from the rooftop of a hotel early Sunday and died 
several hours later with massive head injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ramirez Jr., 18, and a fellow Avalon High School student

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Up on Treasury Bills / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.570 percent, up from 4.480 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.630 percent, up from 4.510 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 21, when the  
bills sold for 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since Sept. 14, when the rate was 4.755. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.700 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,884.50, and 4.821 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,765.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.79 
percent last week from 4.78 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Infant Receives Cow Valve in Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The first person in the United States to  
have valve from a cow's neck transplanted into his heart is a 
13-month-old boy who was born with only one heart valve instead of 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was our best shot and it's doing its job and it's doing  
it well right now,'' said Chris Doty, 31, father of little Ryan 
Doty. 
</P>
<P>
	While the transplant has not been approved in the United States,  
the Food and Drug Administration permitted it as a ``compassionate 
case'' due to the boy's deteriorating condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was in fair condition Monday at Riley Hospital for  
Children, where cardiothorasic surgeon Dr. John Brown performed the 
surgery May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	With only one heart valve, Ryan's heart was unable to pump  
enough blood. He had received a heart-valve transplant at three 
months from an infant who had died, but that valve weakened and 
developed leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was extremely ill and really wasn't expected to live. This  
was the only thing that could save his life,'' said Brown, director 
of heart transplantation surgery at the Indiana University Medical 
Center, which includes the children's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said there is always an acute shortage of donor infant  
valves, which tend to fail in transplant procedures. And pig valves 
used for transplant in adult hearts are too large for infants, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown said a valve from a cow's neck ``is perfect'' for  
transplanting into an infant's heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who also suffers from hydrocephalus, or fluid on the  
brain, wasn't a candidate for a heart transplant because he had 
received so many blood transfusions during earlier surgeries and 
illnesses, said his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has been working on bovine neck valves for years,  
transplanting them into dogs. His work led to the transplant being 
approved last year in Europe for use in infants. So far, 13 success 
transplants have been performed overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has all the qualities and properties that heart surgeons  
have been looking for a long time,'' Brown said. ``It's strong, 
it's the right size, it has all the surrounding tissue you need to 
make the hookup to the heart, and it's less likely to have 
complications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The valve is treated with chemicals so that the human body won't  
reject it. Brown expects the FDA to approve the procedure in the 
United States by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan will outgrow the small valve. When they happens, he can  
undergo surgery again to receive a pig's valve.

<HEADLINE>  Miami Makeover Likely After Flop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat's first-round flop against the New  
York Knicks prompted a twist on the usual fan criticism: Fire the 
players, not the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pat Riley, part owner of the team as well as the coach, may  
do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley thought he built a team ready to fill the championship  
void created by Michael Jordan's retirement. Instead, the Heat were 
eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the third time 
in Riley's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's last-second shot Sunday for the New York Knicks  
drove home the point: Miami needs a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll sit down and talk about what we're going to do  
this offseason,'' Riley said after the Heat became just the second 
top-seeded team to lose in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Riley should share in the blame, because his blueprint  
is a bust. But his four world championship rings with the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the 1980s still carry considerable clout, and 
Riley has been spared in the backlash of criticism triggered by 
Sunday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Heat players will take the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	As is his custom, Riley laid low on the first day of the  
offseason and didn't talk to the media Monday. So speculation began 
without him. The question is not whether he'll shake up the roster, 
but how. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player considered untouchable is center Alonzo  
Mourning, who had an MVP-caliber year and a fine series against the 
Knicks. But his teammates, including point guard Tim Hardaway, can 
only wonder whether they'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to war with this group of guys, and I don't want  
to see change,'' Mourning said. ``But this game is about change, 
and with Riles running the ship, if adjustments have to be made, 
he'll make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks series confirmed adjustments have to be made. The  
Heat became the first No. 1 seed from the Eastern Conference to 
lose against a No. 8 seed. Last year, Miami was the first No. 2 
seed from the East to be eliminated by a No. 7 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Miami lost both times to the despised  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was tough. This is going to be even tougher,'' guard  
Dan Majerle said. ``We play hard, but we just haven't been able to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York underscored the Heat's deficiencies:  
they rely too much on outside shots and badly need a scorer at 
shooting guard or small forward. Miami has no reliable third option 
beyond Mourning and Hardaway, who struggled through a miserable 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway shot 27 percent against the Knicks and averaged 9.0  
points per game, barely half his average. He was shut out in the 
second half of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad stretch I hit, and I didn't come through for  
my team,'' he said. ``That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his productivity curtailed, Miami averaged just 79.0 points  
against New York, the second-lowest figure in a five-game series in 
NBA history. The Heat set the record of 78.6 against the Bulls two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's biggest decision will be whether to keep Hardaway, the  
Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is a lackluster 12-18, 
and with the offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely 
to stand pat.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Globe Libel Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a  
million-dollar libel award against the tabloid newspaper Globe for 
repeating a book's claim that a California man, not Sirhan Sirhan, 
killed Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by  
California's highest court that the news media can be liable for 
repeating someone else's libelous statement about a private figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action, while not a precedent-setting decision, is a  
$1.175 million victory for Khalid Khawar, a Bakersfield farmer. He 
was covering Kennedy's presidential campaign for a publication in 
his native Pakistan when the senator from New York was murdered in 
a Los Angeles hotel in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Globe lawyers had argued that the state court's ruling  
``seriously threatens the right of the media to accurately report 
previously published allegations of public concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 Globe article reported uncritically about a book in which  
conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow said Kennedy's murder had been 
plotted by the Iranian secret police and organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The book included a photo of Khawar with Kennedy at the hotel,  
and said the man pictured was Pakistani assassin Ali Ahmand. The 
tabloid article included the photo with a circle and arrow pointing 
out Khawar. 
</P>
<P>
	Khawar was not named in the article. But he said his photograph  
was recognized, and that he and his children later received death 
threats and that his house and son's car were vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded Khawar $675,000 in compensatory damages for the  
tabloid's negligence and $500,000 in punitive damages for its 
``actual malice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the jury's verdict was reviewed by the state Supreme Court,  
a coalition of major news organizations including The Associated 
Press argued in support of the tabloid and contended that a 
``neutral reportage'' privilege is essential for coverage of public 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state court ruled that Globe reporters and editors had  
``obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy'' of the book's claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were, to say the least, obvious reasons to doubt. ...  
The Morrow book was making the highly improbable claim that results 
of the official investigation, Sirhan's trial and this court's 
decision on Sirhan's appeal were all fundamentally mistaken,'' the 
state court said in upholding the jury verdict by a 7-0 vote last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republication of accusations made against private figures are  
never protected by the neutral reportage privilege,'' the 
California court added. It stopped short of recognizing such a 
privilege when public officials and public figures are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Globe lawyers said, ``When The  
Washington Post initially reported the Watergate allegations 
detailing the president's involvement with petty criminals, those 
allegations may have seemed `highly improbable' to many. Yet, those 
allegations were re-reported by virtually every news organization 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the California Supreme Court's rule, each of those news  
organizations would now face the risk of being found to have acted 
with `actual malice' for failing to investigate the ... allegations 
themselves before reporting on those allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khawar's lawyer also urged the justices to take the case, to let  
courts nationwide know that the California court struck ``the 
proper balancing of First Amendment and personal reputational 
values.'' He said the court should do away with the ``neutral 
reportage theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Globe International vs. Khawar, 98-1491.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard 2Q Profits Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. beat Wall Street  
expectations with a 34 percent increase in second-quarter profits, 
fueled by sales of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The big maker of computers, printers and high-tech accessories  
said Monday it earned $918 million, or 88 cents a share, for the 
three months ended April 30. It earned $685 million, or 65 cents a 
share in the same period of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 3 percent to $12.4 billion from $12 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected the Palo  
Alto-based Hewlett-Packard to earn 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had solid net earnings in PCs, strong profit performance in  
printing and imaging, and significant profit improvement in our 
measurement business,'' said Hewlett-Packard chairman Lewis E. 
Platt. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Hewlett-Packard split into two separate ventures in an  
effort to revitalize some of its underperforming divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The split formed one company with the computer and imaging  
businesses, and second, much smaller company including testing and 
measuring, components, chemical analysis and medical components. 
</P>
<P>
	Platt said the results are especially notable because ``they  
show we can remain focused even as we make progress on our plan to 
divide HP into two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended April 30, HP's net earnings increased  
16 percent to $1.9 billion, compared with $1.6 billion in the first 
half of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were released after financial markets had closed. In  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares rose $3.81 1/4 to $88.

<HEADLINE> Workers Honor Ingalls Picket Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) -- Hundreds of workers refused today to  
cross picket lines set up by a machinists union outside Ingalls 
Shipbuilding, Mississippi's largest private employer. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word from Ingalls, a major shipbuilder  
for the Navy, on exactly how many of its 11,500 workers were 
honoring the pickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The picket lines first went up outside the two main entrances to  
the shipyard on Sunday morning after the union and the company 
could not resolve a dispute over the frequency of pay raises and 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Management employees were jeered by strikers as they entered the  
shipyard after 7 a.m. today, while workers who turned around in 
support of the union were cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	While only Machinists Local 1133 voted to strike, 11 of the 13  
unions representing 8,000 Ingalls employees rejected the shipyard's 
latest contract proposal in weekend votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metal Trades Council, which represents nine of the 11 unions  
that rejected the contract, has offered to continue working on a 
day-to-day basis until a contract is worked out. But council 
leaders say they doubt their workers will cross the Machinists' 
picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was here last night until midnight and we didn't have any  
problems,'' striking machinist Clyde Stevens said today. ``It's 
going pretty good. I haven't seen anybody in crafts cross the line 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls management has asked workers to return to their jobs  
until federal mediators and national union leaders work out a 
better solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls is committed to achieving new labor agreements without a  
work disruption, said Den Knecht, vice president of public and 
industrial relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Kelly, Machinists business agent, said the workers want  
annual salary raises and more bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last 12 years, the unions have gotten only seven raises  
and five bonuses,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some union members contend Ingalls' proposed contract would have  
offset pay raises by hiking monthly insurance premiums, so they 
rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, picketing by the Machinists union shut down Ingalls for  
two days because other union members honored the lines. It was the 
first strike at the shipyards in 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Trying for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Since Affirmed became the last Triple Crown  
champion in 1978, six thoroughbreds have won the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness to stand on the brink of racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes foiled them all.  
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks, Charismatic will attempt to negotiate the 1 1/2  
miles of the final leg of racing's Triple Crown at Belmont Park. If 
he crosses the finish line first, a $5 million VISA bonus and 
racing immortality await. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does not, he will join a long list of also-rans, the most  
recent of which include Real Quiet (1998), Silver Charm (1997), 
Sunday Silence (1989), Alysheba (1987), Pleasant Colony (1981) and 
Spectacular Bid (1979). 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 25 horses have taken the first two races of the Triple  
Crown. Only 11 have succeeded in sweeping the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday morning, trainer D. Wayne Lukas sounded upbeat as he  
assessed his big chestnut colt's chances of joining the likes of 
Affirmed, Secretariat and Citation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the style and strength to get it,'' Lukas said the day  
after Charismatic's powerful move around the final turn launched 
him to a 1 1/2-length victory over Menifee in the Preakness. ``But you 
can't go out there saying `We're going to beat these horses.' We're 
not talking Secretariat here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, actually, he was. Following the race, Lukas pointed out  
that Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall, was significantly 
influenced by Secretariat in his pedigree. And, in fact, resembled 
his ancestor more than his smaller, darker sire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's time for the gene pool to start kicking in,'' Lukas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third straight year a horse has gone for the  
Triple Crown, and the first time that has happened since Seattle 
Slew and Affirmed won Triple Crowns in 1977 and 1978, and 
Spectacular Bid fell short in his try in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years, horses trained by Bob Baffert have come  
close to capturing racing's elusive prize. Baffert, who trains the 
fillies Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday, will not be making 
the trip to New York this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting off at this bus stop,'' he said after Excellent  
Meeting was pulled up in the Preakness when she experienced trouble 
breathing. The filly was scoped and Baffert reported she was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Baffert won't be there, owners Bob and Beverly Lewis  
will. Two years ago, their Silver Charm was upended by Touch Gold 
in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for the Triple Crown twice in the same lifetime,  
imagine that,'' said Lewis, who celebrated his 75th birthday on 
Wednesday. ``I wouldn't be so rash as to predict we'll win, but 
wouldn't it be wonderful. If he doesn't, well, we've been there, 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the spoiler's role was played by Victory Gallop. The  
horse trained by Elliott Walden finished second in both the Derby 
and Preakness before winning by a nose in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Walden is back in the same position with Menifee, the  
fast-closing colt who lost the Derby by a neck and missed by a bit 
more in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's different this year is I feel good about going on and  
trying Charismatic again in the Belmont, maybe because of the 
experience last year,'' Walden said. ``Wayne's horse is in a zone 
now. I can't feel bad standing here with the second best 3-year-old 
in the country. It's beginning to look like it's between the two 
horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont, on June 5, could draw as many as 11 challengers for  
Charismatic, a former claimer who heads to New York with a 16-race 
resume and three straight wins that began with the Lexington Stakes 
on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Menifee, others set for the Belmont include:  
Badge and Stephen Got Even, the third- and fourth-place Preakness 
finishers; Lemon Drop Kid (ninth in the Derby); Comeonmom, Best of 
Luck, Vision and Verse and Pineaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Cat Thief, who finished third in the Derby and  
seventh in the Preakness, won't make the trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was set to return to Churchill Downs today, while  
his jockey, Chris Antley, was back riding in California. Lukas, 
too, returns to Louisville to oversee Belmont preparations for his 
colt, who could have been purchased for $62,500 after a claiming 
race in February, but there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races, said Charismatic will  
have his final Belmont tuneup on June 1 before shipping east the 
following day, when the draw for post positions takes place and 
excitement will begin to mount for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, excitement is building in Walton, Ky., home of  
Affirmed's jockey Steve Cauthen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's meant to happen, and if the whole thing falls  
together, it would be great,'' Cauthen said. ``Seeing stars being 
made -- and Charismatic would be a genuine thoroughbred star -- 
that's what racing needs.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Companies Cater to Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer companies are catching on -- grandma  
and grandpa want to surf the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	With the number of older Americans on the Internet growing, but  
only one out of four people over age 60 owning computers, hi-tech 
companies are viewing the elderly as one of the last largely 
untapped U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as Microsoft, Intel and America Online are  
distributing instructional videos on computer use, sponsoring 
training seminars and creating Web sites that cater to the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding a lot of interest,'' said Craig Spiezle,  
director of Microsoft's senior initiative. ``Clearly, the growth is 
huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People over age 50 are the second-fastest-growing group on the  
Internet, trailing only 16-to-24-year-olds, according to a study 
last year by Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the over-50 group accounts for only 17 percent of the people  
who use the Internet, the study found. And only 25 percent of 
people over age 60 own a computer, compared with 50 percent for the 
rest of the population, according to research by Microsoft and the 
American Society on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	So company officials are taking action.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chip maker, has donated equipment for  
computer training centers and sponsored Web sites that cater to the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the nation's largest Internet provider, has  
boosted its content directed at seniors, forming partnerships with 
groups such as the American Association of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM offers computer discounts to members of the non-profit  
computer training group SeniorNet. On-line auctioneer e-Bay has run 
print ads aimed at older customers, and computer maker Gateway has 
sponsored training seminars and run TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it as a very important market,'' said Greg Lund of  
Gateway. ``These are people who are not only not scared of 
technology, they're willing to experiment with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is conducting one of the more high-profile efforts,  
spending millions of dollars and hiring a five-person staff 
dedicated to reaching out to older customers. The Redmond, Wash., 
software giant announced this month that it is shipping 10,000 free 
videos to community groups to introduce seniors to computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Microsoft issued guidelines for businesses and Web  
site developers on how to make Internet sites more user-friendly 
and accessible for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Creighton, a 57-year-old former civil servant who is  
taking a computer training class in Portland, Ore., said she uses 
her computer to send poems to her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a marvelous way to keep in touch,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But company officials see something else in older users --  
profits. Industry officials say many of the elderly have the key 
essentials to becoming computer owners -- time and money. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recently available census data, from 1993, showed that  
70-to-74-year-olds, followed by 65-to-69-year-olds, were the 
wealthiest age groups in America based on net worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hi-tech companies are ``definitely catching on,'' said Mark  
Carpenter, online communications director for the AARP. ``Lots of 
times when you are 22 years old you can't afford to buy a PC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Jette, 59, of Hudson, N.H., was only one week into her  
first computer training class earlier this year when she plunked 
down $1,500 to buy her first computer. Now she has set up a Web 
page to sell the clocks she makes, and she checks it each day for 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was much well worth it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts say the increasing focus on the elderly has  
been a natural progression. With their children and grandchildren 
often already plugged in, seniors see computers as valuable for 
checking stock prices, getting health and travel tips and, above 
all, exchanging e-mail and digital photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to keep in touch with their family and friends,''  
said Laura Fay of SeniorNet in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	And with retirees living longer, and often viewing Social  
Security as insufficient to support them, they also want training 
for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Kelley, who signed up with Green Thumb Inc., a nonprofit  
group that provides computer training to the low-income elderly, 
said, ``There's absolutely nothing in here I can't learn.''

<HEADLINE>  US Women's Soccer Team Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They're talented, they're tested and they're on a  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy and Tiffeny Milbrett, all  
determined to win back the title they lost four years ago, lead the 
U.S. roster for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins June 19 at Giants Stadium, with the  
Americans playing Denmark, and concludes July 10 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make a statement to the world,'' coach Tony  
DiCicco said Monday after announcing the 20-player roster. ``The 
World Cup, in soccer, is the epitome. They want to be Olympic 
champions and World Cup champions at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is huge. But we are capable of accomplishing  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roster includes 13 of the 16 players from the team that won  
the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics. Hamm, Akers, Foudy, Carla 
Overbeck, Kristine Lilly and Joy Fawcett all will be playing in 
their third World Cup; six others will be playing in their second. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the first World Cup in 1991 and was  
eliminated in the semifinals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight players have been in 115 or more international games,  
including Lilly, whose 177 appearances is a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been there, for sure, is a huge plus,'' DiCicco said.  
``They know what to expect; they know what it's going to take. They 
know there are going to be some ups and downs in the tournament. 
They know physically the demand, because you can't duplicate the 
intensity of these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most noticeable absence from the roster is forward Debbie  
Keller, who claims she's being excluded because of a sexual 
harassment lawsuit she filed. Keller, whose 14 goals tied her for 
second on the U.S. team last year, is suing Anson Dorrance, the 
North Carolina and former U.S. coach, alleging he made uninvited 
sexual advances and harassed her during and after her college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time national player of the year wasn't an original  
invitee to the team's 26-player residency camp, but she later spent 
time with the team. Keller lost an arbitration hearing against U.S. 
Soccer last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invested a lot in Debbie last year, and she did very  
well,'' DiCicco said. ``But Cindy Parlow wasn't in the mix a lot 
last year, and Danielle Fotopoulos was still coming back from her 
knee injury. It just became a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debbie's still in the pool,'' DiCicco added. ``The landscape  
of this team is going to change, because in the next year or two 
there's going to be a lot of retirements. So she needs to keep 
herself in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long been the dominant team in women's  
soccer. It has 156-33-13 record, and 10-1-1 in the World Cup, 
giving up just five goals in six matches in '91. 
</P>
<P>
	This team is better than the 1991 squad, said Brandi Chastain, a  
member of both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very athletic in 1991. We relied on our athleticism to  
beat teams,'' Chastain said. ``Now, with the same core people, 
we're a much more polished soccer team. We're better tactically; 
we're better technically. We understand each other a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things don't happen just because of instinct like they used  
to. They happen for reasons and purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost to Norway, the eventual winner, in the  
1995 World Cup. That loss still bothers the Americans, despite 
winning the Olympics the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So DiCicco and his players have been preparing for this World  
Cup since the day after the Olympics ended. DiCicco has looked at 
hundreds of players in the last three years, both veterans and 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of his roster was set a long time ago, there were  
some decisions he made in the last few days. Among those DiCicco 
left off were goalie Siri Mullinix, midfielder Aly Wagner, defender 
Michelle French and forward Susan Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a more difficult decision than the Olympic decision,  
even though there were only 16 players in the Olympics, because 
there was more of a clear-cut division in '96,'' DiCicco said. ``I 
think it's the best team the U.S. has ever put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett, the leading scorer this year, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of disparity between the last person on the  
bench and those on the field,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also will play Nigeria and South Korea in the  
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win this thing and hold the trophy up,'' Chastain  
said. ``It's a beautiful trophy, and I hope I get to touch it.''

<HEADLINE> Hoechst, Rhone-Poulenc Set Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Hoechst AG and France's  
Rhone-Poulenc SA on Monday set November as a deadline for 
completing their merger into a new drugs and agricultural chemicals 
giant to be called Aventis. 
</P>
<P>
	The share-swap, to begin in October, will give Hoechst 53  
percent of the new company and Rhone-Poulenc the rest, the two 
companies said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-stock deal will result in one of the world's largest  
``life sciences'' companies, with annual sales of around $20 
billion. Based in Strassbourg, France, Aventis will be publicly 
traded in Paris, Frankfurt and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect the merger to be closed in November,  
provided the shareholders of the two groups approve it, the 
statement said. A 90 percent acceptance rate will be needed for the 
merger to succeed, the two companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before November, Hoechst plans to spin off its industrial  
chemical operations into Celanese AG by offering Hoechst 
shareholders one Celanese share for 10 Hoechst shares held. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups said they plan to submit the merger plan to  
extraordinary shareholder meetings in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst shareholders will meet again in October at an annual  
general meeting to vote on the payment of a special dividend, the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst Chairman Juergen Dormann will head the new company,  
while Rhone-Poulenc Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou will be his deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger initially was planned to take several years, but it  
was accelerated at the urging of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., Hoechst's 
largest shareholder with a 24.5 percent stake.

<HEADLINE> Rice Grown With Less Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists are having success with new  
rice-planting methods, some based on ancient practices, that use 
much less fresh water -- a rapidly dwindling resource. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperately looking for ways to increase rice production to feed  
growing Third World populations, researchers say saving water will 
be a key challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Asia, 80 percent of fresh water goes to agriculture. With  
increasing urbanization, that just won't be available in the 
future,'' said Robert Cantrell of the International Rice Research 
Institute. Asia produces about 90 percent of the world's rice. 
</P>
<P>
	The new methods are being developed by farmers with the help of  
scientists from the United Nation's Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural Research, which has laboratories 
throughout the world. CGIAR will report on its new findings in 
Beijing next week during a meeting on pressing food security, 
poverty reduction and environmental protection challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The methods include wet-seeding, intermittent irrigation, land  
leveling, improved weed management and techniques to cultivate 
cracked soils. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantrell, interviewed by telephone from his office in Makati  
City, Philippines, said water-saving techniques will not approach 
the impact of the ``rice revolution'' of the 1960s that in six 
years saw widespread adoption of new, strong varieties of 
high-yielding rice across Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said hybrid varieties, however, are still being developed and  
have allowed rice farmers to keep up with world demand. The 
water-saving methods pose new hope for feeding the world into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice production must increase 40 percent in the next three  
decades to meet the needs of Asia's poor, said Ismael Serageldin, 
CGIAR chairman and World Bank vice president for special programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the projected growth of Asian cities and industries and  
their increased need for fresh water, rice farming must become more 
water efficient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Current methods that involve growing rice under water take twice  
as much water to produce rice than any other cereal crop, 
Serageldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, rice plants are transplanted as seedlings into  
flooded fields. With wet-seeding, presoaked seeds are sown directly 
into muddied fields, using up to 25 percent less water. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantrell said the method now being tried out in Thailand,  
Vietnam and the Philippines was used by ancient tribes in the 
region, but nearly all rice farming now is done by flooding fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other new rice-growing methods being developed by farmers  
and scientists: 
</P>
<P>
	--In China, irrigation is being used to flood fields only after  
they have been allowed to nearly dry out, repeating the process 
through the growing period. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Cambodia, many rice paddies are in fields at different  
levels, with upper levels requiring more water. By leveling fields 
to one flat surface, less water is needed. Initials costs for this 
method, however, can be high. 
</P>
<P>
	--When fields are not flooded, weed management becomes a problem,  
and several methods are being developed to fight weeds, including 
weed-resistant rice strains, mechanical devices and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Finally, methods are being developed to crumble soil that has  
developed cracks that suck up water without first letting it soak 
into the soil.

<HEADLINE> Origins of Indians' Name Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The origin of the Cleveland Indians' nickname  
has been called into question. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 30 years, the club has said the nickname  
``Indians'' was chosen in a newspaper contest to honor Louis 
Sockalexis, a Penobscot Indian who played for the Cleveland Spiders 
from 1897-99. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ellen Staurowsky, an associate professor at Ithaca College  
who wrote a paper on the subject in the Sociology of Sports Journal 
last December, said the idea that there was a contest is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's completely fake,'' she told the Plain Dealer. ``It's a  
misrepresentation of what actually happened. There is no evidence 
the team was named after Sockalexis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, protesters have demonstrated against the  
Indians nickname and the club's Chief Wahoo mascot, saying they are 
degrading to American Indians. Cleveland fans sometimes argue the 
nickname was meant as a tribute to Sockalexis and not an insult. 
</P>
<P>
	The team first began mentioning the Sockalexis link in its 1968  
media guide, and in this year's edition, a full page has been 
devoted to Sockalexis and a history of Cleveland's nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
	It says that in 1915 ``a local daily newspaper ran a contest and  
the name Indian was suggested by a fan who said he was doing it in 
honor of an Indians player named Louis Francis Sockalexis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in researching its own paper and three others from Jan. 1,  
1915 through April 30, 1915, the Plain Dealer found that 
Sockalexis' name was never mentioned when the nickname was 
announced. The name Indians was chosen by a committee of sports 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to realize that nicknames used by teams back  
then didn't have the official status that they do today,'' team 
spokesman Bob DiBiasio said. ``Teams had several nicknames that 
were used by fans and players and the press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her paper, Staurowsky points to the tale of a contest  
originating from a Jan. 7, 1915, headline which said: ``Fans will 
help select new nickname for Naps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Naps was the nickname used by the team until 1915 when  
second baseman Nap Lajoie was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The club was officially known as the Spiders during the 1890s  
until Sockalexis arrived in 1897. Staurowsky said sports writers 
would vacillate on using Indians ``depending on how well Sockalexis 
was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Indians are not entirely correct when they say the  
team is named specifically for Sockalexis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a vast difference between speculating the Indians  
were named after Sockalexis and making the claim the franchise now 
makes, that there was an intentional decision to honor him,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Carmakers Brace for Haulers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Drivers who haul vehicles from auto assembly  
plants to dealers have taken a strike vote. 
</P>
<P>
	A walkout by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which  
represents about 12,200 drivers and related workers, could quickly 
curtail U.S. new vehicle production and possibly dampen what 
promises to be a record sales year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone would have a problem,'' Ford Motor Co. president Jac  
Nasser said today. Nasser said his company was keeping in close 
contact with the Teamsters and the car haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes on whether to authorize a strike were held last week and  
results were expected later today. The current contract with 
trucking companies that haul the vehicles expires May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants enhanced job security, higher wages and better  
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1999 car and truck sales already up 8.9 percent through  
April, and the traditionally strong summer selling season still 
ahead, a prolonged strike could be a devastating setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we could get cars or trucks out of the  
plants,'' said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor and 
Varsity Lincoln Mercury in Novi. ``The last time it happened, we 
sat and sucked our thumbs until we could get cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler AG and  
other automakers already are preparing alternative plans in case of 
a walkout by workers who deliver vehicles to showrooms and used-car 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may ask our dealers to use their own trucks and drivers in  
case of a strike,'' DaimlerChrysler spokesman Dan Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations are the first big test at the bargaining table  
for new Teamsters chief James P. Hoffa, who assumed control of the 
union and its 1.4 million members last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has struck just one car hauler.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the union waged a 32-day strike against Ryder System  
Inc.'s auto transport subsidiary, idling 500,000 cars and trucks at 
assembly plants, depots and ports. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Holdings Inc. bought Ryder's car-hauling unit in 1997 and  
now controls about two-thirds of the U.S. market. It operates about 
5,200 car- and truck-hauling rigs from 120 terminals in the United 
States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> NBC Adds Five Dramas, Two Comedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Coming to NBC this fall, dramas about rescue  
workers, a White House with Martin Sheen as president and high 
school students circa 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is bringing in a total of five new dramas and two  
new comedies, and will cancel ``Caroline in the City,'' ``Homicide: 
Life on the Street'' and ``NewsRadio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All seven broadcast networks are presenting next September's  
schedules to advertisers this week. NBC, as the defending ratings 
champ, was up first. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC executives said they were making relatively few changes to  
minimize confusion for viewers. Some shows thought to be 
questionable for the fall schedule -- ``Jesse'' and ``Veronica's 
Closet'' -- were renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the most stable schedule you'll see at a network  
in years,'' said Garth Ancier, new NBC entertainment president. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' creator John Wells, who failed last fall with his  
``Trinity'' drama, is getting two new chances in September. He's 
behind ``The West Wing,'' a political drama with Sheen and Rob Lowe 
as a White House staffer. Wells is co-executive producer with Aaron 
Sorkin, creator of ``Sports Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells also created the new Sunday night drama, ``Third Watch,''  
which NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa called ``the best series 
we have.'' Reminiscent of ``ER'' and featuring some of the same 
actors, it's about rescue workers in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is spinning off its popular ``Law &AMP; Order'' series with a  
Monday night drama focusing on particularly heinous crimes. ``Law &AMP; 
Order: Special Victims Unit'' will prominently use many of the 
actors from the original series. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC executives played hardball with its rivals at its Monday  
presentation, showing advertisers a filmed skit depicting the 
typical Fox viewer as a long-haired man who crushed beer cans on 
his head, and a CBS viewer as a clueless elderly lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are NBC's other new shows:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Cold Feet,'' a Friday night drama/comedy about three couples  
in various stages of relationships. NBC wanted to replace 
``Homicide'' with a show that would appeal more to women. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Freaks and Geeks,'' an hour-long show about two teen-aged  
siblings, set in a suburban high school. 
</P>
<P>
	--''The Mike O'Malley Show,'' a comedy starring the actor as a  
30-year-old bachelor who realizes that his partying days are about 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Stark Raving Mad,'' a comedy about a horror writer and his  
editor. It also won NBC's version of the lottery -- placement on its 
top-rated Thursday schedule between ``Frasier'' and ``ER.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Could Grow in Popularity / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska is known as the Cornhusker State,  
but crop experts say wheat could grow in popularity among farmers 
as new, consumer-friendly varieties like white wheat are developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural  
Research Service announced the development of Nebraska's first hard 
white winter wheat, called Nuplains. 
</P>
<P>
	Six acres near Sidney are sown to Nuplains this year. The  
harvested seed wheat is to be available to certified seed growers 
this fall and to farmers by planting time in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Graybosch, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Ag Research  
Service research geneticist, said the new winter wheat has 
potential for use in the growing market for tortillas, pita breads 
and Asian noodles. 
</P>
<P>
	``White wheats are being developed because customers want  
them,'' Graybosch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska produced 84.6 million bushels of wheat, half of which  
were exported, in 1998. Asia imports 400 million bushels of white 
wheat annually from Australia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska wheat promoters hope to tap the growing Asian market.  
</P>
<P>
	Nuplains is a cross between Abilene, a hard red winter wheat and  
a Kansas experimental hard wheat. It allows Nebraska to join other 
states with white wheat programs, Graybosch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few premiums exist now, but someday monetary incentives may be  
available for producers to grow nothing but white wheat, he said. 
Graybosch said yields are competitive, and white wheat is ``an 
option'' for Nebraska growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestic millers will already take all they can get,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millers like white-wheat flour because of the taste, Graybosch  
said. Red wheat contains tannins, which make it red and also give 
it a bitter flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	White wheat is sweeter, Graybosch said, meaning processors can  
mill closer to the hull and add less sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	While the difference between red and white wheat is in the  
genes, Graybosch stressed that white wheat is not a genetically 
modified grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This white wheat occurs naturally,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Australia was first to develop white wheat varieties, and now  
enjoys strong trade with the Asian noodle market, Graybosch said. 
There are some disadvantages to growing white wheat, however, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, white wheat is more susceptible than red wheat to  
pre-harvest sprouting in the heads. White wheat is geared toward 
relatively dry climates where the grain will be dry at harvest, 
Graybosch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Strouts, executive director of the Kansas Crop Improvement  
Association in Manhattan, Kan., said Kansas universities have been 
working with white wheats since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas released white wheat to seed growers for the first time  
in fall 1998. Kansas offers two varieties of certified white wheat. 
The varieties, Betty and Heyne, are named after their founders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine producers have the seed growing on their farms. Most of the  
acreage is irrigated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strouts said white varieties also will produce flour higher in  
protein because millers can mill closer to the bran, where the 
highest protein concentrations exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Millers also can extract 2 percent to 3 percent more flour from  
each white kernel than a red kernel, he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Assault on Jockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The man who stood on the track as horses raced  
past him on Preakness day was charged with assaulting the jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ferrell of Bel Air also was charged with trespassing,  
reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and 
alcohol-related offenses, according to a police report released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old man punched jockey Jorge Chavez at Pimlico Race  
Course on Saturday, an assault that has been shown repeatedly on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell was taken to Baltimore's central booking facility, said  
Barbara Cooper, a spokeswoman for the Division of Pretrial 
Detention and Services. He was released Sunday after posting $2,500 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Angelique Cook-Hayes said Ferrell was first  
taken to Sinai Hospital for a psychiatric review, but was released 
Saturday night. Hospital spokeswoman Amy Mickolite refused to 
comment on whether Ferrell had been at the facility, citing 
hospital policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why he did it,'' Cook-Hayes said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre episode occurred several hundred yards from the  
finish line during the seventh race, about 2 1/2 hours before the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell made his way to the track from the infield and crossed a  
fence separating the fans from the turf course. He then staggered 
to the inside rail, which he pounded with his fist before ducking 
under it, and walked onto the main track. 
</P>
<P>
	As the horses approached, he stood with his fists clenched and  
arms upraised. As the horses charged by on both sides, Ferrell 
could be seen in replays trying to punch two horses.

<HEADLINE> NBC Adds Five Dramas, Two Comedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is adding five dramas to its prime-time  
schedule next fall, including a ``Law &AMP; Order'' spinoff, a look at 
the inner workings of the White House that stars Rob Lowe, and a 
show set in a suburban high school around 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The network will also premiere two new comedies and cancel  
``Caroline in the City,'' ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and 
``NewsRadio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven broadcast networks all present next September's  
schedules to advertisers this week. NBC, the ratings champ for the 
last three years and locked in a battle for first place with CBS 
this year, is the first to pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	A new comedy about a book editor, ``Stark Raving Mad,'' is given  
a coveted time slot on Thursday night, NBC's most popular night. It 
takes over for ``Veronica's Closet,'' which moves to Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's other new comedy, ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' is about a  
30-year-old man who realizes his partying days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' will air on Monday nights.  
It's a police drama set in New York City and focusing on 
particularly heinous crimes. ``Law &AMP; Order'' remains on Wednesday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wells, the creator of ``ER,'' is also behind two of the new  
dramas. ``West Wing'' is the White House drama, set for Wednesday 
nights, and he's also producing ``Third Watch,'' about paramedics, 
firefighters and police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freaks and Geeks,'' about high school life circa 1980, is  
reminiscent of the teen-age dramas popular on the WB. That 
network's former entertainment chief, Garth Ancier, took over this 
month as NBC's entertainment president. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's fifth new drama, ``Cold Feet,'' is about three young  
couples in relationships with various levels of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	One staple remains on NBC's schedule: hour-long installments of  
``Dateline NBC'' five nights a week.

<HEADLINE> Former Ark. Gov. Must Pay for Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, whose shady  
financial deals got caught up in the Whitewater investigation, was 
ordered today to pay $1 million for setting up a sham bankruptcy to 
avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, who pleaded guilty in February 1998, was also ordered  
placed on four years' probation for hiding the value of a cable TV 
business he sold in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that if the company's real value was known,  
Tucker and business partner William Marks would have been liable 
for an additional $2.9 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said he would appeal the sentence and order of  
restitution, which is to be paid to the federal government. Marks 
was also ordered to pay $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no tax loss to the government that I benefited  
from,'' Tucker said after sentencing, arguing that the government 
owed him federal income tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's business dealings came under scrutiny as part of the  
federal investigation into the Whitewater land deal, a failed 
development in which President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
were investors. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 18 months of home detention after being convicted of  
fraud and conspiracy with James and Susan McDougal, President 
Clinton's former business partners. Tucker had lied to arrange 
nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fighting to have that conviction overturned, saying a  
juror was biased against him. As part of his plea bargain in the 
cable case, prosecutors will not retry him if his initial 
conviction is thrown out.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Takes Triple Crown Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic, one race away from  
completing the Triple Crown, returned to Churchill Downs Monday to 
train for his bid at racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness could become  
racing's 12th Triple Crown winner by winning the 1 1/2-mile Belmont 
Stakes June 5. He would become the first to earn a $5 million bonus 
that goes to a horse that sweeps the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was accompanied by  
stablemate Cat Thief on the 1 1/2-hour flight from Baltimore to 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shipped very well,'' Lukas said. ``It's an easy trip.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall owned by Robert and Beverly  
Lewis, was bathed and then walked in the shedrow before being taken 
out to graze in a grassy area alongside Churchill's barns. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic has won his last three races, starting with the  
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland two weeks before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just continues to amaze me,'' Lukas said. ``He was out on  
the lawn yesterday, grazing at Pimlico, and he didn't look any 
different than he did Friday when we had him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Charismatic's tentative training schedule before the  
Belmont Stakes probably will include two workouts at Churchill 
Downs before being shipped to Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Overbrook Farm's Cat Thief, third in the Derby, is  
off the Triple Crown trail after engaging in a withering speed duel 
in the Preakness and will skip the Belmont Stakes.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Tries To Qualify for Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The luck of the draw, and maybe some  
favorable weather, might determine when and how well Tony Stewart 
qualifies for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Indy Racing League champion already knows he won't  
have much time to practice, thanks to his Winston Cup commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest challenge will be the weather,'' said Stewart, who  
needs an early draw in the qualifying order on Saturday to have a 
chance for the pole position in the May 30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing that's going to hurt us right now is a lack  
of track time, and if we wash out two or three days this week then 
that's what's going to hurt us the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice was halted more than two hours early Monday because of  
rain. More rain was forecast for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who formed the Tri Star Motor Sports team to race at  
Indianapolis, already missed the opening day of practice on 
Saturday to compete in NASCAR's Pontiac Excitement 400 in Richmond, 
Va. He arrived in Indianapolis early Sunday, with little sleep, and 
took only a few shakedown laps in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite not driving an Indy car since October, Stewart quickly  
got up to speed, turning a lap of 222.091 mph, the seventh best in 
Sunday's practice. On Monday, he managed only six more laps, with a 
top speed of 219.700, before the rain hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray, who took Stewart's place with Team Menard, was the  
fastest for the third day in a row, turning a top lap of 224.843. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other fast drivers were rookie John Hollansworth Jr. at  
221.669, defending IRL champion Kenny Brack at 221.272 and two-time 
Indy winner Arie Luyendyk at 221.119. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Mike Borkowski and veterans Scott Harrington and Billy  
Boat hit walls in separate crashes, but none of them was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifications begin 11 a.m. Saturday. To race that night in The  
Winston at Concord, N.C., Stewart figures he needs to leave 
Indianapolis by 1:30 p.m., which means his position in the 
qualifying line is crucial. The order will be drawn Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't feel pressure,'' Stewart said of having  
possibly only one chance to get into the race. ``I think I'm going 
to have a good enough car underneath me that we're not going to 
have to worry about that. I think we can get in the show pretty 
solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question, though, is which day.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be true to the Winston Cup guys,'' he said.  
``They've been good enough to give me this opportunity to come 
here, and the last thing I want to do is be late down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means if he doesn't qualify in the first 2 1/2 hours on  
Saturday, he will have to wait until Sunday, with no shot at the 
pole or any other spot high in the 33-car lineup. After the race, 
he will leave immediately again to drive in the Coca-Cola 600 at 
Concord that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Stewart became the first driver to win U.S. Auto  
Club national championships in the sprint, midget and Silver Crown 
divisions in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, he made his debut in the Indianapolis 500,  
started from the pole after teammate Scott Brayton was killed in 
practice, led 44 laps and was rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, he started second, finished fifth and went on to  
capture the IRL series title. Last year, he started fourth at Indy 
but was first out after engine problems on the 23rd lap. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Team Menard at the end the season to drive full time for  
Joe Gibbs Racing, where he is the top rookie driver in NASCAR and 
seventh overall after finishing 15th Saturday at Richmond. But Indy 
has always been on his mind. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Spelling To Complete Sale To Viacom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. is paying $181 million in cash to  
buy the 20 percent of television producer Spelling Entertainment 
Group Inc. it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom will pay $9.75 for each share of Spelling, giving it full  
control of the production company whose hits include ``Melrose 
Place,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Judge Judy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom, which inherited its stake in Spelling from its 1994  
acquisition of the Blockbuster video chain, has been trying for 
some time to buy the rest of the company. Viacom had offered to pay 
$9 per share for the rest of Spelling two months ago but had to 
sweeten the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, concerned that the substantial cash payment could  
hurt Viacom, pushed the company's stock lower Monday. Viacom's 
shares fell $1.62 1/2 or 4 percent to $37.56 1/4 in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling's shares rose on news of the rich offer, gaining 75  
cents, or 8.5 percent, to $9.62 1/2. Both stocks trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<P>
	Viacom also owns MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, the Paramount movie  
studio, half of the UPN network and part of the Simon &AMP; Schuster

	Barak Unseats Netanyahu in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ehud Barak, a peace process moderate, unseated  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in elections today. Netanyahu 
conceded defeat in an emotional farewell after exit polls projected 
a sweeping victory for Barak. TV's Channel One had Barak ahead by 
58.5 percent to 41.5 percent for Netanyahu, while Channel Two gave 
the opposition chief a lead of 57 percent to 43 percent for 
Netanyahu. A Barak victory would likely jumpstart Israel's stalled 
negotiations with the Palestinians that were frozen during most of 
Netanyahu's three-year rule.

	Albright Urges Israeli Pullback  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israelis elected Ehud Barak their new prime  
minister today, the Clinton administration renewed its call for an 
Israeli pullback on the West Bank and immediate and rapid talks 
with the Palestinians on Jerusalem and statehood. After a long and 
frustrating stalemate, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also 
set as a U.S. goal peace talks on ``an invigorated track'' between 
Israel and Syria and Lebanon.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bad weather forced the cancellation  
of most NATO flights over Kosovo today as diplomatic efforts to 
solve the nearly 2-month-old conflict moved into higher gear. A 
U.N. delegation was in Belgrade today, preparing to make the first 
trip to Kosovo by international authorities since some 790,000 
ethnic Albanians were driven out of the southern Serb province 
beginning March 24, when NATO launched airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. In what U.N. officials and NATO said was a worrying 
development, Serb forces today barred hundreds of ethnic Albanians 
who arrived at the Macedonian border from leaving Kosovo.

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, a longtime  
friend of President Clinton accused of funneling illegal 
contributions to Democrats, went on trial today on an obstruction 
charge. Trie is accused of obstructing justice by ordering an 
employee to destroy documents subpoenaed in 1997 by a federal grand 
jury and by a Senate committee. Trie could spend time in a federal 
prison if convicted and faces even stiffer penalties if convicted 
of charges in Washington that he made and arranged illegal 
contributions from foreigners to the Democratic National Committee.

	Court To Decide on Auto Records Law

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a big-bucks battle over privacy, the  
Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether states can sell 
personal information from driver's license records such as people's 
addresses and Social Security numbers. The Clinton administration 
wants the justices to uphold a federal law that closes state motor 
vehicle records to the public. States have routinely sold such 
information to businesses, charities and political candidates, 
earning millions of dollars in revenue each year. When the law was 
enacted, 34 states made motor vehicle records public in some form.

	Ruling Allows Cops To Seize Cars

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police do not need a warrant to seize  
someone's car from a public place under laws requiring forfeiture 
of property linked to crime, the Supreme Court said today. The 7-2 
ruling reinstated a Florida man's drug conviction based on the 
crack cocaine police found in his car after seizing it without a 
warrant. Police said the man's car was subject to forfeiture 
because it had been used to deliver drugs several months earlier. 
The case involves seizures made under a Florida law that allows 
forfeiture of property used in committing drug crimes.

	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island star forward Lamar  
Odom has entered the NBA draft after one collegiate season. The 
6-foot-10 Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding 
(9.4) last season. Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of 
the draft as late as June 23 and return to college. Last year, Odom 
declared for the draft, then pulled out after he was admitted to 
Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> Roy Has Red Wings Against Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Their names are Arturs Irbe, Martin Brodeur,  
Patrick Roy and Nikolai Khabibulin. Over the past few years, they 
are the goaltenders who have tormented the Detroit Red Wings in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, in particular, has become almost as familiar to Detroit  
fans as the octopus they like to toss at Joe Louis Arena. If he can 
win again Tuesday night in Game 6, the Colorado Avalanche will have 
eliminated the Red Wings -- dashing their quest for a third 
consecutive Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, extending his NHL playoff record for wins to 106, had 36  
saves as the Avalanche beat Detroit 3-0 in Game 5 on Sunday, the 
first time the home team has won in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has stopped 111 of the last 116 Detroit shots.  
</P>
<P>
	Roy's 12th career playoff shutout tied him with Terry Sawchuk  
for fourth place in NHL history. His last shutout in the postseason 
came in Game 5 against Detroit in the Western Conference finals in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, there is adversity,'' Roy said. ``You have to  
find a way to go through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there has been one thing that can give the Red Wings fits in  
the playoffs, it seems to be a goaltender who can all but stand on 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has been fairly loaded with talent for several years  
now. But in 1994, Irbe was spectacular in goal and the San Jose 
Sharks booted the Red Wings in seven games -- in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur helped the New Jersey Devils sweep Detroit in the 1995  
finals, and Roy sent the Red Wings packing after six games in the 
1996 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy and the Avs took the Red Wings to six games in 1997, before  
Detroit went on to sweep Philadelphia in the finals. Khabibulin and 
the Phoenix Coyotes made the Red Wings sweat out a six-game series 
last year, before they swept Washington for their second straight 
Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, here is Roy again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been outstanding,'' said Colorado forward Jeff Odgers,  
who scored his first goal of these playoffs Sunday. ``He's the kind 
of guy that when he makes up his mind that he's going to do 
something, he says, `Listen, boys, this is the way it's going to 
be.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Patty is he'll say it and he'll lead by  
example. If you don't go out there and give it your all, you're not 
only letting the team down, you're letting him down because he 
gives such a great effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your goaltender is playing as well as Patty is, it gives  
everyone else confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been three years since the Red Wings have been on the  
brink of elimination, dating to the 1996 Western Conference finals 
against Colorado. Down 3-1, the Red Wings rallied to win Game 5, 
but the Avs won Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit had advanced that year only because Steve Yzerman had  
managed to score in the second overtime in Game 7 of a second-round 
series against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say we have been taken out of our game,'' Yzerman  
said. ``They are playing more disciplined than they did in the 
first two games in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy has been solid in the net and they have gotten timely  
goals from all sorts of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are attempting to become the first team to win  
three straight Cups since the New York Islanders won four straight 
between 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	If they should force a Game 7, it would be Thursday night in  
Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayor Candidate Remains Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- He's been portrayed as a tax deadbeat, a  
do-nothing legislator and a dangerous hothead. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Democratic mayoral candidate John F. Street has  
remained calm, even serene, refusing to respond to the attacks from 
his chief rival in Tuesday's primary election, lawyer Marty 
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of this city are tired of the negativity,'' Street  
said Monday. ``They're going to punish the negativity. They're just 
not buying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Weinberg are in a five-way primary race for the right  
to challenge the lone Republican candidate this fall, businessman 
Sam Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a  
Democrat who oversaw Philadelphia's remarkable economic recovery 
but is barred from seeking a third term. Rendell has endorsed 
Street, the former City Council president. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who is white, has been accused of playing to racial  
fears in his campaign against Street, who is seeking to become 
Philadelphia's second black mayor. Weinberg expects to do well in 
the blue-collar rowhouse neighborhoods of this city of 1.5 million 
people, more 40 percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Street began airing a solitary ad accusing  
Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, though, can afford to stick to the high road. He has  
maintained a slim lead in most polls, and his favorability rating 
has actually gone up since the negative attacks began several weeks 
ago, according to campaign aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Political consultant Larry Ceisler, who is not affiliated with  
any candidates, said Street is playing smart politics by not going 
after Weinberg, who has never held elective office, although he has 
been the city solicitor and top adviser to the late Mayor Frank 
Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campaign trail and in television commercials, Street  
talks about his agenda for the city and his record as City Council 
president, a post he left to run for mayor. One of the commercials 
stars Rendell, who links Street to the city's economic recovery and 
booming downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg focuses on the John Street of old -- the community  
activist and City Council backbencher prone to violent outbursts, 
the guy who defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy, 
the legislator whose City Council district is rife with crime and 
abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	One commercial features television footage of Street shoving a  
reporter. Another shows Street throwing a cup of water into a 
police officer's face. Both incidents happened 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also sent a flier to voters that features a picture of  
a bullet on the cover and says: ``Protect your family. Elect Marty 
Weinberg mayor. Not John Street!'' 
</P>
<P>
	G. Terry Madonna, a Millersville University pollster and  
political scientist, said the negative attacks energize Weinberg's 
base of white voters. ``But by the same token, there were a lot of 
people who were turned off by it,'' Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Street, Madonna said: ``He's been mayor-like. He's taking  
the incumbent's strategy of not dirtying his hands but talking 
about his vision for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who used a nearly $4 million advertising campaign to  
move from last place in polls into a close second, believes the 
negative commercials are taking their toll on Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hurting him,'' he said Monday during a campaign stop.  
``His handlers of the last few years have tried to clean him up. It 
doesn't sell.''

<HEADLINE>  Rhode Island's Odom Heads to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- With the blessing of his coach and  
some advice from Kobe Bryant, Lamar Odom left Rhode Island on 
Monday after just one season to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 forward is giving up two years of eligibility and  
is certain to be among the top picks -- if not the No. 1 choice -- 
for the June 23 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom denied being pressured by relatives to pursue the millions  
awaiting him in the NBA. But it was a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a man now and I'm ready to take care of the family,'' he  
said at a news conference, flanked by his father, Joe Odom, his 
grandmother and an aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom said he listened to a suggestion from Bryant, who went  
straight from high school to the Los Angeles Lakers two years ago. 
That advice, Odom said, was to make his own decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing at the sophomore's side, Rhode Island coach Jerry  
DeGregorio said: ``I told Lamar to follow his heart. Lamar has my 
blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old player notified the NBA on Sunday, the deadline  
for the draft. He is one of 16 early-entry players, joining such 
stars Ron Artest, William Avery, Elton Brand, Steve Francis and 
Richard Hamilton. One high school player has applied, Jonathan 
Bender of Picayune, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of the draft by June  
23 and return to college ball. Last year, Odom entered the draft, 
then pulled out after he was admitted to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4)  
last season. The Rams (20-13) lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been swinging back and forth,'' Odom said. ``Jerry being  
on the job here made it that much harder for me to turn away. The 
hardest thing is leaving the school, leaving all my friends, 
leaving Jerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said senior forward Antonio Reynolds-Dean: ``I think he's ready  
for the NBA and I think he's going to do just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement ends weeks of speculation. Odom left the campus  
during the past several weeks, and school officials confirm he 
missed final exams for the semester that just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom said he plans to return in the summer to finish his course  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision is the second blow to Rhode Island basketball in  
less than two months. In March, Jim Harrick flip-flopped on his 
plans before finally deciding to take the Georgia coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, Rhode Island placed Odom on a search  
committee to find a successor. The committee selected DeGregorio, a 
Rhode Island assistant and a mentor to Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom entered UNLV in 1997, but he was accused of cheating on a  
college entrance exam. He was upset by the accusations and chose to 
play at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're losing the best player in the country,'' DeGregorio  
said. But, he added, ``we have to move on.''

</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Richard Bunkall, a painter and longtime  
art teacher whose battle with Lou Gehrig's disease inspired a TV 
episode, died Wednesday of the illness. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, Bunkall  
was diagnosed in 1994 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an 
irreversible neuromuscular condition better known as Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his condition worsened, Bunkall refused to give up  
painting and relied on a respirator and a motorized wheelchair. 
With the help of an assistant, Bunkall painted until the end. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tradition of baseball players who hang their gloves up  
when they retire, Bunkall's final picture was a baseball mitt 
hanging on a wall. He completed it two weeks ago, dedicating it to 
his sons -- 7-year-old twins John and Henry, and 4-year-old George. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Williamson, executive producer of ``Touched by an  
Angel,'' saw Bunkall's work at a gallery and asked to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunkall's wife, Sally Storch Bunkall, had already been working  
on a script based on her husband's life. The two collaborated, 
along with Mrs. Bunkall's writing partner, Sally Howell, to create 
``Flight of Angels.'' The episode aired February 1998.

</P>
<P>
	Cochran taught at Penn for nearly 30 years before retiring in  
1979 as an emeritus professor and was the author of more than 20 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran, who said his aim was to convince readers that business  
was the most important American social institution, had served as 
president of the American Historical Association, Organization of 
American Historians, and the Economic History Association.

Indiana Democratic politics who wrote former Sen. Birch Bayh's 
signature campaign theme song, ``Hey, Look Me Over,'' died Friday. 
She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Conrad's marriage to Larry Conrad, the state's former  
secretary of state, brought her into politics. But she wrote her 
own footnote in political history in 1962 when, as a worker in 
Bayh's first senatorial bid, she wrote ``Hey, Look Me Over.''

	DENVER (AP) -- Wilfred Keyes, who led the effort to desegregate  
Denver's public schools, died Friday after a battle with diabetes. 
He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was behind a 1969 discrimination lawsuit filed against  
Denver Public Schools by a group of parents of minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	The same year Keyes and the other parents filed the lawsuit,  
U.S. District Judge William Doyle ruled Denver schools were 
intentionally segregated and schools in the downtown area were so 
inferior that they denied equal access to education. He ordered 
desegregation of northeast Denver schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the complete  
desegregation of the Denver school system. Mandated busing began 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ended court-ordered busing in  
1995, saying the schools had been integrated as much as possible. 
Keyes expressed displeasure with the decision.

<HEADLINE>  Rhode Island's Odom Heads to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- With the blessing of his coach and  
some advice from Kobe Bryant, Lamar Odom left Rhode Island on 
Monday after just one season to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 forward is giving up two years of eligibility and  
is certain to be among the top picks -- if not the No. 1 choice -- 
for the June 23 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom denied being pressured by relatives to pursue the millions  
awaiting him in the NBA. But it was a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a man now and I'm ready to take care of the family,'' he  
said at a news conference, flanked by his father, Joe Odom, his 
grandmother and an aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom said he listened to a suggestion from Bryant, who went  
straight from high school to the Los Angeles Lakers two years ago. 
That advice, Odom said, was to make his own decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing at the sophomore's side, Rhode Island coach Jerry  
DeGregorio said: ``I told Lamar to follow his heart. Lamar has my 
blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old player notified the NBA on Sunday, the deadline  
for the draft. He is one of 16 early-entry players, joining such 
stars Ron Artest, William Avery, Elton Brand, Steve Francis and 
Richard Hamilton. One high school player has applied, Jonathan 
Bender of Picayune, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he hires an agent, Odom can pull out of the draft by June  
23 and return to college ball. Last year, Odom entered the draft, 
then pulled out after he was admitted to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4)  
last season. The Rams (20-13) lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been swinging back and forth,'' Odom said. ``Jerry being  
on the job here made it that much harder for me to turn away. The 
hardest thing is leaving the school, leaving all my friends, 
leaving Jerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said senior forward Antonio Reynolds-Dean: ``I think he's ready  
for the NBA and I think he's going to do just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement ends weeks of speculation. Odom left the campus  
during the past several weeks, and school officials confirm he 
missed final exams for the semester that just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom said he plans to return in the summer to finish his course  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision is the second blow to Rhode Island basketball in  
less than two months. In March, Jim Harrick flip-flopped on his 
plans before finally deciding to take the Georgia coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, Rhode Island placed Odom on a search  
committee to find a successor. The committee selected DeGregorio, a 
Rhode Island assistant and a mentor to Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom entered UNLV in 1997, but he was accused of cheating on a  
college entrance exam. He was upset by the accusations and chose to 
play at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're losing the best player in the country,'' DeGregorio  
said. But, he added, ``we have to move on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- CNET Inc., an online media company  
specializing in technology news and product information, launched 
an Internet auction service Monday where people can bid for used, 
refurbished and surplus computer products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently bought auction company AuctionGate  
Interactive of Irvine, Calif., to handle the bidding, which got a 
jump-start Monday with about 2,000 items offered for sale by 
computer resellers. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining the bidding venue with product information, news  
and reviews from CNET's related Web sites, the company hopes to 
become the preferred destination where technophiles can find 
products from ``the really useful to the completely geeky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNET's auction venture will compete against eBay, which  
currently offers more than 72,000 items in its computers category, 
and Amazon.com, the online bookseller which also auctions 
technology products, among many other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McKenzie, CNET's associate vice president for shopping  
services, said CNET hopes sellers and buyers will police themselves 
by rating each other on the site.

<HEADLINE>  Cardinals Await Stadium Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals, the only franchise in  
the four major pro sports to play on a college campus, could soon 
have a home of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have been homeless for 11 years, since the Bidwill  
family moved the franchise to Arizona from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	If voters in Mesa and two smaller communities give the go-ahead  
Tuesday -- and the latest poll shows the race a virtual dead heat -- 
the Cardinals won't just have a home, they'll have a palace, the 
centerpiece of the $1.8 billion Rio Salado Crossing. It's a project 
ambitious even by the ``build anything, anywhere'' standards of 
booming Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Now would seem the time for the Cardinals to win at the ballot  
box. The team had its first winning record in 14 years and won a 
playoff game for only the second time. Their star is Arizona State 
hero Jake Plummer, who already has engineered some hair-raising 
comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer appeared in a 30-second commercial spot for the project,  
one of the few mentions of the Cardinals in a campaign that has 
emphasized the supposed benefits of an undertaking that would 
include hotels, shops, restaurants, golf courses, a park and large 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people like us, they're going to be more apt to get a  
stadium done,'' Plummer said. ``If they don't like us, then we've 
got no chance of getting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the NFL team will be handed, virtually free, one of  
the most opulent stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proper role of government is not to subsidize professional  
sports,'' Mesa city councilman Keno Hawker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals aren't the only Arizona pro sports team looking  
for a new home. In Scottsdale and Avondale, voters will cast 
ballots on a $624 million renovation project that includes a 
20,000-seat arena for the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have pledged $75 million for their stadium. The  
remainder of the $507 million cost of the public share of the 
project -- to pay for the stadium, convention center and adjacent 
parks -- will come from Mesa taxpayers. The remaining $1.3 billion 
is to come from private investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa, a fast-growing city of 380,000, is being asked for a new  
quarter-cent sales tax and extension of another existing 
quarter-cent tax. The smaller cities of Gilbert and Queen Creek 
only must approve the project under Arizona law. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has promised a Super Bowl there in 2004 or 2005. The  
Fiesta Bowl also has indicated it would move there. 
</P>
<P>
	Although proponents, who have outspent opponents 70-to-1, say  
$500 million in private investment is assured, critics doubt the 
entire private portion will be built. They also are skeptical of a 
provision requiring the contractor to cover cost overruns and say 
Mesa could be stuck for huge operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $75 million they've pledged for construction,  
the Cardinals have promised to invest $75 million in the private 
portion and pay $2 million a year in rent for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, in turn, get to sell the stadium's name to a  
sponsor, which should bring in $50 million or more. The team also 
gets all the parking revenue on game days, all revenue from sale of 
advertising signs and up to half the revenue for parking at other 
events held at Rio Salado. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals' vice president and general  
counsel and son of longtime owner Bill Bidwill, says the deal is 
fair, and the Cardinals could have demanded more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many other NFL stadium deals and other sports arena  
deals around the country that have guarantees in terms of season 
tickets, suites and things like that,'' he said. ``There are no 
guarantees here, and the Cardinals are taking on risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the measure passes, Rio Salado faces hurdles. A working  
agreement must be reached with the Mesa City Council, and failure 
to sign a major hotel would kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cardinals have been careful not to make any  
ultimatums about moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're totally committed to Rio Salado Crossing,'' Bidwill  
said. ``And there is no Plan B.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Differ on Marrow Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some experts say grueling bone marrow transplants  
for advanced breast cancer will eventually prove worthwhile, 
despite disappointing results from some long-awaited studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, doctors have increasing urged women with  
advanced breast cancer to undergo extremely high doses of 
chemotherapy in a last-ditch attempt to stop their disease. The 
treatment is so toxic that it kills the bone marrow, so patients 
need marrow transplants to restore their bodies' ability to make 
blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	While this treatment clearly can cure leukemia and lymphoma,  
there has been no solid evidence that it actually improves the 
outlook for breast cancer, despite its wide use. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of an answer was expected to emerge from five studies  
being conducted in the United States, Europe and South Africa. 
However, their results are unsettling for both doctors and 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While the findings do not prove this approach works, they also  
do not mean it should be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Brief summaries of the results were released last month, and the  
presentation of more detailed reports was the leading topic Monday 
at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 
the world's biggest gathering of cancer specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who have long advocated intensive chemotherapy for this  
disease pointed out glimmers of good news in the generally dismal 
results, and they still recommend it. Others say the data should 
eliminate any pressure on women to go for the most difficult 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of hype about the benefits of bone marrow  
transplants without any clear evidence,'' said Dr. Derek Raghaven 
of the University of Southern California. ``These date will remind 
women that they have a choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raghaven and others at the conference predicted that high-dose  
therapy followed by marrow transplants will be done less 
frequently, at least until new data emerge showing that the 
approach actually saves lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors and patients are rethinking the use of transplants,''  
said Dr. Edward Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the mid-1980s, more than 12,000 women with breast cancer  
in the United States have undergone bone marrow transplants. In 
about 5 percent of cases, the treatment itself is fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the approach was limited to women with clearly  
spreading breast cancer. But now more than half the time it is used 
for those whose outlook is somewhat better -- those whose cancer has 
spread to several lymph nodes but cannot be found in other parts of 
their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new data are difficult to compare since the studies involve  
different combinations of drugs and varying severity of disease. 
However, the data look especially unfavorable for women with 
spreading cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest study ever among these women, Stadtmauer and  
others randomly assigned 199 to undergo standard chemotherapy or 
the high-dose approach. Three years later, there was no difference 
in their survival. A similar but smaller French study also found no 
survival difference after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, results were somewhat less clear for women with  
cancerous lymph nodes but no clear spread. Typically, doctors give 
these women standard doses of chemotherapy followed by high doses. 
</P>
<P>
	A South African study involving 154 women suggests this approach  
might be wrong. By eliminating the initial low dose and giving 
women high-dose treatment from the start, they appeared to double 
survival after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other studies that took more conventional approaches and saw  
no difference in survival after two or three years of follow-up. 
Still, some details pointed to a possible advantage of high-dose 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest of the studies, 22 percent of the women getting  
high-dose treatment had relapsed after three years, compared with 
32 percent getting lower doses. Even though their survival was the 
same, longer follow-up may still show the high-dose patients do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say somebody is cured of breast cancer for 20  
years,'' said Dr. Karen Antman of Columbia Presbyterian Medical 
Center in New York City. ``It's way too early. We have to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the average cancer patient, the decision until then will  
come down to a willingness to undergo a risky treatment for a 
benefit that is uncertain and perhaps even nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have five times the information than we had up to now,''  
said Dr. Gabriel Hortobagyi of the University of Texas M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center in Dallas. ``This is still far less than we 
need.''

and easier procedure for treating enlarged prostates that has shown 
promise in clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at a dozen medical centers have begun testing the  
procedure, which is cheaper and less painful than current 
techniques and doesn't require an overnight hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joseph V. DiTrolio's procedure, using a device he has  
patented, could prove to be more effective than today's best 
treatments, according to Dr. Elroy Kursh, a urologist who 
researches prostate treatments at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the 
study sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Kursh said he foresees the treatment eventually being performed  
in a doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate enlargement, which is not related to cancer, causes  
bothersome symptoms requiring surgery, medication or other 
treatment in one-fourth of men by age 80, and nearly all show signs 
of the disorder by 85. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's looking for an easy way to treat prostate  
(enlargement) because so many men have it,'' said DiTrolio, a 
researcher at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with frequent urination and extra nighttime trips to the  
bathroom, the disorder can cause difficulty emptying the bladder as 
the swollen prostate gland constricts the flow of urine through the 
urethra, around which the gland is wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Blocked flow of urine can damage kidneys and the bladder. In  
rare cases, it can become fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	DiTrolio, an assistant professor of urology at UMDNJ's New  
Jersey Medical School in Newark, said his procedure, using the 
InjecTx device, can be done in about a half-hour with a local 
anesthetic, although using a small amount of intravenous sedative 
is preferable. An overnight hospital stay is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The device -- a customized version of the cystoscope, which  
urologists use to see inside the bladder -- has a long sheath with a 
cylindrical lens and needle running through its center. 
</P>
<P>
	The needle is pushed just past the sheath's end high up in the  
urethra where the prostate surrounds it. The needle tip then is 
turned sideways and pushed through the urethra wall into the 
adjacent prostate tissue at two to five points, depending on how 
swollen the prostate is. 
</P>
<P>
	Small amounts of purified alcohol are injected at each point,  
DiTrolio said. The alcohol passes freely into cells, which try to 
dilute it by drawing in water from outside the cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They take in so much water that they explode and they die,''  
and the prostate shrinks as the body eliminates those cells, 
DiTrolio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcohol kills the prostate cells so quickly there's no  
painful swelling. The procedure requires the patient to be 
catheterized for two days, compared to the seven typical for those 
who choose surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	DiTrolio presented results of his first 10 cases at the American  
Urological Association's annual meeting in Dallas earlier this 
month. The procedure reduced the prostate, without side effects, in 
nine of 10 patients who received it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But those patients were only followed for six months, so  
DiTrolio can't prove side effects won't develop after that -- or 
that the prostate won't grow again, requiring future treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, a dozen hospitals and medical clinics begin testing  
the procedure on about a dozen patients each, and more sites may be 
added. Barring unforeseen problems, DiTrolio plans to begin selling 
his device to urologists in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Current treatments include four medications, three types of  
traditional surgery and five minimally invasive operations using 
either radio waves, microwaves or laser energy, according to Dr. 
John McConnell, chairman of urology at University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, a prostate treatment researcher who is chairman of  
the urological association panel drafting new guidelines for 
treating the disorder, noted that over the years alcohol injections 
have been used to treat conditions in many parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Because concentrated alcohol kills tissue, McConnell said  
there's a danger that nearby organs could be damaged if the needle 
missed its target and entered an organ or a vein feeding the penis 
or rectum. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no treatment that has zero risk,'' McConnell added.  
</P>
<P>
	DiTrolio said that a misplaced needle is unlikely because the  
device allows urologists trained in the use of a cystoscope to 
position the needle ``exactly where you want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell noted that the use of alcohol in the body and of each  
component of DiTrolio's device already are approved by the federal 
Food and Drug Administration.

<HEADLINE> U S West, Global Crossing To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baby Bell phone company U S West Inc. plans to  
merge with growing telecommunications company Global Crossing Ltd. 
in a stock swap valued at $37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will offer local, long-distance and wireless  
phone service, plus high-speed Internet access around the globe. 
The new company, which will keep the Global Crossing name, will 
have more than $15 billion in sales and a market value of about $65 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at the various companies that would be complementary  
with what U S West has ... (and) Global Crossing came out on top,'' 
said Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, were slow to see the benefits of the deal  
when it was announced this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares fell $4.75 to $57.50 in late morning trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Global Crossing's stock dipped 
$3.18 3/4 to $58.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, U S West will purchase 9.5 percent of Global  
Crossing for roughly $2.4 billion, the companies said this morning. 
The two companies will subsequently merge in a 50-50 stock 
combination, creating a company with $17 billion in annual revenue 
and a stock market value of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have two separate stocks: one to track  
the performance of the high-growth Internet and data assets, the 
other stock for the traditional telephone assets. Investors will be 
able to choose which stock they want to hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Each U S West share will be worth 1.2 shares of either tracking  
stock, and each Global Crossing share will be worth 1 share of 
either tracking stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief executive officer,  
will share the power and the top title of the new company with U S 
West's Trujillo. The board of directors will include 10 members 
from each company, plus two chosen by mutual agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have our own local, national and global network  
positioned and ready to go,'' said Annunziata. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, based in Denver, has local phone customers in 14  
Western and Midwestern states, a wireless phone service, and offers 
high-speed Internet access. It had $12.4 billion in revenue in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, headquartered in Bermuda, offers local and  
long-distance phone service and has a vast undersea fiber optic 
cable network. Though it had only $424 million in revenue in 1998, 
Global Crossing has been on a buying spree recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, it agreed to pay $725 million in cash for the undersea  
cable operations of the British telecommunications company Cable &AMP; 
Wireless. In March, Global Crossing signed a contract to acquire 
Frontier Corp., a phone company based in Rochester, N.Y., for about 
$11 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier has agreed to the deal between Global Crossing and U S  
West and will be part of the combined company.

<HEADLINE> Smoltz Goes on DL With Sore Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Smoltz, the best pitcher in Atlanta's  
struggling rotation, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday 
with an inflamed right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz (5-1) noticed the soreness during the Braves' 8-5 victory  
over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday. He allowed five runs in six 
innings, the most he has surrendered in 16 starts dating to last 
August, and his ERA climbed to 2.59 -- the first time it's been 
above 2.00 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're pitching good, you want to keep pitching,'' he  
said. ``But as frustrated as I am, I know I'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors drained fluid from Smoltz's elbow before Monday's  
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. An MRI showed no serious 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	To take Smoltz's place on the roster, Atlanta activated relief  
pitcher Russ Springer. Smoltz's spot in the rotation will be taken 
by left-hander Bruce Chen, who is 3-2 with a 2.40 ERA in seven 
starts and 45 innings at Class Triple-A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's next start would be Sunday, so that's the only time  
we'd need Chen,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``(Smoltz) will 
miss two starts. In fact, he could make his next start, and if we 
were going down the stretch in September, he could start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz is still suffering the lingering effects of arthroscopic  
surgery in December 1997. He spent the first two weeks of last 
season on the disabled list and went back there for nearly a month 
after his elbow acted up again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new or worse in the X-rays and in the  
determining factors that they looked at today,'' Cox said. ``It all 
looks good. It looks the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning from his second stint on the DL June 20, he went 13-2  
with a 2.51 ERA in 18 starts. Overall, he led the majors in winning 
percentage with a 17-3 record (.850) to go along with a 2.90 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Smoltz was by far the most effective starter in  
Atlanta's heralded rotation, winning his first five starts and 
lasting no less than six innings in each of his eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander's injury comes with fellow Cy Young winners Tom  
Glavine (2-4, 4.53 ERA) and Greg Maddux (4-3, 4.83) struggling. 
Maddux has lost his last three starts and leads the NL in hits 
allowed with 79. The league is hitting .356 against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine lost his first four starts and then won three straight  
down before giving up five earned runs and seven his in a 9-0 loss 
at Chicago Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, despite his subpar outing Sunday, has allowed only 40  
hits in 55 2-3 innings, with 52 strikeouts. He seemed on track to 
challenge the best season of his career, a 24-8 performance in 1996 
that landed his lone Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't really want to go on the disabled list at all,''  
Cox said. ``In fact, he tried to talk me into it this afternoon, 
the second time we talked. I just don't think it's the right thing 
to do. I think the right thing to do is to miss two starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Chen is called up, the Braves either are likely to send  
rookie reliever Justin Speier to the minors or disable John Hudek, 
who has been ineffective since being acquired April 16 from 
Cincinnati in the Mark Wohlers trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek has a blister on his right middle finger and is 0-1 with  
an 11.17 ERA in 9 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Praises Progress in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) - The worst of Asia's financial crisis appears to  
be over, but the region must not allow ``irrational euphoria'' to 
delay needed reforms or leave it unprepared for a possible slowdown 
in the U.S. economy, the head of the IMF said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International  
Monetary Fund, told businessmen today that Asian financial markets 
are now headed in the right direction. He said South Korea's gross 
domestic product could expand 4 percent and that Thailand could 
post gross domestic product growth this year, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus also said the Philippines, Malaysia and ``even  
possibly'' Indonesia could show some growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he is concerned about the financial markets,  
noting they may have moved ``possibly to a degree of irrational 
euphoria or premature euphoria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst of this crisis is over, but there is still a very  
heavy agenda of reforms,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said markets should be ready for a possible slowdown in the  
U.S. economy or inflationary pressures there, even though no one is 
sure yet whether that is about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not conclude that this moment has come on the basis of  
the figures published recently,'' said Camdessus. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus was commenting about a report Friday that U.S.  
consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the largest monthly gain 
in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF leader also discussed Asia's nearly two-year-old  
economic crisis during an interview over the weekend with CNBC, a 
cable TV business channel, and Dow Jones New Wires in Malaysia, 
where Asia-Pacific finance ministers were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Malaysia has taken advantage of its capital controls to  
restructure its banking sector, but the Southeast Asian nation 
still needs to do more to restructure its major companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said while capital controls do have a short-term cost  
in terms of loss of international standing, Malaysia had done a 
good job at softening their impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF has not condemned capital controls. We have simply  
reminded Malaysia that exchange controls have an international 
cost,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who turned his back  
on Western prescriptions for mending its economy, imposed sweeping 
capital controls in an effort to prevent the kind of investor 
flight that wreaked havoc in other Asian nations. The controls 
locked in portfolio capital of $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said he welcomed efforts by Asian countries to  
transfer their short-term debt into debt with longer maturities, 
noting in particular a plan announced by Japan over the weekend. 
Japan said during the APEC meeting in Malaysia that it would 
guarantee new Asian sovereign bonds, hoping the money that would be 
raised would be used to restructure regional banking systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We vigorously encourage this kind of initiative,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Camdessus also was upbeat on the return of  
capital flows to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no miracle here, markets have observed the underlying  
improvement,'' he said, adding he wasn't concerned about the slow 
pace of recapitalizing banks. ``The business of recapitalizing 
banks is complicated, particularly in countries like Indonesia, 
which has had an agitated financial history for the past few 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins Manager Has Back Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins manager John Boles will be away  
from the team 3-10 days after undergoing emergency back surgery 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale worked two  
hours to remove a herniated disk in Boles' back. The 50-year-old 
manager is expected to be walking Tuesday and could be released as 
soon as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance he could be back here managing Thursday,''  
general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``We'll know more tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third base coach Fredi Gonzalez was appointed interim manager  
before the Marlins began a seven-game homestand Monday night 
against the Chicago Cubs. The debut was unsuccessful, as Florida 
lost 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way I wanted to manage my first major league  
game,'' said Gonzalez, who managed eight seasons in the Florida 
organization before joining Boles' staff this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bolesy was the guy that gave me my first opportunity,''  
Gonzalez said. ``I wish he was sitting here and saying, `I'll let 
you manage it,' instead of him going under the knife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Rich Dubee will handle the pitching changes  
during Boles' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles had complained of back pain during Florida's  
just-completed nine-game road trip that ended Sunday in Milwaukee. 
He underwent magnetic resonance image testing Monday and was told 
surgery couldn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's a tough guy. He didn't say much about it,'' Dombrowski  
said. ``But he said that when he went out to the mound, there were 
a couple of times he didn't think he was going to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles was being prepped for surgery as players gathered at Pro  
Player Stadium. Dombrowski and Gonzalez addressed the team before 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them don't change a thing. Score 20,'' Gonzalez said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins (11-27) went 5-4 on the road trip, winning series in  
Los Angeles and Milwaukee. That moved them out of last place in the 
NL East, one game ahead of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to change anything. The guys know what they  
need to do,'' said pitcher Alex Fernandez, scheduled to come off 
the disabled list himself on Tuesday after missing two weeks with a 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 35, had managed the independent Miami Miracle for 1 1/2  
seasons before the Marlins made him their first minor league 
manager in 1992. He took Erie to a second-place finish in the New 
York-Penn League that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He has earned manager of the year honors in the California,  
Florida State and Eastern leagues and guided Sun Cities to the 
Arizona Fall League title this past offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like he's been managing a long time,'' Dombrowski  
said. ``It's a short-term thing, just until Bolesy gets back.''

<HEADLINE> USGA: Ruling May Affect Martin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- An attorney for the USGA said Monday the  
organization may deny Casey Martin use of a cart in qualifications 
for the U.S. Open if it wins a lawsuit filed by an Indiana golf 
professional seeking the same accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Golf Association promised Martin last year he'd be  
allowed to use a cart as long as his suit against the PGA was on 
appeal. But USGA attorney Lee Abrams speculated the association 
could reconsider its decision if a judge denies Ford Olinger's suit 
seeking a permanent injunction to ride throughout the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that remain to be decided as this case comes  
out,'' Abrams said, stressing the USGA has given no formal 
consideration to Martin's status pending the outcome of Olinger's 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that  
makes it painful for him to walk long distances, won the right last 
year to ride on tour under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But 
his case is on appeal before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Oral arguments were heard earlier this month, and a decision isn't 
expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Reardon, Martin's attorney handling the appeal, said he'd be  
surprised if the association changed its mind while the PGA suit is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 50 million disabled people in America, and I can't  
believe the U.S. Golf Association would want to offend 50 million 
people with that decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, a golf pro in Warsaw, Ind., successfully sued the USGA  
last year to use a cart in a local qualifier for the Open; a 
degenerative hip disorder makes walking 18 holes nearly impossible. 
He did not qualify for the sectional last year, shooting a 12-over 
83 in the local qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGA argues that allowing any contestant to ride during  
competition equals an unfair advantage over walking contestants by 
reducing fatigue. It has filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration 
that providing a cart is not a public accommodation under the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Miller said he will issue a ruling by Monday, the  
date of the local qualifier in South Bend for the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	During testimony in federal court Monday, USGA lawyers tried to  
paint Olinger's request as an unfair advantage. The golfer's 
lawyers tried to dismiss the notion that walking is a fundamental 
aspect to the game and that it has a significant impact on 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, USGA attorney Steve Jackson asked Olinger whether  
accommodations should be made for golfers who suffer injuries 
during the course of a tournament, such as a sprained ankle or 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that give you an advantage to ride a cart that lessens  
your pain?'' Jackson asked Olinger. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir. I start with pain every time,'' he answered.  
</P>
<P>
	USGA attorneys called Dr. James Rippe, who studies the physical  
impacts of walking, to testify about a study he compiled on the 
impact walking had on golfers. Rippe said his review of various 
studies showed that walking a 4 1/2-hour round of golf for the average 
American male weighing 177 pounds is equivalent to running for two 
hours at a pace of 11 minutes per mile. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the studies show fatigue greatly impacts motor  
skills and judgment. Those effects are cumulative over the course 
of a tournament, a huge factor in tournaments where the winning 
margin is often just a few strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``One-third of one percent of shots in a golf tournament might  
be the difference between winning and losing,'' Rippe said. ``The 
individual riding in a cart is afforded a substantial and unfair 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Olinger's attorney, John Hamilton, said  
Rippe's study did not compare a healthy, average golfer walking a 
round with Olinger, who has bilateral avascular necrosis. He also 
suggested the physical disability, coupled with the mental stress 
of playing in competition, would fatigue Olinger just as much as it 
would a healthy golfer walking a round.

<HEADLINE> Knee Lands Indians' Alomar on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bone spurs, not his lack of cartilage, is  
what's causing the pain in Indians catcher Sandy Alomar's knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, who underwent offseason surgery on his left knee, was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday. He's hoping a cortisone 
injection will get rid of the pain, but if the knee isn't better by 
Tuesday, he said he'll consider having surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time All-Star thinks he'd probably miss at least a month  
if surgery is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have two bone chips that either moved and it's irritating  
the capsule or the capsule has swelled up a bit,'' he said before 
Cleveland's game in Chicago. ``I don't want this to be a lingering 
problem. It's not going to help me or the help the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar had missed five games since May 10 with soreness in the  
knee before the club decided to put him on the DL, retroactive to 
May 11. Chris Turner was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo to fill 
Alomar's spot and will back up Einar Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you lose an All-Star, it's disappointing,'' manager  
Mike Hargrove said. ``We're very fortunate we've got a capable 
back-up. And he hasn't died, so he will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he has such little cartilage in his left knee following  
several operations, Alomar has been getting injections of hylagen, 
a lubricant that eases soreness caused by bone rubbing on bone. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is relatively new, and after getting a shot last  
week, Alomar thought he would be able to return for the three-game 
weekend series in Detroit. But the soreness persisted, and doctors 
finally realized it was the bone chips causing the problems, not 
the lack of cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knee is fine. The shots have done what they're supposed to  
do,'' Alomar said. ``It was that I aggravated one of the bone 
chips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cortisone shot seems to have helped some, Alomar said. He  
hopes it will reduce the swelling in the capsule enough so the bone 
chip will stop rubbing against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't do that, you'll see me on the table getting  
surgery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar said he's had the chips for at least three years, but  
they've never bothered him. Doctors decided not to remove them when 
he had surgery because they weren't causing problems and they 
didn't want to disturb the structure of the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagging injuries limited Alomar to 117 games last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Alomar is batting .317 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 22 games  
this season. Earlier this year, he missed six games with lower back 
spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was batting .319 with two homers and five RBIs in 20  
games for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also transferred outfielder Mark Whiten from the  
15-day DL to the 60-day. Whiten has a broken right foot.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
lawsuit against the tobacco industry by six smokers from 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the smokers' argument  
that their case should be certified as a class action on behalf of 
all smokers in the state. A federal judge threw out the case and an 
appeals court upheld the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 lawsuit had sought to represent the claims of about 1  
million Pennsylvania smokers who began lighting up as teen-agers. 
Instead of asking for money, the lawsuit demanded that the tobacco 
companies provide medical monitoring for the smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Clarence Newcomer certified the case as a  
class action in August 1997. But just weeks before the trial was to 
begin the following October, the judge decertified the class action 
on grounds there were too many individual issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He also granted judgment to the tobacco companies against five  
of the plaintiffs, saying they missed the deadline to sue because 
they smoked for years despite knowledge of the danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also barred the claims of the sixth, younger plaintiff  
on grounds she would not need any more medical monitoring than a 
non-smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling last  
November. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the smokers' lawyers said the case  
should be made a class action. They said the six smokers had legal 
standing to appeal the denial of class certification even though 
they were dismissed from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the lawyers said a seventh plaintiff had not been  
dismissed from the case and therefore had legal standing to appeal. 
However, a 1997 ruling by Newcomer said the smokers' group had 
decided to withdraw that man as a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Barnes vs. American Tobacco Co., 98-1489.

<HEADLINE> Failed Japan Bank Exec Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An executive of a failed Japanese bank was found  
hanged Monday in his company dormitory room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent suicide was the second in the last two weeks by  
officials from the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., who 
reportedly faced questioning about an alleged cover-up of bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The death follows a series of suicides over the past two years  
by top corporate and government officials linked to scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazunori Fukuda, 51, was found dead in his room by a manager of  
the dormitory in the city of Nishinomiya, a police official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Credit Bank, once one of Japan's top banks, was  
nationalized last year after regulators said it would never be able 
to dig its way out from under a mountain of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the government had taken over a bank since  
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices collapsed in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank executives denied that LTCB was insolvent as the government  
moved to take it over in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Fukuda, most recently the manager of the bank's Osaka branch,  
served until last summer as managing director of the bank's 
real-estate loan division, media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive faced questioning by prosecutors over the alleged  
falsification of financial records to hide the extent of the bank's 
bad-loan problems, national broadcaster NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A former LTCB vice president, Takashi Uehara, 59, was found  
hanged earlier this month in a Tokyo hotel room. Prosecutors had 
been questioning Uehara about the alleged cover-up, media reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, suicide is often seen as a respectable way to avoid  
the disgrace of scandal.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Embassy in Beijing Cleans Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. Marines and Chinese workers shoveled debris  
and scrubbed the U.S. Embassy in Beijing today after protests last 
week left the compound a rock-scarred, paint-spattered picture of 
unleashed rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine days after demonstrations erupted over NATO's bombing of  
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, bulletproof glass on the U.S. 
Embassy's main door stood pockmarked and cracked. An air 
conditioning unit, charred and twisted, was dumped by the front 
gate. Rock-shattered windows remained boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests are over, but China's anger persists. The Communist  
Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, today called NATO's 
war against Yugoslavia and the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy 
``a great step in the United States' strategy to dominate the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Propping up the government's view that the embassy bombing was a  
deliberate test of China's will, the newspaper said the United 
States is determined to ``not allow the emergence of any nation or 
group of nations that can challenge its leading position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since government-sanctioned protests ended  
Wednesday, U.S. diplomats took reporters into the embassy compound 
to inspect the damage and the clean-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew-cut marines in civvies hosed down the embassy's  
paint-spattered front entrance, sending inky rivulets into the 
fenced-off forecourt that U.S. officials feared was about to be 
stormed May 9 when protests were at their height. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from lumps of rock, brick and concrete, Molotov cocktails,  
paint bombs and at least one stink bomb, protesters also hurled 
bottles filled with urine and feces, said a U.S. diplomat who was 
trapped inside the embassy during the siege. Protesters used 
slingshots to fire ball-bearings and marbles. 
</P>
<P>
	The government-sanctioned protests brought tens of thousands of  
people to Beijing's normally quiet embassy district in days of wild 
rage seldom seen in tightly controlled China. Numbers dwindled last 
Monday and Tuesday after police controlled access to the area. 
Small groups of protesters returned to hurl rocks at the embassy on 
Wednesday, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
	American students trapped on Chinese campuses by angry  
protesters also phoned the embassy ``pleading for help,'' said the 
diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be named. ``Campuses 
were getting out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embassy staff went to work Monday, but visa offices were closed  
indefinitely, said embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. His office, in 
another U.S. Embassy building three blocks away from the main 
compound, also was stoned, littering it with broken glass and lumps 
of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters last week also beset U.S. consulates in four cities,  
setting fire to the consul's residence in Chengdu. The consulates 
in Chengdu and Shenyang set to cleaning up the remains of mob 
violence Monday, while those in Shanghai and Guangzhou resumed most 
operations. None issued student, business or tourist visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the embassy's visa section, where windows remained  
broken and the forecourt strewn with debris, hopeful applicants and 
people waiting to collect documents anxiously stood behind a police 
cordon. None said the bombing made them hate Americans or dampened 
their desire to visit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These matters don't have anything to do with the people of our  
two countries. The trouble is past, what we need now are more 
channels, more exchanges,'' said a retiree from the northern port 
city of Qingdao who gave his surname, Zhu. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd had traveled to Beijing from surrounding  
provinces to get visas. While some cast doubt on the Chinese 
government's charge that the embassy attack was deliberate, they 
also refrained from condemning the damage wreaked by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were blowing off steam. How would you have felt if it had  
been your embassy that was bombed?'' asked a Beijing woman surnamed 
Han.

<HEADLINE> Seeger Celebrates 80th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) -- Pete Seeger celebrated his 80th  
birthday by doing what he does best: strumming the banjo and 
leading a singalong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very honored to be here,'' he said Sunday at the annual  
Riverlovers Shadfest in Croton Point Park on the Hudson River. 
``It's one of my favorite spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event marks the annual shad run, when the oily little fish  
detours from the ocean to spawn in the Hudson. This year's 
observance also honored Seeger, the folk-singing legend whose 
birthday was May 3. He has long been associated with Clearwater, 
the clean-river organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In jeans and a red shirt, the white-bearded Seeger played for a  
crowd that sang and swayed to familiar tunes like ``If I Had a 
Hammer.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Ownership Dispute Cools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Suspended San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie  
DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, agreed Monday to a 
one-month truce in their feud over the team. 
</P>
<P>
	York filed a lawsuit last month seeking to oust DeBartolo from  
any management role with the 49ers and demanding he repay $94 
million to the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo filed a countersuit asking a judge to rescind his sale  
of the team to the family-run corporation. He asked for more than 
$650 million in damages from his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	In Akron, Ohio, on Monday, U.S. District Judge Daniel Polster  
asked both sides to suspend litigation against each other for one 
month and begin settlement talks, Polster told the San Francisco 
Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides said they would give it their best effort,'' York  
spokesman Sam Singer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge asked the siblings to return to court on June 15 and  
advised them not to talk to reporters about the progress of the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked them to keep their comments private so that the  
process could continue confidentially in order to try and reach a 
settlement,'' Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo spokesman Rick Rice did not immediately return a  
message left Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has suspended DeBartolo through February 2000 and fined  
him $1 million for his role in a Louisiana gambling and bribery 
case. DeBartolo pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, York sued her brother in San Francisco, charging him  
with reneging on a $94 million debt to the family company and 
cutting an improper side deal with a prospective developer on a 
stadium-shopping mall project. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo responded with a lawsuit in Ohio, accusing her of  
breach of contract. Polster presides over that suit, but the talks 
could include a settlement of the San Francisco suit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, the feud has stalled the stadium project  
approved by voters in June 1997.
